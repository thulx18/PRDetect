The Tau Manifesto is a that suggests that we should use a different circle constant called tau , which is represented by the Greek \u03c4 . Tau is equal to 2\u03c0 , or . The idea behind the Tau is that a more natural and intuitive circle to use , especially when it comes to understanding radians . are a way measuring angles . If you think of a circle as a clock , with the 12 position at top , is equal to 1/6 the way around the circle . tau as the circle makes to understand radians , one radian equal to tau , rather than of pi .

Ice is reflects . as ice , sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter the the beneath ice tend to absorbes that and make everything . The hotter it becomes the more ice is and the Ocean there is to heat which further melts infinitum until we all die .

His basic plan that nations move to socialism , then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll later why communist country his plan . One of Marx Engels was that industrialization , we produced much more we used . Obviously there but for most the of machinery kept production levels low . Then come along our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the of Wealth Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now of one person making a , have 10 who the task . made production way . What Marx criticized was the a . you overproduce the price the good because the is high . This required two things , to the cost of manufacturing to keep up competition , free market competition , lower . The second you had to find new markets . Given the the time of Smith who 1776 , there were a lot non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your . markets that up the more needed to produced . that workers of living decreased people moved into the cities to the demand for . This resulted , he believed , in the workers consumers self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead owning , you lived worker cities or rented in . note was not a big fan of private ownership ( understatement , his summation Communism was \" The abolition private property \" ) . He the land would amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , the family . land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying same set of people who own the land .

They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The basically \" in the walled city \" . The second class . These are the the factories and farms . standard of is so that they can only to . means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat ones who are actually doing work the goods , yet they are the and little profits . argued for a society in which the . He labor protect themselves increasingly poor conditions . Before , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent . People did want jobs defending them and there was n't it . the workers band and say , \" Hey we n't going to work unless you these \" the and have . They ca n't work on their , they a number of the proletariat . goal was for the to take their power , which was . they had to stop work , strike , it cost the owners in than cost the workers in lost wages . that was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . of this Marx , was result of and the drive it . stated producing to needs , started make for a portion of population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) .
