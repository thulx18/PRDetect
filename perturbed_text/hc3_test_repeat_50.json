For For example , if you you hold hold your your finger up in front of of you you and and close close one eye , then then open open that eye eye and and close close the other eye eye , your your finger finger will appear appear to move move against the background background . This This is because you you are are looking at it it from two different angles . We can use use this this same principle to to determine determine the the distance distance to to nearby stars . By By measuring measuring the the apparent shift in in the the position position of of a star star against against the the background background of more more distant distant stars ( as as viewed viewed from from opposite opposite sides sides of Earth 's orbit around around the sun ) , we we can calculate calculate how how far away the the star is is . This This method method is most most accurate accurate for for stars that are are relatively relatively close close to to us us ( within a few hundred hundred light - years years ) . For more distant distant objects , such such as as quasars quasars and galaxies , we use use other methods methods to determine determine their distance distance . One One such method is called called the cosmic cosmic distance distance ladder , which which involves using a series series of \" rungs rungs \" or steps to to measure measure the distance distance to to increasingly increasingly distant distant objects . Each Each rung rung of the the ladder relies relies on on a different different type type of \" standard candle , \" which is is an object that is is known known to have a certain intrinsic brightness brightness . By By measuring the the brightness brightness of the the object object as as seen from from Earth Earth , we we can determine determine its distance . For example example , one one type type of of standard standard candle candle that we we use use is is a type of star star called a Cepheid variable . These These stars have have a very regular pulse pulse , and the the time between between pulses is is directly related related to to the the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring measuring the the time between between pulses , we we can can determine the the star 's 's brightness , and therefore therefore its its distance . Once we we have have determined determined the the distance to a Cepheid Cepheid variable , we can can use it it as a \" rung rung \" on the the cosmic cosmic distance ladder ladder to to measure the distance distance to to other other objects objects that that are farther farther away away . For For example , we we can can use Cepheid Cepheid variables to measure the the distance to nearby nearby galaxies , and and then then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to to measure measure the the distance to to even more distant distant galaxies . This way , we we can can build build up up a \" ladder ladder \" of distances distances that reaches reaches all all the way out to the the most distant objects in the universe universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Quantum levitation is is a phenomenon phenomenon in which which an object object is suspended above above a surface without any any physical contact contact . This This can can be achieved achieved using the the principles principles of quantum quantum mechanics mechanics , which is a branch branch of of physics physics that that studies studies the behavior behavior of of particles particles at very small small scales scales , such as as atoms and and subatomic particles . To To understand understand how quantum quantum levitation works works , it helps helps to to think think about a magnet magnet . Magnets Magnets have north and south south poles poles , and and opposite poles poles attract attract each other while while similar similar poles repel each other . This This is because because of of the the magnetic magnetic field that that surrounds a magnet magnet . Now Now imagine a superconductor superconductor , which is is a material that can can conduct conduct electricity electricity with zero resistance resistance . When a superconductor superconductor is is placed placed in a strong magnetic field field , it is able able to to \" float \" above above the the magnet due to to the repelling repelling forces between between the the two . This This is is known known as as the the Meissner effect effect . Quantum levitation works in a similar way , but instead instead of using using a magnet magnet and a superconductor , it it uses uses a superconductor and a surface with with a pattern pattern of of magnetic field . When When the superconductor superconductor is is cooled to a very low low temperature , it becomes becomes a superconductor and is is able to \" float float \" above the surface surface due due to the repelling forces between between the the two two . So to sum it it up , quantum quantum levitation levitation is the result result of the the repelling repelling forces between between a superconductor and and a surface with a pattern of of magnetic field field , caused caused by by the the Meissner effect effect .

As a practical matter matter , many many commercial real - estate estate investments are set up as limited partnerships partnerships in in which most most of the the annual taxable taxable income income is a small small amount of portfolio income income ( usually interest income that that you you report on on Schedule Schedule B of Form Form 1040 1040 ) , and and the annual annual bottom bottom line is is lots lots of passive losses losses which which the limited partners report ( but but do do not get to to deduct ) on the the Federal return return . As As a result result , State State A is is unlikely unlikely to come after you for the tax tax on on , say say , $ 100 of interest income income each each year year because it will will cost them more to to go go after you than than they will recover from you . But But , when the the real real estate estate is is sold , there there will will ( hopefully hopefully ) be be a big capital gain , most most of which will will be sheltered sheltered from from Federal tax since the the passive passive losses losses finally get to be deducted deducted . At At this this point point , State State A is not only owed owed a lot of money ( it it knows knows nothing nothing of of your your passive losses losses etc ) but , after it processes the the income income tax return that that you filed for that year year , it will will likely likely demand that you file income tax tax returns returns for previous years years as as well well .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the ancient ancient world \" rich rich \" was defined defined as \" do n't n't have have to to farm farm \" . There were only three three kinds kinds of people like that that : royalty , high priests priests , and successful generals generals . Since Since gold was was in limited limited supply supply - but there there was enough enough of of it it that that people would would recognize recognize it and value value it it , and it was was n't n't good good for for any any practical practical use , and as a metal it it would would \" stay stay all in in one place \" and did n't n't have have to be kept in jars or or otherwise contained contained , it it became became a way for rich people people to display their their wealth . Gold Gold is pretty easy easy to purify and and to to determine purity purity ( it 's 's a simple simple weight / volume volume calculation ) . That That means that that it it could could be be exchanged between people for for like value value - a fixed fixed amount of of gold gold , of of a certain certain purity , was \" worth worth \" some some number of sheep sheep or sheaves sheaves of of wheat wheat , or or slaves slaves , or or land land , or or whatever . It became became a unit unit of currency currency due to to intrinsic properties properties convenient for for anyone anyone to to access access - all all I need is a scale scale , a cup cup , some some water water , and a little math math and and I can can figure figure out how much your your gold is is worth worth to to me me . 5,000 5,000 years years of humans humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued imbued it it with with a certain certain advantage vs. other other similar metals metals . Nobody wants wants to to exchange exchange plutonium coins coins , even though plutonium plutonium is is worth , ounce for ounce ounce , vastly vastly more than gold gold . Gold Gold turns out out to to have practical practical uses for for modern modern humans humans that that ancient humans did n't know about - it 's 's an extraordinarily good good conductor of of electricity . And And it still still looks looks good good next next to human skin skin .", "label": "hc3human"}

( A dealer - he would would have then then sold it on for 35 or whatever . ) I have have never dealt dealt in in stones stones over over six figures , but I 'm fairly fairly certain certain those are \" real real \" valuable objects : just just like paintings paintings by name artists artists . ( However : yes , the the line between \" laughable laughable diamonds \" and actual investment stones stones , is is indeed moving moving ever upwards . ) ( Note Note - the the \" elephant in the room room \" with diamonds is that that GE 's 's industrial process for simply making making utterly flawless flawless diamonds , starting starting with with carbon carbon , is is getting better every decade decade . ) ( A second overwheleming overwheleming point point that nobody nobody has mentioned mentioned : diamonds get get beat beat - up up .

{"text": "The Heisenberg Heisenberg uncertainty uncertainty principle principle is a principle in in quantum mechanics mechanics that explains the fundamental fundamental limits of our our ability to to know certain things things about a particle particle , such as as its its position position and and momentum momentum . It It states that that the more precisely precisely we know know the the position position of of a particle particle , the the less precisely precisely we we can can know know its momentum momentum , and vice versa versa . This This is is because because the the act of measuring measuring one of of these quantities quantities affects the the other other . Imagine that that you are trying trying to to measure measure the position and momentum momentum of a ball . You You can can use a ruler ruler to measure the position of of the ball ball by by seeing where where it it is is on on the the ruler ruler . But But if if you want want to measure measure the momentum momentum of of the the ball , you you might need to to push push it or or throw throw it it in in order order to to measure measure its its speed . However , the act act of pushing or throwing throwing the the ball ball will will change change its its momentum momentum , so so you ca n't n't get an an accurate accurate measurement measurement of both the the position position and and momentum momentum of of the ball at at the same time . This This is similar similar to how how the Heisenberg Heisenberg uncertainty uncertainty principle principle works works in quantum quantum mechanics mechanics . When we try to to measure measure the position position of a particle particle , we have have to to interact interact with with it it in some way way , and this this interaction changes changes the particle particle 's 's momentum momentum . This This means that that we ca ca n't know know both both the position position and momentum of of the the particle with with complete complete accuracy accuracy at at the the same same time time .

{"text": "Not Not exactly ELI5 but but I 'll 'll do my best to to take a stab stab at at it it with with some pseudo code code . I ' m coming from from a Laravel / PHP PHP angle angle . Model : Items Items ; Controller : ItemController ; View : Shops The view view Shops Shops is merely a template for for lack lack of better better term term . Basically Basically we have have a page page where we we are going to spit spit out the data for for a record in in our imaginary imaginary inventory inventory . The page will have have a $ title , and an array array $ data data . We will will get get our data from from the DB DB with with a model called called Items Items . Think of of this as a class that that handles handles all all interaction interaction with with the the DB DB and and abstracts the the SQL implementation implementation away . Our Controller Controller titled titled ItemController will handle handle all business business logic . If If $ title = Acme Acme Co. Co. < title title > { { $ title } } < /title /title > = < title > Acme Acme Co. < /title > Now Now we we need need to to bring bring the item item into the view view , right right ? For simplicity we 'll just just have two things in our our array $ data . $ data['price data['price ' ] and and $ data['item_name ' ] . price price shall shall be be $ 20.00 and item_name item_name shall shall be RC RC Car Car . Fancy Fancy . So So our our view is a very simple simple html page page with a title title and and a table table . < title > { { $ title title } } < /title > < table table > < tr > < td td > Product Product Name Name < /td /td > < td td > { { $ data['item_name data['item_name ' ] } } < /td /td > < /tr /tr > < tr tr > < td > Price < d > < td td > { { $ data['price ' ] } } < /td /td > < /tr > Now we we have the same thing but but parsed : < table table > < tr tr > < td > Product Product Name < /td /td > < td > RC RC Car < /td > < /tr /tr > < tr tr > < td > Price Price < d > < td td > $ 20.00 20.00 < /td /td > < /tr > Now Now imagine imagine if if $ data had several more indexes . We We have one one view view that we we pass this data to . But But how do do we we get get the data data ? The The model model , right ? Well Well , yes and and no no . So a brief brief bit bit ; tying business business logic logic to to your view ( the the pretty pretty ) makes makes for a mess . It It 's like putting putting everything everything into a blender for for a beverage and and then then not not putting putting the lid on on . When When it 's 's done done you you then then swing swing it around around to to really get get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles handles this this pairing . We have have things things called routes routes , so so we we 're going going to to tell the the application(website application(website ) to to point point to the the ItemController ItemController when when the the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show InventoryController@show ) ; So what what does does that that do ? Simple , really really . In In our InventoryController InventoryController class we we have a method method called show show . All we we 're 're doing is saying saying when when item item is requested go go here if there is is a parameter parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC RC car above had an i d of 0 . We We 'd 'd go to : URL_0 and and the the example above above would would be rendered rendered . Controller Controller time ! InventoryController InventoryController extends extends Controller Controller { public function function show($id show($id ) { //Item is is in our our auto auto load load . This This class is accessible app wide wide . $ data = Item::where('id Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Viewing Details Details for \" . data['item_name data['item_name ' ] ; //View is is in in the same same boat boat . Auto loaded loaded . return View::make('itempage.view.php View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that that returns returns the the view view above , just just like like before . Now Now though , we we 're going going to spice spice it it up up ! We We have another another product product . i d = 1 ; item_name item_name = \" RC Boat Boat \" ; price price = \" $ 25.00 \" ; When When we call to URL_1 URL_1 guess guess what what ! Our Our application application automagically fills fills in the the information for for the the item matching the i d of of 1 . Fancy Fancy ! Back Back to the ELI5 ELI5 attempt attempt : Automatic Automatic coloring books books and stencils = MVC MVC . ( kind kind of ) . Code Reuse Reuse ( stencils stencils ) is considered considered , for good reason reason , to to be be a sign of of a capable capable developer developer . We get get to to reuse reuse the the same same files files passing passing in only a parameter parameter to to change change the outcome outcome . When we first called the page we we had an an i d of 0 . The RC RC Car was was returned returned . Then Then we we simply changed the the URL URL to to have have a 1 which which returned returned the the RC Boat . Same files different different page page . In In a real real world example we 'd probably probably have have a master master page(coloring book book ) that that served as the main template template for for all all pages . This This would would have have our CSS , JS JS , and and other other elements elements all centrally centrally located . MVC means means you you no no longer have have to to update update your pages individually individually to to change change something something like like your your navigation or header header . It It 's all all in in one spot . It means means no no need need for for nasty nasty database database interaction interaction spattered spattered all all over over your php php files files . All of that that is handled handled in in your your database object . That is is a central concept concept . Centralized Centralized code code management management and maintenance . I do n't think I quite quite hit the ELI5 ELI5 nail nail on the the head , but I hope hope this this helps anyone that might might be confused . I know it took took me a bit bit to to figure figure out out this this MVC thing thing .", "label": "hc3human"}

Classical irony irony is the triumph of wit over over hubris hubris . We We do n't typically associate associate this this with irony irony anymore anymore , but but any sort of of parlor scene scene from from a detective story story is a good example . Verbal irony irony is sarcasm sarcasm and is mostly mostly performative performative in in nature . An intended intended meaning is is dramatically different different from from an an expressed expressed meaning meaning . This is is typically typically indicated by tone tone , gesture , and circumstance circumstance . Paralipsis Paralipsis ( talking about something something by saying you 're not talking about about it it ) is the the easiest easiest method of verbal verbal irony irony to to translate translate from from performance performance to written word word . Situational or or cosmic cosmic irony irony is is when when the the outcome of a series series of events events is is different different from from the the expected expected outcome outcome . For For instance instance , in in * The Wizard Wizard of of Oz * all all three of Dorothy Dorothy 's companions companions are are questing for a character trait they they felt felt they lacked lacked and hoped to to receive receive from the the allegedly allegedly god - like Oz , who in fact lacks the the traits the companions companions sought and would be unable to to grant those traits traits even even if if he had had them them himself because is is revealed revealed to to be a mere mere mortal . Had Had Oz been a god , he would still have have been been unable to to grant grant these these gifts gifts , but but the the situational would would have been elevated elevated to to the cosmic cosmic . Now satire uses uses these forms of irony , a context context of of entertainment entertainment and lightheartedness , and a tendency towards absurdity absurdity , to make the the serious ( Bill Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes of of British British landlords to to suffering during the Potato Potato Famine ) seem seem silly silly .

For example , LSTM LSTM is is applicable applicable to to tasks tasks such such as as unsegmented , connected connected handwriting recognition , speech speech recognition recognition , machine translation translation , robot control control , video video games,[10 ] and and healthcare.[11 ] The name of LSTM LSTM refers refers to to the the analogy that a standard RNN RNN has both \" long long - term term memory memory \" and and \" short - term term memory \" . The connection connection weights and biases biases in in the network network change once once per per episode episode of training , analogous analogous to to how physiological changes in synaptic synaptic strengths store store long - term term memories memories ; the the activation activation patterns in the network network change once per time time - step , analogous analogous to to how the moment moment - to to - moment change change in electric firing patterns patterns in the the brain store short short - term memories.[12 memories.[12 ] The LSTM LSTM architecture architecture aims to to provide a short short - term term memory for for RNN RNN that can last last thousands thousands of of timesteps timesteps , thus thus \" long short short - term term memory memory \" . A common LSTM LSTM unit is composed composed of of a cell , an input input gate , an an output output gate[13 gate[13 ] and a forget forget gate.[14 ] The cell remembers remembers values over arbitrary arbitrary time time intervals intervals and the the three three gates gates regulate the the flow flow of information information into into and and out of the the cell . LSTM networks are are well well - suited to classifying classifying , processing processing and making making predictions based on on time series data data , since since there there can be lags of unknown duration between important important events in a time time series . LSTMs were developed to deal with the the vanishing gradient gradient problem[15 problem[15 ] that can can be be encountered when when training traditional traditional RNNs RNNs .

The The issue issue is is that in in most most states states ( with with Maine Maine and and Nebraska Nebraska being the exceptions exceptions ) all the electoral college votes votes go go to the the popular vote winner .

So in in that respect , your vote vote is actually actually MORE important important . Because winning winning a state by by 51 % usually gets you MORE than 51 % of the electoral college college votes . The reason reason you can can win win the election election while while losing the the popular vote vote is because anything MORE than 51 % in in a state state does n't get get you you any closer closer to to victory victory , since since you you already get get all all those electoral college votes . If If you you 're 're wildly popular in in a state state and get get 90 90 % of of the the popular vote vote , it it does n't help you you any more more than in if if you you just barely won won .

In In general , a forward forward slash slash is used used to to separate separate things , such such as in a URL where where it is used used to separate different different parts of of the the address address . For example , in the the URL URL \" https://www.example.com/pages/about https://www.example.com/pages/about \" , the forward slash is used used to to separate separate the protocol protocol ( https https ) , the domain domain name name ( www.example.com ) , and and the the path to a specific specific page ( /pages /pages / about ) . On On the the other other hand hand , a backslash backslash is is often often used used in in computer programming programming to to represent represent the start start of of a special character character or or code . For example example , in in some some programming programming languages languages , a backslash backslash followed followed by the the letter letter \" n \" represents a new line , and and a backslash backslash followed by the letter \" t \" represents a tab . In addition addition , a backslash backslash is also used in some contexts contexts to to represent represent a folder or or directory directory on a computer , such as as in a file file path path like like \" C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\file.txt \" .

One financial financial metric that that is is often often used used in fundamental analysis is the the price - to - earnings earnings - to to - growth ( PEG ) ratio ratio . The The PEG PEG ratio ratio is calculated by by dividing dividing the the price price - to to - earnings ( P / E ) ratio by by the the company company 's expected earnings growth rate . The P / E ratio ratio is is a measure measure of of the price of of a stock stock relative to its its earnings per share share . It It is is calculated by by dividing the current current market market price of the the stock stock by the company company 's 's earnings per per share ( EPS EPS ) . The The PEG ratio is used to evaluate whether a stock stock is is overvalued or or undervalued undervalued based on on its price price and and earnings earnings growth growth . For example , if a company has a P / E ratio ratio of 20 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10 % , its its PEG ratio ratio would be 2 . A PEG ratio ratio of of less than than 1 is is generally considered considered undervalued , while a PEG PEG ratio ratio greater than 1 is considered overvalued . There There are are several several limitations limitations to to using using the PEG ratio as a sole measure of a stock 's 's value value . It It is based based on future future earnings earnings growth estimates estimates , which which are are inherently uncertain and subject subject to to change change . Additionally , the PEG ratio does not take into into account other factors factors that can can affect affect a company company 's 's value , such such as its debt levels levels , market market conditions conditions , and competitive landscape .

Now Now in in the the body of the solar solar cell cell , which we call the bulk bulk , you you can can get many things things that will steal that that electron electron and and stop stop it it from from being collected . These include metallic metallic impurities impurities ( Iron Iron , chromium , copper ... ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and and usually usually anything anything that has a charge charge that that can can capture capture an an electron electron or a hole hole ( which which we we call call charge carriers ) . The The more more of of these these defects you have have the lower lower your effective effective efficiency efficiency . So So what what happens happens out out in in the the field field over time ? There are many many things things that can happen happen that can can cause a module module to degrade . On the macro macro level level , standard deterioration from from corrosion corrosion , UV UV exposure , humidity humidity , etc as as mentioned by by others in this thread thread . We also also have have a few such such as as PID ( potential induced induced degradation degradation ) and and LID LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for for example example in monocrystalline solar solar cells cells is largely known known to be due due to to the Boron - Oxygen defects defects . Under sunlight sunlight , boron boron and oxygen oxygen can combine combine together together to form form a B - O complex , which which likes likes to to steal charge carriers and and usually results in in a drop in efficiency efficiency within within the the first 48 48 hours . Now this problem problem has has largely largely been solved .

{"text": "* * WHY WHY THEY THEY EXIST * * In order to to protect normal people people , the the SEC SEC has has created all sorts of of rules rules and and regulations for for how how companies that that invest money money on behalf behalf of of other people should operate operate . While this makes the the investments investments safer and and less less volatile volatile , it it prevents the the firm firm making making investments investments from from chasing riskier riskier but possibly possibly more more profitable investments investments . * * WHAT WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge Hedge funds funds are are companies that that make these these investments investments . They are not not allowed allowed to have have more more than 100 100 investors investors , and and they they are not not allowed allowed to to take on any any investors with with less less than than $ 5 million in wealth . Many Many of their clients clients are either either very wealthy wealthy people people or or institutional institutional investors investors , such as as pension pension funds funds , banks banks , insurance insurance companies , college college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It It 's 's also very difficult to to get into a good good hedge fund , as as not not only only are they they limited limited by the the number number of investors they they can take take on on , but they are are also also rated on on the rate rate of return return they they earn earn on assets , and and the more more money you have to invest , the the more more opportunities you need to find . If someone someone offers offers to let you invest in their their hedge fund fund , remember the the Groucho Groucho Marx joke about about not not wanting wanting to to join join a country club club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS GOALS * * So in short short , hedge hedge funds funds gather large piles of money from very very wealthy wealthy institutions institutions and and invest it it on on their behalf behalf . The The goal goal is to do two two things things . The The first first is to demonstrate alpha . To To explain explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear hear that that the stock market went up up by 10 10 % , and you you look at all the the stocks stocks on the the market market , odds odds are are almost all all of of them them went went up up . A rising rising tide tide lifts lifts all boats boats . This is referred referred to as beta . Most Most assets , or portfolios portfolios of of assets assets , will will move move in the direction of general market . Alpha Alpha is finding assets that go go up even more more than than the the general general market market . Anybody Anybody can just just buy buy into a fund through through say say Vanguard , and own own the broad broad market index , and get get the above above mentioned mentioned 10 10 % . People People invest in hedge funds to earn earn an amount amount above above and and beyond beyond that that 10 10 % . Alpha Alpha is is supposed supposed to be be the ability ability to to find find assets that will do do this this . The The other other goal of of hedge funds funds is is to to earn earn absolute absolute returns returns . What What this means means is that that they they make money money every every year , regardless of of what the the stock market does . A few funds funds have done done this this , but but 2008 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing bluffing in saying saying they they were were able able to to do do that , and many many of of them went went out out of business business . * * HOW DO DO THEY THEY SET IT UP * * So based based on on the above , the hedge hedge fund fund has a large pile pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions billions of of dollars dollars , invested invested with it it by various various clients . A hedge fund fund is is normally normally staffed by veterans of the financial services services industry , typically typically people who who have worked for a long long time time at at investment investment banks banks and have have contacts contacts within within the the industry industry . After After accumulating accumulating their investment investment capital , their their frequently turn to to investment investment banks , such as as Goldman Goldman Sachs Sachs , Merrill Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley Stanley , or commercial banks banks with with investment investment banking arms arms , such such as as Citigroup or or Bank of America America , to borrow borrow large sums sums of of money money to to leverage this return . What this means if that that if you you invest $ 100 and make make 10 10 % , you make make $ 10 10 . But if if you you borrow borrow $ 900 900 , and invest invest the the full full $ 1,000 1,000 and and make 10 % , you make make $ 100 , then then pay back back the the bank $ 900 900 ( plus interest interest ) , and and you you made made $ 100 100 ( less less interest interest ) for for your investors investors off off the the $ 100 they invested with with you you . ( The The downside of of this this is that that if if you you lose lose 10 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment investment , you 're down to to $ 900 900 , and and your your investors investors are wiped wiped out . This This is called blowing blowing up up in in the the jargon jargon , and and it it happens more more than than you would would think , so leverage leverage can be be * very very dangerous * ) . The banks banks like like to lend to to hedge funds funds though though , because because they they like the the interest income , and they they like like to hear what what leads the the hedge funds are following following ( financial financial services services is is very incestuous , and and rumors rumors drive drive trades trades ) . The The hedge hedge funds funds like to to borrow borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding notwithstanding the the need need for for leverage , the the investment investment banks have contacts within within the publicly traded companies . Say Say you you 're 're doing doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs Sachs . Maybe Maybe in in the the process process of that that , you you meet meet their hedge fund fund clients clients , and and talk talk up your your business to to them them to drive drive demand for for your stock , while while they hear from from the CFO CFO and CEO personally , and and make better better decisions decisions than than the the average investor pouring over over financial statements statements . * * WHAT DO THEY THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so so now we have have a bunch bunch of guys guys who used to work for investment investment banks banks , with investor investor money money , contacts at investment investment banks banks , and and large large piles of borrowed money money . What What do they invest invest in in ? The The short short answer answer is whatever whatever they they want . There are are a number of recognized investing investing styles styles though though . 1 ) Long short - These are are the most most simple simple funds funds . They buy some some stocks stocks , and and short other stocks . The desire is is to assemble assemble a portfolio that will will earn earn both above above average average and and absolute returns . The The concept of going going long long and short , done done to to hedge risks , is how how the industry got its its name name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Global Macro Macro - These These funds funds invest in in assets assets that that will give them them exposure exposure to to broad economic forces , which which they they hope hope to to predict predict . Do you you think the the euro euro is going going to break up up ? Short it it , and euro - denominated denominated assets assets . Do you you think think we we ' ve ve hit peak peak oil oil ? Buy Buy oil oil companies companies , and oil futures futures . George Soros Soros became became famous famous for making billions billions for for predicting that that England would be be forced to devalue devalue its its currency in the the 1980s 1980s . 3 ) Directional Directional - These These tend tend to to be be referred to to as as \" black box funds \" , meaning meaning that that no no one one knows knows what what their criteria are are , as as it it is is a trade trade secret secret . Often Often they they write write computer computer programs programs designed to go through through millions of pages pages of data data , and and analyze all kinds of data to find find mispriced assets and and go long long or short short on on them . High High frequency frequency traders do do this this with with stocks stocks by by setting up a computer computer near a stock stock exchange that can can buy stocks stocks and and sell them them again within nanoseconds . I also also read about about a fund fund that that combs through through publicly publicly available filings filings through through the the Food and and Drug Drug Administration Administration , looking looking for for any any changes regarding new drugs drugs , to to use use as as information on on pharmaceutical stocks stocks . 4 ) Event Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests suggests , the the buy buy or or sell short short assets whose whose price price will will be affected affected by future future events . Merger arbitrage is a common common form of of this this . When When one one company company acquires another another , usually usually the buyer 's stock goes goes down down , as as they are are probably probably overpaying , while the acquired acquired company 's 's stock stock jumps jumps , as someone someone is is about to to overpay overpay for for it . Short Short the predator and and buy the the prey prey . In In the movie movie * Wall Street Street * , Charlie Sheen uses uses contacts contacts with a law firm to find clients of of the the firm who are planning mergers to conduct conduct this sort sort of strategy , and and is is arrested arrested when the feds flip one one of his his accomplices accomplices . The The most famous example of of this this strategy is is John Paulson , who who made billions billions off off the housing bubble bubble buying credit credit default swaps on on collateralized collateralized debt obligations obligations ( CDOs CDOs ) . * The The Big Short Short * by Michael Lewis Lewis also analyzes analyzes funds that took took this this approach . ( I believe believe Paulson Paulson is is now following following a macro strategy strategy , and and has been buying up up gold gold mines , evidence evidence that that funds funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in in other hedge hedge funds funds . By diversifying among among various funds , the hope hope is that that returns returns will will be be less less volatile volatile and and safer . If one fund fund blows up up and and loses all its money money , that that might be be 5 % of your your investment investment rather than than 100 100 % . There There is a pretty pretty long list of of other other recognized recognized strategies , many too too complicated complicated to worry worry about here here . ( For For example , the Galleon hedge hedge fund , which was was in the news recently , was using using contacts in consulting consulting firms and other places places to obtain obtain and and trade on on inside inside information . The The founder is now now facing 15 15 to to 19 19 years in in prison . It It was was an an effective effective strategy , but but one that that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point point of of this is is to indicate that they can invest invest in whatever they they want , and will be be judged solely solely on on how much money it it makes . * * HOW HOW DO DO THEY THEY GET PAID PAID * * You ' ve probably probably already heard about how many many hedge hedge funds funds make make billions in profits profits . Hedge funds get paid in two two ways . The first first is the the management management fee fee . If If you you invest invest money money with with a hedge fund fund ( or or anyone for that that matter matter ) , the the first first thing they do do is is take take a percentage of your money money from you you and keep keep it for for themselves . Hedge funds typically typically charge 2 % of assets assets under under management management each each year year . They use use this this money money to pay employees employees , rent rent office space space , and and cover overhead overhead until their real real payday arrives arrives at the end of the year . The other other means means of payment payment is the performance performance fee fee . At At the end of of the year year , the fund fund tallies tallies how much money it made made for investors , and and takes takes a chunk chunk of of it it for themselves themselves . 20 20 % is typical , but but amounts amounts have varied varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion billion for its its investors , it it is a $ 1 billion billion payday for the people who who run run the fund . If you have have a lot of of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you you an an become become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

The The Space Shuttle was a reusable reusable spacecraft that was used for many different missions missions , including including transporting transporting astronauts to and from the the International International Space Station Station ( ISS ) . It was a very advanced and and complex vehicle vehicle , but it also also had had some some limitations limitations . One of of the reasons reasons NASA NASA decided decided to to use rockets instead instead of a new new upgraded upgraded type of Space Shuttle Shuttle for for the the Orion Orion spacecraft spacecraft is is that that rockets rockets are generally generally more more powerful and and can can reach reach higher altitudes altitudes and faster faster speeds speeds than the the Space Space Shuttle . This is important for for deep deep space missions missions , such such as going going to the the Moon or or Mars , because because these these destinations destinations are much farther away from Earth Earth than the ISS ISS . Another Another reason reason is that the Space Shuttle required a lot of of maintenance maintenance and and preparation between between flights , which made it less less flexible flexible and efficient than rockets rockets . Rockets Rockets can be be launched launched more more quickly quickly and can be be used used for a wider range of of missions missions . Finally , NASA is always looking looking for for ways to to improve improve and and advance its its technology , and developing developing a new type of Space Space Shuttle would have been been a very expensive and time - consuming project .

The author author that wrote wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Easton Ellis Ellis , is is known for a common theme in all all of of his books . Simply Simply put put , they are about about the detachment prevalent in in modern modern society society . Specifically the effect that that wealth and and privilege privilege can have on people people . No No one one has friends friends only only acquaintances . People People are are only only as important as as what what they can can do do for for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity simplicity I 'll 'll only deal with with what 's in in the the movie movie . In American Psycho the the main main character character is is pretending to be be a human . He takes everything everything way way too too far because because he is is over over acting acting . From the opening you you see see how how obsessed obsessed he he is with with appearance and and the massive overkill regarding regarding his his whole whole shower procedure procedure . He is is pretending pretending to to work work . His father owns owns a competing competing firm firm and it it 's alluded that they have Patrick Patrick as an employee employee simply because because of his fathers name . He He pretends pretends to to have have a fiance , who who of of course course is is completely completely fake fake too , otherwise otherwise she would would n't n't survive long long around him him . He pretends to have have sexuality sexuality . He has no no clue clue what what it it is is to love someone someone let let alone alone to to even like someone . Patrick is is filled filled with rage because he he feels feels cheated . He He can can see see all around around him what what humanity is supposed to be and and he he just is is n't n't \" that that \" . He knows knows that that it 's 's getting getting worse and and worse worse , and is afraid afraid that he will be be caught . He is is n't afraid of of going going to to jail jail or dying , but but rather he he is afraid afraid of being being exposed as a fake fake person person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your your specific specific question question regarding the scene scene where he calls calls his lawyer . He He thinks thinks he 's about to be caught , so so he calls calls his lawyer and admits admits everything everything he he can can think think of of . The The lawyer lawyer thinks the the caller is is someone other other than Patrick Patrick playing a joke . He He never takes takes it it seriously seriously because to to him him Patrick is is just just some bland rich rich guy guy who looks looks and acts just like 10,000 10,000 other bland bland rich guys . Later Later when when Patrick sees the the lawyer lawyer at a party he begins begins to freak freak out out . When When he asks the lawyer lawyer about about it it the the lawyer lawyer , not realizing he is is talking TO Patrick Patrick , laughs about about the the ridiculousness ridiculousness of of it . Because Because Patrick is so normal normal . Both Both of these types of things are are common common themes in the the movie movie and and book . People constantly remark how how normal normal Patrick is , people people constantly constantly mistake mistake him him and and others others for someone else . They They all look and act act alike . In In my my opinion the movie movie is about how how easy it is for a passionless sociopath sociopath killer killer to blend blend into into society because of of how how uncaring uncaring and superficial we we all all are are . If you you likes likes the the movie of course read read the book book .

What it tells tells you is is three three things : 1 ) How big big of a pile pile of stuff do I own ? 2 ) How much money did I borrow borrow to to buy my big pile of of stuff that that I still still have have to to pay pay back ? 3 ) If If I removed removed everything from my my pile pile of of stuff stuff that that I still owe owe money on , how much is left ? This smaller smaller pile of stuff that that you have have paid in full full for and that that you do do n't n't owe another cent on is is your \" equity \" . It can be be broken down down to to the the classic accounting equation equation of of : ASSETS ASSETS ( Total Pile Pile of Stuff Stuff ) = Liabilities Liabilities ( Stuff Stuff in your your pile pile that the the bank can can take back because because you you have n't paid for it it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff Stuff in in the pile pile that is is paid for and and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out out a mortgage mortgage and and buy buy a $ 200,000 house house , and promptly promptly pay $ 100,000 100,000 as a down down payment , I own own half half of a house . That That is my my equity . The bank owns owns the the other $ 100,000 of of the the house house , and that is my my liability . Again , the equation equation tells tells us : Total Assets Assets ( The The Whole Whole House , 200k 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank Bank 's half half of of the the house house 100k 100k ) + Equity Equity ( my half of the the house that that I plunked down down 100k for for ) . To answer answer the the question about what what equity equity is in finance finance , this is is how how is is it important : Let Let us say that I owned an an entrepreneurial entrepreneurial cat cat . The cat decides decides to to get get into the business business of of rat rat control . I take take the the cat to to the bank bank , and the bank lends lends the the cat cat $ 995,000 as a business business loan loan under the the agreement agreement that that the bank bank can repossesses repossesses everything everything if if the loan is n't paid paid back with with interest interest . The cat takes the bank bank 's 's 995k and and I throw throw in in 5k of my own own money that that the cat never never has to pay me me back for for , and and he he buys buys 1 million dollars dollars worth of of rat rat control control equipment equipment . Now Now if if I went went on Craigslist and and offered to sell sell the the cat and his 1 million million dollars worth of of rat control supplies to to the the highest bidder bidder , my my cat cat might might sell for close close to 1 million million dollars dollars . However However , once once the potential buyer buyer found found out that the the 1 million million dollar dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to to the bank bank still , the the potential buyer buyer would would realize realize the the EQUITY EQUITY in in the cat is is only $ 5,000 , and and would n't n't pay much much more than than that . Now Now that begs begs the question question , why would I give give the feline $ 5,000 5,000 that he did did n't have have to pay pay me me back for ? This This relates relates to the the second second use use of of the the phrase phrase equity in in finance , which which is is ownership . I gave the the cat $ 5,000 to to become become a partner partner in his business business . Think Think of of this this as \" seed seed money money \" that the cat can spend on on things things that will will make his his business business better , and and that that he does n't n't have have to to worry about about paying me interest interest on on or ever ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives gives me me 100 100 shares shares of Rat Cat Stock Stock of of a total total 200 shares outstanding outstanding . He He owns owns the the other other 100 100 , which he he assigned assigned to to himself when incorporating incorporating his his business business . What What 's in in it for for me ? As owner of of 50 % of the EQUITY EQUITY in in the the company company ( I own 100 100 of 200 total shares shares ) , I am am entitled to half of the profits profits ! Now Now if the cat is is very successful successful and makes $ 200,000 200,000 in profits each each year after after paying paying interest on on his his loan loan to the the bank , that is great for me me ! Going back back to our our general accounting equation equation : Assets $ 1.2 1.2 Million Million Dollars ( 1 Million Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Million Principle Principle Still Owed Owed to the the Bank Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that that belongs belongs outright outright to to me and and the the cat ! ) . The amount amount of of money we borrowed borrowed from from the the bank does n't n't change change . We still still have 1 million million dollars dollars worth of equipment that that could could be be liquidated and sold to pay pay back back the bank bank , so that that 200k is pure profit profit for us us ( me and my my cat cat ) as as business business owners owners . Now Now this this $ 200,000 200,000 can either be be paid paid to to use in in the the form form of of dividends , or or reinvested in new new equipment and and services that that can can help help the the business grow grow .", "label": "hc3human"}

The most common circle circle constant constant is pi , which which is is represented by by the the Greek Greek letter letter \u03c0 . Pi Pi is is a number that that is a little bit more more than than 3 , and and it is important important because because it it helps us us understand the the relationship relationship between between the circumference ( the the distance around around the the circle circle ) and and the the diameter ( the distance distance across the the circle circle through the the center ) . The Tau Tau Manifesto is is a document document that suggests that that we should use use a different circle constant called tau , which is is represented represented by the Greek Greek letter letter \u03c4 . Tau is equal to to 2\u03c0 , or about about 6.28 6.28 . The The idea idea behind the the Tau Tau Manifesto Manifesto is is that tau tau is is a more natural and intuitive circle constant constant to use use , especially especially when it comes to understanding radians radians . Radians Radians are a way way of of measuring measuring angles . If you you think of of a circle circle as a clock , with the 12 o'clock o'clock position at the the top , then then one one radian radian is equal to 1/6 of of the way way around around the circle . Using Using tau tau as the circle constant constant makes it it easier easier to understand radians radians , because because one one radian is is equal to 1/3 1/3 of of tau , rather rather than than 1/2 1/2 of of pi pi . This makes makes it easier easier to see that that radians radians are a measure of of how far far around around the circle an angle angle is , rather than how how wide the angle is . So So , in summary , both pi pi and and tau tau are are important numbers numbers that help help us us understand and measure measure circles circles , but some some people people believe believe that that tau tau is is a better circle circle constant to to use because it it makes it it easier easier to understand understand radians radians .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "But what what if I am getting getting paid paid salary salary from a source source in India India ? In In other words , it may be that in India India a research assistant assistant at at a college college on average average earns a third third of of what what a research assistant assistant like me me earns earns here in US US . In In that case case , even if if my cost cost of of living living there there is is much less less , so so is is my salary salary . There are are sites sites that provide provide a good good guidance guidance for for what what the the average average salary salary for an an profession with with x years of of experience experience would be . Of Of course course some some would would get paid paid more more than than average average . So So you you can can try and and make make a logic , if if in US say say you you are being paid paid more than than average , you would would be paid paid more more than than average average elsewhere elsewhere . Plus Plus If moving moving from Developed to to Developing country , one has has the Advantage of of positive pedigree pedigree bias . There There are are also websites websites that would would give give the the Purchasing Power Power Parity for quite a few few currency currency pairs . The The Real Real difficulty to to find is whether whether the the Lifestyle you have have in a specific country would would be similar similar in in other country country . If you you compare like like for like like it it becomes slightly skewed skewed . If If you compare equivalence equivalence , then can you you adjust . A relevant example my friend friend in in US US had had a Independent Independent Bungalow Bungalow in in US . It was with Basement Basement and and attic , 2 levels of living living space space with with 4 bedroom bedroom . He shifted to to India India and got got a great great salary compared compared to normal normal Indian salary salary . However this this kind of house house in in India India in Bangalore would would be affordable only to CEO CEO 's 's of of top companies . So So is is living living in a 3 room room apartment apartment fine fine ? There There are are multiple such such aspects aspects . Drinking Drinking a Starbucks coffee coffee couple couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US . In India India this would would be be considered considered luxury luxury . A like for for equivalent comparison is is \" One drinks 3 - 4 mugs of of Coffee \" in in US US , and average average Indian Indian drinks drinks \" Tea / Coffee 3 - 4 mugs \" . In India the local local Tea / Coffee Coffee would be be Rs 10 10 - Rs 20 20 . A Starbucks Starbucks would come with starting starting price price of Rs 150 . The same same applies to food . A McBurger in India would be be around around Rs Rs 100 . The Indian Indian equivalent equivalent Wada Wada Pav Pav is is for Rs 10 . A Sub Way Way would would be Rs 150 . A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around around Rs Rs 25 25 . I personally am am picky picky about about food food , so it it does n't n't matter where where I go , I can only eat specific things , which means I spend spend a huge huge amount amount of money money if I am outside of of India . When I was in US , I could could n't n't afford afford a maid , driver driver or any help help . In India India I have 2 maids , a cooking maid maid and and a driver . Plus Plus I get get plumber , electrician , window cleaner cleaner , and and all the the help help without without costing me me much much . Things that I absolutely absolutely ca n't n't dream in US . My colleague colleague in in UK UK preferred to to stay stay in a specific locality locality as it has has a very good good Church Church . So So if if its important important , one may find few few good good ones in India India if if one one is is Roman Roman Catholic , if if one follows follows Lutheran Lutheran , Greek Greek Orthodox , tough tough luck . Citizenship : Does Does it matter ... ... A foreign foreign national national may never never get get an Indian Indian citizenship citizenship . Children Children do do n't qualify qualify either either unless both both parents parents are Indian . Health Care : Again is is quite different different . One One may may feel feel Health Health care care in in US US is not good good or very very expensive expensive ... ... but but there are multiple aspects of of this this . So in in essence essence its very very broad there there is traffic , cleanliness , climate climate , culture , etc ... PS PS : A research research assistant assistant in India is is poorly paid paid , because colleges colleges do n't n't have have funds . Research Research in in fundamental science science is is quite low . Industry to to university university linkages linkages are are primitive primitive and now where close to what we we have in in US US .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Have skimmed skimmed it it , these these are the the most most important important parts as I can can tell tell : The new new temperature goal is is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For anybody anybody uninformed uninformed on on what what that that means means , 1.5 us us the limit limit the the average global temperature temperature will have risen since since pre - industrial industrial times . This This is friggin huge and I ' m super excited because the the previous goal goal of of 2 was was n't n't all that great . So So basically there 's 's limits on the the global global temperature temperature rise ( which which I 'll call call GTR from now cause cause I ' m lazy ) . The The GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before before the the industrial revolution . The The last last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C rise rise in in temperature temperature , which before before was considered okay okay at at best best ( this this goal goal was was reached reached in the the 90 's 's I believe believe ) . Since Since then new science science and and research research has come come out out that that tells us us that that 2 \u00b0 C could could be be bad bad . There There 's also another another thing you should know which is is feedback loops loops : Under Under the arctic lies lies huge amounts of trapped methane . If If the the temperature becomes too high the the ice that traps the the methane methane gas gas melts melts and the methane enters enters the atmosphere atmosphere . Methane Methane is is a greenhouse greenhouse gas and is one one of the the stronger greenhouse greenhouse gases gases . When it gets into into the atmosphere atmosphere it reinforces global warming and and the the greenhouse greenhouse effect further further melting ice ice and further further releasing releasing methane methane until it it kills all all life on earth because because of huge amounts amounts of heat . There There 's also also another important important feedback loop , that of of ice and and in particular particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and and absorbes heat heat . Ice is white white and and reflects reflects it it . As As long long as as ice , particularly particularly sea ice , melts melts , more more sun and and heat reflecting matter goes goes away away the the the things things beneath beneath the the ice ice tend to to absorbes absorbes that heat heat and and sun sun and and make everything hotter hotter . The The hotter it becomes the more ice ice is melted melted and the more more Ocean there is to absorb absorb heat which which further further melts melts ice ice ad ad infinitum infinitum until we we all die . Now back back to to the the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays nowadays is generally generally considered considered seriously seriously pushing pushing it for for these feedback loops loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse collapse of of civilization civilization . At the the current rate rate we 're doing doing things things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is is pretty much much death . If If we can can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't n't in in the the clear clear but but we we have a very good chance chance of of living life life comfortably on earth earth , with nearly nearly all of of the the same luxuries we we have today albeit operated operated differently differently . Before Before this this agreement agreement the goal was was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed it it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is is a huge huge and and a really big difference difference . Aside from from that one one of the the big big concerns concerns is that developed developed countries countries have have created created climate change and and gotten gotten rich off off it and now now poor nations such as Pacific Pacific island nations nations and and countries countries like Bangladesh now have have to to suffer suffer because because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says says basically basically that that developed nations nations have to help out out financially to to developing developing nations with with protection against rising sea sea levels levels and and other things and and to to help them them convert convert their infrastructures to green energy while also also helping helping them develop develop their economies and humanitarian humanitarian situations situations . It also sets sets a goal for for developed nations nations to try and cut all all greenhouse greenhouse emissions emissions they emit . Lastly they they will take take stock stock of emissions emissions and temperature temperature rises and and environmental environmental impacts impacts of of climate climate change change in in 2023 2023 and and every five five years after that that . Also nations have have to to set set goals goals for themselves every every 5 years years based on on what what they can accomplish accomplish and what what they have have accomplished accomplished . One One worrying worrying part part is the fact that that nations nations can can back back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without without repercussions repercussions . I ' m also not sure sure how how legally binding any any of of this is is or if if it it even even is is . It It would would be be awesome awesome if it was was but I ' m not sure sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the 90 90 's 's , the the generation that grew grew up up on on these these ideals had kids kids and and wanted them all all to go to to college college . All of them them . So So suddenly suddenly massive amounts amounts of of kids were being pushed into college college . The colleges colleges reacted by by raising their prices prices . Sometimes Sometimes this this was justified justified : they they had many more students so they needed needed more dorms dorms , more food food , more more teachers . But ultimately ultimately , college college prices prices went out out of of control . The The parents still wanted wanted to send send their their kids to college ( thinking it was was how how they they 'd 'd get get a good job job still ) and and decided decided to to take out loans to pay pay for their school . BUT BUT these these loans were were taken out out on on behalf behalf of the kids so the loans were were in in their their kid kid 's 's names ( in in most most cases cases anyway anyway ) . All at at once once , a lot of of kids kids with college college degrees flooded flooded the job job market market . Employers Employers now had millions of applicants applicants with with college college degrees . In In the past , they they 'd have have many applicants applicants but but one one or two would would be be college college educated . Now ... everyone everyone had one . This This meant meant that that the college college degrees degrees lost lost a lot of of value . Since Since everyone everyone had had one , it stopped being special special . There There * are * plenty plenty of of degrees degrees that that are are still useful and and that you needed needed in your your field field ( medical , legal , financial , computer computer science ) , but a lot of kids ( myself myself included ) were told told that they 'd 'd be fine no matter matter what degree degree they they got . And And many were were misguided by by the college college system system ( who wanted money money more than for for their their student student 's 's to to be be well well - prepared prepared for the ever ever - changing job job market ) . And And of of course course , it it 's 's super super easy to to argue that that a teenager teenager , with with no real world experience experience , should should n't be making a decision decision that will will cost cost them them tens tens of thousands of dollars , that will will also greatly impact impact the the course course their career career . So So now now ... we we 've 've got a lot of kids kids with with degrees degrees that that may or may may not not be be useful . They ca ca n't get get a job job in the field field they they studied studied for for . Well , they can can still get get low low paying paying jobs jobs in another another field just to make make ends ends met met . No big big deal deal right right ? WRONG ! Remember Remember those loans loans ? That That does does n't n't go go anywhere anywhere . These These young adults suddenly have a lot of of debt to pay pay off . If If their their degree degree / career did did n't n't pan pan out out , debt . If they they have a great job job and make decent money money , debt .

An i3 is is the the slowest , then then an an i5 , and i7 is is the fastest fastest . However However , within within the ' i ' series series , there there are are now 4 ' generations ' of processors processors .. .. each year year , Intel Intel refreshes refreshes their their processor processor lineup with new new versions of of the the processors processors , so so a 4th 4th - generation i5 i5 will will be faster than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and usually newer processors processors are more efficient , using less electricity electricity and running running cooler , as well well ) . You can can tell which which generation a Core - i processor is is from from by by the number after it it - 4xxx 4xxx is 4th 4th - gen , 3xxx is 3rd 3rd - gen gen , etc . ( so so i5 i5 - 4670 is a 4th 4th - gen , for for example ) . Pretty much much any Core - i processor processor will be faster than than a Core2Duo and and probably probably any Core2Quad as as well . The best best way to to compare compare how how fast fast processors processors are in in relation to each each other is is to look look at at benchmarks benchmarks for specific specific applications applications though ( a benchmark benchmark is is just just a measure of how well well a specific specific piece of of hardware performs ) . As As for how many many cores cores each one has , it depends on which specific processor processor you 're talking talking about about .. .. you can can easily easily Google Google a specific processor processor to to find out how many many cores cores it has . One other thing to note note is that that a quad - core processor is is not necessarily twice as fast as as a dual dual - core core processor processor . All All 4 cores usually do do n't n't run run at at the same speed and and at the the same time time .

Data Data compression is a technique technique used used to to reduce the size size of a file file or a piece piece of of data data , making it easier easier and and more efficient efficient to store store , transmit , and and process process . The \" middle - out \" part of of Lepton Lepton refers refers to the the way the the algorithm algorithm works works : it it first first identifies identifies and removes removes redundancies from from the the middle of the data , and and then then works works its its way way outwards to to compress the the rest of the the data data . This This approach is is different from from other other data compression compression algorithms algorithms , which often often start start at the beginning beginning or or the end end of of the the data and and work work their way way towards towards the the middle middle . To To understand understand how how Lepton Lepton works , let 's 's use a simple example example . Imagine you have a list of words that that you you want want to to compress compress . Lepton would first look look for repeating repeating words words or or patterns patterns in the the middle middle of the list list , and and then represent represent those those repetitions with a shorter code code . For For example , if the the word \" the \" appears 10 10 times times in in the middle of of the list list , Lepton might replace all all of of those those instances with a code like \" t10 \" . This This would save some space , because because the code \" t10 \" is is shorter than than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times . Once Lepton Lepton has compressed compressed the middle middle of the list , it it would then then work its way outwards outwards , looking for for more more opportunities to compress compress the data data . For example , it might look for for repeating repeating words words or or patterns patterns at the the beginning beginning and end of of the list list , and and replace replace them them with with shorter shorter codes as as well well .

This would would make make it difficult to fit fit inside inside a typical typical computer computer case and and would make make the overall overall computer system system much much larger and and less portable.\\n\\nCost portable.\\n\\nCost : A 1 TB RAM RAM module would be very expensive expensive to produce .

Systematic Systematic Investment Investment Plan Plan ( SIP SIP ) is not a universal piece of jargon jargon in the financial world . Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece piece of jargon in the the financial financial world and and is a common topic topic taught taught in in finance finance classes in the the US US . On average , verified by by many studies studies , individuals will generate generate better better investment investment returns returns when they they proactively avoid avoid timing the the market market or or attempting attempting to pick specific specific winners . Say Say you you decide decide to invest in a mutual fund fund , dollar cost cost averaging averaging means you invest the the same same dollar dollar amount in in consistent consistent intervals intervals rather rather than than buying buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when when you feel feel the the market market is is low low . As As an an example example I 'll 'll compare compare investing $ 50 50 per per week on on Wednesdays Wednesdays , versus versus 1 share per week week on Wednesdays Wednesdays , or the the full full $ 850 850 on on the the first Wednesday . I 'll use use the Vanguard Large Large cap cap fund fund as an example ( VLCAX VLCAX ) . I realize this is not really an an apples apples to to apples comparison as as the invested invested amounts are different , I just wanted wanted to show show how your rate of of return return can change depending depending on how your money goes goes in to to the the market even if the the difference difference is subtle . By By investing a common common dollar amount amount rather rather than a common share amount you ultimately ultimately maintain maintain a lower average average share price while while the the share share price price climbs . It It also also keeps keeps your your investment investment easy to to budget budget . Vanguard published an an excellent paper paper discussing dollar dollar cost averaging versus versus lump lump sum investing investing which concluded that you you should invest as as soon as you you have have funds , rather rather than parsing parsing out out a lump sum sum in in to smaller periodic periodic investments investments , which which is is illustrated in the third third column above ; and obviously worked out out well well as as the the market has been been increasing . Ultimately Ultimately , all of of these companies are vying to customers so so they all have marketing marketing teams trying trying to figure out out how to to make make their their services sound interesting interesting and unique .

As you you can see , each each time time you you increase the power by 1 , you multiply by A again again .

Instead of of just just choosing one one candidate candidate , voters can can indicate their their top top choice choice , second second choice , third third choice choice , and so on . In In a ranked voting voting system system , if if a candidate wins a majority of first first - choice choice votes , they are declared declared the the winner winner just just like like in in a normal normal election . If If no candidate wins wins a majority majority of first - choice votes votes , then then the candidate with with the fewest fewest votes votes is is eliminated and their votes are are redistributed to the the voters ' next choice . This This process process is is repeated repeated until until one candidate has has a majority majority of votes votes and and is is declared the the winner winner . One advantage of of ranked ranked voting voting is that it can can help ensure that that the winner of of an election election has has the support of a majority of of voters voters , rather rather than than just a plurality plurality of of voters voters . In In a normal election election , it it is possible for a candidate to win with less than than 50 50 % of of the vote if if there there are more than two candidates candidates running running .

This could could make it it more likely that that a third third - party party candidate could win an election , or at at least have have a stronger stronger influence on on the the outcome .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

If it slows slows down or drops too low , it will fall fall back to to Earth Earth . If If it it speeds speeds up or climbs climbs too too high high , it it will will fly fly off off into space .

These These devices devices use use radio waves , which are are a type type of electromagnetic electromagnetic radiation , to to transmit the data . The radio waves are are sent sent from from the the spacecraft spacecraft to antennas antennas on Earth , which which are are large structures that are are designed designed to to receive the the radio waves and turn turn them into into the data data that that scientists scientists can use use to study study the spacecraft spacecraft 's environment environment and the objects objects it it is is encountering encountering . To reach reach Earth from such such a long long distance distance , the spacecraft spacecraft use use a special special type of of antenna antenna called called a high - gain antenna . This antenna antenna is is able to to focus the the radio waves into into a very very narrow narrow beam , which allows allows the the spacecraft to to transmit the the data with a very very low power power level . This is is important because the the spacecraft need need to be as as energy energy efficient as possible possible , since since they have limited limited power available to them them . Even Even with with the use of of the high high - gain antenna , it still takes takes a long time time for the the data from from the spacecraft to to reach Earth Earth , due due to the the vast vast distance distance that that the radio radio waves have to to travel travel .

There There will be be a transformer transformer box somewhere in in your your block block that that has three three coils that are connected connected to to the power power lines lines . The coils coils create create a spinning magnet magnet force field field , rotating at at the same speed speed as as the magnet in in the generator . Then there are three three more more coils coils , but smaller ones ones , in the transformer transformer . These These secondary coils coils see see the rotating rotating field and it it appears just like a spinning spinning magnet magnet to those those three three smaller coils coils . So So they they generate too , but but at at a lower lower voltage that that is safer safer for the the houses in in your street . The The three three coils can be be connected together together as a \" star \" like like a Y or or as as a triangle triangle \" Delta \" . The power power lines lines connect connect to the corners corners of of the triangle or or the points of of the star to give 3 phase power power . The centre centre of the the star is is also connected connected and and that cable cable is called called \" neutral \" . Wall sockets are are connected to one one of the 3 phases and neutral neutral . Big Big motors in in factories can use all three three phases . Big Big office office blocks blocks will use use different phases phases for for different power power outlets to keep keep a balanced load load . The The voltage between between two of of the the phases is is more than than the the voltage from from phase to to neutral because because in in a star connection connection ( Y ) that that is is the the voltage across two of of the the coils . It is n't n't double though though , because because the pole of the the rotating rotating magnet passes passes those those coils one after another another .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The The important thing to know is how how insects breathe . Insects Insects do n't n't breathe breathe through through their mouths mouths like like us us ; they do n't even even have lungs lungs . They They have tiny holes holes in in their exoskeleton exoskeleton which which allows allows oxygen into system system of tubes tubes , which which carry carry oxygen oxygen to their their organs . With With that in in mind mind , let let 's think think about about what happens when something increases increases in size size . Two Two things things increase : volume , and surface area area . The dependence between the two two is is not not linear , though . In In other other words words , volume and surface surface area increase increase by by different different rates rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot foot cube . It It has a volume of 1 , and a surface surface area area of of 6 . Now Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It It has has a volume of of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides sides , 4 sq ft ft per per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times times * , but the the surface surface area only only increased increased by by * four * . 3x3x3 3x3x3 ? Volume Volume of of 27 27 , surface surface area of 54 54 . The The volume volume more more than than tripled tripled , whereas the surface area area roughly doubled . Now Now , the point point here is that * volume volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That That means means that that there there 's 's more organs and and whatnot , all all of of which which need oxygen . The amount of of oxygen oxygen available , though , depends on on * surface area * . Insects get get oxygen oxygen from from their their skin , so to to increase their their oxygen oxygen intake intake , they they need to increase the surface surface area area of of their their skin . You You ca ca n't add add more more holes holes in in the the exoskeleton exoskeleton to increase increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because because that that makes makes the the exoskeleton exoskeleton weaker . The The exoskeleton is * already * under extra extra strain strain trying to support the increased increased weight weight , so so that that wo wo n't n't work . This means means that there there 's 's essentially a point point where an insect insect ca ca n't n't grow grow any any bigger , because because it does n't have enough surface area area ( oxygen supply ) to to make up for for the the increased increased volume / weight ( need need for for oxygen oxygen ) . For more more evidence evidence of this being being why why insects insects ca n't increase in in size , they they used used to to be be much much bigger millions millions and and millions of of years ago ago during dinosaur times . The The atmosphere was was richer richer in in oxygen back back then , so it makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

We We 'll 'll call it the the State of of Calville . Calville Calville gets gets 10 10 Representatives Representatives to to send send to the US US House of Representatives . If If you you 're a Democrat you you would like as as many many Democrats Democrats as as possible possible ; if if you you 're 're a Republican you you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville Calville gets gets 10 10 Representatives Representatives it it needs 10 districts districts . Each Each district = 1 Representative . How do do you you draw draw the the borders borders to to make these districts districts ? One One way way is to to draw draw the the borders to to make make sure sure that your your party party gets gets as as many of of those those 10 10 Representative Representative spots as possible . There There are are 2 basic basic ways ways to to do do that that . 1 . Put ( groups of of ) voters voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of of ) voters voters apart apart . 1 . Let 's pretend pretend a group group of people people always always vote for Republicans : people people over over 6 feet feet tall tall . And And you you 're a Democrat and and you you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the the 10 districts districts . You can can draw it so so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and and only one one , district . It could look look [ something like like this this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're 're basically basically giving up that one one district . You know that Democrats Democrats will will never be able able to to win win it . But But you you also know know that Democrats will have have a * * much much better better * * chance in the other 9 because all the the Republican voters are in in 1 district . So you you 're 're drawing the the borders so you you get 9 districts districts / Representatives and and Republicans get 1 district district / Representative . You You 're 're basically using using the ability to make borders borders to to get get the the electoral electoral outcome outcome you you want and not the electoral electoral outcome outcome the the people / voters voters want . 2 . Let 's keep keep going going with with our hypothetical . You 're 're a Democrat Democrat writing the rules and and you you only only care care about about getting as many many Democrats Democrats elected elected as as possible possible . Let Let 's 's also also say 20 % of of people people in in Calville Calville are over over 6 feet tall tall . They will vote Republican no no matter what . A fair fair person might might say something something like : at least 20 20 % of of the population wants wants Republican Representatives , therefore it it 's 's fair fair that that * at least * 2/10 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But But you you , you do do n't care care about about fair fair or or what what voters voters want . You only want want to win win . ( Bastard ! ) So you you take take that that 20 20 % and and you you spread them them around . You You make sure sure that that each district district has has 20 % , but but no more , of of people people over over 6 feet tall . That That way you you might might be able able to to win all all 10 districts / Representatives Representatives ! So even though a fair fair outcome would be be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve ve abused your your power power to make make sure sure you you get the result you want want and not what what the people / voters want . If a Republican Republican is from from a district district which which is 90 % people over over 6 feet tall then then they do n't really really have have to to worry about being re - elected . If If a Democrat Democrat is from a district where where they they know that that only 20 % of of people are over over 6 feet feet tall tall then then they they may may not not have to to worry about being being re - elected elected . -------------------------- -------------------------- It 's 's a real real problem problem and it it ( basically basically ) disenfranchises real real people people .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It is called \" Credit Credit card card installments installments \" or \" Equal pay installments \" , and and I am am not aware of of them being being widely used in the the USA USA . While While in other countries countries they are supported supported by banks directly ( right right ? ) , in in US US you you may may find this this option option only only in some big big stores like like home improvement improvement stores stores , car car dealerships , cell cell phone phone operators operators ( so so that you can can buy buy a new new phone ) etc . Some stores stores allow 0 % financing for for , say say , 12 months months which is not exactly exactly the the same same as installments installments but but close , if if you have have discipline discipline to pay $ 250 each each month month and not wait wait for for 12 12 months months to to end . Splitting Splitting the the big big payment in in parts parts means means that that the seller seller gets gets money money in in parts parts as as well well , and and it adds risks of of customer customer default , introduces debt collection possibility possibility etc . That That 's 's why it it 's 's usually usually up to the the merchants to to support support it it - bank does not care care in this case , from the the bank bank point point of of view the the store just just charges charges the the same card another another $ 250 every every month month . In other countries banks support support this option option directly , I think , taking taking over over or dividing dividing the the risk risk with with the the merchants . This This has has not happened in US US . There is is a company SplitIt which which automates installments if stores stores want to to support it but but again , it it means stores need need to to agree to it it . Here is a simple article article describing how credit credit cards cards work : https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html In In general , if you you move to to US US , you you are unlikely to to be be able to to get get a regular regular credit credit card card because because you you will will not have have any any \" credit credit history \" which is is a system designed to to track track each each customer ability ability to to get get & pay pay off debt debt . The easiest easiest way way to to build build the the history history - request request \" secured secured credit card card \" , which which means you you have to give the the bank money money up front and and then then they they will will give you you a credit credit card card with with a credit limit limit equal to that that amount . It It 's 's like like a \" practice practice credit card \" . You You use use it for 6 - 12 months and and the the bank bank will will report report your usage usage to to credit credit bureaus bureaus , establishing your \" credit score score \" . After After that you you should should be able to get your your money money back and convert convert your secured card card into into a regular credit credit card card . Credit history can be also also built built by by paying paying rent rent and utilities utilities but that that requires companies companies who who collect collect money to to report the the payments to credit bureaus bureaus and very very few do do that that . As anything anything else else in in US , there there are some businesses which which help to to solve this problem for extra extra money money .", "label": "hc3human"}

The short version version is that a highway highway was was a road road elevated elevated above the surrounding surrounding terrain terrain ( literally , the the high high way way ) , and and a freeway freeway was the the opposite opposite of a toll road road ( literally , the the free free way way ) . Back in , say say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most Most people walked walked from from their hut to the fields fields and back , and perhaps perhaps once once a season the duke 's 's tax collector collector came came in a wagon or or cart . This This meant that most traffic traffic was was along footpaths footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations populations increased , and the cart paths began began seeing more traffic , 2 big problems problems arose . First First , the ruts got deeper deeper , much much deeper . This is a major problem in places places with with a high high water water table table ( say , coastal coastal areas or swamps ) , or during rainy rainy seasons . Second Second , these low low paths made made it it hard hard to see see around around , facilitating ambushes by bandits bandits . By By building building up up the the path path , these these two two problems were alleviated . The path was was above the the waterline , during during rains the water would naturally naturally run off the path , and and someone someone on the the path path could more easily easily see see bandits lying in wait . A high high way was much much safer safer . The The downsides of of the the high way way is is that that you you could n't n't just get get on it anywhere anywhere with your your cart - the the sides were were too steep . You You had had to get on on or off off in specific locations locations that had had lower grade grade ramps leading leading to the the high way way . This This is still still reflected in how our our modern highways work work . They They have limited limited access , usually by on on / off ramps ramps . Modern Modern highways are are ( often often ) elevated elevated , limited access access roads roads that can safely safely handle handle high volumes of traffic . However However , the the cost of building building this this highway has to be be borne borne by by someone someone . Hence Hence , initially initially , most highways were toll roads roads ( aka aka turnpikes , because they had walls of of pikes pikes setup on the the road , which which was was turned aside aside when the toll was was paid paid . Again Again , literally , turn pike pike to pass pass ) . When bright bright , insightful insightful people people in government realized that safer safer traffic traffic along along those highways highways boosted the economy economy , and and allowed allowed them them to to collect more more taxes taxes , they they decided decided to make make the the highways highways they they build free , so that that they they could could make more money money off the the increased increased traffic . The The free free way was was born born . Modern Modern freeways freeways are highways highways that that are paid paid for by by taxes taxes .

The The key key idea idea behind Bayesian inference is that the data and and the the hypothesis hypothesis can can be treated as random random variables variables and and that the the relationship relationship between between them can be described using probability probability theory .

{"text": "Yes Yes , it is is true true that twins twins can can run in in families . This is because the trait of of having twins is is partly partly determined by by genetics . There are are certain genetic factors factors that can can increase a person person 's chances of of having having twins , such as as having having a family history of twins twins or or certain racial or or ethnic ethnic backgrounds backgrounds . Here 's 's a simple explanation of how how this works works : when a woman becomes pregnant pregnant , her her body body produces produces a hormone hormone called called human human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . This This hormone helps helps the the body maintain maintain the pregnancy pregnancy by preventing preventing the woman woman 's body body from from ovulating ( releasing eggs ) again . Some Some women produce produce more hCG than others others , and and this this can can lead lead to the release of more than than one egg during during ovulation ovulation . When two two eggs eggs are fertilized at at the the same same time , it it can can result result in in the birth of of twins twins . So , if a woman has has a family history history of twins , it it could be because someone someone in in her family family ( like like her mother or grandmother grandmother ) produced more hCG , which led led to to the birth of twins . This This genetic genetic trait can can be be passed down down from one generation generation to the the next next , which which is is why why twins can run in families .

Based on on the the concept concept of strong rules rules , Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski Imieli\u0144ski and and Arun Arun Swami Swami introduced introduced association rules for for discovering discovering regularities between between products in in large large - scale transaction transaction data data recorded by by point - of of - sale ( POS ) systems systems in supermarkets supermarkets . For example , the the rule [[ ]] { [[ ]] o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s [[ ]] } \u21d2 { [[ ]] b u r g e r } [[ ]] { \\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm \\{\\mathrm { onions onions , potatoes potatoes } \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm \\{\\mathrm { burger burger } \\ } } [[ ]] found in the the sales data of of a supermarket would would indicate indicate that if if a customer customer buys buys onions onions and and potatoes together together , they they are are likely to to also also buy hamburger meat meat . Such Such information information can be be used used as as the the basis basis for decisions decisions about about marketing activities such as as , e.g. , promotional pricing or or product product placements placements . In In addition addition to the the above above example from from market basket basket analysis association rules rules are employed employed today today in in many many application application areas including including Web Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and and bioinformatics . In contrast contrast with with sequence mining , association association rule rule learning typically typically does not consider the the order of items either either within a transaction transaction or or across transactions transactions . The The association rule rule algorithm algorithm itself consists consists of various various parameters parameters that that can can make it difficult for those those without without some expertise expertise in data mining mining to execute , with with many many rules that are are arduous arduous to to understand .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There are are a few few reasons why applications applications and operating systems systems may slow down the the longer longer they are running running : 1 . Resource Resource exhaustion exhaustion : As As an an application application or or operating system runs , it it uses uses up up resources such as memory memory and processing processing power . If the the application or operating operating system system continues continues to to run for an extended period period of of time time , it may eventually eventually use use up all all of the the available resources resources , causing causing it it to slow slow down or even even crash . 2 . Memory leaks : A memory memory leak is is a type type of bug that that occurs when when an an application application or or operating system system allocates memory memory for a task task , but but fails fails to properly properly release it it when the the task is is finished finished . Over Over time time , this this can can lead to the the application application or or operating operating system system using using up more more and and more memory , causing causing it to to slow slow down down . 3 . Fragmentation : When When an operating system system writes data data to a hard hard drive drive or or solid - state state drive drive , it tries to to store store the data in contiguous blocks blocks to make make it it faster faster to to access . However However , as as the operating system continues continues to to write and and delete delete data data , the blocks blocks of data data on the the drive drive can become become fragmented fragmented , meaning that that they they are are scattered scattered around around the the drive drive in small small pieces . This can make it slower for the the operating system system to access access and read read the data data , which which can can cause cause the system to to slow down down . 4 . Background Background processes processes : Many Many applications and operating systems have have processes processes that run run in the the background background , even when when the main application application is is not not being used used . These processes processes can can use up resources and cause cause the system system to slow slow down over over time time . By By regularly closing closing unnecessary unnecessary applications and and programs , and restarting restarting the the operating system on on a regular regular basis , it can can help help to keep keep the system system running running smoothly and prevent prevent it it from from slowing slowing down down .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

PPP PPP is is an economic theory theory that compares compares the purchasing purchasing power power of of different currencies in different different countries countries by by taking into account the cost cost of living living in those those countries countries . It It allows for for a comparison of of living living standards between countries countries by by taking taking into account the differences differences in prices for goods and services . For example example , if the cost of of living living is higher in in one country country compared compared to another , the the purchasing power of the the currency in the first country country will be be lower , even even if if the the nominal exchange exchange rate between between the two currencies currencies is is the the same same . PPP PPP helps to adjust for for these differences in in prices and allows for for a more accurate comparison comparison of living living standards standards between countries countries . There There are are several several measures of of PPP PPP , including including the the \" Big Big Mac Mac Index , \" which which compares the price price of of a Big Mac Mac burger in in different countries as a way to to compare the purchasing purchasing power of different different currencies .

Each Each playgroup has different different requirements to to get in in . Each playgroup playgroup has has their own part part of the the playset , and and they they still still play with with other other kids outside outside of of the playset playset and other other playgroups , but but at at the the end of of the the day day , they always go go back back to to their playgroups . Now imagine imagine each playgroup has a babysitter , and and that babysitter babysitter oversees several playgroups playgroups at other other playsets playsets and she reports reports to to a mom . The babysitter is like like a regional regional coordinator or or a house house mom or or what have you . The Mom Mom is is like the the national national / international president president . Each playset playset is is like like greek life life on on another another campus . Each playgroup is like a house house .

A girl girl on my my lacrosse lacrosse team always always bashes sororities , but she 's closest with with all all the girls in in Greek Greek life on on our our team . It 's amazing amazing if if you find find the the right right house house with with the right right girls girls . Every Every house house at at every every campus during different generations generations are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT . So So if if your best best friend friend joins joins Phi Phi Upsilon Upsilon Kappa ( made made up , does does n't exist exist as as far as I know ) at at All All - American University , does does n't n't mean you you have have to to join join Phi Phi Upsilon Kappa at your university . In In Greek life , you get get to meet meet a lot of of people ( especially especially if you go to a big school like like me ) and and it it makes a big big campus campus feel smaller smaller because because you you meet meet people from from mixers mixers / raids raids / invites invites whatever whatever you you want to call them . I ' ve ve gotten so many many connections connections for professors , classes , and and any help help I ' ve needed . A lot lot of my my best friends friends are are in in Greek Greek life , but but I also also have friends who who refuse refuse to be in Greek Greek life and and friends who dropped dropped out of of Greek Greek life life . It It 's 's not like like some elite elite club where you ignore everyone everyone else . One way we we describe it it is \" there 's 's a friend , and and then there 's 's a sister \" If If you feel nervous or unsure , go through rush rush anyways , and and do n't n't accept a bid bid unless you are are absolutely sure . There There is is always next semester / quarter quarter . If If you 're an an incoming incoming freshman , talk to to people you you know at the the school school already and and what their their opinion is on on it it . Sometimes Sometimes Greek Greek life at some some schools is is horrible , sometimes sometimes it it 's 's the the best best thing in in the world .

After all all , why pay for the insurance insurance when when I ' m healthy if if can can just just buy insurance if if I start to to feel feel sick sick ? Because fewer healthy people are are signing up ( people who who would would be cheaper cheaper for the the insurance company company ) and and the the sick ones are are still able able to ( expensive ) , the the average expenditures the the insurance company company has has to make make for for each person person goes goes up up . So So they they raise their rates rates in in response response . More More healthy people people drop out sinc , forgoing forgoing the the more more expensive expensive insurance insurance since they do do n't n't need need it and can can buy it it later . And costs go go up again , so prices prices go go up again , so so more healthy people drop out out again again . And And so on on , until prices prices get so high that it 's 's effectively effectively not an insurance system , just sick sick people paying paying a lot lot of money money for for healthcare healthcare . If If you you can can only only sign up for for health insurance insurance once a year , it it makes makes this this much much harder harder to do . What What if you you got sick three months months after after open open enrollment ? You would would be be without without insurance when you you needed needed it it .

Intensity Intensity is is a measure measure of of the the amount of of energy energy that that a sound sound wave wave carries carries . When When we increase the the volume of a sound sound on a computer computer or other other device , we we are are increasing the the intensity intensity of of the sound wave . However , the way that volume is typically typically measured measured and and controlled on on a device does n't always always increase the the intensity intensity of the the sound wave in a linear linear way way . For example example , if you you increase the volume of of a sound sound from 1 % to to 2 % , the the intensity of the the sound sound wave may may not not double double . This is because the volume control control on on a device often uses a logarithmic logarithmic scale , rather than than a linear linear scale . This This means means that each increase in in volume volume by a certain percentage percentage represents a much much smaller smaller increase in in intensity intensity than than the the previous increase . So So , even even though you may may think that that increasing the the volume volume from from 1 % to 2 % should make the sound twice twice as as loud loud , it it may may not seem that way because the intensity of the sound sound wave is is not actually doubling .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

If you you look look at the the $ 80,001 80,001 - $ 180,000 bracket bracket , you you 'll 'll notice that that it says \" $ 17,550 plus 37c for for each each $ 1 over over $ 80,000 \" . This is is because because $ 17,550 17,550 is what you would have have owed owed from the previous previous tax tax brackets if if you earned $ 80,000 . Generally speaking speaking , you you are said to to be ' in ' your your highest highest tax tax bracket bracket , as as that that informs informs how much much of of every every extra dollar dollar you you earn earn will be be taken taken in in tax . As As an an example to to see see how how much much tax tax you 'd 'd pay pay in in this this , assume that you you earn $ 70,000 70,000 . From From the previous previous brackets brackets , you 'd 'd pay $ 4650 4650 . Then from the current current bracket bracket , you 'd pay ( 70,000 70,000 - 37,000 37,000 ) * 0.3 0.3 = $ 9900 .

However , Pinyin Pinyin is is not not used used as as the primary primary written form form of of Chinese . Chinese Chinese characters characters ( also known known as Hanzi Hanzi or Kanji Kanji in Japanese ) are the primary written written form of of Chinese and have a long history dating dating back over over 3,000 3,000 years years . They are still used today because because they they are are an important part part of of Chinese Chinese culture and history , and they they are are also very very efficient efficient for for written communication . One of the main reasons reasons that Pinyin is is not used used as the the primary written written form of Chinese Chinese is is that it it can can not not fully represent represent the the sounds and and meanings of of Chinese words . Chinese Chinese characters , on on the other hand hand , can convey convey the the full meaning meaning and and pronunciation pronunciation of a word in in a single single character character . For For example , the Chinese Chinese character character for \" water \" is \u6c34 , which which is pronounced pronounced \" shui shui \" in Mandarin . Pinyin Pinyin can not not represent represent the the meaning of of the character , only the pronunciation . Additionally , replacing replacing Chinese Chinese characters with Pinyin as as the primary primary written written form of of Chinese would be a massive massive undertaking that would would involve involve changing changing the the way that Chinese Chinese is taught in in schools schools , updating dictionaries dictionaries and other reference materials , and potentially requiring requiring people to learn a new writing writing system system . It would also also be be difficult to determine a standard standard way way to to represent the the many different regional regional accents and dialects dialects of Chinese Chinese using the the Roman alphabet alphabet . In summary summary , while Pinyin Pinyin is is a useful useful tool for for learning Chinese Chinese and and transcribing transcribing proper nouns , it is is not used as as the the primary written written form of Chinese because it it can can not fully fully represent the the sounds sounds and and meanings of of Chinese words words , and replacing Chinese Chinese characters with Pinyin would be a major undertaking undertaking .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

These fibers fibers are extremely extremely thin , about the the diameter of a human hair , and and are are made of of a special special type of glass glass or plastic plastic that that is very very good good at at transmitting light light . Light travels through the fiber fiber optic optic cables cables by by bouncing bouncing off the the walls walls of the fibers fibers . This happens happens because the the walls walls of the the fibers are very very smooth smooth and and the the light reflects off off them them in in a way that keeps keeps it moving forward . The The light light reflects off off the the walls walls so so many times times that that it travels a very long long distance without without losing much energy or or intensity . One reason reason that that light light can enter the the fiber fiber optic cable cable but not exit is is because the the walls walls of of the fiber are are made made of a material material that is is very very good at at reflecting reflecting light . This This means means that when when the the light hits the walls walls , it bounces bounces off them and and continues traveling traveling through through the the fiber fiber . However However , the the walls walls of the the fiber are are also very smooth , which makes it it difficult for the the light to to escape . This is why why the the light light stays inside inside the the fiber and and is is able to to travel such a long distance distance without losing much much intensity intensity .

{"text": "What What a lot of people seem not to realize is is that that there are are * tiers tiers * of government in the the United States . Assuming you 're a civilian civilian living in a typical place in in the United States \u2014 that that is , not American Samoa Samoa or whatever \u2014 you may be within the the jurisdiction of as as many as as five five separate separate democratically or or semi semi - democratically elected elected governments : the municipality municipality , the the township township , the county county , the state state and the the union union . Certain Certain hard limits are are placed placed on on lower tiers by upper upper tiers tiers , particularly regarding how how those those lower tiers must respect basic basic civil rights rights . For For example , it would be be unlawful unlawful for * any * tier of of government government in the United United States States to charge a poll poll tax during an election . It It 's prohibited prohibited by law , and and if if attempted attempted would would be challenged in a court of of appropriate appropriate jurisdiction jurisdiction and and overturned overturned . However However , within within those basic limits , each each tier tier is more more or or less left left at its its own discretion discretion to to organize organize itself itself however however it it wants wants , and that includes setting the rules for for local elections elections . As long long as those rules rules do n't n't violate fundamental principles of of law , the the individual individual bodies bodies politic can can do * whatever . * If If some municipal municipal government government somewhere wanted to to change its its method of of electing electing its its mayor mayor from from election election by ballot to to election election by by acclamation , and the laws of of the the locally locally relevant relevant upper upper tiers tiers of of government \u2014 meaning the state constitution , basically \u2014 did did n't n't expressly prohibit it it , they could could go go right ahead ahead . This even applies to to a certain extent extent to to locally run elections elections which are part of a higher - level level process process . For For instance instance , each state 's 's senators are elected by the people of that that state \u2014 this this is is set down in in the 17th amendment to to the the US Constitution Constitution . But the the precise precise method method for for holding holding that election is is left to to the states states \u2026 and and the the states , in turn , may leave it it to to the the lower lower tiers of of government government . So So when when you start talking talking about about changing changing the fundamental fundamental method of of election election in the the United States States , you 're 're kind of talking talking about about a lot lot . You You 're talking about about well well upwards of 25,000 individual individual municipal municipal governments governments , God God knows how many many civil townships townships , more than 3,000 counties counties or or equivalent , fifty states and and a smattering of of non non - state state territories territories . Depending on * which which of of those those * you 're talking about about , the the rules rules for changing the the rules \u2014 if you know know what I mean \u2014 are are going to vary vary . If If you you 're 're talking about changing changing how the town town of of Hart 's 's Location , New Hampshire Hampshire \u2014 population 41 ; they had three babies in in 2010 2010 \u2014 elects its selectmen selectmen , you you need need to convince convince about two two dozen people people to to agree agree with with you you , then then you 're 're done done . If If you you 're talking about about how how the the country country as a whole whole elects a president president \u2026 well , that 's another kettle of of fish entirely entirely .", "label": "hc3human"}

Fraternities ( and sororities sororities ) are are basically basically structured social groups groups . When college students students leave leave their their hometown and arrive at college , they often know very very few people people and and are are not used to to taking taking the the initiative in in meeting people people . Fraternities Fraternities provide provide a medium for students students to to socialise and and bond . Since fraternities fraternities often often have a reputation , students can join join to meet likeminded peers who they they might might not not otherwise meet . For example , some some fraternities fraternities will will have have a charity focus , others others will have people people who grew up in in a certain certain area area , others others will will attract goofy goofy guys or sporty guys guys . Fraternities also provide structured structured social social situations situations to meet meet girls ( or sororities for meeting meeting boys ) by by holding parties , date nights and and other functions . Finally Finally , because because the drinking age in America America is 21 21 , most students students ca ca n't n't go go to to bars bars for the first few years years of college college , so so fraternities also function as social hubs hubs in in the the same same way that bars / clubs do do once once you you reach reach the legal drinking age . Having Having said said that that , there there are arguably arguably a number of downsides downsides to fraternities . They They can can perpetuate social social stratification stratification because because current members of of the the fraternity fraternity pick the the incoming incoming members members . Members will will often only want want to to invite invite freshman freshman students who are are similar similar to to them them , and so the the fraternity and sorority sorority scene scene can can appear quite insular . I have have heard heard that that people belong in a certain fraternity fraternity because they went went to to X high school school , they they have family family money money , or or because they they are a ' legacy legacy ' ( i.e. i.e. their dad / mum was was in in the the fraternity / sorority sorority ) .

In In general , people people keep keep electing electing the the same people as long long as they run run again again . There are two main main reasons reasons for for it it . 1 . Redistricting Redistricting - Every Every 10 10 years when when a new new census comes out lines have have to to be be redrawn to accurately accurately decide decide how how much much representation in congress each state gets gets . This is often used used as an an opportunity for the party party that is is in in charge in in each state state to change the the lines so so that that it favors them . Over Over time this this means means that that * * most * * districts lean heavily one one way or another . This means that that if if you 're a republican republican or democrat in in the the house house of representatives , if you run run again next next term term , the the guy from the the other party probably wo n't n't be be able able to beat beat you .

People People like like * * their representative representative * * even even if they do do n't like like congress . While While people people say say they they do do n't like like congress , they they still like like the guy guy they they voted for . This is is partly partly because because of of # 1 above but it it 's 's a common situation situation . This is is because even though though congress congress makes makes decisions a lot lot of people dislike , their representative will will often often vote vote how they prefer . The reason congress congress does n't n't agree is is mostly mostly because they they 'll be be replaced replaced next next election election if they they work work with the other other side side . * * So So most people people are upset with congress , but but when when they they have have a chance to change change a small small part part of it , they they overwhelmingly overwhelmingly will choose choose to to not not do so . * * A small majority are are upset with the the president , but he ca n't run run again again in in 2016 2016 anyway .

For instance instance , suppose you are programming a little little robot robot that can can move around around on on a piece piece of of paper . The The robot robot has has a pen pen in its its belly , so so it it draws a line line wherever it it goes goes . You You would like like to get get the robot robot to draw a square . But all all it knows how how to to do is is * go go forward or back back by by some some number number of inches inches * , and * turn left left or right right by some number number of of degrees degrees * . So you have have to to tell it how how to to make make a square out out of those those moves moves . You might write a program like this this : to to draw_a_square draw_a_square forward forward 2 right right 90 forward 2 right 90 90 forward forward 2 right 90 90 forward forward 2 right right 90 90 end end If If the robot robot runs that that program , it will have drawn a square , and and ended up back back where it it started . This This is is , in in fact fact , a program in the language language [ Logo Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which which used to to be be very very popular for teaching teaching programming programming to to grade school students . You can find find the Logo Logo programming programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows Windows , Linux Linux , and and other other systems systems . Remember how I said that that you you can can use use repeated steps ? You You can use these these to to make a program shorter , like this : to to draw_a_square draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward forward 2 right 90 ] end That That 's 's a lot lot shorter shorter than than the earlier earlier program , but but it it does does the the same thing thing . It 's 's shorter shorter because instead of of repeating repeating instructions instructions ourselves , we we tell the the robot robot to to repeat doing them . Programs Programs can also also take take inputs inputs , for for instance instance , telling how how big big the square should should be : to draw_square : size size repeat 4 [ forward forward : size size right right 90 90 ] end Or , even , instead instead of a square , we we could draw an an arbitrary regular polygon : to to draw_polygon draw_polygon : sides : size size repeat repeat : sides sides [ forward : size right right ( 360 360 / : sides sides ) ] end So So , programs programs can repeat themselves themselves and they can can do different different things things based on their their inputs . They They can also also control control different different parts parts of of the the computer computer , for instance instance sending sounds to to the the speakers or or communicating with with other other programs programs over over the network network .

It has been been used in the the game game industry for for many many years , but but it it has become become more more popular and more more advanced in recent years years . Before motion motion capture , game developers had to to create create animations animations manually manually , which was was a very time time - consuming process . They would have to draw each each frame of the animation animation by by hand hand , or or use computers to create the the animations from from scratch . This was not very very efficient , and and it it was difficult to create create realistic animations animations this this way . To use use motion capture capture , game game developers developers set up a special studio studio with with many many cameras cameras that that are pointed pointed at the person or animal animal whose movements they want want to to capture capture . The person person or animal wears a special special suit with markers on on it , which the cameras can track . As As the person person or animal moves moves , the cameras record record their their movements movements and and send the data to a computer computer .

{"text": "They 're 're not not loopholes loopholes . That 's 's just a propaganda word people people use use to to confuse things things . There There are are basically basically two two different things things that people sometimes sometimes erroneously call call loopholes loopholes : There are are tax deductions deductions , and then there there are standard standard accounting accounting practices . A tax deduction deduction is is anything that you you can * spend * money money on on that * reduces reduces * your your taxable income income . So say you 're 're an individual \u2014 this this applies equally equally well to to corporations ; we 're just just keeping keeping it it simple simple \u2014 who who earns $ 100,000 100,000 in in a year year . You spend spend a quarter of of that , let let 's 's say , on on * stuff stuff * , stuff like your your mortgage and food food and and whatever . That That leaves leaves you with with $ 75,000 75,000 at the the end of of the year year . Let Let 's * pretend pretend * \u2014 this is is not how it works , but this is is just an an example example \u2014 that that your your tax rate rate is a flat 10 10 % of of your your taxable income , and your your taxable taxable income is is everything everything you you make make in in a year year . That means in in this this year year , your your taxable income income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of of that is $ 10,000 10,000 , meaning at the end of the the year you you owe owe the government $ 10,000 , out out of the the $ 75,000 75,000 you have have on on hand hand . But the the government government allows you you to to * deduct deduct * charitable charitable contributions contributions from your taxable income income . Meaning Meaning anything you give to charity is is * subtracted from from * your your taxable taxable income income for the year . Since Since you have have $ 75,000 75,000 left over at the the end end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 50,000 check to to your your local local soup kitchen kitchen , let 's 's say . That That $ 50,000 gets gets * subtracted subtracted * from your taxable income , making your your taxable taxable income just just $ 50,000 50,000 , rather than than $ 100,000 100,000 . Since your your tax is is 10 % of of your taxable taxable income , you you just reduced your your tax tax bill from from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 5,000 , which which is is only 5 % of your your gross gross income income . Some Some people people just just look look at at the last last sentence sentence \u2014 you only only paid 5 % of of your gross income income in in taxes \u2014 and think that 's unfair unfair , so they they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we we give give tax tax deductions * hoping people people will will take advantage advantage of of them them . * They They 're * incentives incentives * to get people to to do do certain things things with their their money money , things like give to to charity , or save for their retirement retirement or future future health - care care needs , or put a kid kid through college . The other thing people people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes loopholes \" are are just just standard accounting practices practices . One One thing that that 's been been in the the news news kind kind of of recently is is the question question of personal personal income income from from hedge hedge fund fund managers . A hedge fund fund is is a type type of investment that 's 's managed by a person . That That person person does does n't get paid a salary salary ; instead instead , he gets a percentage percentage of of the the profits profits the hedge hedge fund makes makes under his his management management . Makes sense , right ? You You 're 're tying the manager manager 's 's compensation compensation directly to his job performance performance . Well , since the hedge fund fund manager draws draws no salary and and instead takes a percentage percentage from from the fund 's 's gain , all his income income is is taxed at the the capital capital gains gains tax tax rate rate of 15 % , not at the income income tax tax rate of of ( up to to ) 35 35 % . Some Some people call this this a loophole loophole , but but that that 's 's just just propaganda . Accounting Accounting for for your income income that way way is what what you you 're 're * supposed supposed to to do do . * It 's 's not not a cheat cheat . It It 's how how the system is set up . We We can talk talk about whether the system system * should should be * set up up that that way or not not , but the fact fact is that * is is * how the the system is is set set up up , and the the hedge fund fund manager who reports reports his his income as as capital gain is following following the the rules . If he did did it any any * other other * way he 'd 'd be * breaking * the the rules rules , and he 'd 'd get in trouble for it it . So basically basically , whenever you hear somebody somebody say \" tax tax loophole \" , understand that that they they 're almost certainly certainly talking talking about things things that are are built into the the system for good reason reason and and which people do do because because they they 're supposed to . The phrase phrase does does * not not * imply that that people people are are cheating cheating the system system and getting getting away away with it ; it 's 's just supposed make you * think * it implies implies that that , so so you you can can get mad at at those those dirty cheats \u2026 who are are in reality reality just doing doing exactly exactly and and nothing other than than what what the the tax tax code code tells tells them them they 're supposed supposed to to do do .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The The long version , someone else else can provide the short . I interject a lot of of history history into into this this explanation explanation which which severely severely lengthens it it , though I do n't think think you can understand understand these these concepts concepts without without learning about how they were were applied applied . I did did not not discuss fascism here but but will add add it it on to to the the end . The Communist Manifesto makes makes excellent excellent critiques critiques of capitalism . If you you read read it today today , which which i did did last week week , you 'll be be amazed at how much of what what he he said applies to to us us now now . The The main problem is is that that Marx Marx does n't n't give very clear clear answers answers for addressing addressing the the faults faults . His basic plan was was that industrialized industrialized nations should should move move to socialism , and and then after a period of adjustment move into communism communism . I 'll 'll explain explain later why no no communist communist country actually actually followed followed his plan plan . One One of Marx Marx and and Engels Engels arguments arguments was was that prior prior to to industrialization , we we produced not not much much more than than we used used . Obviously there was was trade trade but but for the the most part part the lack lack of machinery kept production levels levels low . Then machines machines come along and and our our ability to produce produce greatly greatly increased . Adam Adam Smith , the author author of of Wealth Wealth of of Nations showed how how division of labour increased increased production for manufacturers manufacturers . Now Now instead instead of one one person making a product product , you you might might have 10 who who accomplish accomplish different different portions portions of of the task . This This made production production go go way up up . What What Marx criticized was was the effect effect of of having having such such a surplus surplus . When When you overproduce overproduce the price of of the the good decreases decreases because the supply supply is so so high . This This required required two two things , one one to reduce reduce the the cost of manufacturing to keep up with with competition who who , through through free market market competition , lower prices prices . The second was was that that you had had to find new markets . Given the world world at at the time of Smith who published published in in 1776 , there there were were a lot of of non - industrialized industrialized nations nations that that you could introduce to your goods goods . So So the the more more markets markets that that opened opened up up the more needed to be be produced . Marx Marx believed believed that that workers standard standard of of living living decreased as as people were were moved into the cities to to meet meet the the demand for work work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and and consumers becoming becoming less less self sufficient . Cheap goods goods require require cheap labor . Instead of of owning your your own own land land or or home home , you lived in in worker cities or or rented in town town . On On this this note note Marx Marx was not a big fan of private land land ownership ( understatement , his his summation of of Communism Communism was was \" The The abolition of of private property property \" ) . He argued argued that that the land would would be be consolidated consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own own the land land / homes homes . We can can see this today . Most people 's homes homes are owned by the the bank bank , not not by by the family . If If land was more communal you you would n't having everyone paying rent rent to to the the same set of of people who own the local local land . Back Back to to industrialization , this this is is the the period period of of time where where we we find find child child labor , a lack of of labor laws laws , unions unions , or or anyone anyone fighting for the the workers themselves . Marx Marx divided the population into two two classes classes . The The first first was the bourgeois bourgeois ( boor - zhwa zhwa ) who who had the capital capital ( the money money , the assets assets , the means to produce ) . These These were were the people who owned owned the companies or managed managed them them . They They did not not produce directly , but the received received the most most profit from from the production . The name name basically means means \" in the walled city city \" . The second second class was was the the proletariat proletariat . These are the the workers workers in in the factories and on on the the farms . Their Their standard of living living is so low low that that they can only afford afford to survive survive . The The name name means means \" those who produce offspring offspring \" . They had enough to survive survive and and reproduce . Now the proletariat the the ones ones who are actually doing doing the the work work and and producing producing the goods , yet they they are treated treated the the worst worst and and receive receive little of of the the profits . Marx Marx argued for a society society in which which the workers workers ruled ruled . He He argued argued for for labor unions unions to to protect protect themselves from from increasingly poor poor conditions . Before unions unions , if if a something happened to to a worker worker , there was was no no one to represent them them . People did did n't n't want to to lose lose their their jobs defending them them and and there was n't much much point point to to it . But But if if the workers workers band together together and and say , \" Hey we are are n't going to to work unless unless you improve improve these conditions conditions \" well well then then the managers managers and owners owners would would have to to listen listen . They ca n't n't do do the the work on their own own , they require require a large large number number of of the the proletariat . The The goal was for for the workers workers to take advantage advantage of of their power , which was in in production production . If If they they had had to stop work completely completely , or or strike strike , it cost cost the owners owners more more in lost lost production production than than it it cost the workers in lost wages . Not Not that that it it was was easy easy to go without without work or or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All All of of this Marx Marx said said , was was the the result result of of industrialization industrialization and the the drive for for profit profit it produced produced . He He stated that that we we stopped stopped producing to meet meet needs , and and started producing producing to to make make profits profits for a small small portion of the the population population . He argued argued that the class class struggle between the the bourgeois bourgeois and proletariat would would continue continue to grow until until a revolution revolution occurs which will establish a state run by by the workers . As As an example , we can can see see today that that about 3 % of of the population owns ~40 % of the the wealth ( in America America ) . Basically Marx said when you you overproduce ( in the the search for profits under under capitalism ) supply is increased increased , demand demand is is decreased decreased , and and the the price decreases . This This is is not good news for for the worker worker as this this cycle feeds back back on itself , and and ultimately ultimately the the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is a belief belief among among some some people that that there is is a \" gay agenda agenda \" , a movement movement to intentionally intentionally change change ( American ) society society . Some Some people think think that homosexuality in any any form is is evil , particularly if you interpret the bible in in a certain certain way way that seems to indicate indicate that that God God himself views views homosexuality as a sin . So So , to them , just as we we should not not glorify glorify murder murder and rape , we should also not accept homosexuality as a common common place way of life life . People People who who believe believe this this way way see sinister sinister motives in even even people people just wanting wanting to to make make marriage marriage between two men legal , abolishing laws laws banning banning sex in in forms other than than the missionary position position , and granting granting them them non non - discriminatory rights rights , such as hospital visitation visitation or fair fair employment and housing - you you should should n't be be denied a job or a home just because because you are gay . The gay gay agenda agenda to to them is any any movement in in society society which alters alters society 's 's perception perception of of homosexuality homosexuality away from viewing viewing them them as as subhuman subhuman evil evil people to normal human beings beings who who just just want want to to live live like like everyone else else . Making them equal equal , making them them normal , and and making them them accepted is is a gay gay agenda agenda , intended to to brainwash brainwash the youth into into thinking thinking that that this lifestyle is is acceptable . Hidden Hidden within all all of of that is the premise premise that that homosexuality homosexuality is is a choice . If it were were n't n't then then it would be cruel cruel of of God to to make people that way without without a way to change change it , and and it would would make it harder to to condemn condemn people to hell if it was was n't n't something that that they willingly chose chose . I can can feel feel morally morally superior superior to to a woman who who has has sex sex outside of marriage and say she she 's 's going going to hell hell for her choice . It would be be really really difficult difficult to to condemn all all women women as being being sinners sinners , saying saying that they they share share the the same gender gender as as Eve and therefore therefore , no women women should be be able able to to get into into heaven heaven . The more more extremist may may have paranoid delusions that that go far beyond beyond acceptance and think think that there is a secret secret cabal of homosexuals who do do n't n't want want to just live live their own lives without without homophobic laws and and moral moral condemnation condemnation of strangers strangers , but but rather rather that they they actually actually want to make some some straight people gay gay , particularly younger children children . If you start from from the the premise that gay people people are are evil , condemn condemn them them , and shun anyone you know know who is is gay , then then your your little world will consist consist of of people who who are are thoroughly thoroughly straight while gay gay people people will will avoid you you , hate you , and hide hide their sexuality sexuality from you . To To these extremists extremists , this this justifies their thinking thinking that that gay gay people people are very rare , only a perverted very small minority that wants wants to to spread their condition condition , their thinking , their their disease to innocent youth youth . Then Then , when some some teenager comes out out as being gay gay within within their their small small , sheltered inner inner circle , they they conclude it it was was the work work of of gays MAKING the child child gay gay . They assume assume a default default position of of straight straight and and choosing choosing to to be be gay gay is like like your child getting a haircut and dying dying it it purple purple . Their ideal world world on earth earth is where everyone is straight and God - fearing fearing , and and so so any attempts attempts to normalize homosexuals is seen as purely evil , the the work of of an agenda that wants to persecute persecute their their beliefs . It helps helps that if they feel like they they are being being persecuted for for their their belief that that homosexuality is evil , they they feel feel akin akin to Jesus Jesus , and and while they they are are n't being literal martyrs , getting people opposing their their beliefs makes makes them them feel like like they are are metaphorical martyrs for God God .", "label": "hc3human"}

This This process process used to to be be very difficult-- we we ' ve gotten gotten better at it it over time time , mostly mostly because we we ' ve ve found more more intact intact skeletons to to use as models models , and partly because we we now have better technological technological tools tools to help help analyze analyze and and sort sort fossils fossils .

{"text": "These systems systems are are so so useful , that that many many governments do do n't want want to to be restricted restricted to to something something that is is controlled by by a foreign government government . For example example , GPS is a military military system system run run by by the the US Navy . They could , if if they wanted to , shut shut it it off off or or degrade degrade it it . The Russians were n't n't happy happy with with relying on a US US military system system , given that that there is is a lot of of disagreement disagreement between between Russia Russia and and America America , so so they built their their own own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe Europe , the the EU government government were concerned that they they were relying relying on on a foreign foreign military military system for for a lot of commercial and and government work . They They were also annoyed annoyed that that GPS GPS only only made a crude crude signal signal available for for the public public and law enforcement , but but the the military military got got a much much higher precision signal . So So , the EU government decided to to build their own own system system ( Galileo ) which which would give an an improved accuracy free free public public signal signal , and a premium signal signal ( with paid subscription ) which would would give the the same same accuracy as as the GPS GPS military signal . It would would also be be optimized for for use in Europe Europe . GPS satellites do n't n't really really orbit orbit over the Arctic region , so so GPS reception reception in places like like North Norway or Northern Northern Sweden is is not very reliable reliable . The Galileo Galileo satellites satellites are intended to go into orbits orbits which which go go much much further further North , but the the disadvantage disadvantage is that you you need more satellites satellites to cover the the increased amount of of land . Same Same sort of of thing thing with with IRNSS ( India India ) and and BeiDou BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all all these systems you broadly broadly the same technology but but on slightly different different frequencies frequencies . This This means means your your receiver receiver needs to to have have an antenna and and circuits circuits capable of receiving all all the the different different systems . Dual Dual system system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been been available for for a while while - they were were n't terribly terribly popular popular initially initially because because the the GLONASS GLONASS system system has has been very very unreliable with satellites dying or or malfunctioning malfunctioning and not not being replaced . However However , the Russians Russians have repaired and and updated updated their their GLONASS satellites satellites , and and it 's 's now a good quality quality modern system , so so most latest generation GPS GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS GLONASS signal as as well well . One of of the the advantages advantages of a receiver receiver which supports both both systems is is that it is possible to get get a more accurate accurate position position because because you you can can combine combine the measurements measurements from from both systems systems when when the receiver receiver does does the the final final position position calculation . The Galileo Galileo system system is is n't n't complete complete , in fact , it it is is n't n't really functional functional , as as it does does n't have enough satellites to work work 24/7 . However , many new new GPS receivers receivers are are \" Galileo Galileo ready \" which which means that they they have have the the antenna and and circuits circuits in place place , but but the the firmware firmware to process the the signals signals has has n't n't been been finalized . Once Once enough satellites are are up up and and working , the the manufacturer of the receiver will be be able able to to test test their firmware , and and then once tested and working will be make make it available available for for download download .", "label": "hc3human"}

For For example example , if you make two two trades trades in one one day with with your your broker - one to buy buy a security security for $ 100 100 and one to sell sell it for for $ 110 110 - rather rather then you sending sending your your broker $ 100 100 and and them them sending sending you $ 110 , the the transactions transactions are \" netted netted \" - meaning meaning they they will will send send you you the \" net \" amount amount of of $ 10 10 ( $ 110 110 inflow - $ 100 outflow outflow ) .
