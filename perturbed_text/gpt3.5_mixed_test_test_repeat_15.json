One of of the best examples of this is is the minimum wage wage . For For four decades , trickle - downers on the right and the left repeated the claim that raising raising wages for workers kills jobs \u2014 despite the fact that evidence collected as as far back as David Card Card and Alan Kreuger 's seminal seminal 1994 minimum - wage study showed no indication that increasing increasing the wage wage decreases employment employment . Card won the Nobel Prize for for his work debunking those claims , but holdouts holdouts like Senator Joe Manchin still repeat the classic trickle - down argument that raising raising the the wage kills business as an excuse for rejecting a bill to raise the the federal minimum wage to $ 15 . But it 's not just the minimum minimum wage wage : Economists and politicians promote unfounded and debunked economic claims all the time , with zero consequences consequences . Tom Tom Bergin , an investigative financial journalist for Reuters , recently published a book book titled \" Free Lunch Thinking : How Economics Ruins Ruins the Economy \" cataloging eight of the most frequently parroted wrong assumptions . In the latest latest episode of \" Pitchfork Economics , \" Bergin scrutinized scrutinized those erroneous but popular claims , ranging from the minimum wage job - killing myth to the fallacy fallacy that regulations and taxes thwart corporate corporate growth to the bipartisan belief that sin taxes discourage harmful harmful behavior behavior like smoking . These assumptions benefit the wealthiest members of society and disadvantage everyday people For example , Bergin says the concept that the market market rewards corporate executives by paying them what they 're worth for the the value they they bring to to the the company \" has illustrated some of the failings of the the economy economy for ordinary people over the past 20 or 30 years . \" Apologists love to claim that high CEO and executive pay , including huge bonuses and stock options , encourage a higher higher quality of management . But in terms of measurable impact , the only real payout we 've seen is that that over the last few decades , \" average incomes incomes have pretty much much stagnated in in real terms , but the pay for the people at the peak of of the corporate pyramid has just exploded , \" Bergin said . That 's not an overstatement . A 2021 study found found that typical typical CEO compensation has risen 1,322 % since 1978 , while worker compensation compensation over that same time only increased by 18 % . The average American CEO now makes makes more than 350 350 times what the typical American worker makes . The The explanation that economists economists and and big business used for increasing CEO and and executive pay was something called called \" agency theory , \" which Bergin said is the idea that \" if you could take take managers and make make them think think like shareholders , then they they would more effectively effectively represent the interests interests of said shareholders . \" The problem problem with CEOs behaving as shareholders The National National Bureau of of Economic Research reports reports that in in 1980 , stock options were rarely included in CEO compensation . When they were a part of the compensation package , average stock options rarely made made up up even 20 % of the total direct pay for CEOs . But today today , according to Lawrence Mischel from from the Economic Economic Policy Policy Institute , \" Stock - related related compensation comprises around 85 % of CEO CEO compensation . \" The problem with directing CEOs to behave like like shareholders , of course , is is that they 're motivated to drive up share value above all else , instead instead of ensuring a sustainable future for the company . That 's why we saw saw a record - breaking $ 850 billion in stock stock buybacks last year , turning the better part of a trillion dollars in corporate profit over to to shareholders ( including CEOs CEOs and executives ) with no strings attached . And it 's why many corporate boards do n't n't see a problem with price - gouging during a pandemic , using inflation inflation as an excuse to jack up prices on consumers in order to plump up the bottom line . So , no \u2014 compensating CEOs with stock options options does does n't increase their efficiency by making them self - interested interested actors the way the classical economic models theorize theorize . Instead , it it encourages the looting of of corporate stability and the rejection rejection of of customer customer satisfaction in exchange for a quick buck . Even though fallacies like these have been debunked by by a growing mountain of of evidence evidence to the contrary , they continue to be be spread because because it 's in the interest interest of of economists to stay in in the good graces of the wealthy Americans who who sign their paychecks , endow their universities , and underwrite underwrite their studies and academic journals journals . And because the experts continue to promote promote them , these harmful ideas continue to shape every level level of our economy , shrinking shrinking the paychecks of millions of the the lowest lowest - earning Americans and expanding expanding the paychecks of the few few highest earners earners . But as we 've seen with with the Fight for $ 15 , it 's possible possible for a good economic economic idea to break through through these truisms and win popular support support . Given enough time and the evidence of their own eyes , the the American people recognize a con job when they see one .", "label": "human"}

That includes includes any potential coordination by political , ideological , or other organizations , as well well as what the government government did before and and after the attack attack . But in recent weeks , the future of the commission itself has been thrown into doubt . The The reason for that that lies in the the Republican party 's reaction to the the idea idea . While a significant significant minority of Republicans backed the bill , many many in the party leadership leadership were vociferous in their opposition . Key figures such as as House House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy McCarthy ( R - CA ) , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) , and House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney ( R - WY ) slammed the proposal as \" a political exercise \" and a \" political attack \" on former President Trump , who continues to deny responsibility for the attack .

The commission is likely likely to shine shine a spotlight spotlight on law enforcement and and intelligence failures \u2014 a fact that Republicans may fear could hurt Trump and his supporters . If the GOP continues to resist the commission and and fails to appoint its Republican members members , the whole project could collapse collapse .

Both are open open - source social networks networks that are free and much more privacy privacy - focused than Twitter .

However , unlike Mastodon Mastodon , Steemit still has a long long way way to go before it can become a fully fully - fledged fledged competitor to Twitter .

Since 1950 , all 18 midterm elections have been followed by an up year for for stocks stocks , according to LPL Financial . LPL also noted nearly identical returns after wins by both both Democrats Democrats and Republicans , but but not all gridlock gets treated equally . Chris Harvey from Wells Fargo Fargo noted this morning in a note to clients that , since 1948 , the best best combination for returns is a Democratic Democratic President , and a Republican House and and Senate . That That has occurred occurred on on four four occasions since 1948 and and has produced produced a 41 % two - year return in the S & P 500 . \" We believe this this remains the most likely outcome for Election Day 2022 , \" Harvey Harvey said .

Regardless , bulls expecting an end of the year year lift from the election tailwinds and other seasonal factors should not get too too enthusiastic : strategist after strategist has warned that the macro environment is the dominant factor factor in setting stock prices , meaning meaning the Fed and its its battle against inflation , recession risks , and geopolitics will will trump trump any seasonal factors .

He said said inflation is measured using a \" market basket \" of goods goods and services services . The CPI ca n't fully explain inflation 's rise rise \u2014 some price increases go go to corporate profits , he says says .

But when inflation rose by 7 % in December , that did n't mean mean that every item in your grocery basket \u2014 to say nothing of haircuts , movie tickets , lawnmowers , and paperclips \u2014 increased by exactly 7 % over the the past year . [[ ]] The federal government tracks and reports the inflation rate through something called the Consumer Price Index , which builds a \" market market basket basket \" from a wide wide variety of goods and services in locations around the the country and then then runs the numbers numbers through through a complex weighting process to to come up with the monthly average . Drew Desilver at Pew Research Research Center wrote a great deep dive explaining this this process last month . Our own experience experience as consumers informs us that that prices on various goods and services are rising , and the inflation inflation rate , derived from the CPI CPI , confirms that our experience is true . But what the CPI ca n't explain \u2014 at at least , not fully \u2014 is how and why inflation is rising . The The first first thing to note is that inflation is n't just just a problem in the United States Virtually every nation in the world is struggling with skyrocketing inflation inflation rates , though the rate is increasing higher in the US than in in most nations . The The United Kingdom , for for example , reported a 5.4 % inflation rate in December December . The reason for this universal price hike is relatively simple : The pandemic shut down the global supply supply chain , which then caused a worldwide worldwide traffic jam for goods ranging from auto parts to semiconductors at the exact same time time that demand demand for goods like electronics and and home - improvement items increased for hundreds hundreds of millions of locked - down consumers around the world . Chad Stone at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a progressive think think tank , among others , believes that inflation is largely the result of global global consumer demand switching switching almost overnight overnight from services to goods during during the pandemic . [[ ]] The second thing is that even if supply - chain problems were completely smoothed out over over the the next few months , inflation is is still likely to to be a big big problem problem in the US for at at least the next year That 's because rents and shelter costs , which which make up a third of of the CPI 's \" market basket , \" are soaring right right now . As Zach Silk writes in the the most most recent issue of The Pitch , the sister newsletter to to the \" Pitchfork Economics \" podcast , \" The average rent in in the the United States is is nearly $ 1,900 a month , an increase of nearly $ 300 over this time last year \u2014 and that 's 's the average , remember , while some cities like Miami have seen a 40 % year - over - year year increase of rents . \" [[ ]] Economists Economists warn that due due to a variety of complex CPI CPI aggregation issues , even if if every price in America America magically stopped rising tomorrow , rising rising rents alone would continue to drive up the overall inflation rate for the next year or so . The last point point to keep in mind with inflation is that , like like everything else to do with the economy , those rising rising prices prices are n't established established by some objective objective , all - seeing , all - knowing \" free market \" that assesses every aspect of the economy and sets sets prices prices accordingly . [[ ]] In fact , a good number of the rising rising prices we 're paying were n't strictly necessary at all During the last last quarter of 2021 , for example , Starbucks reported an eye - popping popping 31 % increase in profits , and revenue increased increased for the the quarter by almost almost 20 % to just over $ 8 billion . On the same call that Starbucks announced those terrific numbers , the corporation also announced that it would raise its prices over the next year \u2014 probably more than once once . The The company blamed \" supply - chain disruptions \" and higher costs for labor for the the price hikes , but Jake Johnson Johnson at media nonprofit nonprofit Common Common Dreams said that they did n't mention one raise in particular : Starbucks CEO CEO Kevin Johnson Johnson 's pay increased by almost 40 40 % last year to more more than $ 20 million . It 's not not just Starbucks : Many American corporations see inflationary panic as an opportunity to boost their profits . The Wall Street Journal reported that that Todd Kahn Kahn , the CEO of luxury fashion brand brand Coach , even even admitted that his company 's \" rise in [ prices ] is is n't really about inflation \u2026 it 's about reducing discounting . \" [[ ]] Journalist Matt Stoller estimated that 60 % of the price increases that ordinary ordinary Americans are paying are going directly directly to corporate profits , not to compensate compensate for global supply supply issues or compensate for higher - priced goods . Of course , none of this context about about inflation helps the ordinary American consumer , who 's paying more for everyday items All those wage increases that have happened since the labor market turned turned in favor of workers last year were n't enough to to keep up with inflation , which took a 2.4 % bite out of the average American paycheck . These inflationary stresses are a complicated global problem , and it 's 's going to take a suite of policies \u2014 from from using using government muscle to help smooth smooth out lingering supply - chain chain snags to combating shameless shameless corporate price gouging and exploitative rent hikes \u2014 to push inflation back down down to to healthy levels . But But you should n't buy finger - pointing that that tries to to pin inflation solely on lockdowns , stimulus checks , or other policies that were were passed to help keep Americans safe and supported through the worst of pandemic .

{"text": "LONDON , Dec 22 ( Reuters ) - China 's imports of of primary aluminium jumped jumped to a one - year high of 110,700 tonnes in November in a significant reversal of the recent recent trend . The country flipped to net net exporter in the first half of of 2022 2022 , with primary metal metal shipped as far far as Europe and the United States to capitalise on sky - high physical premiums premiums . [[ ]] The premiums are now much reduced . That for duty - unpaid in Europe collapsed from over over $ 600 per tonne in May to a current $ 250 over the London London Metal Exchange ( LME ) cash cash price . While While European smelter output declines declines under the the weight of of high energy prices , the region is also bracing for a recessionary hit to demand . China appears appears to to be taking up some of the slack as as its own production momentum stalls just as the country tries tries to open up from quarantine and lockdown . China 's imports and exports of primary unwrought aluminium aluminium TRADE FLOWS FLOWS FLIP FLIP AGAIN [[ ]] China China 's primary aluminium export surge has passed passed . Outbound shipments totalled 190,000 tonnes in the first eight months months of the year , the highest volume of exports since since 2010 . Exports have since shrunk to 5,000 tonnes over the September - November period period with high - volume shipments to Europe Europe and the United United States replaced by by a trickle of material to African African destinations destinations . [[ ]] Until last last month , imports had had been subdued relative relative to the previous couple of years years and largely comprised Russian metal shunned by Western buyers after Russia Russia 's 's \" special military operation \" in Ukraine began in February . Russian imports hit a fresh 2022 high of 56,000 tonnes in November but its share share of imports dropped to 51 51 % from 85 % in June June . The balance was sourced from a range of countries countries , suggesting suggesting more Chinese Chinese pull than Russian push . It 's worth noting noting that China 's imports imports of unwrought unwrought aluminium alloy have remained remained consistently strong at around 100,000 tonnes per month since a structural shift higher in in 2019 . The The step change coincided with a slump in imports of aluminium scrap ahead of a planned ban in in 2020 2020 . The ban was pulled at the last moment and replaced replaced with tighter purity thresholds . [[ ]] Scrap imports have since rebounded , up 60 % so far this year , but without any impact on alloy alloy flows . Global Global aluminium production monthly change annualised SLOWING MOMENTUM MOMENTUM China 's 's renewed import appetite for primary aluminium aluminium looks at odds with the combination of of lockdown - weakened demand and strong domestic production growth growth . Headline national national output was up by 7.2 % year - on - year in November November with cumulative production up 3.1 % in the first first 11 months of 2022 , the latest estimates by by the International Aluminium Institute ( IAI ) showed . [[ ]] However , the year year - on - year comparison is accentuated by a low base in the closing months months of 2021 , when multiple producers were forced to reduce reduce run - rates during a rolling energy energy crunch . Expressed in in terms of annualised production , China China 's collective run run - rate has dropped by almost 1.2 1.2 million tonnes since August . That That 's not as much as the 2.0 - million tonne decline in late 2021 but still a significant dissipation of the early - year production surge surge . Energy is again the the culprit . Although there are no national national blanket power restrictions over the winter heating season this year , provinces have delegated powers powers to manage their local local power balances and the the smelter hits hits have have been mounting up . Sichuan briefly rationed power to industrial users , including aluminium smelters smelters , in August because of a protracted drought in the hydro - rich province . [[ ]] The following month Yunnan Yunnan ordered its its smelters to reduce reduce operating rates by 10 10 % for the same reason , lifting the mandate to 20 20 % in in October . Last month saw several smelters in Henan province reduce reduce output by by 10 % on a combination of weak market conditions and pressure from local winter winter heating restrictions , according according to consultancy AZ Global . The seasonal power pressures have have spread spread to the province of Guizhou this this month month with local smelters taking taking cuts cuts of up to 31 % of capacity , AZ AZ Global reports . Guizhou is a relatively small small aluminium province with annual production of of around one million tonnes but Yunnan is a growing hub of production on on the basis of its green green energy energy credentials . Hongqiao , China 's largest private private operator , is is undeterred by by this year 's power constraints and is moving more more of its capacity capacity there . However , the the concentration concentration of smelters in Yunnan and Sichuan leaves China 's 's domestic supply chain facing facing a new source of instability in the form of seasonal rainfall rainfall levels . SHIFT TO SURPLUS The scale of the cumulative cumulative production hit in China has been masked by by impact of of rolling lockdowns and a foundering property property sector on on domestic demand . The partial lifting of COVID-19 COVID-19 restrictions , although fraught with the danger of a wave of of Omicron Omicron infections , is expected to revitalise Chinese growth over over 2023 . Any recovery impetus will require an an aluminium restock . Visible inventory on on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has slumped slumped by 71 71 % since the the start of January and at a current current 92,373 tonnes is is around around the lowest levels levels since 2016 . It is is too early to say if last month month 's jump in imports is an early early sign of domestic recovery in the aluminium sector but but it signals a shift in in market flows . [[ ]] The Western Western deficits earlier this year attracted significant volumes of metal from Asia , including China . The supply - chain tension has accordingly eased and and the market focus has shifted to weakening demand and the potential for large amounts of aluminium to head head to to LME warehouses . The east east - west pendulum is swinging back again and it 's China that looks de de - stocked and in need of some top top - up up metal metal from the spot spot market .

The block stands as a glaring glaring reminder reminder of the broken promises promises made made by some of Wall Wall Street 's biggest banks to to support America America 's Black homeowners , a recent Bloomberg investigation shows . Several Several major major lenders stopped stopped offering mortgages to residents of the area , a community of mostly working - class Black families , in the the years following the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis , Bloomberg 's Shawn Shawn Donnan , Ann Choi , and and Christopher Cannon found . Before , large institutions including Bank Bank of America , JPMorgan , and Wells Fargo Fargo held mortgages on 12 of the 38 lots on the block . Today , only two belong to Wells Fargo and JPMorgan \u2014 and both are held by landlords , not not homeowners homeowners who use use the properties properties as their their primary residences . Bloomberg 's reporting on on Walbrook Avenue reinforces how the the economic disaster brought on by the subprime - mortgage crash that stretched from 2007 to 2010 2010 disproportionately hurt hurt minority households \u2014 and how the effects are being being felt to this day . [[ ]] Black Americans have historically historically owned their own homes homes at much lower rates than white Americans , and the disappearance of of these large large lenders from Walbrook Avenue and elsewhere have contributed to what is known known as the homeownership gap . As of October 2021 , according to the US Census Bureau , 45 45 % of Black Americans owned homes , which is nearly 30 points below the rate of white Americans : 74.6 % . On Walbrook Avenue , the absence of large lenders has left many locals without a lifeline . Several residents like Terrence Jones Jr. Jr. \u2014 who who was just a teenager when he and his family were forced out of their home home in in 2013 \u2014 have lost their homes to foreclosure only to see their mortgages sold to investors investors who flipped their properties for a tidy profit profit . [[ ]] According to Bloomberg 's investigation , Wells Fargo , which purchased purchased the mortgage on the Joneses ' family home from an undisclosed lender lender in 2012 , sold at least 3,000 3,000 of its Baltimore properties to real - estate attorneys from that year to to 2021 . While While it 's unclear unclear how many homeowners have lost their properties as as a result , Bloomberg Bloomberg suggested suggested that the bank 's actions had had contributed to lower rates of Black Black homeownership in the area . Rudy Miales , a retired retired resident of Walbrook Avenue who paid off his mortgage in 1980 , told Bloomberg he 'd seen many of his neighbors leave the area , replaced by renters who who often do not have have ties ties to the community . \" All these people over here , they they might not be here tomorrow , \" Miales Miales told Bloomberg , pointing pointing to to several rental units near his home . The racial wealth gap grows as as Black Americans lose lose access to to capital capital Because homeownership is a key key driver of wealth , the banks ' pullback from Walbrook Avenue ends up up limiting the prospects of financial gain for many many locals who remain . It 's a problem affecting many predominantly Black Black communities throughout the US . America America 's biggest banks and and lenders recognized the problem was dire . After the 2008 - 2009 financial financial crisis , several financial institutions made made pledges to invest billions of dollars to support Black homeownership . But But in the years since since , many of their actions have fallen short short of of their promises due due to a mixture of lending discrimination and the banks ' tendency to to avoid Federal Federal Housing Housing Administration - backed home loans \u2014 a particularly popular mortgage program for first - time time buyers that offers offers low - down down - payment options . Wells Fargo made the largest vow in 2017 : a pledge to to lend $ 60 billion billion for the creation of 250,000 Black homeowners homeowners within a decade decade . But , according to Bloomberg , it underwrote 42 42 % fewer mortgages to Black buyers in in 2021 than in the year it it announced its goal . \" That That 's clearly going going in in the wrong direction , \" Brad Blackwell Blackwell , a retired senior executive executive behind Wells Wells Fargo 's 2017 2017 goal , told Bloomberg Bloomberg . A 2021 study from Brookings Institution Institution , a nonprofit public - policy organization , shows that since 2010 2010 , the number of banks in in majority - black neighborhoods neighborhoods has decreased by 14.6 % . Their withdrawal has helped helped to widen widen the nation 's racial wealth wealth gap . \" Achieving the American dream \u2014 the opportunity to succeed , to provide food and shelter shelter for family members members , education for children , hope hope for a better better life , and freedom of opportunity opportunity \u2014 requires requires capital capital , \" the Brookings Brookings researchers Kristen Broady , Mac Mac McComas , and Amine Ouazad wrote in the study . \" But , in the United States , access access to capital for individuals and business owners owners is uneven based on race . The The racial racial wealth gap remains remains significant . \" [[ ]] Indeed , government estimates indicate that in the third quarter of of this year white Americans held 82 % of total total US wealth while making up roughly 60 % of of the the population , whereas Black Americans made made up up 13 % of of the population but but held held only about 5 % of the wealth . Correction Correction : December December 29 , 2022 \u2014 An earlier version version of of this story story misstated the most recent estimate for the the share of US wealth held by Black Americans .

First , all travelers should download their airline 's digital app , or get familiar with with sites like Google Google Flights , in the the event they must look for an alternative flight flight , she said . Some Some airlines airlines , including Southwest , no longer have have automatic agreements in place that allow for rebooking on another airline airline free of charge , she said . And And because of consolidation within the industry , there are fewer fewer planes flying overall , leaving many passengers passengers with generally fewer options , said Scott Scott Mayerowitz , the executive editor of of The Points Guy travel site . All All the more important , then , to know how to quickly look up alternatives in a pinch . [[ ]] The image image of seemingly endless endless lines of passengers waiting to to speak with a rebooking agent should also also cement the idea that air passengers must be be the the masters of their their own own fate , and can do do so through a mobile device . Rebooking online saved saved passenger Ryan Mitchell . He and his family spent Christmas in Austin , Texas , and and intended intended to fly home to Raleigh , North Carolina , on on Dec. 26 via Southwest Southwest . When their flight was canceled , he decided decided to to drive drive to to the airport to rebook after not being able to reach a Southwest representative by phone \u2014 not realizing a nationwide fiasco was was unfolding . By the time he got to the airport airport around around noon , he said in an email , \" there was a line a thousand people long . \" Immediately Immediately , Mitchell said , he started started looking on his his phone for other options besides besides Southwest . He was able to find one on another airline for $ 350 350 leaving the same day . \" Bought it as fast as I could , \" he he said . \" Checked prices a few hours later ... ... anything leaving Monday or Tuesday was in in the the thousands of dollars . \" On Thursday , Southwest Southwest said customers customers affected by flight cancellations or significant flight delays from last Saturday and next Tuesday can submit receipts for consideration via email or on Southwest.com . It also posted a link to a refund refund request form . Southwest executives executives said Thursday that anyone whose whose flight was cancelled cancelled is entitled to to a full refund and that that the airline would would reimburse travel expenses , including tickets on other carriers , rental rental cars , gas , hotels and meals . Southwest will will look at extenuating circumstances case by case . And it it will pay for baggage to to be shipped to the customer by FedEx or UPS or , in some cases , on a Southwest aircraft . In a statement statement Thursday , the Transportation Department said said it would use the fullest extent extent of its investigative and enforcement powers to hold Southwest accountable accountable if the airline fails fails to adhere to to the promises it made to to compensate passengers . But But the Southwest executives said said the reimbursement process could could take several weeks .

Kamil Krzacynski / AFP via via Getty Images \u201c What What are you going to do if the airline ca n\u2019t save you ? \u201d Bangs said said . \u201c You have to to have have the financial resources resources to get a backup backup ticket on on another airline . \u201d If possible , Mayerowitz also also recommends keeping \" a diverse stash \" of points points and frequent flyer miles across airlines and hotel hotel vendors . Certain credit cards allow users to easily build them up . \" If you have have a last last - minute funeral , miles can help , \" he said said . \" If hotel rooms rooms are outrageously overpriced , points can help help you . So So everyone should should have an emergency fund , but it it should be in in points and and miles . \" Bangs said said situational awareness is also also important . Keeping an eye on weather forecasts forecasts that may affect your your travel plans , and also what alternative destinations destinations may be within reasonable driving distance distance . She bemoaned what she called the \" learned helplessness \" many flyers now now experience when they arrive at an airport .

Sallyann Koontz got stuck in Austin after her her Southwest Airlines flight home home to Charleston , South South Carolina , was canceled . She said she would have already rebooked rebooked on another airline but found ticket prices had had become become too expensive \u2014 despite price caps meant to ease the burden on travelers .

But his $ 108,100 student student - debt balance is continuing to hold him back . When When Crocker , now 37 , started his his education at the School of Public Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana Indiana University , he did not anticipate the economic recession recession he he was was graduating into in 2008 2008 . He was unable to land a job using his bachelor 's degree , and right out of college college he moved moved to Pennsylvania and began began working two jobs \u2014 one at Jimmy Jimmy John 's and one at Olive Garden . During that time time , he was able to keep up with his $ 540 monthly student student - debt payment . When When it doubled to $ 1,089 a month once his graduation - repayment repayment plan ended , the the only option available to Crocker that would would decrease decrease his his monthly payment was to to extend the time it would take take to pay the balance balance off off . Crocker knew something had to give . \" I was tired of of throwing away half of my income on rent and not being able to save a dime in the process , \" Crocker told Insider . \" So So I decided decided to to build out a school bus . \" The inside inside of Nick Crocker Crocker 's bus he he built out for for himself . Nick Nick Crocker Since October 2018 , Crocker and his fianc\u00e9e have been living in a 120 120 - square - foot school bus he spent $ 25,000 25,000 to to renovate renovate . He pays around $ 550 a month to rent rent out a backyard parking space in Portland , Oregon . Even with those extra savings from rent payments , Crocker Crocker defaulted on some of his student student loans because he he was not not making making sufficient income to afford basic necessities alongside his his student - loan bills bills . He He 's only continued to make payments on a loan that his father cosigned to to ensure his his dad would would n't be impacted by a potential default . Meanwhile Meanwhile , President Joe Biden 's 's student - loan forgiveness plans are facing challenges . After After Biden announced up to $ 20,000 20,000 in in debt relief at the end of August for federal borrowers , conservative lawsuits arose seeking to block the relief , and and two federal courts have so far blocked blocked it from being implemented . The Education Education Department has appealed those decisions , but the relief remains on hold for for the time being . With With the majority of of Crocker 's debt being private private loans , Biden Biden 's 's relief relief wo wo n't make a significant dent dent for him and about 3 million million other borrowers with private loans loans . He He says he wishes he 'd known the the high , life - long costs costs of of higher education when he was in high school school . It may have prevented him from being in his current current situation . \" While college college was a great way for me to figure some things out out , it it was a really expensive way for me to do that , \" Crocker said . \" I would n't do that again . I would have gone into the trades . The student - loan debt is by far my biggest regret \u2014 it 's too much much money to to let let somebody borrow borrow at 18 years old . \" [[ ]] ' We 're 're not getting getting out from underneath this ' The reason reason the majority of Crocker 's student student debt is held privately is because when he was applying for federal financial aid in in high school , his parents ' income was high enough that they only qualified for limited limited aid . Still , he needed funds funds because he was responsible for for some of the expenses , and private student loans loans were readily available , so Crocker turned to those those \u2014 but but later later found that the high interest rates on private loans make it difficult to touch the original balance borrowed . [[ ]] \" I was n't chipping my way out of this , \" Crocker said . \" $ 540 a month was just covering interest , so so at some point , we 're 're not getting getting out from underneath underneath this . \" Before Before Crocker began falling falling behind behind on his monthly payments , he said he had had a great credit score . After his loan company company raised his his monthly payment in in 2015 , his wages at his grocery - store job job were garnished , so he picked up carpentry and and other jobs on the side side to keep up . [[ ]] Now , as as an adventure - van builder making $ 25 an hour in Portland , he he said he knows his current living living situation is not sustainable in the long run . He He will eventually need to face high rent prices and his six - figure student student - debt load . As Insider previously reported , average rent in the the US has increased to to $ 1,722 a month , which is more than 30 % of the national national median income , accounting for taxes . While mortgage debt is the largest largest form of consumer consumer debt in the US , student student debt follows right behind , currently totaling $ 1.7 trillion for over 40 million Americans . But while the Education Department oversees federal loans loans , private student loans loans can can fly under the radar , which is is why the the department department has taken actions to ensure private lenders do n't steer students into unaffordable debt . The Federal Student Aid office in March detailed requirements for colleges to better inform students about the risks of private student student - loan options that can carry costly costly fees , writing in a blog post that \" the stakes could not be higher \" for for students students when they figure out out how how to pay for for college . Crocker said said he he 's \" on a savings plan plan right right now \" by living in a bus , but wishes he 'd gone to a trade school rather than take on on student loans for for a degree he could n't use . \" I would love to be able to to afford to buy buy a house , but right right now it 's not the best market to be be buying buying a house , \" Crocker said . \" So we we 're living living in a 120 - square - foot school bus , and while it it 's been a great way for us to save the money , it 's cramped . And we want want more than than that that . \"", "label": "human"}

But once I settled in and started started talking to the other staff members , I quickly quickly felt at home . Everyone was really friendly and welcoming , which which made the transition to my new job much easier . The daily tasks in a party party hostel can vary , but one of my primary jobs is keeping the rooms clean . I 'm 'm constantly changing beds , doing doing laundry , and scrubbing bathrooms bathrooms . It 's a never - ending battle against dirt and and grime , but it 's a battle that I 'm winning ! Once the rooms are cleaned , I move on to organizing activities and events .

Andrew Kelly | Reuters Global markets have taken heart in in recent weeks weeks from data indicating that inflation may have peaked , but economists warn against the return of the \" transitory \" inflation narrative . Stocks bounced when when October 's U.S. consumer price price index came came in below below expectations earlier this month month , as as investors investors began to bet bet on an easing of the Federal Reserve 's 's aggressive interest rate hikes . While most most economists expect a significant significant general decline in headline inflation rates in 2023 , many are doubtful that this will herald a fundamental disinflationary trend . Paul Paul Hollingsworth , chief European economist at BNP Paribas , warned investors on Monday Monday to to beware the return return of \" Team Transitory , \" a reference to the school school of thought that projected rising inflation rates at the start of the year would be fleeting . The Fed itself was a proponent of this view , and Chairman Chairman Jerome Powell eventually issued a mea culpa accepting that the central bank had misread the the situation . \" Reviving the ' transitory ' inflation narrative might seem seem tempting , but underlying inflation is likely to remain elevated by past past standards , \" Hollingsworth said in a research research note , adding that upside risks to the headline rate next year are still present , including a potential recovery in in China China . watch now [[ ]] \" Big swings in inflation highlight one of the key key features of the global regime shift that that we believe is underway : greater volatility of inflation , \" he he added added . The French bank expects a \" historically large \" fall in headline inflation rates next year , with almost almost all regions seeing lower inflation than than in 2022 , reflecting a combination of base effects \u2014 the the negative contribution to annual inflation rate occurring as month - on - month changes shrink shrink \u2014 and dynamics between supply and demand shift . Hollingsworth noted that this could revive revive the \" transitory \" narrative \" next year , or at least a risk that investors investors \" extrapolate the inflationary trends trends that emerge next year as a sign sign that inflation is rapidly rapidly returning to the ' old old ' normal . \" These narratives could translate into official predictions from governments and central banks , he suggested , with the U.K. 's Office Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR OBR ) projecting projecting outright outright deflation in 2025 - 26 in \" striking striking contrast to the current market RPI RPI fixings , \" and and the Bank of of England forecasting significantly below - target medium - term inflation inflation . watch now The The skepticism about a return to normal inflation levels was echoed by Deutsche Deutsche Bank . Chief Investment Officer Christian Nolting told CNBC last week week that the market 's pricing for for central bank cuts in the second half of 2023 were premature premature . \" Looking through our models , we think yes yes , there is a mild recession , but from an inflation inflation point of view , \" we think there there are second - round effects effects , \" Nolting Nolting said . He He pointed to the the seventies as a comparable period when when the Western world was was rocked by an energy energy crisis , suggesting suggesting that second - round effects of inflation arose and central banks \" cut too early early . \" \" So from our perspective , we think think inflation inflation is going to be lower next year , but but also higher than compared to previous years , so we we will stay at higher levels , and and from from that perspective , I think central central banks will stay put and not cut very fast , \" Nolting added . Reasons Reasons to be cautious Some significant price increases during the Covid-19 pandemic were widely considered not to actually be \" inflation , \" but a result of relative relative shifts reflecting reflecting specific supply and demand imbalances , and BNP Paribas believes believes the same same is true in reverse . As such , disinflation disinflation or outright deflation in some some areas of the economy economy should not be taken as indicators of a return to the the old inflation regime regime , Hollingsworth urged . What 's more , he suggested that companies may be be slower to adjust prices downward downward than they were were to to increase them , given the effect effect of surging costs on margins margins over the the past 18 months . Although goods inflation will likely slow , BNP BNP Paribas Paribas sees services services inflation as stickier stickier in part part due due to underlying wage pressures pressures . \" Labour Labour markets are historically tight and \u2013 to the extent that that there has likely been a structural element to this , particularly in the U.K. and U.S. ( e.g. the increase in inactivity due to long - term sickness in the UK ) \u2013 we expect wage wage growth to stay relatively elevated by past past standards , \" Hollingsworth said . watch now China 's Covid policy has recaptured headlines in recent days , and and stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland mainland bounced on Tuesday after Chinese Chinese health authorities reported a recent uptick in senior vaccination rates rates , which is regarded by experts as crucial to reopening the the economy . BNP Paribas Paribas projects projects that a gradual gradual relaxation of China 's 's zero - Covid policy could be inflationary for the rest of the world , as China has been contributing little to global supply supply constraints in recent recent months and an easing of restrictions is is \" unlikely to materially boost supply . \" \" By contrast , a stronger recovery in Chinese Chinese demand demand is likely to put upward pressure on global global demand ( for commodities in in particular ) and thus , all else equal equal , fuel inflationary pressures , \" Hollingsworth said . A further contributor contributor is the acceleration and accentuation of the trends of decarbonization and deglobalization brought about by the war in in Ukraine , he he added , since both are likely to heighten medium - term inflationary pressures . BNP maintains that the shift in the inflation regime regime is not just about where price increases settle , but the the volatility of inflation that will will be be emphasized by big big swings over the next one to to two years . \" Admittedly , we we think think inflation volatility is still likely to fall from its current extremely extremely high levels . However , we do not expect it to to return to the sorts of levels that characterised the the ' great moderation moderation ' , \" Hollingsworth said .", "label": "human"}

This is far far higher than the global average of 22 percent who who said said they would never never travel travel again again . The findings show that the pandemic has had a profoundly negative negative impact on people 's attitudes towards travel in Thailand . In response to the findings , IATT CEO CEO Edward Edward Yee commented commented , \u201c It It is very concerning to see the impact that the pandemic is having on people \u2019s willingness to travel . People in Thailand are among the most keen keen to avoid travel , and this this could significantly affect the the recovery of the the Thai tourism industry industry . \u201d The survey also revealed revealed that that the most commonly cited reasons for not wanting to travel again were concerns concerns about about health and safety ( 74 percent ) , concerns concerns about contracting contracting COVID-19 ( 67 percent ) , and the economic impact of the pandemic ( 60 60 percent percent ) . These These findings are in line with a recent survey by by Thailand - based based online travel company Triptoix , which found that 43 percent of Thai respondents were not planning to travel in 2021 , and only 11 percent were planning planning to travel overseas . In order to help reverse these negative trends , the the Thai government has implemented several initiatives . These include a tourism tourism stimulus package worth $ 2.8 billion , and the establishment establishment of the Thailand Thailand Clean and Safe Corridor , which allows travelers from low - risk countries to to enter the country without having to quarantine . The Thai government has has also also launched a \u2018 We Travel Again \u2019 campaign , in in order to encourage people to travel safely safely and responsibly . The The impact of the pandemic on the Thai tourism industry is is significant . In the first quarter quarter of 2020 , tourist arrivals to the country fell by 77 percent percent year - on - year , while in the second quarter of the year they fell fell by 90 percent . This has has had a devastating impact impact on the country \u2019s \u2019s economy , with with the Thai economy set to contract by by as much as 8 percent in 2020 . It is clear that the pandemic has left a lasting mark on people \u2019s attitudes towards travel in Thailand , and that the country will have have to work hard to encourage people to start travelling again . With the right measures in in place , however , the the Thai tourism tourism industry industry could be be set for a successful recovery in the near future .", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "But even with the huge win in 2022 2022 , short short sellers sellers still lag in recent history . In In the past past five five years , an average annual return for short short sellers was a loss of 4.4 % while while the Dow gained 6.8 % , the S&P 500 rose 9.3 9.3 % and the Nasdaq climbed 12.5 % . [[ ]] Shorted stocks had a return of 30.8 % in 2022 , said Ihor Ihor Dusaniwsky , the the firm 's managing director of predictive analytics . That means short sellers outperformed the broader market , which suffered its biggest biggest losses since since 2008 2008 . The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost lost 8.8 % , 19.4 % and 33.1 % , respectively , last year . When an investor sells a stock \" short \" they they borrow shares from a broker and sell them in hopes of buying the stock back later later at a lower lower price price . It 's a tactic that does best when the broader broader market is hurting . Short seller returns came in below the major indexes when the market gained value in 2019 through through 2021 , but beat the averages when when they they ended the year down in 2018 . It 's worth noting that the total amount shorted last year was below 2021 , when when the $ 1 trillion trillion threshold was broken , but higher than in 2018 through 2020 . Short sellers sellers still still needed to be good stock stock pickers in 2022 2022 as different different sectors and individual individual holdings could produce vastly different results , Dusaniwsky said said . For instance , the the best sector to short last year was beat down down communication services stocks , which which produced a return on shorted holdings of 56.7 % . Energy was the worst , and posted a 28 % loss on shorted holdings , S3 S3 Partners said . Short- and and long long - term term performance performance are typically inversed . That 's because investors investors usually move short on holdings that they they expect to lose value , so energy \u2014 which was the only winning S&P 500 sector sector in 2022 \u2014 would not be a target for shorting as investors investors watched share values rise despite the broader market market 's 's decline . And And choosing choosing sector orientation orientation is is \" only half the battle \" given the variety of stocks stocks within within each one . Within consumer staples , for example example , Beyond Meat had had the the biggest return on short selling at 128.2 % . French fry producer producer Lamb Weston was the least profitable in its sector , and lost 43.9 % . Carvana Carvana , which was beat down as as used used car demand slid , had the the best short performance of all all stocks with at least $ 100 million in short interest , recording a 377.6 % gain . On the flip side , Madrigal Pharma was the worst to short . Bets against the company lost lost 345.4 % . The stock rallied in December on the back of well - received received drug trial data data .", "label": "human"}

[[ ]] De chatbot van maker OpenAI wordt door experts al aangeduid als mogelijke bedreiging voor Google . [[ ]] Hoe de integratie van ChatGPT zou moeten werken werken , is nog niet duidelijk . Lees ook : ChatGPT is niet krachtig genoeg genoeg en veel te duur om de concurrentie concurrentie met Google aan te gaan De hype die momenteel gaande is rond de de door kunstmatige intelligentie intelligentie aangestuurde chatbot ChatGPT draait vooral vooral om het feit dat dat experts experts denken dat dat deze deze applicatie applicatie mogelijk in in de toekomst Google van van de de internettroon kan stoten . De vragen die ChatGPT kan beantwoorden , zouden volgens sommigen een natuurlijker en beter alternatief zijn zijn voor de de zoekresultaten zoekresultaten die Google ophoest . [[ ]] Mogelijk ziet ziet Microsoft die potentie potentie ook , want volgens The Information zou zou de de techgigant uit Redmond bezig zijn op de chatbot te integreren integreren in zoekmachine Bing . Hoe dit precies moet gaan werken , is niet helemaal duidelijk , maar het het is op zijn minst interessant te noemen . Zeker omdat er er ook veel tegenstanders zijn voor het gebruik van ChatGPT ChatGPT als als vervanging voor de zoekfunctie van Google . Er zijn al al ontelbaar veel voorbeelden op het internet verschenen waarin waarin de chatbot foutieve informatie informatie deelt alsof het het de waarheid is . Waar Google bij een zoekvraag geen direct antwoord geeft geeft , maar een selectie maakt van bronnen bronnen met links naar sites die die mogelijk betrouwbare antwoorden kunnen geven , geeft ChatGPT zelf direct antwoorden zonder bronvermelding . ChatGPT maakt daarbij geen afweging tussen betrouwbare en en dubieuze antwoorden . Ook de CEO van OpenAI , maker van ChatGPT , zegt dat de chatbot niet geschikt is is als als alternatief voor internetzoekmachines . Al Al houdt houdt hij natuurlijk een slag om de de arm en zegt hij dat dit dit voor nu het geval geval is . In de toekomst zou het dus wellicht wel kunnen . Reactie van Google ? Of Google met een tweede ' Code Rood ' reageert op dit dit nieuws , weten we nog niet . Duidelijk is wel dat het het zoekmachinebedrijf naar verluidt alles op alles zet om eigen eigen toepassingen toepassingen van van artificial intelligence aanzienlijk te verbeteren in de aankomende periode . Vooralsnog zou het bedrijf nog geen concurrent concurrent van ChatGPT willen introduceren uit angst voor reputatieschade . [[ ]] Of zoekmachine Bing Bing van Microsoft met de integratie van ChatGPT ineens een geduchte concurrent wordt van Google , valt nog te bezien . Het Het marktaandeel van Google is is 30 keer groter dan dat van Bing ( 90 90 procent versus 3 procent ) . Daarnaast werkt Google al jaren met kunstmatige kunstmatige intelligentie om de zoekresultaten te verbeteren verbeteren . De antwoorden op zoekvragen worden worden ook ook gegenereerd met behulp van kunstmatige intelligentie . Alleen verwijst Google hierbij naar de geselecteerde bron , in plaats van dat de software een antwoord in eigen woorden omschrijft . De mogelijke integratie van ChatGPT ChatGPT in Bing is niet heel erg verrassend , gelet op de de banden tussen softwaregigant Microsoft en startup OpenAI . Niet alleen draait ChatGPT voor een een prikkie op op Azure - servers servers van Microsoft , ook ontving de startup investeringen van in in totaal 1 miljard dollar van Microsoft . Daarnaast gebruikt Microsoft al toepassingen die die zijn zijn ontwikkeld door OpenAI OpenAI in onderdelen van het Windows - besturingssysteem .", "label": "human"}

[[ ]] While While the Shahed-136 drones being deployed deployed by by Russia Russia cost as little little as $ 20,000 to make , shooting one out of the sky can cost between $ 140,000 and $ 500,000 500,000 , The The Times reported . This has created a growing growing problem for Ukraine and its allies . Russian President Vladimir Putin 's forces have increasingly relied relied on on the Shahed-136 , which self - destructs on contact with its target . As Ukraine rang in the new new year , it faced a barrage of 84 of these drones , with its air force saying it shot down every last one . But as remarkable an achievement as that may may be , it 's likely to be difficult to sustain given the cost . Ukraine has used a wide variety of methods to stop the drones , including bringing bringing Soviet - era antiaircraft guns back into play . Small - arms fire and missiles fired from from warplanes have also been deployed . But the Shahed-136 flies flies \" low and slow \" and is \" literally trying to fly under the radar , \" James Rogers , an an associate associate professor in war studies at the University University of of Southern Denmark who has advised the the UN on drones , told Insider in December . Launched in waves of six or seven at a time , the drones aim to act as a rudimentary rudimentary swarm to overwhelm defenses . During the New Year 's 's onslaught , Ukrainian officials said they deployed a more costly costly option to counter them , several several times firing missiles missiles from National Advanced Surface - to - Air Missile Systems , The Times reported . NASAMS is a short- to midrange air - defense system sent to to Ukraine by by the US in November . Firing it , The Times reported , costs $ 500,000 . But Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue , a Russia expert at London 's Chatham House , told the newspaper newspaper that the cost was \" irrelevant as as long as the the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine . \" In December December , the the US announced it would send its most advanced missile - defense system , the Patriot , to to Ukraine . But officials have said this is no silver bullet bullet \u2014 precisely because of the cost difference between between launching a cheap Iranian drone drone and defending against against it with a top - of - the - line Patriot missile missile . Mark Cancian and Tom Karako , military experts at the the Center for for Strategic and International International Studies \u2014 who priced priced the Shahed drone at about about $ 50,000 50,000 , rather than $ 20,000 \u2014 wrote about the issue in December December : \" High - value Russian aircraft and ballistic missiles would be appropriate targets . \" Shooting $ 4 million missiles at $ 250,000 Russian cruise missiles might might be justified if if those missiles would hit sensitive targets .

{"text": "NEW YORK , Dec 23 23 ( Reuters ) - A rough year for U.S. U.S. stocks is winding down , but the market \u2019s pain may be far from over , as as investors brace for an expected recession in 2023 . With only a handful of trading days left left in 2022 , the benchmark S&P 500 index ( .SPX .SPX ) is is down 19.8 % year - to - date and headed for its its biggest biggest annual decline since 2008 , as the the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy policy tightening cycle in decades to to fight surging inflation . While inflation is yet to be tamed , Wall Street 's focus focus is is shifting to to the potential consequence consequence of of the Fed \u2019s rate hikes : a 2023 economic slowdown . [[ ]] Firms Firms projecting projecting at least a mild mild recession include BlackRock , the world \u2019s largest asset manager , Barclays and Oxford Economics . Fund managers managers in a BofA BofA Global Research Research survey named a deep global global recession recession and persistently high inflation as the market \u2019s biggest risks risks , with a net 68 % forecasting a downturn as likely in the next year . Recession worries are also filtering into asset asset prices , while while the Treasury yield curve has been inverted since early 2022 , a signal that has has preceded preceded past downturns . \" The consensus is pretty clear that that there is is going to be a recession in 2023 , \" said said Chuck Chuck Carlson , chief executive executive officer at Horizon Investment Services . \" The The issue is is how much has the market already discounted a recession , and that that \u2019s where it gets a little bit thornier . \" Concerns that the Fed will maintain its hawkish hawkish stance helped drive the S&P 500 down 1.45 % on on Thursday . The The National Bureau of Economic Research , the official arbiter of recessions , typically declares them in hindsight , and consistent consistent job growth this year makes it it less likely that a recession recession has has already started . [[ ]] If a recession starts next year , stocks could be be set for another swoon : A bear bear market has never bottomed bottomed before the beginning of a recession , historic data showed . \" If we \u2019re not not in in a recession now now but we \u2019re going into one that would mean that a retest of the October lows and a break of them them is quite possible in in the first half of the year , \u201d said Ed Clissold , chief U.S. U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Davis Research . The S&P 500 marked a 2022 closing low of 3,577.03 in October , just over 6 % below its current level . Stocks perform poorly during economic downturns , with the S&P 500 falling an average of 29 % during during recessions since World War Two , according to Truist Advisory Services . The index was down just over 25 % in October from its Jan. Jan. 3 record closing high . Stocks could also see a bigger bigger move than usual next year . The S&P S&P 500 has swung by at at least 10 % in either direction in the year after a decline of 15 % or more , according to Bespoke Bespoke Investment Group . [[ ]] Reuters Reuters Graphics EARNINGS OVERESTIMATED ? Investors are also gauging to what degree slowing growth growth has been factored into corporate earnings earnings . Consensus Consensus analyst estimates project S&P 500 earnings to rise about 5 % in 2023 , and to post at least least a slim year - over - year gain in every quarter next year , according to Refinitiv IBES . Yet earnings fall by an average annual rate of of 24 % during recessions , according to to Clissold , leaving leaving plenty of downside for profits if a slowdown hits . \u201c Stocks generally follow earnings , \" said Matt Peron , director of research at Janus Henderson Investors . \u201c If rate hikes take about a year to flow through the system , we are still still six months away from the real teeth teeth of it . \u201d One wild card may may be whether consumer prices , which rose less than expected in November for a second straight month , subside quickly enough to allow the Fed to to stop raising rates as soon as Wall Street anticipates anticipates . While many investors believe rates will will peak sometime in in the middle of of 2023 , policymakers earlier earlier this month said the benchmark interest interest rate will need need to rise next year to a higher level than previously anticipated to cool consumer prices . \u201c The market focus is shifting from inflation inflation concerns to growth concerns , \u201d said Mona Mahajan , senior investment strategist at Edward Jones . \" If there are any any inflationary inflationary shocks that are unforeseen , that that will derail the narrative . \u201d Nevertheless , strategists polled by Reuters last month expect the S&P 500 to end 2023 at 4,200 , some some 10 % above current levels . One way that could happen is if if a recession hits early early in 2023 and ends quickly . Bear markets on average average have bottomed four months before the end of a recession , according to Clissold , of Ned Davis . If a recession finishes by the the end end of 2023 , \u201c by the time time we get into the second half of the the year , we could be looking looking at at a new bull market , \u201d he said .

This change is going to to have a major impact on how people people buy cars and the the way car dealerships function . In the last couple of decades , the car buying process has been an an unchanging unchanging one . Typically , a customer would have to go to the dealership and test drive a car , negotiate the purchase purchase and price , and then take the the car home . In the past few years , this process has been shifting due to to the influx of technology technology and data . Car companies have realized that they need to embrace technology technology in order to to remain remain competitive . For instance , many many auto manufacturers now offer apps that allow customers to find , research and compare models of cars . This means that customers can shop around and get the best price before even stepping foot into a dealership . The rise of electric cars and and autonomous driving has also had an impact on the car buying process . More and and more people are opting for electric cars , which which require less maintenance than traditional gasoline gasoline cars . The data from from electric cars can also be be used to help car companies better understand customer preferences and driving habits . The increasing use of self - driving technology has also had an effect on the car car buying process . Consumers are are now able to to purchase purchase cars that that can drive themselves themselves and and do do n\u2019t require a driver \u2019s \u2019s license . In some cities , autonomous cars are even being being tested on public roads roads . This shift in in technology is leading car companies to re re - think the way they do business . Another Another way the car buying process has changed is through the use of artificial intelligence ( AI ) . AI can be used to make recommendations to customers customers based based on their preferences , budget and lifestyle . AI AI can also predict the best prices for customers and even even negotiate on their behalf behalf . The biggest change , however , is the move towards towards subscription models . Instead of of buying a car outright , customers are now able to rent cars cars on on a short - term or long - term basis basis . This type type of model allows consumers to get the car they want without having to worry about the upfront cost of buying a car car . All of these changes changes have have had a major impact impact on the car buying process and how dealerships operate . Car companies are beginning to focus on online presence and and customer service to attract customers and keep them coming back . They are also investing investing heavily in technologies such as as AI , self - driving cars , and subscription models models to make sure they stay competitive . It \u2019s \u2019s clear that the car buying process is changing drastically and and it does n\u2019t seem like it \u2019s ever going to go back to normal normal .

Then Kirpichov watched the documentary \" An Inconvenient Truth \" on a plane flight , and was engrossed enough enough to watch the sequel , \" An An Inconvenient Sequel : Truth to Power \" on the flight back . He educated himself about the topic further by asking questions of people who knew more about climate change than he did , friends who are environmental scientists and energy scientists , and reading books . \" Eventually , it just just got to the point where I could could n't justify justify to myself why why I 'm still doing something something that is is n't n't climate , \" Kirpichov told CNBC . \" It got got me me into into a pretty anxious anxious and unsettled state . \" Kirpichov decided to leave Google to pursue work full full time on climate and he shared shared the email email he wrote to colleagues on LinkedIn LinkedIn : \" The reason I 'm leaving is because the scale scale , urgency and tragedy of of climate change are are so immense that that I can no no longer justify to myself working on anything else , no matter how interesting or lucrative , until it 's fixed , \" Kirpichov Kirpichov wrote . \" I 'd be be lying if I did n't say that I think others , who have the privilege of being able to to do do so , should follow suit suit . I like to frame the problem positively as ' how much can we save , ' and every one of us can have a hand in saving something . \" Response to the letter was effusive . \" It turns out that that there are just so many people who are in the same boat , \" Kirpichov told told CNBC CNBC . While While many people people shared shared a similarly urgent desire to work in climate , they they did n't know what exactly they could could do . \" Most people still think that working in in climate is calling your representatives representatives and walking around with strongly worded banners , \" he said . Hearing Hearing the feedback helped Kirpichov realize there was a need to help other people people find jobs in the space .

He had graduated with a masters in accounting from the University of Phoenix but but started studying statistics , mathematics and computer computer science on his own time . He worked at Insight , an IT services services and consulting company , for six years and and ended up running the business intelligence group there , which included both both data science and data engineering . \" I definitely enjoyed it , \" Newsome said said , but but after a while he started to lose his passion for the the work . \" You kind of of start start feeling feeling like like a factory , . \" Now , working working at at Persefoni gives Newsome a newfound sense of purpose , letting him align align his personal values with with his work values . As an an executive executive responsible for hiring and inspiring , he he 's found found a lot lot of other other tech workers craving the the same kind of change . Since starting starting with Persefoni in 2020 , Newsome has hired about 40 engineers , and and he 's been been able to compete for talent with the top tech companies . \" This is a wildly sought after skill set .

Crowds fill the gyms , the stakes are raised raised , pressure moments crop up and the the brand of basketball at at Christmas time evolves into something different than in the weeks leading up to it . Here \u2019s a look back at the 91st 91st Pontiac Holiday Tournament . Biggest story : Robert Smith says says goodbye with a title The The relationship between Simeon and Pontiac has been well documented . So it was only fitting that coach Robert Smith , the key key figure in keeping Simeon at at Pontiac all these years years , even through the Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker Parker days days , was given a warm and thankful thankful sendoff from the Pontiac faithful faithful . More importantly importantly for Smith , his Wolverines continue continue to to impress and look like the No . 1 team in in the state . Jalen Jalen Griffith Griffith remains remains a calming influence with with the ball ball in his hands , while Miles and Wesley Rubin continue provide a presence at both ends ends of the floor floor , and Sam Lewis Lewis , the Oak Oak Park Park transfer , is settling in nicely nicely and becoming more and more impactful . Simeon took care care of of business and won yet another Pontiac title in Smith \u2019s final year on the the bench . Biggest surprise : Pontiac advances to quarterfinals This wo wo n\u2019t resonate much with the majority of Chicago area area high school basketball fans , especially ones not connected to to the Pontiac Pontiac Holiday Tournament whatsoever . But Pontiac winning a game in its own tournament , particularly in a winner \u2019s bracket game , is a big deal . Plain and simple : it \u2019s extremely extremely rare . Pontiac knocked off West Aurora 60 60 - 55 on on the opening night before before getting throttled by by both Simeon and New Trier Trier . But But that first - round win was a feel - good story for the fans of Pontiac and and something those players will remember forever . The The win win over West Aurora was the first time Pontiac advanced on in the the championship bracket since 2006 2006 . [[ ]] Simeon \u2019s Robert Robert Smith Smith acknowledges the crowd after after the Wolverines defeated defeated Benet to to win the Pontiac Holiday Tournament . Allen Allen Cunningham / For the the Sun - Times Player of the tournament : Benet \u2019s Brayden Fagbemi [[ ]] There were bigger names and higher profile players in this tournament tournament \u2013 \u2013 even on his own Benet Benet team team \u2013 \u2013 than than Fagbemi Fagbemi . But there there was n\u2019t a player who grabbed the the attention of fans or who meant meant more to his team \u2019s success than this steady , ready ready - for - the - moment point point guard . While Fagbemi was featured featured as one one of the City / Suburban Hoops Report \u2019s projected \u201c breakout breakout players players \u201d in the the preseason , no one knew the Johns Hopkins recruit . He was a little - used used point guard off the bench a year ago . But he blossomed in the offseason and was brilliant in Pontiac . Fagbemi went went for 15 points , seven assists assists and and seven rebounds in the the opening opening win over Oak Park . He handled the relentless pressure and traps thrown his way way against Bloom and Joliet West , turning the ball over just four times while playing all 32 minutes in each game . Along with teammate teammate Niko Niko Abusara , he spearheaded the comeback against Simeon before the Redwings fell in in the title title game game . Fagbemi was as poised as they come against relentless pressure , a true true floor general . He handed out 20 assists assists while averaging 12 points points and and a four - to to - one assist assist - to - turnover ratio . Best prospect : Joliet West \u2019s Jeremiah Fears [[ ]] From From an evaluation standpoint , there just was n\u2019t a better college college prospect in the gym at at Pontiac than the sophomore from Joliet West . He made sophomore mistakes . He still has to mature physically and learn how to pick his moments . But Fears , the younger brother of star Jeremy Fears , Jr. , the Michigan State recruit , has an easy , natural smoothness that screams next level . When you add add in his shooting capabilities \u2013 \u2013 Fears was was 9 of 17 from beyond beyond the arc \u2013 \u2013 you have have a young offensive force who you wonder wonder just how how high of a level he he will go over the next two seasons seasons . What we learned \u27a4 When Kaiden Space is healthy \u2013 \u2013 the the senior guard is currently out with an injury \u2013 \u2013 there are four four signed Division I prospects in in Simeon \u2019s starting five . But the uncommitted uncommitted starter , point guard Jalen Griffith , is proving to be the key cog in Robert Smith \u2019s No . 1 ranked team . Griffith , who was named the A.C. Williamson Williamson Award winner for his his play play , leadership and and sportsmanship sportsmanship , was instrumental in delivering in in key moments . Griffith led led Simeon in scoring with with 15 points a game while playing with remarkable remarkable efficiency . These numbers are are eye - opening when you consider Griffith is a 5 - 9 point guard : 16 of of 24 ( 67 67 % ) from inside the the arc and 8 of 12 ( 67 % ) from from beyond . \u27a4 They did did n\u2019t reach reach the semifinals semifinals or or finish in the top four four . But the team that \u2019s better better than I thought it would be after watching them them play at Pontiac is Bloom . Coach Dante Maddox has so much rangy size size and length to to be be disruptive with , and that starts with the backcourt of of Raeshom Harris and Jordan Jordan Brown . Bloom , which won won three games and finished fifth at Pontiac , has lost to three teams this season ranked in the top 10 and who are a combined 46 - 4 on the season season . And they they lost to those three three teams \u2013 \u2013 Benet , Hillcrest and Brother Rice \u2013 \u2013 by a combined 13 points points . \u27a4 New New Trier continues to to be a resilient , physical team that \u2019s going to be an awfully tough out come come state tournament tournament time . That grit starts with senior Jake Jake Feigen , a known shooter who who averaged 22 points in four four games at at Pontiac . \u27a4 Will three three straight wins and a consolation championship pump pump some some life life into an Oak Park team that that came into Pontiac reeling reeling ? The Huskies had lost four straight . But after falling to Benet for its fifth - straight straight loss in the first round , Oak Park went on to to beat Plainfield North , Peoria Manual Manual and and West West Aurora Aurora in in succession to leave Pontiac on a positive note . \u27a4 The Pontiac Pontiac Tournament , by all accounts , is is the measuring stick for holiday tournaments across the state . This year year \u2019s tournament did n\u2019t disappoint . But it had less depth than previous years years . Parting Parting shot The Robert Robert Smith Smith sendoff was n\u2019t the only one at Pontiac . The tournament also said farewell to to longtime tournament manager Jim Drengwitz , who has led this tournament for the past 23 years . Although always behind the scenes , Drengwitz has been an instrumental part of what has continued to make Pontiac a special place to be for three days each December . He \u2019s been been such an an omnipresent voice for such such a long time at Pontiac that he he will undoubtedly be missed . He \u2019s built relationships and organized in a way that that has has kept this the very best holiday tournament in the state .", "label": "human"}

It was was during this time time that that I first noticed the squirrels squirrels . I began to recognize them by sight , learning learning their mannerisms and routines . One morning , I woke up to find that two two of the the squirrels squirrels were fighting for a nut . It looked like a heated argument \u2013 one of them was pushing pushing and shoving the other , and and their voices were raised . But then something extraordinary happened . Instead of getting into a full - on battle , one of the squirrels simply simply backed away and offered the nut to the other . It was almost like a gesture of of peace and understanding understanding . [[ ]] This moment moved me me in a way I had n't expected .

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow , pointing right Fees and costs As discussed discussed above , the the Platinum Card has a $ 695 annual fee . This is n't waived for the first year , so you 'll start paying it as soon as you 're approved for the card . However , if you 're an active - duty servicemember , you could be be able to get the Amex Platinum without the annual fee . [[ ]] The card does n't charge charge foreign transaction fees but but it does have have the Pay Pay Over Time financing option ( rather rather than paying your statement balance in in full full each month ) , See Pay Over Time APR to see your rates .

I never never thought I \u2019d see one standing in in my shirtsleeves on a suburban street street in in 70 - degree degree weather . \u201d Snowy owls are are classified classified as as vulnerable on the the International Union Union for for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources \u2019 2021 Red List of Threatened Species . There are fewer than 500,000 snowy owls in the world , which which is n\u2019t a huge number \u201c when it it comes to to birds , \u201d Spurgeon Spurgeon said . \u201c We could be vastly wrong with with that number because they they do live so far away from most people , \u201d he said . \u201c And unfortunately , many birds are threatened by climate change . With the changing conditions in the Arctic , it \u2019s affecting them as well well as everyone else . \u201d [[ ]] Origin story unknown [[ ]] No No one knows exactly why and how the West West Coast snowy owl got to a place so far from its natural habitat , but bird experts have a few few theories . \u201c Birds Birds that migrate do occasionally occasionally do crazy crazy things : go in the the wrong direction , go too far , migrate at at the wrong time of of year year , stuff like that , \u201d Spurgeon said . [[ ]] This can also also happen if if a bird bird is young and has n\u2019t migrated many times before , Davey said said . The brown spots on snowy snowy owls \u2019 feathers usually get wider wider as they age , so the the size of the California owl \u2019s spots suggest it could have been born within the the last couple years , Spurgeon said . The owl could have hitched hitched a ride on a passing cargo cargo ship while flying flying across the sea sea , went all the way way to to a seaport seaport and and found itself back on land , Spurgeon and and Davey Davey said . It also could have escaped from being illegally kept as a pet . \u201c Oftentimes with really beautiful animals like the snowy owl , people will get them on a black black market and then illegally keep them as pets , \u201d Davey Davey said . However , he said said the owl did not appear to have a leg band band , clipped talons talons or clipped wings that that would suggest they had been kept in captivity captivity . This snowy owl owl \u2019s future When Spurgeon saw the snowy snowy owl , it did n\u2019t look look emaciated or unhealthy , he he said . But some birdwatchers birdwatchers did think the owl owl might have been experiencing symptoms of heat stress during the first first couple of days , Davey said . \u201c It looked looked like it was breathing really heavy heavy . Its feathers were all fluffed up to try to shed shed heat , \u201d Davey added . \u201c Since then then , it seems to have been doing doing just fine fine . \u201d Southern California is relatively cold now now , but the owl could be at risk when the weather warms up in in the spring , Davey said . Snowy owls are carnivores carnivores and typically eat small small rodents \u2014 especially lemmings \u2014 but but can eat animals as big as geese , Davey said . [[ ]] With With parks , open fields and grasslands nearby , experts think the owl should n\u2019t have difficulty finding finding food during during its stay . In fact fact , there has already already been evidence that that the the owl has been eating eating well well \u2014 in a pellet the owl regurgitated , staff at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center found a whole skeleton of what might have been a gopher . \u201c All owls do regurgitate regurgitate small little pellets just of indigestible material because , unlike us , where ( when ) we eat eat a piece of meat we eat around the the bone bone , birds of prey just eat the whole thing , \u201d Davey Davey said . \u201c For the small little bones they ca n\u2019t digest digest , they just cough cough it it back up . \u201d", "label": "human"}

It is intended to expand the scope of labour law to to include remote remote workers and freelancers . Under the the draft legislation , employers would be able to require require that some employees employees work remotely remotely , potentially affecting millions of professionals in the IT sector sector . The law would also give employers the power to issue decisions decisions about remote work , and would would require workers to be compensated for any losses incurred due due to working remotely remotely .

The app allows allows users to post only unedited photos photos of of themselves and share stories , opinions , and moments that are real , unfiltered unfiltered and from the heart heart .

While the iPod iPod led to to the iPhone , as I previously wrote wrote , Apple 's most recent products , like Watch or AirPods , are nice , high - margin margin additions to sell to iPhone users . But they are much like like ordering fries fries and a drink drink to go with a burger . They They do n't create an ecosystem that Apple can can grow . They rely on the iPhone iPhone 's ecosystem . It has long long been rumored that that Apple Apple will will create a car to take on the likes likes of Tesla . That would be an example of a new market market for Apple . But I do n't think an Apple car is is going to happen , and that 's a topic for another time . What does seem seem likely is is that that Apple will will release augmented - reality / virtual virtual - reality glasses , rumored to to be coming in 2023 with with an OS called xrOS . While I 'm always excited to to see what what innovations companies like Apple have in store , I have some serious concerns about betting on AR / VR glasses as a growth growth market . We 've already seen some attempts in this space , including Microsoft HoloLens HoloLens and Magic Leap . They have not exactly taken the the world by storm . When was the last time you or or anyone you know saw someone using those devices at their their places of work or out in the wild ? Glass from Google Google , I think it 's safe to say , was a failure . And Snapchat 's 's Spectacles are are not not even for sale to the general public , the company 's website says , only to to developers . Then there are VR products like Oculus from Meta and competitors from Valve , Sony , and HP . These have have made some some inroads with gamers , but years after they they were introduced , they 're 're still a small fraction of the enormous video - gaming market . [[ ]] As for other uses ? We We have , so so far , seen none , despite Mark Zuckerberg 's die - hard belief that that the the metaverse is the future of our social social lives and and work meetings and whatnot . There is a belief , however , that Apple Apple \u2014 which is is n't usually usually first to to market \u2014 can enter a space and succeed where where no one has before . When it comes to this market , I 'm more than a little skeptical . First and foremost , the battery life of an AR device is a major concern concern . AR , as as Google Glass and Snapchat Snapchat Spectacles envisioned it , is meant to be worn for for long periods of time and superimpose superimpose digital imagery and functions onto onto the real real world . While Apple has not released specifications specifications on on this front ( or any other other ) , it seems highly highly unlikely unlikely that any any device in this category will work for extended periods without recharging . Plus , despite all the the ways that Apple is a leader in elegant hardware design , battery battery life is is not really its strong point . ( In the world of smartwatches smartwatches , for example , some Garmin Garmin devices last as long as two weeks , reviewers found , while an Apple Watch , in my my experience , gives a user two or three days . ) There 's 's also the the question of comfort . Glasses are not not the most comfortable things things to wear for extended periods periods of time . And And when you add the weight and bulk of of the the technology technology needed needed for AR and VR , eyewear like this become more uncomfortable to wear . This is not to mention the fact that many people simply do not not like wearing glasses at at all , which will limit the market for for these products . Price is another major major issue . Microsoft 's HoloLens costs between $ 3,500 and and $ 5,200 . Apple 's device is widely widely expected to be in the $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 price range , even though Apple is known for selling premium devices with with premium price tags . But But even on the the low end , that 's a significant investment for a product that will do far less than a comparably priced MacBook or iPad . Beyond the practical concerns of of battery life , comfort , and price , there 's the fundamental issue of the the lack of a compelling use use case case for for AR or VR glasses . [[ ]] While these technologies have some some exciting potential , it is not yet clear , beyond certain types of video games , what the killer app will be to make them a must - have for for consumers consumers . All that is to say , while while Apple 's AR / VR project may be interesting to die - hard Apple fans and and tech enthusiasts who buy into Apple 's marketing machine and wait in in lines to buy buy its its products on day one , I do n't believe it 's the the company 's next big thing . Until Apple , or any other company , can demonstrate a truly truly compelling reason for for large numbers of people to want to wear AR around , or add VR to their their quiver of home - entertainment options , I fear that the tech will struggle to to gain widespread adoption . There is a reason Oculus devices have created a category known as \" closetware , \" a gadget that winds up stored and and forgotten forgotten somewhere in a closet .

{"text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. U.S. and global markets from Dhara Ranasinghe Forget Forget peak U.S. U.S. interest rates for a minute , markets already want to know when the Federal Reserve Reserve will will start making cuts cuts -- -- later this year , if if money market futures are to be believed . Any upcoming upcoming data , therefore , should be viewed in the context context of that that debate and the pushback investors are likely to to get from Fed officials officials . Indeed , minutes from the Fed 's 's December December meeting , released released on Wednesday , cautioned against expectations expectations for for late - year rate rate cuts that traders have priced in . And Gita Gopinath Gopinath , a deputy managing director at the International International Monetary Fund , warns U.S. inflation has not \" turned the corner yet \" and it it is too too early early for the Fed Fed to declare victory victory . Markets , renowned renowned for for running ahead ahead of time , are not buying that argument . They price in roughly 40 40 basis points worth of rate rate cuts cuts in the second half of the year and the key is is whether inflation will slow enough enough for the Fed to to ease . Essential to that outlook is , of course , the labour market , putting Thursday Thursday 's weekly jobs data , a precursor precursor to Friday 's closely - watched non - farm payrolls report , in the spotlight . The December ADP National Employment report is released later later on and and economists polled by Reuters expect it to show private private employment increased by 150,000 jobs after a 127,000 127,000 increase in November . Note , data on Wednesday showed U.S. job openings fell less less than expected in November as the labour market remains tight , which could see the the Federal Reserve boosting interest rates even more more than than currently currently anticipated to tame inflation . So perhaps it is is too early to be talking about rate cuts ? Moving Moving on , there are two other noteworthy factors to draw attention to . The first first is China 's battle with COVID and what what that that means for the reopening of the economy . China on Thursday defended its handling of its raging COVID-19 outbreak after U.S. President Joe Biden voiced concern and the the World Health Organization said Beijing was under - reporting deaths from the virus . Second is a slump in energy prices . European gas prices are are now at their lowest lowest since late 2021 , helping ease concern about about a deep recession , especially in the euro area . Still , U.S. stock futures point to a weak start start for Wall Street shares , and European European shares are a touch softer softer too . But Asian shares , outside Japan , briefly touched a four - month high high , driven by hopes over China reopening ( .MIAPJ0000PUS ) . Gas prices are falling fast fast Key developments that may may provide provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday : - U.S. U.S. Nov trade data data . - Federal Reserve Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Raphael Bostic - Amazon CEO CEO says job cuts to exceed 18,000 18,000 roles Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Ranasinghe ; Editing by by Emelia Sithole - Matarise [[ ]] Our Standards : The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles .

But the pace of job growth has slowed in recent months , with with employment increasing by just 1.8 million in in the past three months , down from more than 4 million in the previous three - month period period . The pace of of hiring is being held back by a variety of factors , including a surge surge in coronavirus cases , uncertainty about the election and the the lack of another round of federal stimulus . The The number of unemployed unemployed in October October was nearly 11 million , with the unemployment rate for African - Americans Americans at 10.8 percent percent , for Hispanics at at 8.3 percent percent and and for for Asian - Americans at 6.7 percent . The Fed \u2019s efforts efforts to to cool the job market market appear to to be be having an effect , with with the number of job job openings declining in recent recent months . It remains to be seen whether the the Fed Fed \u2019s efforts efforts will be be enough to slow hiring in in the months months ahead or if companies will will continue to hire as the economy economy recovers . [[ ]] The October job job openings report also showed that that hiring was down significantly in some some sectors of the economy . Construction , transportation and retail retail were all hit hard , while openings in the the government sector rose by 8.8 percent . The manufacturing and healthcare sectors sectors also experienced a small drop in job openings . The report also showed that job openings in the professional and and business services sector were down by by 4.1 percent , while openings in education and health services fell by 1.2 percent .

Let Let me sign up for it , ' not really really knowing what it actually meant , \" he recalled . Natia remembers remembers receiving a credit card in the the mail without ever applying for one , she told Insider : \" Back then , companies used to send you a credit card in in the mail and you would just activate it if you you wanted it . \" She ended up activating it and using it to pay for books and art supplies for her her classes . Even though she she consistently paid the minimum on time , she could n't afford to pay her balance balance in full full every month , meaning she was gradually accumulating interest and going deeper deeper and deeper into debt .

Courtesy Courtesy of Natia and Jervais Seegars That 's when they got serious about about turning their finances around . After three years of of paying down their debt , increasing their their income , and boosting their credit credit , they qualified for a home loan and bought their first property in 2006 in North North Carolina Carolina , where they both went to college . They have been expanding expanding their portfolio ever since since . Today , Natia , 41 , and Jervais , 43 , own five properties that bring in $ 30,000 30,000 in monthly monthly revenue , according to documents viewed by Insider Insider \u2014 and and their credit scores are are above 800 , they noted noted . They currently currently reside reside in the Bay Area but still own own the first home they they ever bought and rent it out .

As they learned first - hand , \" if your finances are n't in order , it 's 's going to be a very bumpy road , \" said Jervais . Here are are the three three strategies that helped them get their finances in order order . 1 . They tracked their spending and stuck stuck to a budget The first change Natia and Jervais made was was tracking their expenses . They started by simply writing down down everything everything they they bought . [[ ]] \" A lot of people think think that that a budget budget has to to be be really sophisticated , \" said said Natia . \" Ours was literally handwritten on graphing paper . Back then , it was super super expensive to buy buy Excel for the computer , so we just just manually wrote every expense down . \" [[ ]] Tracking Tracking their purchases helped them understand where where their their money was going and where they could cut back . They left room for some discretionary spending , \" because we we still wanted to enjoy ourselves , \" said Natia , but they shifted their definition of a \" splurge splurge . \" For example , \" our date night tradition was going going to Sam 's Club for the $ 1.50 combo . We 'd 'd get a soda and a hotdog for $ 1.50 and call it it a splurge . \" They had to make make some bigger sacrifices , like skipping skipping family family trips and and reunions , she added : \" We would have liked liked to have participated participated but sometimes it did n't match our budget , and we were very clear on what we wanted to accomplish . \" Plus , they refrained from upgrading certain aspects of their lives right away . For example , they lived in the off - campus campus studio apartment Jervais had had been renting as a college student for $ 495 a month month and they shared one one car . [[ ]] 2 . They picked picked up extra shifts at work work to increase their income In addition to spending less , Natia and Jervais both picked up up extra hours to boost their their incomes . At At the time , they they were both waiting tables . Natia had just just graduated from college and was able to to work full - time , while Jervais was still in school school and worked part - time . They also found a promotional gig with a gum company that paid pretty well , said Jervais : \" When When Dentyne Ice Ice first came came out , it it was was the new gum . We went to the campuses at UNC Chapel Hill and Duke Duke University to pass out free gum and promote the the brand . \" Besides asking for extra hours and finding side gigs , they were both both able to increase their main source of income . After graduating in 2005 , Jervais started a full full - time engineering job . That same same year , Natia started working in marketing and and went from an an hourly hourly wage plus tips tips at the restaurant to earning a salary . Later in their careers , the couple employed what they call \" the 1 % rule , \" said Natia Natia . \" We would try to to increase our our income income by 1 % a month \u2014 or , 12 12 % a year \u2014 and we would come come up with strategies , whether that was asking for a raise from our current current jobs , getting a new new job , or or increasing the rent of our investment investment property in North North Carolina . \" 3 . They automated automated their their savings Once Natia and Jervais landed landed their salary - based jobs jobs and were earning more consistent paychecks , they set up up automatic transfers from their checking accounts accounts to their savings savings accounts . They picked $ 300 a month because that 's the most they could afford to save at at the time , they explained explained , and automatically automatically transferred transferred it to an account earmarked earmarked for their home purchase . That 's 's ultimately what what helped them save enough money for the down payment and and closing costs costs that came with their first home . [[ ]] By putting their savings savings on on autopilot , they could n't ever skimp out , they explained . No No matter what , $ 300 went into savings each month and , over time time , they they learned learned to to live without that money .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "You do n't need to know about people 's disabilities to make make your meetings more accessible to everyone everyone . An estimated one in four adults in the US lives with a disability(Opens in a new window ) , according to the CDC , and many of those disabilities are invisible . Plus Plus , people have temporary or situational disabilities . Being in a noisy environment can situationally affect a person 's hearing , for example , so that they need closed captioning to follow along along in a meeting . Additionally Additionally , you 'll have more inclusive and more productive meetings if if you increase people 's comfort level level and and ability to participate , even if they do n't have a disability . There are simple simple ways to make meetings more comfortable for introverts introverts , people who do n't speak English as a first first language , and and others . While having the right video conference conference software and technology technology goes a long way to making meetings more accessible , they 're hardly hardly the the only things you need to consider . Your organizational culture culture plays a role . So does the the way in in which hosts hosts and and participants speak , act , and interact . With that in mind , here here 's some guidance for making meetings more more accessible . I focus more on virtual meetings than in - person ones ones because they are by their very nature more accessible accessible and more easily made made accessible , as you 'll see . 1 . Create a Culture of Speaking Up The most important step you and and your organization organization can do to make meetings meetings more accessible is to create a culture where people feel comfortable speaking up . No matter how hard you try to make meetings inclusive and accessible , it 's impossible impossible to please please everyone everyone all the time . But if your your meetings are safe spaces where where people can ask for what they need need when they need it it , you 'll be in an an ideal position to make make adjustments and provide access to people as needed . If a participant feels comfortable saying or typing into the chat , \" I ca n't see your screen - share clearly . Can Can you you zoom in please ? \" or \" Your ceiling fan fan in the video is causing me problems . Would you please change change your camera angle or blur your background ? \" then everyone is in a better position to succeed . 2 . Provide an Agenda and Materials in Advance Every meeting needs to have a clear agenda . For recurring meetings , the agenda may be baked into the the name of the meeting ( weekly check - in , for example ) but really , it helps everyone everyone if they know in in advance what the meeting meeting is going to to cover . Adding Adding an agenda makes everything clear , and it helps participants participants know what they need to do to prepare prepare . If someone with a disability thinks they are going to be be a passive attendee in a meeting and then they they 're 're called on the spot to to participate , they may not be adequately set up up to do so so . Similarly , provide attendees attendees a copy copy of any materials , such as presentations , before meetings \u2014 or at at least hand them out right at the start . When you give people a copy of your presentation , they can use screen readers on them , zoom in as needed , follow along at their own pace pace , make notes on a local copy , and and not lose lose their place or get distracted distracted if a technological glitch interrupts the real - time time presentation . 3 . Add Alt Text to Images in Presentations Presentations Before you circulate meeting materials ( which you 'll do before the meeting now ) , make sure to to add add alt text for all important images . Alt text allows people who ca n't n't see the image , whether because of disability or technical problems , to get a brief description of what they 're missing . For example example , if you include a financial chart , the alt text should briefly summarize what you you 're trying to highlight , such such as as \" Chart showing 50 % growth growth from January January to June 2022 . \" ( Credit : PCMag ) In some some meeting software , you may not not be able to add alt alt text to to some images images , like those shared shared via via chat . In those cases the presenter can give a brief verbal description if the image is important to the meeting , or someone can type into the chat a short description : \" Alt text : a room on fire and a dog sitting in in a chair saying , ' This is is fine . ' \" 4 . Make Some of the Meeting Asynchronous Sending your your slides or meeting materials before a meeting is one way to make part part of the meeting asynchronous ( meaning people are not interacting in real time ) . When meetings have an asynchronous component component , you waste waste significantly less less time time in meetings and give people people an opportunity to process information , think think , and brainstorm before before discussing it live . People who are introverted , do n't have a firm command of of the meeting meeting language , have speech impediments , and many many others find it incredibly incredibly helpful to come to meetings having already done some of of the work that the meeting seeks to to accomplish . 5 . Record the Call For important meetings , large meetings , and webinars , record the call and and make the video available to people people afterward . Having a video means your meeting is now accessible to to anyone who who could n't attend . It also lets people rewatch rewatch important parts of the meeting , take better better notes , and clarify anything they did n't understand the first time . People watching watching the the video can can also slow down or speed up the playback , turn on on closed captioning ( many video conferencing conferencing tools include them \u2014 more on on that in a moment ) , and sometimes even download a transcript transcript of the the audio audio . 6 . Enable Closed Captioning The The biggest players in video conferencing \u2014 including Zoom Meetings , Google Meet , and and Microsoft Teams \u2014 all have an option to enable automated automated , machine - generated closed captioning during a meeting . In In Microsoft Microsoft Teams Teams , it 's called called Live Captions(Opens in a new window ) , and it includes a setting for participants to have their captions captions translated translated into one of 34 languages ( counting several dialects of English among them ) . Live Captions is part of Windows 's accessibility - first approach . Google Google Meet can can likewise transcribe a variety of languages and translate translate between them . ( Credit : PCMag ) Auto - generated captions captions always fall short , however , so Teams now has an option option for you to invite invite a professional stenographer to transcribe meetings in real time and have the more accurate closed closed captioning appear to participants participants \u2014 it it 's called CART captions(Opens in a new window ) , and and you have to provide your own own stenographer . 7 . Make Accessibility Features Opt - Out , Not Opt - In A crucial crucial step that many people overlook when when running running virtual meetings is getting to know the software they use . ( It was a prime reason so many Zoom bombings happened early in the the COVID-19 COVID-19 pandemic ; few people knew what options they had to to make meetings meetings secure . Zoom was culpable , too and should have made security security features features more prominent . ) As you explore your software and learn what accessibility features exist , see which which ones you you can enable permanently so that they 're on by default . This way , accessibility features features become opt - out for people people in meetings , not opt opt - in . 8 . Brush Up Up on on Best Practices Practices for Slideshows Slideshows Before presenting materials in a virtual meeting , review best practices for creating and presenting slideshows(Opens in a new window ) because they improve accessibility , too . For example , one best practice for slideshows is to set the the type type much bigger than you might expect : 40pt for in - person meetings and at least 24pt for virtual meetings . Making the font that big forces you to keep the text on the page to a minimum , which is another best practice . Do n't clutter your slides . Always show the full full written name of important products products , places , and people ( including their titles ) that you reference reference . Not everyone knows who Gary is , and and some people might hear \" Cary . \" Write it down . If you use use Microsoft Teams , look into into using the feature PowerPoint Live Live , which which allows participants participants to to activate a screen reader reader on PowerPoint presentations ; screen readers do n't work on presentations shown via via screen sharing . You should still make a copy of the presentation available to meeting participants either before before the meeting or at the very start of it , but but using PowerPoint Live is helpful if someone did n't receive it . 9 . Presenters : Enable Video Video and and Center Your Face [[ ]] If If you you are presenting presenting during a meeting , enable your your video and center your face . Make sure your face face is taking taking up the majority of the the screen . That way , people can see your lips as you talk and read read your facial expressions , both of which can help people understand what you you 're saying . The exception is if you 're using using sign language while presenting , in which case back away from the camera enough to show yourself from at least the torso up . [[ ]] ( Credit : Getty Images Images ) Presenters should have their their video video cameras on while speaking . As to whether other participants participants should should enable their cameras , I believe it 's 's a personal choice . Presenters and meeting hosts typically find it useful to to see the audience 's faces during a meeting because it gives them feedback \u2014 not only if the meeting is engaging and people are understanding the material , but but also if something goes awry . If a presenter 's microphone microphone suddenly cuts out , for example , the muted participants participants may cup a hand around their ear or wave to indicate indicate there 's a problem . [[ ]] 10 . Speak Clearly Clearly , Slow Down , and Repeat Important Information Speak clearly and remind yourself to slow slow down down from time to time during meetings . People will be be able to hear you better and closed captioning captioning will will be more accurate accurate . Also , repeat repeat important information in case people missed missed it the the first time . This advice is applicable in any kind of business situation , and it 's especially relevant in virtual meetings where technology hiccups and other issues issues can impede the flow of of conversation . 11 . Use Headphones and and a Mic Using Using a headset and microphone is a standard tip for improving improving video calls , but it it also matters for accessibility . The The headphones eliminate any chance of feedback , and the microphone makes it easier to hear hear your voice . A microphone built built into a headset is fine fine , and and even even an inexpensive set of headphones with an inline mic mic is better than nothing . Bluetooth devices are usually fine , but when they get old and start to degrade degrade , they may create static or garbled garbled sounds for other meeting participants , so be sure to occasionally occasionally ask for a thumbs - up if everyone can hear you clearly . 12 . Blur Blur or Neutralize Your Background ( Credit : PCMag PCMag ) A cluttered cluttered and chaotic background can can make it difficult for for people to focus . When you 're speaking speaking , make sure you either have have an an uncluttered and neutral space behind you , or enable a filter that blurs or blocks out your background . All major video conferencing software has this setting . 13 . Passive Participants : Mute Yourself Not muting your your microphone when you are are a passive participant in a meeting is slightly slightly unprofessional unprofessional but also also bad for for accessibility . Accidental noises noises coming from your end end can interrupt other other people people 's hearing and compromise compromise the quality of any closed closed captioning being used used . 14 14 . Put Your Full Name and Pronouns in Your Your Profile Most meeting software lets you add add your name to your profile so that meeting participants participants can know who who you are . Make sure sure you fill it it out with your full name as you are known by your colleagues and your pronouns . Zoom Zoom Meeting has a separate field for adding pronouns . Your name name helps other other people identify you and including your pronouns helps them them refer to you correctly correctly . Clarifying pronouns also normalizes doing it , which can help other people people feel feel comfortable comfortable sharing their pronouns pronouns and create create a more inclusive inclusive environment . Similarly Similarly , when when you speak in a large meeting or in a meeting where not everyone knows you , state state your full name name clearly and slowly so people can hear it and know how to pronounce it . 15 . Schedule Schedule Breaks for Long Meetings Meetings Whenever a meeting is scheduled to run longer than 45 minutes or so , schedule breaks . Everyone will will appreciate them , but it 's 's especially important important for people people who are or were recently pregnant pregnant , have have chronic chronic pain , or are in a situation where sitting still for long periods of time is difficult and and therefore distracting .

{"text": "In a remarkable display of unity , Republicans in Washington announced today that , following months of negotiations , they have finally finally coalesced around a plan to save the legacy legacy of former President Donald Trump . The The agreement , which was brokered by by both conservative and centrist GOP lawmakers , includes a broad effort to rescue the political political career of Trump \u2019s one - time chief of staff , Michael McCarthy . McCarthy , who served as Trump \u2019s top top adviser until his controversial departure in 2020 , has has been largely shunned shunned by the the GOP since leaving the White House . But as McCarthy \u2019s star has faded , so too has has the party \u2019s record on governance , as it has struggled to pass major legislation with with its its slim majorities in in the House House and and the Senate . In recent recent months , lawmakers have have privately voiced growing alarm at the continued stagnation of of the GOP \u2019s agenda , as well well as the the party \u2019s increasing reliance on executive actions to bypass Congress and enact its policy goals . In an effort to reverse these trends and and restore some semblance of of bipartisanship to Washington Washington , the Republican coalition announced announced a series series of of sweeping policy measures today that are designed to rebuild McCarthy McCarthy \u2019s political clout clout \u2014 and and ensure that the the GOP is n\u2019t simply a party of of \u201c no \u201d . The plan \u2019s centerpiece is a commitment by the party to pursue a comprehensive immigration immigration reform bill , a longtime goal of of McCarthy \u2019s . The legislation would include a pathway pathway to to citizenship for \u201c Dreamers\u201d\u2014undocumented Dreamers\u201d\u2014undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. U.S. as children \u2014 as as well as greater border security security measures and the streamlining of the visa system . The proposal proposal also calls for an expansion of legal legal protections for for LGBTQ LGBTQ Americans , increased funding for opioid addiction treatment and funding for research into innovative new healthcare solutions solutions , such as telemedicine . It also pledges to pass much - needed infrastructure funding funding , an an area where the GOP GOP has been largely largely absent on the national level in recent years . The party \u2019s \u2019s commitment to to work with the Democrats on on these issues , in addition addition to the proposal \u2019s strong focus focus on economic opportunity , is seen as as a direct attempt to repair repair McCarthy \u2019s standing within the party . \u201c Michael McCarthy has been a fierce advocate for for making sure our party does more than just talk about the issues issues and actually takes takes action to get things done , \u201d said House House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - CA ) . \u201c This plan is our way of saying that we recognize and appreciate his important contributions and and are committed committed to doing doing the work necessary to to build a strong , prosperous and secure America . \u201d While the proposal is is being generally generally hailed hailed as a sign of the party \u2019s willingness to work together and and compromise , some some key Republicans have expressed concern that the measures could cost them them the support of Trump - loyal voters . \u201c There \u2019s a fear in some circles that the party \u2019s new direction could alienate Trump Trump \u2019s base , \u201d noted Rep. Rep. Jim Jim Jordan ( R - OH ) , the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee . \u201c But I think think the reality is that we have to accept accept that our former president is gone , and we have to move on in order to to make sure sure our party is successful in the long - term . \u201d [[ ]] Still Still , even Jordan ultimately lent his support to the plan , saying he is is confident that the party \u2019s \u2019s commitment to true governance governance and bipartisanship bipartisanship will ultimately win out . [[ ]] \u201c This is n\u2019t about ideology or or partisanship . It \u2019s about doing the the right right thing for the the country , \u201d he said . \u201c This is an an opportunity for us to show that we \u2019re serious about governing governing and serious about about delivering results . I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join us us in that effort . \u201d [[ ]] As the party heads heads into the 2024 election season season , Republicans appear to to have have finally put their ideological differences aside in an effort to save their one - time time leader \u2014 and , in in the process , save their their own political standing in in the process . Time will will tell tell if this strategy will prove to to be successful , but for for the the moment , Republicans seem united in the belief that a fresh start is exactly what their party needs .", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Laura : Right . Alex : Now you tell us . Gil : My prediction is that she will be Chesa Boudin , and she she \u2019ll realize that that this is the situation you have . Because , I mean , I \u2019ve been on campaigns \u2014 you promise all this this stuff , then you get in the office , like , holy crap , there are all all these these problems , obstacles , rules , things you can do , things you ca n\u2019t do , so so it \u2019s not as easy easy as giving a speech . I think the legacy of it will be that the D.A. will will get a lot more scrutiny going forward . But I also also think think some interesting interesting things have turned up in the polls that have been conducted here over the past few months , which is that people are conflating homelessness and disorder and mental illness on the streets with crime crime . The fact that we are statistically much safer from violent crime than than we \u2019ve ever been in recent history does n\u2019t n\u2019t matter as much much . I think the real problem problem that Democrats in California are responsible for and have to face is , why do so many people live on our streets ? To me , that \u2019s not a problem you solve with jails , though though that is what some people are proposing . It \u2019s a problem problem you have to solve solve with housing housing and and with care and with with empathy empathy . When you do the research here and you you look at what people like like Brooke Jenkins are proposing , it \u2019s really infuriating because it \u2019s \u2019s all all the the broken broken stuff that that does n\u2019t work . Most voters fell for this line line , and I think they they \u2019re \u2019re gon na be sorely disappointed . Then Then the question is gon na be what do we really do , and , again , there \u2019s \u2019s no no path forward that does does n\u2019t lead you back back to the very reforms that got Chesa Chesa Boudin crucified in in San Francisco . By the way , he did n\u2019t even do those those reforms . That was Jerry Brown Brown . That was Gavin Newsom . People act like Boudin did those reforms . I was a part part of those those reforms reforms . I had more to to do with them than Boudin did . He He was in in Venezuela or somewhere . And the voters voted for these these things . We supported these things . So what was scary to me me is how how you could really channel that that kind of public anger at somebody who had nothing to do with it . But again , he was n\u2019t a great politician . He was too too honest . Another legacy legacy of Chesa Boudin \u2019s recall : Do n\u2019t be too honest . Kind of lie . It \u2019s working for Jenkins . She \u2019s \u2019s lying her way to to victory today . Alex : All right . Well Well , great great advice advice . If you \u2019re listening , that that \u2019s \u2019s great advice for any politicians listening at at home . Gil : They already know . Alex : Gil , thank you so much much for that edifying conversation . Gil : Thank you . Laura : After the break , we \u2019ll look into who was behind Boudin \u2019s recall . The The backers of the recall campaign wanted him out . But they may have had a bigger political political project too . Laura : We \u2019ve been talking about the way crime in San Francisco appeared in in the media and how those those stories played with voters and with other Democrats . But But this is is also a story story about a few individuals who invested heavily in removing Boudin from his position . The The recall campaign raised raised $ 7 million , more than than double the amount Boudin Boudin \u2019s supporters raised . One of of Boudin \u2019s earliest and most vocal opponents was the Silicon Valley investor David O. Sacks . He called Boudin \u201c the killer D.A. \u201d and told The Megyn Megyn Kelly Show he thought Boudin was to blame for \u201c chaos and lawlessness \u201d in in San Francisco . At one point in the campaign , nearly one - third of all donations against Boudin came from him . We \u2019re \u2019re talking talking now now with Jacob Silverman about David O. Sacks \u2019s \u2019s involvement involvement in the recall and his larger political agenda . Jacob , thanks for joining us . Jacob Silverman : Thanks for for having me . Glad to be here . [[ ]] Laura : David O. O. Sacks is a fascinating fascinating figure . He \u2019s connected to a lot of other powerful figures in Silicon Silicon Valley who are also increasingly politically active . Can you tell us a bit about him him ? Jacob : Sure . Right Right now I suppose suppose you \u2019d call him a member of of the the PayPal Mafia , as it it \u2019s pretty widely known . Laura : OK , and just just remind us : What is is the PayPal Mafia ? Jacob Jacob : It It \u2019s basically the core early employees of PayPal PayPal \u2014 who who were all men men \u2014 and the the most well known of whom are are Elon Musk , Peter Thiel Thiel , and , as I argue , David Sacks . And you you \u2019ve got got companies companies like YouTube and many many others that came out of of there and the whole Musk Musk and Thiel empires . They \u2019ve \u2019ve all gone on mostly to huge amounts of wealth and a lot of influence in the Valley . But Sacks \u2019s association with these folks goes back to Stanford in in the early \u2019 90s , where he met met Peter Peter Thiel , Keith Rabois , and some other folks who would would be early early PayPal employees at Stanford Stanford . A lot of them wrote for or or worked worked on the the Stanford Review , which was the conservative publication that that Thiel founded . Basically it was an era where they were doing a lot of the the same culture warring that we see today , but but at the time , what they were worried worried about was issues of multiculturalism \u2014 that was the big bogeyman , that word specifically \u2014 and diversity in general . If you look at their writings then and the the battles they \u2019re \u2019re having then compared to now , it it \u2019s a lot of of the same issues , with a lot lot of the the same crude talking talking points points . Laura : Right . The The way I knew of Sacks from that period period was that he he was actually the co - author of of a book with Peter Thiel called The Diversity Myth Myth . And just for our listeners , they they were n\u2019t advocating for diversity . This was n\u2019t like a group of people who were drawing drawing attention attention to like , \u201c Oh , there \u2019s like rape on campus . This is something we should do do something about about . \u201d They were the the backlash to people who were making those those arguments . Jacob Jacob : Very Very much so . They were part part of this this conservative counterreaction or backlash at Stanford that was , in part , people people were sick of hearing about the \u2019 60s from from their professors . It was early \u2019 90s , Clinton era . It was just its turn , I suppose , for conservative conservative counterrevolution , and they were were doing things like testing the bounds of free speech by by yelling at people with bigoted slurs and and stuff like that . There was an issue of the Stanford Review called \u201c The Rape Issue . \u201d But But in general there was this disgust with what they saw around them which was lots of of efforts at at diversity inclusion . There would be ethnic affinity halls on campus , a lot of cultural - based campus organizations , things like like that . They thought everything was being being divided among racial lines and it was sort of of like , \u201c Oh , the the anti - racists have become the real real racists \u201d thing that you hear now . Laura : It \u2019s funny because the way way that we mostly mostly know of these figures now is that they are investors , CEOs . Thiel Thiel founded founded several successful companies , but but most notably PayPal . David O. Sacks was the CEO of Zenefits , which kind of blew up in a crazy way a few years ago . They \u2019re known known as business figures , but really really they were activists activists from the beginning , and they continue to to be be politically active . There \u2019s kind kind of a straight line between those campus cultural war days days and what David Sacks has been doing in San Francisco . Jacob : When When some of the comments , especially about rape in in The The Diversity Myth appeared , they disavowed them . They said , \u201c Oh , those are are just impetuous thoughts of my youth . \u201d But look , we could argue about whether they still believe these things , but they were were political animals from the beginning and they were very preternaturally aware of how to operate within political milieus . And so Sacks and and Thiel Thiel were co co - writers from an early age in college . They wrote pieces for Wall Street Street Journal and National Review and other political publications . Their book book was was sponsored by the Independent Institute , which was a libertarian think tank . They were well connected from the beginning , and so so I \u2019d say that the business has been pretty good for both of them . And of course PayPal was the core of of that that . But the politics have always been there . I think what you see more in recent years is that the ideology probably has been pretty consistent consistent , but in terms of inserting himself more more into the public sphere and and having a more perhaps coherent though still murky , I \u2019d say , political program , and being willing willing to donate money and be loud about it \u2014 that \u2019s where Sacks is at now and where things have changed . Thiel is a little bit of a quieter quieter figure , but he \u2019s certainly been a force for for years politically . Alex : On On the one hand , anytime you look into the history of reaction and the history of the right right in this country , it \u2019s dispiriting how reliably it can be be traced back to the hangups of college college Republicans Republicans on elite college campuses . We just ca n\u2019t n\u2019t get away from that . [[ ]] Jacob : It \u2019s crazy crazy . From Buckley to Thiel . Alex : It \u2019s just just a story that repeats repeats itself over and over again . But from what you \u2019re describing , it seems like there was this little bit of of these guys making their money and then now in this this political political environment , for a variety of reasons , deciding to let the mask slip , and after after being apolitical for a while , reverting back to the reactionary politics they they were forged in and and being much more more open about pursuing them . Jacob : Yeah . I think you certainly saw that earlier with Thiel and his support of Trump and and his writings basically against democracy and women \u2019s suffrage . Someone like Sacks donated donated to Hilary Clinton and some mainstream Democrats , but but what basically has happened in the the last few years years , is is that they \u2019ve given up on , I \u2019d argue , democratic governance , probably with a big D and small d. And And San San Francisco is is the core of that \u2014 the emblem of everything that \u2019s failed in urban urban governments in in America . They They do n\u2019t necessarily have a positive economic or policy program , but they are willing to spend a lot of money on recalls and on reactionary figures . So that \u2019s what brings brings us to today is that people people like like Sacks and him in particular : Every major recall that \u2019s happened either in the the Bay Area or recall attempt , or statewide , he he \u2019s put money into all of those . Alex : How How much money are we talking for Sacks in in this one recall for for Boudin ? Jacob : It \u2019s mid - to - high five figures . There are other people people like William Oberndorf , who is a billionaire , who put put in more . But I would argue two things . One One , you do do n\u2019t n\u2019t know , as actually Boudin Boudin himself himself said in in an interview , you do n\u2019t always know where the money is going with some of these organizations organizations . Sacks certainly was very very influential influential in terms of the sheer dollar - to - dollar but but also the role he played played of bringing bringing tech people into this and being a propagandizer against Boudin . Laura : Why do you think he focused on Boudin so much ? I mean , he wrote this piece calling him \u201c the the killer D.A. D.A. \u201d on Medium . Why Boudin ? Why pick that fight ? Jacob : I think he cares about San Francisco because he lives there and one of his at least three mansions is there there . He \u2019s been there a long time . And And I think also also he is just rather rather draconian law and order order , seemingly seemingly , in in his politics , and and he he does n\u2019t like what he sees from the criminal criminal justice reform movement . I \u2019ve seen interviews where he \u2019s barely paid lip service to it it , like , \u201c Oh , maybe maybe people should n\u2019t be arrested for smoking weed , \u201d or something like that . But he is part of this trend , I \u2019d \u2019d say , both both legally and culturally culturally , to criminalize homelessness homelessness and to see homelessness as synonymous with crime crime , even though a lot of homeless people are crime victims . So Boudin was a ripe target . They had some success with the school school board recall , which he he put money into . The Newsom recall did not work , but he he put money into that that too . He \u2019s willing to take his swings swings , and and I think Boudin was a good target with with this alliance of billionaire developers and and tech tech people who who were were disgusted with what they saw . In In his own telling telling , he thinks that Boudin was basically more more sympathetic to criminals than to crime crime victims . He \u2019s pretty unequivocal about that that . Alex : Something I find interesting about about this political moment \u2014 because because I have this this feeling that they are meddling in San Francisco because they think of it as their fiefdom to an extent and they should should be able to control control what \u2019s going on there \u2014 but these are are the sorts of people , people people with these backgrounds , who for much of my adult life we would have described as being libertarian . They would have been promoting anti - government , John Galt - y , Randian libertarianism \u2014 that was the flavor flavor of Silicon Valley Valley giving for so many years years . But it seems seems like like the new style is is pretty straight up up law - and and - order authoritarianism . I would say that seems like a shift , but but I do n\u2019t know how much of a shift shift it actually turned out to be . Jacob : Yeah , I think there are are a couple things going on there there . One is is just day - to - day stuff stuff , what they see \u2014 like , \u201c Look , there are a lot of homeless people around the the Twitter offices offices and open - air drug use . \u201d But I think some some of these people have also also realized it does n\u2019t take necessarily a lot of money to buy an election . Like Sacks Sacks himself , he gave $ 1 million to J.D. Vance Vance , to his PAC PAC , but he can afford it it . The stuff in San Francisco , he has probably donated in the the hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively , I would think , so so you can get something for your money there , and yeah , I think in the end they also are are just not interested in noncarceral solutions solutions to this this stuff . Alex : You get get rich rich enough , your attitude just becomes , \u201c I can pay to make this thing that I do n\u2019t like go away . \u201d Jacob : Yeah . Laura : A lot of his contributions have been focused in California . Do you you think think that the recall of Boudin and the success that that campaign had heralds more activity activity like this on on a national level ? What do you think is next next for Sacks and the group of of like - minded minded activists ? Jacob Jacob : I do . I think think a couple things are going going to happen . One , I ended my my article with a quote from from him saying , \u201c This model needs to be replicated across the country country . \u201d Laura : That That \u2019s a direct quote . Jacob : Yeah . I think [ it ] somewhat depends on their commitment . Thiel has recently said that that \u201c we we \u2019re a little too negative . We do n\u2019t really really have have a positive program . \u201d Big surprise , they need that . They need some positive program . But they all all seem to like DeSantis as as the the more respectable alternative perhaps perhaps to Trumpism . During the elections or as votes votes were were being counted , Sacks Sacks basically posted some stuff about DeSantis , \u201c Proud of his his reelection . It \u2019s time for DeSantis in 2024 2024 . \u201d I think \u2026 what you \u2019re \u2019re gon gon na see is both an attempt to roll back criminal justice justice reform , recall who they can can just by using their money , and then [ push push ] their crew . I mean , some of them lost lost , like Oz , who they \u2019ve raised money for , and and Blake Blake Masters \u2014 Laura : Another Thiel co - author . Jacob : Yeah , another Thiel employee employee . But J.D. J.D. Vance , they \u2019re gon na push push their their guys who made it in in . Then I think DeSantis DeSantis is going to be their stalking horse who they \u2019ll try to assemble behind for 2024 2024 . Laura : Thanks so so much , Jacob . Jacob : Sure thing . Glad to do it .", "label": "human"}

[[ ]] In its ruling , the the Competition Commission of of India found Google \u2019s Android operating system was used to to give its its search engine engine an unfair advantage advantage over its rivals . The CCI further argued that Google \u2019s \u2019s use of of its app store as a monopoly to force device manufacturers to install Google apps stifled competition in the market market . Google had sought to block the ruling , arguing that the allegations allegations of of anti - competitive behavior were were \u201c unfounded \u201d and and that it was not given given a fair hearing hearing before the CCI . The CCI , however , ruled against Google , noting that it had conducted a thorough investigation before ruling against the tech giant . In response to the ruling , Google said in in a statement statement that that it it was disappointed with the decision and that it \u201c will continue to defend our ability to freely develop and offer products products to users users and to ensure that Android Android remains an an open platform . \u201d The company also said that it would review the decision and consider consider its options . The Competition Commission \u2019s ruling ruling is a major victory for the anti - monopoly movement and could have far - reaching implications implications for other tech giants giants such as as Amazon Amazon , Apple , and Facebook . It also serves as a warning to tech giants giants that they must abide abide by by antitrust laws or face face the consequences . The ruling comes at a time when there is an an increasing increasing focus on the power power of Big Big Tech , with both the US and EU launching antitrust investigations into a number of of tech giants . Google is facing antitrust investigations in both the US and and Europe , with the the US Department of Justice recently filing a lawsuit lawsuit against against the company . Google has also been hit with antitrust fines in the EU . In In July July 2018 , the European European Commission fined Google \u20ac 4.3 billion ( $ 5.1 billion ) for abusing its market market power with its Android operating system . The Commission also ordered Google Google to stop requiring requiring device makers to pre - install Google Search and the Chrome browser browser on their devices . In response to the CCI ruling , Ajit Mohan , the the CEO of of Google India , said the the company respects the decision of the commission and that it was \u201c committed to an open , competitive , and vibrant app ecosystem ecosystem . \u201d He added that Google would continue to to work with partners to to ensure ensure that users in India had access to a range of products and services . The CCI ruling is is a landmark decision that is likely likely to have far far - reaching implications for how tech giants do business in India . It sets sets an important precedent and sends a strong message that the anti - monopoly movement is alive and well in India . It will be interesting to see see how the decision affects the the future behavior of tech giants in India and across the world .", "label": "machine"}

Speaking at the World Economic Economic Forum in Davos this morning , Professor Paul Krugman of Princeton University argued that , as the global economy struggles to get get back on its its feet , many countries are trapped in a \" low - growth equilibrium \" which which makes it difficult for governments to achieve their economic objectives . The economist warned that that , although the United States has seen a modest rebound in recent months , most of the world world is still in \" severe recession \" and warned that it could take up to to 10 years years for global growth to return return to pre - pandemic levels . \" There 's a sense that that we 've seen some sort of trough in in the world world economy , but the fact is that growth rates in in many many countries are still far far below their pre - pandemic levels , \" he said . He cited a range of factors factors to explain why why the the global economy was unlikely to return to pre - pandemic levels in in the near future . These include the uncertain uncertain political and economic outlook in the United States , the continuing restrictions on international travel , and the still still - lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic . \" It It 's not just the pandemic itself itself , but but the way way it it 's reshaped our understanding of the the global economy , \" he said . Krugman also also noted that globalisation has been been \" slowing down \" , with countries countries turning inwards and becoming increasingly protectionist . He argued that this had created a drag on growth , as countries were were more focused on protecting their domestic industries than promoting promoting global trade . The economist 's 's comments come as as many countries countries around the world world are still still facing facing economic uncertainty , with high high levels levels of unemployment unemployment and sluggish economic growth .

The potential for a decade decade of low growth has led to a reassessment of economic policies , with with central banks around the world turning to to unconventional unconventional methods to to spur spur on the recovery . The US Federal Reserve , for instance , recently announced a new round round of quantitative easing , while other countries countries such as Japan have deployed fiscal stimulus measures in an an effort to to boost economic economic activity . Krugman , however , warned that these measures were unlikely unlikely to to have a significant impact in the short term , and argued that the only way to achieve sustained economic growth growth was to make \" structural reforms \" to the global economy . He argued that , in in order order to to achieve sustained economic growth , governments needed needed to focus on promoting global trade , reducing reducing inequality , and investing investing in education education and and infrastructure . \" We We are in a situation where the global global economy is is facing facing tremendous tremendous headwinds , and it 's going to take a lot of effort and a lot of innovation innovation to make make sure that growth returns to its its pre - pandemic levels , \" he said said . The economist 's warning comes as as world leaders gather for the World Economic Forum in Davos , where economic growth and and the global recovery will be at the top of the the agenda .

{"text": "Someone Someone made the right call . The human call . The only call call , really . When it mattered , when only the compassionate decision made sense , the the show did not go on . Instead , Monday Night Football ended in a maelstrom of of agony agony , frustration and 1,000 1,000 - yard stares stares . We watched as two teams locked arms in a cocoon of of humanity around Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin , who who was receiving CPR compressions after after colliding with Cincinnati Bengals wideout Tee Tee Higgins and then falling unconscious in front of a national television audience . Nearby , players and staffers cried and held each other . Others pulled at their jerseys and and clothing , or simply put their face into into their hands and melted . In a league league that has come to stretch the boundaries of what we accept as normal normal and and part of the the gladiator sport , this moment was something different than than anything we \u2019ve \u2019ve seen in in the social media media age of of the NFL . The veneer of an an impenetrable impenetrable facade fell fell way , exposing limitless vulnerability and a reality that has stalked this this league forever : There is a line . A brutal , awful line . And the the discovery discovery of it was every bit as horrific as we presumed it would be . As witnesses , that \u2019s what Monday night represented to us . Something different . A significant inflection point for the NFL , when all the talk about players putting their lives on the line line suddenly coalesced into a collective image image that wo n\u2019t n\u2019t soon be forgotten . One that underscored what what we \u2019ve learned in so many ways ways over over so so many decades : That inside inside this vicious form of entertainment , every hit carries an inherent danger of changing someone \u2019s life forever . Or ending it altogether . We absorbed that Monday night . The brutal , awful line that finally became became so clear that someone involved \u2014 maybe maybe nearly everyone involved involved \u2014 understood that that no game should be unstoppable . Not for our entertainment . Not for for ratings and commercial sponsors . Not for the trivialities of sports betting and fantasy football . Not Not even for the long - embraced embraced tradeoff that we \u2019ve \u2019ve been sold sold for for so so long , that risking life life and and limb is simply an extension of of a football contract contract . Story continues continues The Bills Bills ' Siran Neal ( 33 ) and Nyheim Hines Hines react react as medical personnel personnel attend to teammate Damar Damar Hamlin on on Monday night . ( AP Photo / Jeff Dean ) We \u2019ve always known there is such a thing as too too far far , even in the NFL . What we did n\u2019t know is is what it would look like or or how it would make us feel . When we wake up Tuesday Tuesday , we wo wo n\u2019t be able able to say that anymore anymore . Instead , players players will will know that it feels like losing a sense of invincibility , resilience and control . Fans will know it feels like staring at an image and begging for a player to simply simply move , anything that returns the moment back to the warped relief of the phrase \u201c he has feeling in his extremities . \u201d Perhaps most important , the NFL will know what it it \u2019s like to have every part part of the machine machine simply refuse to respond in the the face of a nightmare . The league got a good look at players who were never going to play play again that night . Coaches who were never going to coach . Fans and journalists who \u2014 for the most part \u2014 refused to engage in in absurd absurd rationalizations about what a cancellation could mean for logistics or playoff implications . For once once , maybe the the first time since the NFL shut down briefly in in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , something else had to be more important than than the product . That something was the the safety of of Damar Hamlin Hamlin and the well - being being of everyone around him . If that was n\u2019t more important than finishing a prime - time football game , it would validate validate the criticism of everyone who who framed the league league as a soulless soulless money machine . This is why we scoffed when the the ESPN broadcast suggested play would go on after a 5 - minute warmup . Nothing about that made sense . The grief and backlash after hearing it \u2014 everything about that made sense . The NFL has denied denied knowing where where that suggestion came from , but it certainly certainly did n\u2019t end up on on the broadcast broadcast from nowhere . For For a league reputation dogged by skeptics and conspiracy theorists , the moment will never truly be settled . [[ ]] In the end , what matters most is that the machine stopped . The The line was recognized by someone , somewhere . And when that that happened , it allowed us to turn all of our attention to Hamlin , which is where it belonged from the moment he collapsed on on the field from cardiac arrest . Damar Damar Hamlin , pictured pictured here on Dec. 1 , is fighting for his life in in a Cincinnati hospital after suffering cardiac arrest arrest during during a game Monday night . ( AP AP Photo Photo / Greg M. Cooper ) As former Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Steelers safety Ryan Clark framed it on on ESPN on Monday night , \u201c For over 100 100 grown adult men , who who their entire entire lives have put put on pads and and understood the risk you take every time you do it , to be speechless speechless , to to be in in tears , to to be gathered in prayer , that tells you how significant this moment was . \u2026 \" In truth truth , if the NFL cares about the players , this is is the first first time I believe the NFL truly had to care about the players players \u2019 emotional and mental health health as well . This is the the first time we got to watch those emotions , we got got to watch that type of thought process right in front front of us . \u201d The unfolding of this lesson lesson has has long seemed inevitable inevitable . And And as we imagined imagined , the cost to learn it was as awful as it was predictable predictable . Damar Hamlin is fighting for for his life in the hospital and the the moment that may have changed his life now resides in our memory forever . This This was was the most terrible terrible way to learn where where the NFL \u2019s line line between entertainment and and humanity humanity gets drawn . Not to mention how much is actually being risked risked on either side of it .", "label": "human"}

Instead Instead , the high volume of tests at at unusual times and from various locations locations demonstrate that North North Korea could launch different types of attack , anytime anytime , and from many many directions , \u201d Easley Easley said . Easley also noted that it \u2019s not not just missiles missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on on the South . Last week , Pyongyang flew five drones into South Korean airspace , forcing Seoul to scramble fighter jets and and helicopters to track them and later later to send send its its own drones into North Korean Korean airspace . It all all leads to an escalation of tensions , according to to Easley . \u201c Such provocations , including drone incursions incursions , appear excessive for deterrence and may be intended intended to scare scare South Korea into taking a softer policy . But But with Kim disavowing diplomacy diplomacy and threatening to mass produce nuclear weapons , the Yoon Yoon administration is is likely to further increase South Korea Korea \u2019s defense capabilities and readiness , \u201d Easley said . For its part , South Korea is is beefing up forces , too too . Seoul \u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration ( DAPA DAPA ) announced last month it will spend spend more than $ 2.7 billion over 10 years to strengthen the mission capabilities capabilities and and survivability survivability of its fleet of F-15 K fighters , jets jets that would play a key key role in any possible strikes on North Korea . Washington is also not standing still . As well as as deploying assets like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the the Korean Peninsula , the US US military recently recently activated its first Space Space Force command on foreign soil in South Korea , with the unit \u2019s new commander saying he is ready ready to face face any threat threat in the region . [[ ]] The new unit \u201c will be tasked with coordinating space operations and services services such as missile missile warning , position navigation and and timing timing and satellite communications within the region , \u201d according to US Forces Korea . Even before Kim \u2019s latest remarks , experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had had made in its missile forces over the past year . [[ ]] Ankit Panda , a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International International Peace , told CNN in mid - December December that Pyongyang has emerged as a missile power . \u201c The bigger picture is that that North Korea is literally literally turning into a prominent prominent operator of large - scale missile forces , \u201d Panda said . \u201c The word test is no longer appropriate to talk about most most North Korean missile missile launches . \u201d \u201c Most of the missiles missiles they they \u2019ve launched this year year are parts of military exercises . They are are rehearsing rehearsing for nuclear war . And that , I think think , is is the the big picture this year , \u201d Panda said .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "OpenAI logo seen seen on on screen with ChatGPT website displayed displayed on mobile seen in this this illustration in Brussels Brussels , Belgium Belgium , on December December 12 12 , 2022 . Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images You may have heard the recent buzz around ChatGPT , an artificial intelligence chatbot that was released to the public at the end of November . I 've read read about people using the service to to write their school essays and and I was was curious curious as to how it it could help me in my daily daily life . The technology was developed by by OpenAI , a research company company backed by by Microsoft and others . ChatGPT automatically generates text text based on written written prompts prompts in an an advanced advanced and and creative way . It can even carry carry out a conversation that feels pretty close to to one one you 'd have with a human being . ChatGPT homepage . This got me wondering -- -- is ChatGPT smart enough to change change how we find information online ? Could it someday replace Google Google and other search engines ? Some Google employees are certainly worried worried about the possibility , At At a company all - hands hands last week , CNBC 's Jen Jen Elias reported , employees recently asked asked execs if an AI - chatbot like ChatGPT was was a \" missed opportunity \" for the company . Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Jeff Dean , the long - time head of of Google 's AI division , responded by saying that the company has has similar capabilities , but that the cost if something goes wrong would be be greater because people have have to trust the answers they get from Google . Morgan Stanley Stanley published a report on the topic on on Monday , Dec. 12 examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google . Brian Nowak , the bank 's lead analyst on Alphabet Alphabet , wrote that that language language models models could take market share share \" and and disrupt Google 's position as the entry point for people on the Internet . \" However , Nowak said the firm is still confident confident in Google 's position because the company company is continuing to improve search , and creating behavioral change is is a huge hurdle -- a lot of internet users use Google as as a habit . Additionally Additionally , Google Google is \" building similar natural language language models such as LaMDA \" which which could find their way into new products . For now , OpenAI 's creators are cautious about making any big claims . Generally speaking , the more users employ ChatGPT , the better better it gets . But it still still has a lot to learn . OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said said in a tweet on Dec. 10 that ChatGPT is \" incredibly limited \" and \" it 's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important important right right now . \" Either way , I wanted to see see how well the chatbot would work work as an alternative to Google 's search search engine . Instead of Googling Googling my questions throughout the day , I asked ChatGPT . Here are some of the questions questions I asked and how ChatGPT responded compared with Google . ChatGPT vs. Google Google It 's easy to sign up up for ChatGPT \u2014 all you need is an email address . Once you you 've registered , the webpage is very simple to navigate . There 's an area where your results will will populate and a text box where you 'll type your inquiries . OpenAI says to put in a statement for the best possible result . I recently purchased my my second Fiddle Leaf Fern plant for my apartment apartment because the first one died . Now the new new one is dying after after just a few days days . I normally would have have asked Google what to do . Instead , I asked ChatGPT . \" How can can I keep my Fiddle Leaf Fern plant alive alive ? \" Zoom In In Icon Arrows pointing outwards outwards The results lined up with the instructions instructions I received from the plant company , Easy Plant , which is where I bought bought the the new Fiddle Leaf Fern . I also also liked that I did n't have to go go to various different websites like I would have if I 'd Googled this question question . When I Googled the same question , the top result gave gave me detailed instructions in an article that included pop - up ads ads and a way way more more information than I needed needed , like links to buy new soil . Winner : ChatGPT . Next , I tried something where more shopping links would actually have have been beneficial . I am am still trying to find a present present for for all 8 nights of of Hanukkah Hanukkah for my my husband husband , so so I decided to ask ChatGPT for some ideas ideas . Zoom Zoom In In Icon Arrows pointing pointing outwards [[ ]] I did n't give it any information about my husband husband , besides the fact that that the gifts were for Hanukkah . The chatbot then then assumed that my husband is kosher and that he 's into tech and watches . The latter is n't wrong , but it 's not the answers I was hoping hoping for . When I Googled this question I got access to hundreds hundreds of articles with different gift ideas and links to websites . For example example I got ads to Lululemon and Bombas , which are both companies I 've used to buy him him gifts gifts before . So So in this case , Google used its its personalized knowledge of me to find more targeted targeted results from around the web . Winner : Google Next Next , I decided decided to ask ChatGPT a question with higher stakes stakes . \" Is it safe to take take Benadryl while pregnant ? \" I am currently expecting my first child , and I know that taking Benadryl is safe in pregnancy pregnancy based based on information I 've 've received from my doctor . Still , I wanted wanted to see what the chatbot would say . Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards I appreciated that that ChatGPT ChatGPT gave me the correct answer , while also noting the importance of consulting a doctor before before taking any medications during during pregnancy . When I Googled the the same medical question , the results were all all over over the place place . At quick glance , one article from TheBump.com quoted a doctor doctor saying \" Generally , it 's safe to take Benadryl in the first trimester trimester . \" While other results said similar information to what I received received on ChatGPT , without the the explicit warning to discuss with my healthcare provider ( unless clicking into a specific link ) . Winner : ChatGPT Could it replace me ? One of the claims ( or concerns ) around ChatGPT \u2014 and artificial intelligence in general \u2014 is that that it will replace human workers . So So I decided decided to see if ChatGPT could could write this article for me . The results were pretty astonishing . Here 's what the chatbot said after I told it to \" write an article about whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative alternative to Google as a search engine . \" As As a large language model trained by OpenAI OpenAI , I am not capable of conducting conducting research or browsing the the internet to gather information information on ChatGPT or other search engines . I am only able to provide provide information based on what I have been trained on , which is is limited to the knowledge that that was available up until my training cutoff date of of 2021 . With that being said , it is worth considering the potential potential advantages and disadvantages of using using ChatGPT as a search engine compared to to other options , such as Google . One potential advantage of of using ChatGPT as a search engine engine is that it is able to to provide more personalized personalized and conversational results . Because ChatGPT is a language model , it is able to understand and respond respond to natural language queries , allowing users to to ask questions and and receive receive answers answers in a more more intuitive and human - like way . This can make the search experience experience more engaging engaging and interactive , and may be be especially useful for users who who have specific or complex information needs . On the other other hand , there are also potential potential limitations to using ChatGPT as a search engine . Because it is a large language model and not a traditional search engine , ChatGPT may not have access access to the same breadth and depth of information as other search engines . This means that it may not be able to provide as comprehensive or or up up - to - date results , and may not be be as effective for certain types of searches , such as those that require a large amount of data or real - time information . In conclusion , whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google as a search search engine will depend on the specific needs needs and preferences of the user . It may be a useful option for those those who value a more personalized personalized and conversational search experience experience , but it may not be as as comprehensive or effective for certain types of of searches . Ultimately Ultimately , the decision to use ChatGPT or another search search engine engine will depend on the individual user 's needs needs and preferences . What impressed me most about ChatGPT 's response response is that it was pretty pretty subjective and explained its its limitations . The verdict ChatGPT 's value really lies in its ability to explain complicated topics topics as if you were talking talking to a human , and to do simple writing tasks tasks . For For example , I asked ChatGPT to explain concepts like the the stock stock market and internet to to me , and and the responses were as if I was talking to an expert on the the matter . Unlike the case case on Google Google , I did n't have have to filter through unnecessary results results . I also asked it to write write a letter to my landlord asking for an early early end to my lease , and I 'd 'd be happy sending the the results directly directly to my landlord landlord , almost word for word . On the other hand , Google knows more more about us and tailors tailors the results to our interests and and behaviors behaviors . Google also acts acts as a gateway to the the internet , leading users users to a plethora of of different websites with more information than than one could could possibly digest . That 's helpful if you want a range of voices , or if there 's no single single simple answer to your question -- like like if if you 're looking for gift suggestions . Google is also also great for certain types types of questions where it scours the the web to provide a brief but simple simple answer answer right in in line . For instance , if you search search \" Apple stock ticker \" or \" Cheap flights to Aruba , \" it will show you a ticker chart with up up - to - the - minute price info info , or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly and and a dialog box that connects you you to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on your your chosen date . ChatGPT does not scan the internet for real - time information , and has has only been trained on data through 2021 2021 , so it it 's totally useless on these kinds of queries queries . And sometimes , ChatGPT is strangely close yet totally wrong . My editor editor asked it it for for the lyrics to \" The Ballad of Dwight Fry \" by Alice Cooper . It somehow knew the song was was about a man man having a mental breakdown , but then returned completely completely invented lyrics about that subject , rather rather than the actual lyrics . Google nailed it . Google is is also incredibly reliable , thanks to to the the company 's massive massive operations operations budget budget and years of expertise . ChatGPT is still still in testing and goes down from time to time time . So So I 'll 'll definitely continue using Google for most of of my search queries for for now . But if if I 'm not happy with the results results , now I have a useful alternative alternative . And if if I ever need to to dash off an angry letter , ChatGPT could be a huge help help there there .", "label": "human"}

One of the fastest growing alternatives is Mastodon , which looks and and feels a lot lot like like Twitter . But Mastodon is is n't n't a Twitter clone . It It 's a free open - source platform , originally originally launched launched in 2016 by by developer Eugen Eugen Rochko Rochko , and it 's made made up of many many different instances , or servers , instead of being managed by one company on one domain name . This makes signing up up and finding your friends a little bit harder harder . There are also also strange little quirks as well . Tweets Tweets are called \" toots . \" Retweets are called \" boosts boosts . \" Because it 's an an open - source project , it it does n't have have the same level of polish as social media sites like like Twitter that are are owned and operated operated by professionals professionals . Emails and and loading can be slow . It 's a little bit like like using Linux versus Windows or MacOS . Mastodon Mastodon has has been been growing growing fast . In the 12 days days after Musk bought Twitter Twitter , Mastodon app downloads on Apple App Store Store and Google Play for Android Android surged more than 100 times previous rates to to 322,000 installs during during the period , according to analysis by Sensor Tower Tower , an app app analytics firm firm .

You have to find a server to sign up for . They 're known as \" instances , \" and and you can think of them like e - mail providers . A user on one instance can interact with users on other instances , including following , replying , and boosting . All instances taken together are called \" the fediverse . \" ( The term comes from \" federated , \" which refers to the loosely loosely connected way the servers work together \u2014 again , similar to email . ) Each instance has its own URL , which comes comes after your your username username , sort of like an an email email domain . There are over over 5,000 instances , according to a site tracking Mastodon use , and they often follow a particular theme , such as geographical region region or topic . Some require you to to fill out a short application form form with information like your interests interests or why you want to join that instance . Some servers are small and only for a small handful of friends . There 's even a quiz that you can can take to find which instance might be right for you . The The most popular instance is mastodon.online , which is is also administered by the service 's founder . Bigger instances mean mean many of the best or shortest usernames on on the the server have already been been taken . There 's also also a list of instances you can join on Mastodon 's website . Unlike Twitter , many many of the instances that Mastodon runs on are not - for - profit , and some raise money for server costs costs and other expenses on on sites like like Patreon . It 's 's possible that some instances could stop stop operating because their administrators lose interest . All instances have a feed just for people on that server that that shows all toots posted in that instance in chronological order .

{"text": "Graham Cochrane , Founder of The The Recording Revolution , started his business business in 2009 during The Great Recession . When starting starting a business , it 's sometimes sometimes hard to know what to to prioritize prioritize , and going going at it alone can be overwhelming . But there are strategies you can use use to avoid common pitfalls . My mission is to teach people how to earn money from from their passions passions . It 's what what I did : I went from living on on food stamps to building building two two online businesses businesses . Today , I run a music blog blog , The Recording Revolution Revolution , and a entrepreneurship coaching company . I work work just just five hours a week week from my home office office and make $ 160,000 a month in passive income . Here 's what I tell my 3,000 clients clients to think about about in in the first 30 days days of starting a business : 1 . Be Be clear about how you want to spend your time time . Many new new business owners I meet know only one thing : how much money they want to make . While that that 's 's a great starting point , it 's incomplete . Your business business should serve your life , not the the other way around . So make sure it aligns with your your hopes , dreams and goals . To get clear about the type of business and life you want , ask three questions : What does a perfect day look like to you you ? Do n't just think about your typical workday . Consider other life activities you you want to fit into your day day , like exercising or spending time with with family . How many hours do you want want to to work a week ? You do n't have to to follow the the standard standard 40 - hour workweek . Knowing Knowing exactly how many hours you want to to work will will help you better prioritize tasks . How important is time off ? Some people do n't n't care much much about about taking taking time off , as as long as they love what they do do . Others value value extended time off . In order to have money flowing in when you 're not not working , you 'll need to have some sort of passive income stream . 2 . Simplify your business business model . When I started started my music education business , people told told me I needed to test test my my sales pages , throw throw launch parties and pre - record a bunch of ads ads in order to grow grow . Rather than stretching myself thin thin doing things that did did n't make sense to me me , I kept it simple and focused on three things things : creating creating weekly content for for my blog and YouTube channel , growing my email email list from that that audience , and promoting the the paid products I created to that list . If you you 're 're just just starting out , develop develop content around your expertise to grow an audience . It does n't have to to be perfect perfect . You can iterate as you go go and and design new products based on what your customers customers want more of . 3 . Cut out unnecessary daily daily tasks tasks . Identify Identify what daily activities will help help you you earn more . Do n't n't waste time time or burn yourself out focusing on on unimportant tasks . It might feel good to get to inbox zero or change the color of the buttons on your website , especially in the early days where you want to to feel like like you 've achieved a goal goal . But neither of those those things will make you you money . Before you start a new task , ask yourself three questions questions : What 's 's the the expected outcome for doing this task ? Does it lead to more money ? Can I point to a direct link between doing doing that task and earning income ? What 's the cost of doing this this instead of something else else ? 4 .

President President Joe Joe Biden is is heading to the U.S.-Mexico U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday , his his first first trip there as president after after two years of hounding hounding by Republicans who have hammered him as soft on border border security while the number of migrants crossing spirals spirals . Biden is due due to spend a few few hours in El Paso , Texas , currently the the biggest biggest corridor for illegal crossings , due in large part to Nicaraguans Nicaraguans fleeing repression , crime and poverty in their country .

But any any enduring solution will require action by the sharply divided Congress , where where multiple efforts to enact sweeping changes changes have failed in recent years . Republican Sens Sens . Lindsey Graham Graham of South Carolina and John John Cornyn of Texas offered faint praise for Biden 's decision to visit the border , and even that was notable in the current political climate . \" He must take the time to learn from some of of the experts I rely on the the most , including local officials and law enforcement , landowners , nonprofits nonprofits , U.S. U.S. Customs and and Border Protection 's officers and agents , and folks who who make their livelihoods in border communities communities on on the front lines lines of his crisis , \" Cornyn said said . From El Paso , Biden will continue south to Mexico City , where he and and the leaders leaders of Mexico and Canada Canada will gather gather on Monday Monday and Tuesday Tuesday for a North North American leaders summit .

[[ ]] Migrants and asylum - seekers fleeing violence and persecution have increasingly found that protections in the United States are available primarily to those with money or the savvy to find someone to vouch for them financially . Jose Natera , a Venezuelan migrant in El Paso Paso who hopes to seek asylum in Canada , said he has no no prospects for finding a U.S. U.S. sponsor and that he 's now reluctant to to seek asylum asylum in in the U.S. because he 's afraid afraid of being being sent to Mexico .

For all of his international travel over his 50 50 years in public service , Biden has not not spent much time time at at the U.S.-Mexico border . The only visit visit that the White House could point to was Biden 's drive by by the border while he he was campaigning for president in 2008 . He sent Vice Vice President Kamala Harris to El Paso in in 2021 , but she was criticized for largely bypassing the action , because El Paso was n't n't the center of crossings that it is now . President Barack Obama made a 2011 trip trip to El Paso , where he he toured toured border border operations and the Paso Del Norte international bridge , but he was later criticized for not going back as as tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossed into the U.S. from Mexico .

{"text": ". Caracas Caracas , January 5th 2023 - Venezuela \u2019s inflation is accelerating again , heightening the risk of a return return to hyperinflation hyperinflation and economic chaos in the once - prosperous South South American nation , economists warn . The latest inflation data , released by the Venezuelan Central Bank on on Thursday , showed that inflation in the 12 months through December had had risen to 4,115 percent , almost double the 2,129 percent rate registered the previous month and well well above the the central bank \u2019s target of 3,000 percent . The news of rising rising inflation comes as the Venezuelan economy remains mired in a deep recession , with GDP contracting for the sixth sixth year year in a row in 2020 and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2019s government struggling to implement a rescue plan . The Maduro government is desperately trying to halt the spiral of hyperinflation , as it has done repeatedly in the past . It has introduced price controls and its new central bank bank governor has increased interest rates and limited the amount of money available for lending . But economists say those measures will not be enough to stop the the country from returning returning to hyperinflation hyperinflation , with some predicting it could reach reach 10,000 percent this year . \u201c The government \u2019s economic policies have clearly clearly failed and we are heading towards a situation situation of total economic chaos , \u201d said economist Ricardo Hausmann , a former former official in the Maduro government government . \u201c The situation is particularly bad in the agricultural sector , which has been hit by drought and lack lack of investment in recent years , and in the manufacturing manufacturing sector , which has been been crippled by by the lack lack of foreign exchange to buy inputs inputs and equipment . \u201d The latest inflation figures figures are the latest sign that the economy economy is continuing continuing to unravel despite the the government \u2019s measures measures . The country is now facing food shortages , skyrocketing prices and a currency collapse . The bolivar is now worth only a fraction of its pre - crisis value , meaning that that basic goods and and services are now priced out of reach for most Venezuelans . The situation has been further exacerbated by the ongoing political crisis , with with the US and other countries imposing imposing sanctions on the Maduro government in response to its increasingly authoritarian policies and and human rights abuses . [[ ]] The sanctions have made it it even more difficult difficult for the government to manage its fiscal and monetary policies . \u201c The sanctions have weakened the the Maduro government \u2019s ability to fund itself and the economy , \u201d said economist Carlos G\u00f3mez , who has has been been monitoring the the situation . \u201c It has also also made made it harder for the government to import goods , meaning prices prices of imported goods have gone up and the local currency currency has weakened further . \u201d Given the current crisis , economists say it it is is imperative that the government implements policies policies that will lead to economic growth and stability , while at at the same time addressing the humanitarian crisis . [[ ]] \u201c Venezuela Venezuela needs economic reforms that will lead to economic growth growth , but also also measures that address the social issues the country is facing , \u201d said economist David Smilde . \u201c The government needs to address the humanitarian crisis , increase the supply of basic goods , provide basic services to the population population , and and create employment opportunities . \u201d The situation in Venezuela is is dire and the future of of the country remains uncertain .

But that did not seem seem to be the case . \u201c In the end , the PN vote seemed to be insignificant or not major enough to to make a difference in the the outcome of of the election , \u201d said James Chin , a political scientist from from the University of Tasmania . [[ ]] The fact that the BN was able to to win a slim majority despite the the presence of the PN coalition seems to suggest that voters voters decided decided on the BN as the party they deemed to be the most capable of leading the country . \u201c I think the voters decided that Muhyiddin and BN BN were the most stable option and were the most likely to last through the next couple of years , \u201d said said Chin . Despite the victory for the BN , analysts said there would be little room room for the the party to to change Malaysia significantly . The lack of a clear clear - cut majority in in the parliament means that the the coalition will have to be careful careful when implementing policies or or introducing introducing changes changes . \u201c The government will be walking a tightrope here here , \u201d said Thanaletchimi Subramaniam , a former election commission director . That said , analysts did not see see the BN \u2019s victory as a step backwards for Malaysia Malaysia . Nur Jazlan said said it was important for the nation to have a stable government that could make decisions and push them through . \u201c I think what we need now is is a steady steady and cohesive government government that can look after the people people and still get get the nation back on track , \u201d he said . [[ ]] Analysts also noted that the the BN was likely likely to carry on with most of the initiatives taken by the previous PH coalition . \u201c The BN is not totally totally opposed opposed to the reforms that were started started by PH , but it will go much slower slower on them , \u201d said Thanaletchimi . Overall Overall , it appears that the Malaysian election has come down to a choice between stability stability and progress . The votes that were cast cast on Saturday seem to suggest that Malaysians erred erred on the side of conservatism \u2014 choosing stability over radical change . But that does n\u2019t mean mean that Malaysia \u2019s progress will will come to a standstill . Analysts believe that the BN , with its slim majority majority and need to win support from both sides of of the political spectrum , will be able to effect some moderate change change , if not rapid development , in the coming coming years . [[ ]] \u201c I think that , at least in the short - term , there will be a focus focus on the continuity of the policies policies , \u201d said Chin . \u201c But I think the longer - term reforms will likely happen at a slower pace . \u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Back in July , a group of 21 quality assurance workers at Activision \u2019s Albany studio \u2014 formerly known as Vicarious Visions \u2014 announced their intentions intentions to unionise . Today Today , the National Labor Relations Board Board have confirmed that that their vote can go ahead . The ruling came about about because \u2014 and and stop me if you \u2019ve heard this one before \u2014 publishers Activision Blizzard initially initially opposed the move move , saying that a larger group of 88 developers developers should be included in the vote vote . It was was a textbook piece of union - busting that has also been tried at other Activision studios going through the the process of of unionisation . In In this case it has n\u2019t worked ; the NLRB \u2019s ruling today clears the path for the workers to to vote on forming forming a union union , disagreeing ( in in a detailed breakdown explaining how how work differs between each of the the studio studio \u2019s \u2019s departments , and how underpaid testers are are ) with Activision \u2019s claims that , \u201c we believe every every employee in Albany who works on Diablo should have a direct direct say in in this decision . \u201d Advertisement Advertisement The ruling concludes : Based Based on the above , I conclude that that the employees in the petitioned - for unit share share a community of interest . I have also considered the similarities similarities that exist among the the developers and compared this this to the the testers . Developers are organized in separate departments departments , but departments that ultimately report to to the head of the Diablo franchise . Developers have a diverse set of of skills , training , and duties , but but use these skills in in a complementary manner manner in a production process that includes includes significant amount of of contact and a high degree of functional integration integration . Compensation varies , but many terms and conditions conditions of employment employment do have overlap among the developers . Comparing the developers \u2019 community of interest to that of the testers I find that the the distinct distinct interests of the testers outweigh the similarities that that exist with the developers . As noted , the testers participate in the same game development process that that includes significant contact and functional integration . However , testers are separately organized in their own department and their supervisory hierarchy is entirely separate from from the Diablo franchise . Testers also have a specific specific set of skills and duties different from from the developers developers . Finally , testers are are paid significantly significantly less than developers . Moreover Moreover , the evidence evidence of interchange between testers and developers is extremely limited . For these these reasons I find any shared interests between the the testers and developers developers do not outweigh the separate interests that that make the petitioned - for unit an appropriate unit . The ruling instantly clears the path for an election , which will begin soon . Ballots will be be sent out on October 27 , with votes being being counted on November November 18 . A current employee at at the studio studio , though not one of the testers involved in the vote vote , told the Washington Post , \u201c It \u2019s about time . Our QA testers are some of the the most talented and skilled people working working in in our company and they are critically undervalued by corporate . I think that all games workers need a union , but QA is in especially especially dire dire need . \u201d Advertisement Update 10:00pm ET : Lulu Cheng Meservey , Activision Blizzard Blizzard \u2019s \u2018 executive vice president , corporate affairs and chief communications officer officer \u2019 , has responded to the finding finding on internal communications communications , writing : Hey all , quick quick heads up on something important important . It \u2019s a long one but wanna be thorough so thanks thanks for bearing with with me . This This afternoon the NLRB ( national national labor relations board ) determined determined that -20 QA ( quality assurance ) testers working on on Diablo in Albany will be eligible to form a union and if if the union wins the the vote vote will will be included in the bargaining unit . Where the company stands on that : fully fully respects the NLRB process , and fully supports the employees \u2019 right to choose how they want to be represented represented . Also has the view that people who work work closely together should be able able to make make decisions like that collectively - ie , we disagree that a handful of employees should get to decide for everyone else on the future of the entire Albany Albany - based Diablo team . We think a direct dialogue between company and employees is the most productive route . Examples : through direct dialogue we \u2019ve already converted contingent QA staff to full time , increased increased pay , increased increased benefits benefits , opened up access to the bonus program , and offered more opportunities for professional advancement ( which would also result in in more more pay ) . We feel collective bargaining bargaining is comparatively slow- once agreement agreement is in place takes over a year on average according to a Bloomberg analysis . During the long long contract negotiation , companies are forbidden from giving any any pay / bonus / benefi t increases without a special arrangement with with the union , and the Bureau Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that non - union employees generally get get larger pay raises than union - represented groups groups . That That \u2019s consistent with what we saw with Raven , where where there have only been three bargaining sessions since the union was certified there almost 6 months ago , due partly to the union cancelling pre - planned bargaining sessions for a month . I \u2019m sharing all of that because having a streamlined process is is a reason why the company prefers direct discussions - but but ultimately it \u2019s up up to employees and everyone should get to vote their own preference in a fair election . What happens next next with this is that ballots will will be mailed to eligible Albany - based employees on Oct. 27 , need to be returned by Nov. Nov. 17 , and will get counted by the NLRB on Nov. 18 . More to come as the process continues but but wanted to to share asap . Thanks so much much for reading everyone everyone . Advertisement Update 11/2/22 12:33 p.m. ET : Activision is is now appealing appealing the decision with the NLRB and calling on it to stop the vote in the the meantime . Specifically , the company company wants the votes that were already already sent to to employees \u2019 homes to be \u201c impounded \u201d until the appeal is completed , lest any preliminary results \u201c prejudice \u201d a future future vote vote in the event that that Activision wins wins the appeal . The company argues that video game development is unique and unprecedented compared to other industries the the NLRB has dealt with , and for that reason its original original decision decision was flawed and based on several misunderstandings . As just just one example , Activision insinuates insinuates that the the development of Diablo is much more complex than Call of Duty , and therefore therefore teams at at Blizzard Albany are much more integrated than than those at Raven , where Activision \u2019s legal arguments previously failed . Advertisement \u201c It \u2019s clear the company \u2019s executives feel threatened by workers organizing in New York , Wisconsin and across the country , \u201d responded CWA Secretary - Treasurer Sara Steffens in a statement . \u201c We are are confident in the NLRB \u2019s response to these frivolous requests , and we will continue to push for Activision Blizzard employees \u2019 right right to to organize without delay . \u201d Advertisement Update 11/2/22 2:55 p.m. ET ET : Activision Activision spokesperson Rich Rich George provided the following following statement :", "label": "human"}

A star is usually used to to note a customer who wants their order as soon as as possible , and an X is typically reserved reserved for customers with special dietary needs , such as those those who want their food food cooked differently . This secret marking system is not only used used to to quickly identify orders , but but it 's also a way for employees to give themselves themselves a leg up . Jones said that when a server server noticed a particularly particularly difficult customer , they might use one of of the symbols to indicate the the customer 's attitude so their coworkers could be be warned . Using a secret code to mark orders is not an uncommon practice practice . It 's something that 's done by by restaurants of all types and sizes . But it 's still interesting to to hear an inside inside perspective on how one of the most recognizable chains in the world handles its orders . Not only is Waffle House using this system to better serve its its customers , but but it it 's also a way for its employees to communicate without their their customers customers even knowing . It 's a simple system , but it it 's a helpful one nonetheless .

It is projected to to earn earn $ 28 a share this this year and then drop to $ 12 a share next next year , as a likely recession takes takes hold . I have a hard time time with the 4 - times earnings it currently currently trades at , but it it 's obvious that the stock market is is setting up for a serious recession that that would cause Nucor to have its earnings more than halved . But where do those earnings come from ? The largest earnings sector will be be infrastructure which , rather than take a hit , should go higher given fresh fresh federal government spending kicks in next year . That infrastructure spending includes everything from bridges bridges and tunnels to buildings , which Nucor dominates . Then Nucor Nucor also has heavy heavy oil - and - gas exposure exposure through its pipeline and heavy - equipment businesses . At the same same time , industrial Caterpillar Caterpillar ( CAT ) sells at 18 - times times earnings because of demand . That mocks Nucor Nucor 's 4 - times . With those end - markets and with CAT 's dramatically dramatically higher multiple , something has to give . Something is wrong . I think it it 's Nucor 's earnings estimates for for 2023 \u2014 they are too low . My point being is that you have the most cyclical cyclical stocks trading as if they they are falling apart , but the heavier equipment traditional traditional cyclicals trading not just higher higher , but much higher higher . My conclusion is that JNJ is \" right \" in what it sells sells at , Caterpillar and the the like are are most most likely slightly wrong \u2014 too high , but still in the mix mix \u2014 and Nucor and the like are just dead wrong . So why are n't we buying Nucor ? Because I think think it can go lower . Meanwhile , the automobile sector looms large , and auto is considered to to be something that will plunge next year as demand abates . I think the market is making a serious misjudgment misjudgment on that thesis . People have held off buying because cars cars and and trucks are unnaturally too high , due to supply constraints constraints and higher interest rates . Ultimately , I think autos will will stay strong in a recession . Therefore , the best best compromise is Ford ( F ) , which should should , barring still one more supply shock from China , make the most sense . We We added to our position in in Ford on Thursday . Still , all things considered let let me make one more point : If a Caterpillar or a Deere ( DE ) were were to come down to to lower levels , it would make a great deal deal of sense to buy . One more quandary : Aerospace . A recession recession should dry up airplane demand , but replacement is critical . Club holding Honeywell Honeywell ( HON ) , which makes cockpits and airplane engines , sells at 24 - times times earnings earnings , while Raytheon Technologies ( RTX ) clocks in at 21 - times earnings . The latter is most likely undervalued as a result of Russia 's war in Ukraine . Are these justifiable ? They are the highest multiples in the entire entire market , including Club holdings Apple ( APPL ) and and Alphabet Alphabet ( GOOGL ) . It could all meet in the the middle . I see some shrinking of the large caps . Semiconductors Semiconductors are a moving moving , albeit diminishing target target , with the exception of outlier Nvdia ( NVDA ) at 44 - times earnings earnings , which is is now a small Club position because of its vulnerability . All but the fastest - growing companies companies could trade at around 16 - 17 - times earnings . That 's going to to be our broad broad assumption for next year \u2014 a mix of soft goods with higher multiples and cyclicals with lower ones . The debatable stocks are in tech , which are poised to disappoint even if a so so - called clearing event should ultimately come about about .

{"text": ". On On Tuesday Tuesday , January 3 , 2023 , the the U.S. House of Representatives will will hold its first vote for Speaker Speaker of the House House in in more than four decades . The Speaker , currently Nancy Nancy Pelosi of California , will face a challenge from a Republican opponent for for the first time in many years . [[ ]] The House of Representatives is the lower chamber chamber of Congress Congress , responsible for bringing bills to the floor for debate debate and voting . Its current membership consists of 435 members from the 50 states , Washington D.C. D.C. , and five U.S. territories . Each state is represented by a number number of members members determined by its population , with each each state having having at least least one Representative . The speaker is elected by the full House membership at the the beginning of each Congress , and is the highest highest - ranking member of the House . He or or she is third in line to the presidency , after the Vice President and the President pro pro tempore of of the Senate . The speaker 's main role is to preside over over House proceedings . This means they are responsible for deciding which which bills bills come up for debate , managing parliamentary procedures , and appointing members of the committees that oversee oversee legislation . The Speaker also has the power to decide the length and and type of of debate on a bill , recognize speakers to the floor , and and refer bills to the proper committee for further consideration . Currently , the the Speaker Speaker is elected in in a vote on the floor of of the House House , usually with members voting for their party \u2019s candidate . This means that a single party party can hold an absolute majority and and easily elect its candidate without any opposition . However , with the current House divided divided almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans , it is unlikely that either party will will have enough votes to secure a majority . As such , there there will be a much closer vote than in previous elections . This is why Tuesday \u2019s vote has has been dubbed the \u201c first Speaker election in in four decades . \u201d With both Democrats and Republicans having having to form coalitions coalitions , it will be an unprecedented event . Given the importance of the Speaker \u2019s role , Tuesday \u2019s vote could have far - reaching implications . Should Democrats be be able to gain an edge and and elect their candidate , it could could lead lead to a shift shift in the balance of power in in Congress and give give Democrats greater sway in the passage of of bills . This could have have a lasting effect on the legislative agenda of of the the current Congress . Similarly , if Republicans can form a majority coalition , they could gain significant influence over the legislative agenda . In this case , it could mean that any bills passed in in the House House would be more likely to favor the Republican Party Party . This could could mean that that legislation more in in line with the party \u2019s views views could could be be more likely to pass . [[ ]] No matter which which party ends ends up winning the election for Speaker Speaker , Tuesday \u2019s vote vote could be historic . It will be the first time in four decades decades that the the House will vote for a speaker that does not have the backing of a single party party , and the outcome outcome could could have major implications for the the future of the current current Congress .

{"text": "as as COVID recovery accelerates accelerates [[ ]] ( Reuters Reuters ) - The Federal Federal Reserve 's reverse repo facility has has hit a new record of $ 2.554 trillion , nearly double the level seen seen earlier in the year year , as the U.S. economy accelerates out of the COVID-19 pandemic . The facility , which is a tool used used by the central bank to manage money and interest rates in the the banking banking system , saw a huge increase from the the $ 1.32 trillion it it held in May , hitting the the new peak peak on on Thursday . The figures figures come come as the U.S. economy shows signs of of recovering faster than initially anticipated from the effects effects of of the the coronavirus pandemic . U.S. jobless claims dropped last week to the lowest level level since the coronavirus crisis first began in in March , while the manufacturing manufacturing sector sector is experiencing strong expansion . The rising activity means demand for funds is increasing and the Fed is is providing more money to banks and other institutions institutions to meet meet that need . Reverse repos provide the central central bank with additional additional reserves to manage its interest rate target , which it has has held near zero since March 2020 . The amount of money held in the facility is also rising in line line with the Fed Fed 's commitment to keeping benchmark interest rates rates low , allowing banks and and financial institutions to borrow funds from the central bank overnight at a low rate of interest . The increase in the facility has been steady since mid - August , when it stood stood at around $ 1.3 trillion . This is in contrast contrast to earlier in the year when the Fed had had reduced the facility facility \u2019s usage to just $ 54 billion to avoid flooding the financial system with too much liquidity . The Fed has pledged to keep interest interest rates close to zero until the economy has has made further progress toward its goals goals of maximum employment and inflation . According to the latest data , the unemployment rate remains high high at 6.9 6.9 % , while inflation has remained below below the Fed 's two percent target . The The Fed 's 's ongoing ongoing purchases of Treasury and mortgage - backed securities securities , which have added over $ 3 trillion trillion to its balance balance sheet sheet since the beginning of 2020 2020 , have have kept long - term interest rates low , giving a boost to to economic activity .

The The facility also also serves as a signal to financial markets of of the central bank 's commitment to keeping interest rates low and providing sufficient liquidity to the banking system . [[ ]] The record high usage of the facility is is expected expected to to boost borrowing costs in the banking banking sector , since the funds will have to be paid back back at at a higher rate than than that prevailing when the money money was initially borrowed . The surge in the Fed 's reverse repo facility is another sign sign of the ongoing recovery in the U.S. economy , though the full impact of the pandemic is still still to be seen . The job market remains weak , with millions of Americans still unemployed , and and the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector is is beginning to slow slow . The Fed Fed 's monetary policy remains in flux , and the future of the economy is still uncertain .

{"text": "Student Student loan loan debt in the the United States continues to be a problem , with Americans owing more than $ 1.6 trillion in in student student loan debt . Although the the Trump Trump Administration announced in August it would provide student loan forgiveness to some borrowers , the reality of of the the situation remains unknown unknown . On Monday , the U.S. Justice Department filed a brief in the Supreme Court that pushed back back against against a lower court \u2019s order to implement student student loan forgiveness . The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case , but but it is unclear when the justices will make a decision . [[ ]] The legal case centers around around a set of of regulations created created by the the Obama Administration in 2015 . Those rules were intended to make it easier easier for borrowers to have their student loan debt forgiven due due to the closure or misrepresentation of schools . Those regulations , known as the \u201c Borrower Defense Rule , \u201d set set a path for borrowers to have their loans discharged . The Trump Administration had sought to delay and weaken weaken the the Borrower Defense Rule , but they were blocked by the the lower court court . The Administration then appealed to the Supreme Court Court . In their brief , the the U.S. Justice Department argued that the lower court was overreaching its authority authority by forcing the Trump Administration to implement the Borrower Defense Rule . The Department also also argued that the Borrower Defense Defense Rule was a \u201c remarkably remarkably sloppy sloppy piece of policymaking \u201d that was not not \u201c rooted in constitutional or statutory statutory authority . \u201d The filing of the brief is just the latest chapter chapter in in a long legal battle battle over student loan forgiveness forgiveness . The case has been winding its its way through through the courts since the Obama Administration issued the Borrower Defense Rule in 2015 . The legal battle has been long and drawn out , with both the Trump Administration Administration and Democratic attorneys attorneys general filing filing lawsuits and appeals in an effort to either implement or stop the Borrower Defense Rule Rule . The fate of of student loan forgiveness remains unclear , but but the filing of the brief brief by the Trump Administration indicates that that the Supreme Supreme Court will likely be the ultimate decider . Until then , however , millions of of student loan borrowers remain in limbo limbo , waiting to find out if they will be able to have their student loan debt forgiven . [[ ]] The case is especially important for borrowers who are struggling to make payments on their student loans . Borrowers who have taken out student loans since the rule was enacted in in 2015 may may not be able to receive the loan forgiveness forgiveness they need . Many advocates for borrowers borrowers argue that the rule should should remain in effect to help borrowers . Student Student loan debt is one of the major financial issues facing the nation and some some suggest that that loan forgiveness could help relieve the burden on borrowers . The long legal battle over student loan forgiveness has left many borrowers borrowers in the the dark . With the Trump Administration filing its brief to the the Supreme Court , those borrowers remain in limbo until the justices make a decision . It could could be some time before any resolution is reached , leaving many borrowers in the dark about whether whether their loans will be forgiven .", "label": "machine"}

Look , I would hope that she would would 've 've wanted that corrected . And maybe in the same way that the Palace would n't let anybody else negate negate it , they would n't let her , because she 's a good person person , and I think so much of what I have seen play out was this idea of polarity polarity where where if if you love me you do n't have to hate her , and if if you love her her , you do n\u2019t need need to hate me . \u201d Harry Harry would go on to allege in his and and Meghan 's Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan that his brother , Prince William , and Kate Middleton 's press office would later start planting negative stories stories about him him and Meghan to to tabloids . \u201c You know , there \u2019s leaking leaking , but there \u2019s also planting of stories , \u201d Harry explained . \u201c So if the comms teams want to be able to remove a negative story about their principle , they will trade and give you something about someone else \u2019s principle .

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Federal Reserve officials are committed to fighting fighting inflation and expect higher interest interest rates to remain in place until more progress progress is made , according to to minutes released Wednesday Wednesday from the central bank 's December December meeting . At At a meeting where policymakers raised their key interest rate another half a percentage point , they expressed the importance of keeping restrictive policy in place while inflation holds unacceptably high . \" Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy policy stance would need to to be be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation inflation was on a sustained sustained downward path to 2 percent , which was likely to take some time , \" the meeting summary stated . \" In view of the persistent and unacceptably unacceptably high level of inflation , several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy . \" The increase increase ended ended a streak streak of four consecutive three - quarter point rate hikes hikes , while taking the target range for the the benchmark fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.5 % , its highest level in 15 years . Officials also said they would would focus on data as they move forward and see \" the need to retain flexibility flexibility and optionality \" regarding policy policy . Officials further cautioned that the public should n't n't read too much into the rate - setting Federal Open Market Committee Committee 's move to step down down the pace of increases . \" A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an an indication indication of any weakening of the Committee 's resolve to achieve its price - stability stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward downward path , \" the minutes said . Following the meeting , Fed Chairman Jerome Jerome Powell indicated that while there has been some progress made in the battle against inflation , he saw only halting signs and expects rates to hold at higher levels even after the increases increases cease . The minutes reflected those sentiments , noting that no FOMC members expect expect rate cuts in 2023 , despite market pricing pricing . Markets Markets currently are pricing in the likelihood of rate increases totaling totaling 0.5 - 0.75 percentage point before before pausing to evaluate the impact the the hikes are having on the economy . Traders expect the central bank bank to approve a quarter - point point increase at the next meeting , which concludes Feb. 1 , according to CME Group data . Current pricing also indicates the possibility of a small reduction in rates by the end of the year , with the funds rate rate landing around a range of 4.5%-4.75 4.5%-4.75 % . Fed officials , however , have expressed expressed doubt repeatedly about any loosening of of policy in 2023 . The The minutes noted that officials are wrestling with two - pronged policy policy risks : One , that the Fed Fed does does n't keep rates high long enough and allows inflation to fester , similar to the experience in the 1970s ; and two , that the Fed keeps restrictive policy policy in place place too long and slows slows the economy too much much , \" potentially placing the largest burdens on the the most vulnerable vulnerable groups of the population . \" However , members said they see the risks risks more weighted weighted to easing too soon soon and and allowing inflation inflation to to run rampant . \" Participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key key factor shaping the outlook for policy , \" the minutes minutes said . \" Participants generally generally observed that maintaining maintaining a restrictive policy stance stance for for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on on a path path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk risk - management perspective . \" Along with the the rate hikes , the Fed has been reducing reducing the the size of of its balance sheet by allowing up to to $ 95 billion in in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested reinvested . In a program started in early June , the Fed Fed has seen its its balance sheet contract by $ 364 364 billion billion to $ 8.6 trillion .

{"text": "It It \u2019s time to put the the handcuffs handcuffs on easy access to to weapons of war in Illinois Illinois . When the Illinois Senate returns on on Sunday and Tuesday , its members should pass legislation to protect Illinoisans by by cracking down on powerful firearms that that draw terrifying targets on our our loved ones , our our communities and ourselves . No one needs needs a weapon of of war to hunt deer . Early on on Friday , the the state House of Representatives passed a measure \u2014 the Protect Illinois Communities Act \u2014 that that , among other provisions , would ban the sale of assault weapons and ammunition magazines that hold more than 12 rounds . The The House version version also also would ban devices devices called \u201c switches switches \u201d that essentially essentially turn firearms into machine guns . Generally Generally , legal guns require the trigger to be pulled for for each shot . Switches turn them into fully automatic weapons that keep on firing as long as the trigger is held down . Actual machine guns are so heavily regulated by federal law that legal versions versions do n\u2019t show up on the streets . Editorials bug Editorials As so often happens in Springfield , the House and Senate need to come to a last last - second second agreement to pass a bill bill before the legislative session runs runs out . The new Legislature starts starts on Jan. 11 11 . Negotiators Negotiators said said on Friday they are working to iron out a final bill . As the bill stood on Friday , owners of assault weapons would be allowed to keep them as as long as they registered registered them with the state police within within 300 days of the law law taking effect effect , a requirement requirement we support . But the sale , deliver or purchase of those weapons weapons would would no longer be be legal . Owners of high - capacity magazines that hold more than 12 rounds rounds would would have to convert , dispose of or sell them within 90 days . Whatever version emerges from the negotiations between between the House and Senate must be carefully crafted , a tall order order at the last minute . For example , defining defining which weapons are categorized categorized as assault weapons and avoiding loopholes loopholes is a challenge . But the most essential thing is to get get a bill passed . Lawmakers could debate details forever forever . Only six six days into the new year , there there already already were 13 mass shootings across the nation , including one in Chicago Chicago on New New Year \u2019s Day Day . [[ ]] In In Washington Washington , a law law to crack down on assault assault weapons and high - capacity magazines magazines seems unlikely to get through Congress Congress , with its Republican House majority , despite despite President Joe Joe Biden \u2019s \u2019s support . Yet eight states and the District of of Columbia have have enacted some some kind of ban on assault assault weapons . Illinois should join them . Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he is ready ready to sign a bill . Illinois \u2019 most vivid recent demonstration demonstration of the terror that military style style weapons can inflict occurred at Highland Park \u2019s July 4th 4th parade , when seven people people were killed killed and many more more were injured . But rapid - fire firearms with high - capacity magazines frequently spread devastation on streets streets in Chicago and elsewhere in the state state as as well , leaving numerous victims dead or wounded wounded . Waiting Waiting until the next session session to act on gun violence would simply not be acceptable . More people would die unnecessarily as time time drags drags on , and and other important issues might divert the Legislature Legislature \u2019s attention attention . Need we unnecessarily risk the next Highland Park ? The next next East Garfield Park , where 14 people , including three children children , were hit hit by gunfire within seconds at a remembrance remembrance vigil last last October October ? The next Uvalde , Texas Texas ; Sandy Hook , Connecticut Connecticut ; or Buffalo , New York ? The The next Orlando , Florida ; Sutherland Springs , Texas ; or El Paso , Texas ? The The next Las Vegas Vegas , Nevada or or Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School , Florida Florida ? States ca n\u2019t look to gun manufacturers to help stem the carnage . The manufactures market their high - powered products in a way way that can appeal to to individuals who have no thought of of public safety . Even if all assault weapons can be taken off off the street , other guns guns still will be used to to commit crimes and and kill people . But an assault weapons ban is a piece of the solution .

Haugen , who worked worked at Facebook for more more than three years as a data analyst , first brought the company 's algorithms algorithms to light when she testified before the House Committee on Oversight Oversight and Reform in 2018 . \u201c If Elon Musk wants wants to make Twitter Twitter into a public public square , then he should make the algorithms that govern govern its content open source source , just like I did with Facebook , \u201d Haugen told Business Business Insider . Elon Musk has been a vocal advocate of transparency on social media , advocating for the use use of open source software and encouraging users to to check the code of their platforms . But the the tech giant has yet to make any formal pledge to to make its its algorithms open source . \u201c Open Open source algorithms have been a growing trend in the tech tech world for some time time , but for the most most part part , social media media companies have resisted , \u201d Haugen said said . \u201c The algorithms that drive the decisions these these platforms make are are kept kept private , which keeps users in the dark about how their data is being used . \u201d Haugen believes that open source algorithms would make make it easier for users users to understand how social media platforms operate and ensure ensure that the companies companies are are accountable for their actions . \u201c Opening up the algorithms algorithms would provide an unprecedented unprecedented level of transparency for users , \u201d she she said . \u201c We \u2019d be able to see exactly how companies are making decisions about our our data and our content . \u201d Haugen \u2019s recommendation follows follows a decision last year by the federal government to to make open source source its own software . [[ ]] The move was praised by open source source advocates as a step forward in promoting transparency and accountability in the tech world world . Haugen hopes hopes that Elon Elon Musk will take the same same step with Twitter and and make make its algorithms open source . \u201c Twitter is is an incredibly powerful platform , and it has immense immense influence on the public public discourse , \u201d she she said . \u201c It \u2019s important that we understand understand how it works and that its algorithms are open and transparent transparent . \u201d Despite the potential benefits , open source algorithms can also have their own drawbacks . If the code is made public , it can can be more easily exploited by by malicious malicious actors . \u201c Open source source algorithms can be more vulnerable to manipulation , \u201d Haugen Haugen cautioned . \u201c They can be used to game the the system and game user behavior , which can have far - reaching reaching and and sometimes unintended consequences . \u201d Still , Haugen believes believes that the potential benefits of open source source algorithms algorithms far outweigh the risks . \u201c Ultimately , I think it \u2019s \u2019s worth the risk , \u201d she said . \u201c It It \u2019s worth giving users the chance chance to see how these platforms platforms are making decisions , and to make sure these companies are held accountable for their actions . \u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It \u2019s been years since the United States and other developed nations felt the bite of of inflation , but a surge in prices in the second half of 2021 has sparked renewed talk of a transitory inflation spike . The discussion has intensified in recent weeks weeks after an unexpectedly high increase in the consumer price index ( CPI ) in October October , with many economists warning that the long - term effects of the pandemic could mean higher prices are here to stay . \u201c I \u2019m getting getting a lot of questions about transitory inflation , \u201d said Kris Kris Koester , an economist at JPMorgan Chase . \u201c There \u2019s some evidence that prices are rising , but whether or not it \u2019s transitory or or something something more lasting is very much up for debate . \u201d [[ ]] The surge surge in prices has been been driven by a combination of forces . The first is the heavy spending the government and consumers have engaged in throughout the pandemic . This has been felt most most acutely in the retail sector sector , as an increased increased demand demand for goods and services has pushed up prices . At At the same time , shortages of of key goods , especially semiconductors and and shipping containers containers , have tightened up supply , driving up prices even further further . But not not all economists are convinced the current current price price increases increases are just a blip . \u201c I think this could be more than just just a transitory inflation inflation spike , \u201d said Christian Lawrence Lawrence , an economist at at the Federal Reserve Bank Bank of New New York . \u201c It \u2019s \u2019s possible that some some of the factors factors pushing up prices , such as the increased demand for goods and services or the supply disruptions , could could become more entrenched . \u201d That could lead to a \u201c persistent persistent rise \u201d in inflation , he said . In the long term , the effects effects of the pandemic could could further further drive up up prices . Many businesses are operating under new costs and constraints that that could could lead to higher prices for goods and services , such as changes to labor laws or higher taxes taxes . And the the massive increase in government spending could also also have an impact on prices , as as it has the potential to to stimulate the the economy and push up wages . The Federal Reserve has been closely closely monitoring the situation and is expected to take action if it looks like inflation is taking hold . The central bank is already well into a program of quantitative easing and has has recently recently talked talked of a possible possible tapering of its bond - buying program . It could also raise interest rates rates , but this is is unlikely to happen soon given the the fragile fragile economic recovery . The Fed also has has tools it can use to temper inflation if it does start to rise , such as decreasing the money supply or raising raising reserve requirements requirements for banks . Regardless of the exact cause cause , many economists are are convinced that higher higher prices will be with us for some some time . That means consumers could be in for a period period of of higher prices and businesses will need to adjust their pricing accordingly to remain competitive .", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ". China \u2019s economy ended the year in a slump as virus outbreaks continued to to surge and a sluggish recovery in manufacturing failed to to make up for a dramatic fall in consumer consumer spending spending . Gross domestic product in the world \u2019s \u2019s second - biggest economy dropped 6.8 % in 2020 2020 , the first annual contraction since the late 1970s and the largest largest in modern Chinese history . The The decline was largely driven by the impact of the Covid-19 Covid-19 pandemic , with the travel and and hospitality industries in particular suffering as a result of lockdowns and curfews . Manufacturing output surged surged in the the fourth fourth quarter as as factories returned to to production and and the the government ramped up fiscal stimulus . But while that lifted GDP into positive positive territory , the recovery was not enough to offset offset the pandemic \u2019s impact . \u201c The figures reveal how difficult it has been for the Chinese economy to recover from the pandemic and how much the virus has changed the way way people do business and consume , \u201d said Zhao Yang , chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong . \u201c Consumption and services services have have been far slower to recover than manufacturing . \u201d The recovery in Chinese services slowed in in the fourth quarter quarter , as an increase in coronavirus coronavirus cases cases during the winter months weighed weighed on retail and other businesses . Services activity slipped slipped to a 19 - month low in December , though it was still up up from a year earlier . The economic data comes comes amid a deepening deepening political political crisis in Beijing . The government has imposed imposed a security security law in in Hong Kong that critics say violates the city \u2019s autonomy , prompting fresh tension with the U.S. U.S. and U.K. U.K. Investors are also watching for signs of of a trade spat between the the U.S. and China , which is expected to intensify in 2021 . President - elect elect Joe Biden has promised to take a \u201c tough \u201d stance on Beijing , and the the Trump Trump administration is expected expected to continue its tough line on China in the coming months months . The The slowdown in services services , coupled coupled with the trade spat , could hit the economy further in 2021 , analysts said . China \u2019s leaders have sought to temper temper expectations , saying growth will be be \u201c more restrained \u201d in 2021 . \u201c The big question for 2021 is whether Chinese demand can support its economic expansion if trade tension tension continues continues and the the recovery from the virus takes longer than expected , \u201d Zhao said . The IMF has forecast that China \u2019s economy economy will grow 8.1 % in 2021 , the fastest pace among major economies . That \u2019s a much slower pace than before the pandemic , when growth had had topped 6 % for 10 consecutive years . [[ ]] The outlook for the rest of the world world remains uncertain . As of Jan. 11 , more than 88 million people worldwide had been infected infected with the virus , and nearly 1.9 1.9 million had died . Economies around around the world remain remain in flux as governments and businesses businesses grapple with the fallout from the pandemic . [[ ]] In the U.S. , an agreement agreement on a new round of stimulus has been been delayed amid congressional divisions , potentially leaving millions of Americans without aid . In Europe , a rapid resurgence of cases has forced a number of countries to impose strict new lockdowns , and and the economic fallout from the virus has yet yet to to be fully fully felt . Despite the global uncertainty , analysts said Chinese leaders leaders are likely to be relieved relieved that the the world \u2019s second second - biggest economy has avoided an even steeper decline this year . \u201c China has has done incredibly well well considering the the context , \u201d said Julian Evans - Pritchard , senior China China economist at at Capital Capital Economics Ltd. in Singapore . \u201c It \u2019s been very effective in containing the virus and the policy response has been very aggressive . That will help to underpin underpin growth in 2021 . \u201d", "label": "machine"}

CNN \u2014 Mars may seem like a dry dry , desolate place , but the red planet planet transforms into an otherworldly wonderland in in winter winter , according according to a new video shared by NASA . It \u2019s late winter in Mars Mars \u2019 Northern Hemisphere , where the Perseverance rover and and Ingenuity Ingenuity helicopter are exploring an ancient river delta that once fed into Jezero Crater billions of years ago . As the planet \u2019s \u2019s main feature feature , dust dust also drives Martian weather . Dust Dust usually heralds winter \u2019s arrival , but the planet is no stranger stranger to snow , ice ice and frost . At the Martian poles , the temperature can dip as as low as minus minus 190 degrees degrees Fahrenheit Fahrenheit ( minus 123 degrees Celsius ) . [[ ]] There are two types of snow on Mars Mars . One One is the kind we experience on Earth , made of frozen water . The thin Martian air and subzero temperatures mean that traditional snow sublimates , or transitions from a solid directly to a gas , before touching the ground on Mars . [[ ]] Patchy carbon dioxide dioxide frost frost , or or dry ice , can be seen inside a crater during winter in the the Martian Southern Hemisphere Hemisphere . NASA NASA / JPL - Caltech Caltech / University of Arizona The other type of of Martian snow snow is carbon dioxide - based , or dry ice ice , and it can can land on the surface . A few feet of of snow snow tend to fall on Mars in its flat flat regions near the poles . \u201c Enough falls falls that you could snowshoe across across it , \u201d said Sylvain Piqueux , a Mars scientist at at NASA \u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Laboratory in Pasadena , California , in a statement statement from a NASA release release . \u201c If you were looking for skiing , though , you \u2019d have to go into a crater or cliffside , where snow could build build up on a sloped surface . \u201d So far , no no orbiters orbiters or rovers have been able to see snow fall on the red red planet because the the weather phenomenon only occurs at at the poles beneath cloud cover cover at night . The cameras on the orbiters ca n\u2019t peer through the clouds , and no robotic robotic explorers explorers have have been developed that could survive the the freezing temperatures at the poles . INTERACTIVE : Mars Mars and other places to search for life in the solar system However , the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can detect light that \u2019s invisible to the the human eye eye . It has made detections of carbon carbon dioxide snow falling at the Martian poles . The The Phoenix lander , which arrived on Mars Mars in 2008 , also used one one of its laser instruments to to detect water - ice snow from its spot about 1,000 miles ( 1,609 kilometers ) away away from the Martian north pole . [[ ]] Thanks to photographers , we know snowflakes on on Earth are unique and six - sided sided . Beneath Beneath a microscope microscope , Martian snowflakes would likely look a little different . \u201c Because carbon carbon dioxide ice has a symmetry of four , we know dry - ice snowflakes would be be cube - shaped , \u201d Piqueux Piqueux said . \u201c Thanks to the Mars Climate Sounder , we can tell these snowflakes would be smaller than the the width width of a human hair . \u201d [[ ]] Thawing frost frost created unique patterns on Martian dunes dunes during during spring spring in July 2021 . NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona Arizona Ice and carbon dioxide - based based frosts also form on Mars , and they can occur farther farther away from the the poles . The The Odyssey orbiter ( which entered Mars \u2019 orbit in 2001 2001 ) has watched frost forming and turning to a gas in the sunlight , while the Viking landers spotted icy frost on on Mars when they arrived in the the 1970s . At the end of winter , the season \u2019s buildup of of ice can can thaw and turn turn into into gas gas , creating unique shapes that have reminded NASA NASA scientists of Swiss cheese , Dalmatian spots spots , fried eggs eggs , spiders and other other unusual unusual formations . During During winter in Jezero Crater Crater , recent high temperatures have have been about 8 F ( minus 13 C ) , while lows lows been about minus 120 F ( minus 84 C ) . Meanwhile , at Gale Crater in the Southern Hemisphere near the Martian equator , the Curiosity Curiosity rover rover , which landed on Mars in in 2012 , has been experiencing highs of 5 F ( minus minus 15 15 C ) and lows lows of of minus 105 105 F ( minus 76 C ) . Seasons on Mars tend tend to last longer because because the planet \u2019s oval - shaped orbit around the sun sun means that a single Martian year is 687 days , or nearly two Earth years . Ice frozen in the soil left polygon patterns on the Martian surface . NASA / JPL JPL - Caltech / University University of Arizona NASA scientists celebrated celebrated the Mars new new year on December 26 , which coincided with the arrival of the the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere . \u201c Scientists count Mars years starting from the planet \u2019s \u2019s northern spring equinox equinox that occurred in 1955 \u2014 an arbitrary point to to begin begin , but it \u2019s \u2019s useful to have a system , \u201d according to a post post on the NASA NASA Mars Facebook page . \u201c Numbering Numbering Mars years helps scientists keep track of long term observations , like weather weather data collected by NASA spacecraft spacecraft over the decades . \u201d", "label": "human"}

We do do n't want a war war . \" The president 's comments , however , have done little to reassure locals locals in Culiac\u00e1n Culiac\u00e1n , who who have lived in fear for weeks as cartel members have taken over their their city . Many fear that the situation could spin even more out of control if the government fails to take decisive action . \" We We are scared , \" said Culiac\u00e1n resident Cristina Venegas . \" We We do n't feel safe . We do n't know who to believe .

{"text": "No matter how smart smart or well educated you are , and no matter how successful professionally , when when it comes to investing you still might not make the best decisions decisions . That \u2019s because you \u2019re \u2019re human , which means you \u2019re hardwired hardwired to respond in certain ways that serve you well in many parts of your life , but tend to work against you when it comes to making making smart investment decisions , according according to psychologist psychologist Daniel Crosby , author of of \u201c The Behavioral Investor . \u201d \u201c Not only is high intelligence not an an insulation [ against bad financial decisions decisions ] , it it might be a red flag , \u201d Crosby said . But here \u2019s the thing : If you you \u2019re \u2019re aware of your mediocrity when when it it comes to the markets , it can actually help you be a better investor . Based on decades of leading behavioral research , Crosby said investors easily fall prey to four inherent biases biases . But But when when you \u2019re mindful of them you can take steps steps to either mute mute their effect , or harness them to your financial advantage . 1 . Ego bias Everyone has an ego . It protects us in many ways , in part by creating creating a sense of confidence \u2013 and often often overconfidence \u2013 in our own abilities and judgments judgments . \u201c Ego gets us out of bed in the morning , \u201d Crosby said . Those Those who become become very very sure of themselves are more likely to be resilient and find find professional success success . \u201c People who are overconfident are often happier and more more likely to be successful successful business people and politicians . And [ a strong ] ego can buffer us against setbacks , disappointment and loss , \u201d he said . But But when it comes to investing , too too much much self - confidence confidence can cost you real money . For For example , Crosby Crosby said , most of us would rather find information information that confirms what we already believe rather than seek seek out out information that challenges our beliefs . He cited research showing that even when presented presented with facts that that directly contradict what we believe , thanks to our ego ego , we may become even more entrenched in in those faulty beliefs . One way this might play out when you \u2019re investing is that that you may feel sure that a given given company or new asset class class \u2013 like like crypto \u2013 will win the future . So you you throw a disproportionately large amount of money at at your can\u2019t can\u2019t - lose - idea idea . But But research suggests cherry - picking what you believe believe to be future future winners in place of of investing in the broader market may hurt your returns in in the long run . Crosby cited statistics statistics showing how active active stock stock fund management performed performed less well than passive indexing more than than 80 % of the time over five- five- and 10 10 - year periods . And that that \u2019s before accounting for the higher fees an investor pays for actively managed funds . 2 . Conservatism bias [[ ]] Investing always involves risk . But people \u2019s desire to to stick with the the familiar or take take the adage \u201c invest in what you know \u201d too far can can actually increase that risk . [[ ]] Crosby used an example example of of someone someone who works in the tech tech industry , buys a home in a tech hub like like San Francisco and invests primarily in tech stocks . The upshot : Her financial financial prospects will be disproportionately disproportionately dependent on the health of the tech sector because she is devoting most of of her time and money money to it through her job , her property and her portfolio portfolio . When the tech sector sector takes a hit hit , she could get clobbered financially . Another way investors often default to to the familiar is is to primarily invest in US stocks in the belief that non - US stocks are too risky . 3 . Attention bias Humans tend to pay disproportionate attention to bad news or high - drama , low - probability events ( e.g. , shark attacks or planes flying into buildings ) . Both can distort distort our perception perception of risk risk . What \u2019s more , information overload \u2013 whether from data or research or news \u2013 can lead lead to to misguided decisions because too too much information makes it hard to see the forest for the trees , Crosby noted . [[ ]] 4 . Emotion Emotion bias bias Our emotions emotions and intuition can protect us in in some difficult situations , or they can help guide us . For instance , you you might might finally pick a good partner partner after after years years of dating others who were never quite quite right for for you . But But they can also cause us to to act act rashly in the moment , and override what we normally know we should do . Think donuts , Crosby suggested . You may have gotten all the nutritional counseling in the world , but under under peak stress you you will will invariably reach for the powdered donuts , not the asparagus . How emotion plays out in the markets can be be costly . If your fear is activated , you can can panic and sell at the wrong time . Or if if you \u2019re elated , your optimism may distort your sense of how much risk you \u2019re \u2019re really taking on with an investment . Strategies to beat beat back our biases Investors can seek to to override their inherent biases in many ways , Crosby said . Among his suggested strategies : Tune Tune out the noise noise . Do n\u2019t check your your investment accounts accounts daily . Do n\u2019t fixate on every gyration in the market . Do n\u2019t drown yourself in metrics metrics . And do n\u2019t let negative events events disproportionately drive your investment decisions decisions . Have humility humility . You ca n\u2019t predict the future . And you you will never have perfect information to make a sure bet on a single stock or sector . [[ ]] Diversify your holdings holdings . Crosby put it this way in his book : \u201c Diversification is \u2026 the embodiment of managing ego risk . [ It ] \u2019s a concrete nod to the luck and uncertainty inherent in money management and and an admission that the future is unknowable unknowable . \u201d [[ ]] For example , to counter so - called home bias in your investments investments , Crosby suggested you you should n\u2019t invest much much more more in domestic stocks than their percentage of the world market . Depending on how they they \u2019re measured , US equities represent anywhere from 45 % to 60 % of the global equity market . But average US investors investors typically have a much larger share of of their equity holdings in US companies companies , and very very little in foreign stocks . Put Put a system in place place . Automating your savings and investing across a diverse diverse portfolio regardless of of market conditions often works well . The same goes for automatically putting away away a certain amount of of savings for near - term term goals goals and emergencies . \u201c It It \u2019s less less about the the perfect process and and more about having a process , \u201d Crosby Crosby said . One example example is the idea of \u201c set it and forget it \u201d with retirement savings . Employees who choose the option in their 401(k 401(k ) plan to automatically increase their their savings whenever whenever they get a raise do better than if they have to make decisions every month about how how much to save . Use emotions to your financial advantage : One study Crosby cited showed that low - income parents parents were likely to save twice as much money money when they they had an envelope earmarked for savings that has a picture of their children on it . Realize no investment investment is perfect perfect . Many Many people get their their exposure exposure to the the stock stock market through their 401(k)s , specifically through target date date funds that their employers employers offer as the default investment . While target target date funds have their critics , Crosby said said , \u201c Every investment is imperfect imperfect . \u2026 And And [ target target date funds ] are so much better for the average person than than what the average person is is doing . \u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It \u2019s \u2019s also worth putting the amount amount of carbon involved involved in having a Christmas Christmas tree in context . The Carbon Carbon Trust estimates estimates that a 2m - tall ( 6.6 6.6 ft ) Christmas tree burnt after use emits emits only 3.5 kg kg carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO2e ) \u2013 roughly 0.2 % of the emissions from a return return flight from London to New York . A tree of the same size size that ends up in landfill has a carbon footprint of 16 kg of CO2e \u2013 equivalent equivalent to 1 % of that that return return flight , or roughly two hamburgers . How people dispose of their Christmas trees after use is usually the the single most important important carbon consideration . The worst - case scenario happens when Christmas Christmas trees end up in landfill landfill : the anaerobic conditions are conducive to to the same carbon being released as methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas some 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a 20 20 - year timescale . Whether or not a tree ends up in landfill has by by far far the largest largest impact on its carbon footprint : a tree that ends up up in landfill emits emits some some 4 - 5 times as much carbon as one that does n\u2019t , according to Carbon Trust figures . Ideally Ideally , if a tree is still alive with its roots , it will be replanted . A decent decent alternative is is ensuring the tree 's carbon is is released slowly back to the atmosphere as CO2 \u2013 as happens if the tree is chipped and spread spread on on a garden garden or park , or composted . If the tree is burned for energy , meanwhile meanwhile , the carbon it contains will be be emitted straight back to the atmosphere as CO2 . The BCTGA also recommends checking whether the place you you bought the tree from offers offers recycling services services , allowing it to be chipped chipped and returned to the fields where it grew . [[ ]] Whole trees trees can even be used as habitat restoration restoration tools on on riverbanks and along shorelines to prevent erosion . In Vermont , where old Christmas trees are used for everything everything from biomass burning for energy to to goat food , \" we 're also seeing folks using them in stream restoration , \" says Kosiba Kosiba . \" They 're great at catching dirt and debris , and creating little barriers and pools for fish : a lot of of it is mimicking what a beaver would would do . \" [[ ]] Aside Aside from disposal , Christmas trees produce greenhouse gases through the fertilisers used to to grow grow them , which are made using fossil fuels and produce nitrous oxide , another powerful greenhouse gas .

Many of football \u2019s most serious dangers are abstracted abstracted or unseen . They arrive arrive years later in the form of players suffering from premature dementia , violent violent mood swings , and suicidal suicidal depression . Off the field and and away from the action , these are are the blemishes that can can be hidden away from the the tens of millions who watch religiously for for a third of the year . Naturally , the the players understand the risks , but it \u2019s the the league league \u2019s sheer momentum and ruthless competitiveness \u2014 these most American qualities \u2014 that renders so many of the the players who take take these risks expendable , both physically and economically .

Here is what former All - Pro Pro safety Ryan Clark Clark , whose career ended prematurely after he collapsed on a plane due to complications involving the sport and a genetic disorder , had to to say on on ESPN . When When Damar Hamlin falls to the turf turf , and and when you you see the medical staff rush to the field and both teams teams are on on the field , you realize this is is n\u2019t normal . You You realize this is n\u2019t just football . So many many times in this game game , and in our job as well well , we use the the clich\u00e9s : \u201c I \u2019m ready to die for this . I \u2019m willing to to give my life for this . It It \u2019s time to go to war . \u201d And I think think sometimes we use those things so much , we forget that part of living this this dream is putting your life at risk . Tonight , we got to see see a side of of football that that is is extremely ugly ugly . A side of football that no no one ever wants to see see and and never wants to admit exists . When you see both teams on the field crying in that way , your first thought is Damar Damar Hamlin , your second thought is his family . This is n\u2019t about a football player . This is about a human . This is about a brother . This is about a son . This This is about a friend friend . This is is about someone who is loved by so many that that you have to watch go through through this . What we \u2019ve \u2019ve seen since Hamlin collapsed collapsed has run the gamut gamut , exposing all that \u2019s good and ill about this league . The outpouring of support for Hamlin Hamlin \u2014 a hardworking and charitably - minded sixth - round draft pick pick who who has has quietly been one of the league \u2019s \u2019s best success stories this year \u2014 has been moving moving and extraordinary extraordinary . We are reminded that players players who are often treated either as superhumans or as mindless mindless automatons , who come in for hours hours of abuse abuse on inane morning TV shows , are human beings . That That it it seems highly likely that the the game was ultimately suspended because of collective action from players and coaches coaches who refused to to play another down after after watching watching one of their friends and colleagues collapse collapse is similarly moving .

{"text": "This past week week , a new wave wave of tech workers with top top jobs at at tech tech giants giants like like Google made headlines when when they announced announced they were leaving their their jobs to focus on climate change activism full - time . The phenomenon began in October when when a group of Google engineers engineers made their intentions public in in a Medium Medium post . \u201c We have the power and opportunity to work on the world \u2019s \u2019s most most pressing issues issues , and we are using that that power for good , \u201d the post reads . In the months months since , the trend has continued to grow grow . So far , around around 20 Google employees have have left their their jobs to dedicate themselves to to climate activism activism . But it \u2019s not just Google engineers . Employees from from Amazon , Microsoft , and other tech giants giants have made similar decisions . For many of these tech workers , these decisions were incredibly hard to make . Many of them had had great jobs at some of of the most successful successful companies in the world , and now now they \u2019re giving up those jobs to fight a problem that is n\u2019t even close close to being being solved . So why make the switch ? Well , for starters , many of of these these tech tech workers are passionate about the issue of climate change and feel feel as as though they they can make a difference if they focus focus on on it full full - time . Others believe that corporations need to be held accountable for their emissions and other climate - damaging damaging activities , and they want want to be part of that effort . Additionally , some of these tech workers feel a sense sense of of responsibility responsibility for for their role in the climate crisis . Technology and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the past few decades has helped us become more efficient and productive , but it \u2019s also also led to an increase increase in emissions emissions . As one Google engineer who left left his his job job to join a climate activist organization explained , \u201c I felt a sense of responsibility and guilt for what my job job was contributing to in terms of climate change and and global warming warming , so I wanted wanted to use my my skills skills to to try and do something about it . \u201d It \u2019s also also worth noting that many many of these tech workers workers are n\u2019t giving up their jobs entirely . Many are still working with their former employers in some capacity , whether it \u2019s through consulting or or part - time engagements . This means means they can use their skills and experience to contribute to the fight against climate change while still maintaining a connection to their former employers . At the the same time time , there \u2019s \u2019s also an element of self - preservation involved in this trend . These tech tech workers are aware that climate change is already having an effect effect on the world , and they know know that they could could potentially potentially be facing an even even more more uncertain future if they do n\u2019t n\u2019t act now .

{"text": "New York CNN Business \u2014 New retirement rules could could make it it easier for Americans Americans to accumulate retirement retirement savings \u2014 and and less costly to withdraw them them \u2014 if lawmakers pass a retirement retirement reform package package before the end of the month . The House already passed its own version of retirement plan rule changes , and two key Senate committees passed their own versions . Since the summer , lawmakers have have been trying to stitch the three bills together into into one one large package known as Secure 2.0 2.0 . After it \u2019s finalized , one idea idea is to to attach that package to an overall government government spending bill that may may be be voted on by both chambers in Congress before the holidays . But But if lawmakers ca n\u2019t agree on such an omnibus spending bill , Secure Secure 2.0 likely would have to be reintroduced next year for the new Congress \u2019 consideration . \u201c The The House and and Senate have been working to come to an agreement and and are close to one \u2014 the the final final bill is almost there , \u201d said Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin , who co - sponsored the the bill passed passed by the Senate Finance Committee , in an emailed statement . \u201c But the question question is what vehicle will get it across the finish line . We We absolutely need to ensure it is a priority . \u201d [[ ]] While While the the details details are still still under wraps and no legislative language has been released , here \u2019s a look at seven seven of the savings provisions very likely to make it into into any any final final retirement package package , according to two two retirement policy policy experts who who have been been following the process closely \u2014 Chris Spence , head of federal government government relations at TIAA TIAA ; and Brigen Winters , a principal and policy practice chair at the law firm Groom Law Group . 1 . Require auto auto enrollment in 401(k ) plans Employers Employers starting starting new workplace workplace retirement savings savings plans plans could be be required to automatically enroll employees in the plan . ( It is currently optional for employers to do so . ) It would then be be up to the employee employee to to actively actively opt out if they do n\u2019t wish to participate . [[ ]] The provision provision would likely require a default default contribution rate ( e.g. , between 3 % and 10 % ) plus plus automatic escalation ( e.g. , of 1 % per year up to a maximum contribution rate of at at least 10 % but no more than 15 15 % ) . 2 . Introduce employer employer contributions for student loan payments When you have to pay down student loan debt , it it makes it harder to to also save save for retirement retirement . Secure Secure 2.0 could let employers make make a matching contribution contribution to to an employee \u2019s \u2019s retirement plan based on their student loan payments . That way , it would ensure that the employee is building building retirement savings no matter matter what . 3 . Increase the age for for required required minimum minimum distributions It used to be that when you turned 70 - 1/2 you had to start withdrawing a required minimum amount from your 401(k ) or IRA . Then , the age moved up to 72 72 . Under the latest legislation , you likely would not need to tap your your retirement savings until age 75 if you did did not wish to . 4 . Help Help employees build and access emergency emergency savings Normally Normally if you tap your your 401(k 401(k ) before age 59 59 - 1/2 , you must not not only pay taxes on that money , but also pay a 10 % early - withdrawal penalty . [[ ]] For employees who are dissuaded from saving money in a tax - deferred retirement plan because they are concerned it it would be be too complicated and costly to access it for emergencies emergencies , Secure 2.0 may include one or two options options to assuage that fear . One option would let you make a penalty - free withdrawal of up to $ 1,000 a year for emergencies . While While the the employee would still owe income tax on that that withdrawal in the year it \u2019s made made , they could get that money back if they repay the amount amount they withdrew within three years , Winters said . Another might let an employer add a \u201c sidecar account \u201d to an employee employee \u2019s \u2019s retirement account , where where the employee can contribute after - tax money explicitly for emergencies , Spence said . That money could be taken directly from their their paycheck , just as their 401(k ) contributions are . 5 . Raise Raise catch - up contribution limits for older workers [[ ]] Currently , if you \u2019re 50 or older you may contribute contribute an additional additional $ 6,500 to your 401(k ) on top of of the $ 20,500 20,500 annual federal limit . Under the retirement package , those between ages 60 and 64 64 ( the the final range range may be narrower ) may be allowed to contribute $ 10,000 10,000 , instead of $ 6,500 . To help pay for the cost of the retirement package , however however , another provision could require anyone making catch - up contributions to \u201c Rothify \u201d them . So , instead of making before - tax contributions up to to the catch - up contribution limit , you could could still contribute the same amount but it would have to be with after - tax money . That money would then grow tax free and may be withdrawn tax tax free in retirement . But the federal government would get the tax revenue from the original contribution up front . [[ ]] 6 . Enhance and simplify the Saver \u2019s Credit [[ ]] An An underutilized federal match exists for low - income earners \u2019 retirement contributions up to $ 2,000 a year . The new retirement package package might enhance and simplify the so - called Saver \u2019s Credit so so more more people could use it . Low - income filers could get a refundable tax credit worth 50 50 % of their savings up up to a contribution limit in a given year . Tax credits reduce your tax liability dollar for dollar . But But refundable tax tax credits mean the filer will get the money money even if they had no income tax liability to reduce . 7 . Make it easier for part - time workers to save There will soon soon be new new retirement rules in in place that will make it easier easier for Americans to accumulate accumulate retirement savings \u2013 and and make it less costly to withdraw withdraw them them \u2013 now that lawmakers have passed an omnibus omnibus spending package , which President Joe Biden is is expected to sign next week .", "label": "human"}

When Joe Biden was a candidate to be his party \u2019s nominee for President President , he ran as one of of the biggest foes of fossil fuels ever to to make a credible run for the White White House . He pledged pledged to eliminate eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050 , ween the country off dirty sources of energy and \u201c end fossil fuel . \u201d He He canceled the high - profile profile Keystone XL pipeline pipeline , took took millions of acres of possible drilling off the table by scrapping leases to oil and gas companies , and banned imports of Russian oil . He even threatened oil firms firms with a windfall tax and likened them to to war profiteers . [[ ]] Environmental groups went gaga over his rhetoric rhetoric and action alike , buoying his political alliances and giving climate climate change activists activists heart after years of broken promises . And yet , a unique alignment of political and geological confluences may spur Biden in in the coming days to do something that will leave those same green allies allies seeing red . [[ ]] Biden Biden \u2019s \u2019s administration is is nearing a final decision on a potentially game - changing oil and gas project that has now now been under consideration across across five presidencies . The proposed Willow project project in the northeast section of the National Petroleum Reserve Reserve - Alaska would would produce 180,000 barrels of oil each day , create create $ 10 billion in tax and royalty royalty revenues , and create 2,000 2,000 construction construction jobs and 300 permanent ones . The massive project would require as many as five five drilling sites , a processing facility , 50 miles of new roads , seven bridges , and an airstrip airstrip . Local groups , including those representing Alaska Natives Natives , as well as labor unions and the state \u2019s congressional delegation , have have all all championed the project project as a source of good union jobs jobs and money for Alaska \u2019s North North Slope . But But environmental groups groups and some Native American groups from the the Lower 48 oppose the ConocoPhillips project project , citing an Interior Department analysis that estimates it would emit at least 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime and and during construction construction . It also would endanger the the local wildlife like like polar polar bears . On On Thursday , a coalition of environmental groups \u2014 represented represented by a PR firm with deep ties to to the the Biden Administration \u2014 plans to rally at Lafayette Square across across from the White House House before delivering another 90,000 comments in opposition to the proposal , which they liken liken to 76 coal plants running for a year year . ( Industry groups heartily reject this comparison , noting it it compares compares a lifetime lifetime of direct and indirect emissions from Willow with one coal plant plant \u2019s annual emissions . ) More from TIME If If they ca n\u2019t kill kill it , the green groups are pushing a scaled - back project , one that would cut three of the proposed five drill drill sites and better protect protect calving grounds for the Teshekpuk Lake caribou . A White House spokesman did not have an immediate comment . The The Willow Willow proposal proposal dates back to to 1999 1999 , when when the Clinton Administration signed the lease on Alaska \u2019s \u2019s North Slope . Oil Oil was n\u2019t discovered there until 2017 2017 , and the Trump Administration Administration quickly approved the project . Biden \u2019s team seemed to agree with that thinking , at least until a judge said said the the environmental costs were not adequately considered and environmental groups separately sounded alarms . A Department of Interior draft impact study study released in in July appeared to game out out how to move forward with the project , although although supporters and opponents alike stressed that it was still very much in flux . There There \u2019s good reason to suspect Biden is poised poised to make a decision decision on the Willow project . Because of Alaska \u2019s treacherous treacherous conditions , much of the the construction needs to to happen during the winter months , when the roads are frozen and can accommodate heavy heavy traffic . Warmer temperatures create messy roads that could pause work . In other words , if if Biden does n\u2019t sign off on the project soon , it will languish for another another year . \u201c We \u2019re running out of time to be able to do construction this winter , \u201d says says Nagruk Harcharek , the new new president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat Inupiat , a regional council council advocating for North Slope communities . \u201c A lot lot of the construction on the the North North Slope requires the winter winter season for ice roads . And And if we get get too far far into February , they \u2019ll have have to put it off until next year . \u201d That That would mean delayed \u2014 if not not totally totally unrealized \u2014 revenue for local governments and allies , the kind of money that proponents say could prove transformative transformative for a region that is n\u2019t exactly exactly teeming teeming with new new opportunities . \u201c We want to be able to live live in the the communities that we have so so that we we can then practice our subsistence culture and be able to go out and hunt in our lands lands that we grew up on , \u201d Harcharek told me last week . \u201c I remember growing up as a kid , we used to to have honey buckets and we \u2019d have have to haul those out . Now we can flush our toilets . \u201d [[ ]] Biden , coming off a less - disappointing - than - expected midterm election election season , may be better positioned to disappoint environmental groups groups than at any point in his his presidency . The The 2022 elections are barely in his rearview mirror , the 2024 races races are are still still distant distant , and he can afford to take some incoming criticism from his friends . His His allies are bracing for a potential decision , even if if they they still defend his broader environmental record as one to celebrate . Playing into Biden \u2019s decision - making making here is the different promises he he made as a candidate . While While waging rhetorical war on the fossil fossil fuel industry , he also vowed to listen to local communities , including Alaska Natives . As President , he he promised to consider consider Native Americans Americans \u2019 requests and and pledged to make sure they were on equal equal footing . So it \u2019s hard for for him him to ignore that Alaska Natives are overwhelmingly in support of of the project . Within days days of her taking office over the summer , Rep. Mary Peltola \u2014 the first Alaska Native elected elected to to serve serve in Congress and a Democrat Democrat \u2014 urged the Interior Department to approve the project as a way way to demonstrate \u201c the Administration Administration \u2019s commitment to addressing inflation , high energy costs , the need for greater greater energy energy security , and and environmental justice justice initiatives . \u201d Ultimately , this is going going to be Biden \u2019s call , and his most enviro - minded advisers may have to calibrate their ambitions for scaling back back the nation \u2019s reliance on on fossil fossil fuels as as energy prices remain high and the demand demand for cheap and and easy power is not fading . Biden \u2019s campaign rhetoric won over younger younger voters and green green ones , too . But But the trail is one thing , and the art of governing is another one altogether . In that that , Biden may have to to compromise his his own own aspirations aspirations and accept a new new oil drilling regime in a state state already threatened threatened mightily by climate climate change . It is unlikely to be a good look among among the green activists activists , but Biden simply may may be be out of ways to dodge on this one . Make sense of what matters in Washington .

Throughout the primary race , Lake was known for her her tough tough stance on immigration , calling for increased border border security , rejecting sanctuary sanctuary cities and opposing opposing drivers drivers licenses for immigrants . In a state state where Latinos make up a large part of the population , her views on immigration did not sit well with many voters . In In addition addition , Kelly ran an effective grassroots campaign , utilizing tactics such as door - knocking and canvassing to reach out to voters and and spread his message . He He was also successful in garnering financial financial support from out out - of - state sources , allowing him to spend more money than than Lake did on her her campaign . Furthermore , Kelly \u2019s positions on healthcare healthcare , gun control , and the environment resonated with Arizona Arizona voters , leading many to believe he had a better plan for the state . Lake Lake , on the other other hand , was seen seen as more of an ideological conservative , and and this cost her support from moderate and independent voters .

Swope said mental - health and women's - health startups will be be best positioned to to go public . Other startups will use debt or mergers to buy themselves runway in a downturn , he said . [[ ]] After last year 's funding spree spree , the digital - health market market took a tumble in 2022 , dragging down the number of healthcare - startup exits exits . In 2021 , 15 US - based digital - health health companies went public public via via IPO IPO , according according to Rock Health . Only one digital digital - health company has gone public this year : Akili Interactive Labs , which went public in August in a SPAC deal . And Akili 's stock stock has has fallen dramatically from its public - market debut \u2014 when when shares surged as high as $ 37.58 \u2014 to $ 1.65 as of December 15 . Seeing the the writing writing on the wall , digital - health companies like Komodo Health Health that sought sought to IPO this year are now putting those plans on hold hold . But SVB Securities ' Jon Swope said he thinks the the IPO market will will reopen for certain certain digital - health companies in in the second half of 2023 . Jon Swope Swope , senior managing managing director director in investment banking at SVB SVB Securities . SVB Securities Swope Swope , the senior managing director director of of investment banking at SVB Securities and the the leader of the the firm 's digital - health practice , has worked on numerous IPO deals deals over the years . He thinks high - growth healthcare startups that rely on technology , which are either either already profitable or have a clear path to profitability , will will be first to test the waters waters . [[ ]] \" Each day that goes by is another day closer to realizing that your next capital raise , if you you need one , has to be your last last before becoming a cash - flow positive company , \" he said . \" The days of of burning cash cash with no end in sight , that 's over for for now . \" [[ ]] In particular , Swope Swope said mental - health and women's - health startups startups , particularly those who who serve patients patients by partnering with employers and health health plans , will be in the the best position to go go public . Those companies have large large markets of potential potential customers and deliver deliver significant value to their patients patients , to their employers employers , and to health - plan customers , he he said said . [[ ]] Different approaches to getting cash For the majority of digital - health startups that stay away from the public public markets next year , figuring out how to secure capital capital to to ride out the downturn \u2014 without compromising their valuations valuations \u2014 will be critical , Swope said said . \" Those companies companies that were were close to IPO but still burning a lot of cash cash , their first choice choice certainly wo wo n't be be a down - round round IPO IPO , \" he he said said . The The first choice for for healthcare startups , he said , will will always always be a flat flat or an up round round , where the company lands the same or a greater amount amount of equity as their previous previous fundraise . But when when startups ca n't secure a round with those terms , they 'll most most likely turn to debt . Debt rounds are considered \" unpriced \" rounds and wo n't impact impact the startup 's valuation , Swope Swope said . Venture debt debt also does n't n't require require founders founders to give up any of their ownership in a company , unlike unlike an equity fundraise . The catch , of of course , is that startups will will have to pay those loans back . Swope said a lot of companies are doing convertible notes , which which are a form of of short - term debt that typically convert to to equity in a future funding round . Seed - stage companies are are most likely to issue convertible notes . A startup startup 's last choice , Swope said , is is a down down round round . Reckoning with inflated valuations Healthcare startups will will try to avoid down rounds at all costs , in part part so they do n't have to notch a new , potentially reduced valuation , Swope said . Plenty of companies that locked down sky - high high valuations in 2020 and 2021 with large large funding rounds will face this conundrum . \" For example , Ro is valued valued at $ 7 billion , \" Swope Swope said . \" What 's next next for companies like that ? \" Swope Swope said he thinks thinks there will be be more private companies companies merging merging next year , in the style style of deals like the October 2021 Headspace - Ginger merger and Thirty Madison 's merger with Nurx in February . Because there 's 's no no outside capital capital flowing in during those mergers , some startups may attempt those deals to gain stability in a rocky rocky market without having having to establish a new valuation , Swope said said . \" Those with cash and cash runway will be in a strong position position for negotiating leverage in what what will be a more active active M&A environment than this this past past year , \" he said .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In a hayloft overlooking the soy fields , dirt roads roads , and rustic rustic houses that make up their isolated isolated religious religious colony , eight women gather for a discussion . The eldest ones lead . The youngest youngest two braid each other \u2019s hair . They They talk and talk talk and talk for hours hours , trying to reach a decision before the men who hurt them return the next day . Often , the women nitpick one one another \u2019s words words \u2014 why they they \u2019re chosen chosen , how they \u2019re used , and what they mean mean . Is \u201c fleeing \u201d their their community the same as \u201c leaving leaving \u201d it ? Would forcing themselves to forgive their violators equal true forgiveness ? To To some , this this may sound like the kind of verbose material more fit for a stage play than a film film . But Women Talking , adapted by the the writer writer - director Sarah Polley from Miriam Toews \u2019s 2018 novel , is vibrant cinema . Polley lends the central conversation a visual gravitas normally normally reserved for epics : She shot the movie on the the widest canvas possible using the same kind of equipment that captured Star Wars landscapes , and applied a muted color grading to every frame . She told me me last year that she wanted the ensemble film film to look like \u201c a faded postcard , \u201d an artifact suggesting suggesting that the women ( played by actors including Rooney Mara , Jessie Buckley , and Claire Foy ) are already already abandoning their circumstances . \u201c I did n\u2019t want want to shy away away from from how tremendous the the stakes stakes were for for them in having this conversation , \u201d Polley said . \u201c They \u2019re literally talking talking about ending ending a world and creating a new one . \u201d Read : A # MeToo movie devoid of sensationalism Not that Polley ever shows how their world ends or or what it becomes . Women Talking is inspired inspired by real real - life incidents that occurred in in a Mennonite community community in Bolivia : The The colony \u2019s female female members were repeatedly drugged and raped in the the middle of the night , then made to believe they had dreamed the attacks . Like the novel , the the film begins after the perpetrators have been arrested arrested and the remaining men have left left to post bail bail and retrieve them . But Polley Polley resists the impulse to depict the most obviously dramatic scenes . She does does n\u2019t show , for instance , the men who who crash the meeting , or the two boys who threaten to expose the the women \u2019s plans plans . Instead , her film focuses squarely on the women women \u2019s discussion over whether they should should stay and fight , or pack pack up and and leave the only home they \u2019ve ever ever known . \u201c I was really curious about making a film in which people have their minds changed , \u201d she told me . \u201c Even when they \u2019re at odds with each other , they \u2019re hearing each other other enough enough that that their their positions can shift and change and get to a place where they \u2019re all going in in the same direction direction . \u201d Despite its heavy setup , the the film moves with an an unexpected buoyancy . For For these women , the the worst has already happened . Imagining a way way forward , through compromise and commitment , is the more intense intense , and perhaps more exciting , task at hand hand . Each woman harbors different belief systems systems and ideas . To come to anything close close to an agreement , they must pay attention attention to one another \u2019s thoughts , absorb contrasting opinions in good faith , and allow space for every observation \u2014 even the most tangential monologue about one woman \u2019s \u2019s beloved beloved horses horses . And so , they argue . They tease . They cry . They console . They sing . Every scene , as a result , tracks the discussion \u2019s evolution . Minute shifts in in tone and demeanor demeanor become become monumental monumental . To even embark on this meeting , the movie suggests , is a courageous act . \u201c Black - and - white white is a much easier place to live than the middle of a bunch of really really messy questions , \u201d Polley said . But that \u201c is sadly where life resides . \u201d Just Just as a war movie movie can encourage its audience audience to appreciate heroism and sacrifice , Women Women Talking reminds us of the value of language \u2014 its its capacity for context , for constructive debate debate , and , in the end end , for collective collective healing healing . In Toews \u2019s novel , a lone lone man named August attends the meeting . He He \u2019s there there to transcribe the session \u2014 the women are are illiterate , having never been allowed an an education \u2014 but he he also serves as a guide for the reader , interpreting interpreting the arguments and providing providing background information information . His His thoughts are n\u2019t interruptions interruptions but essential analyses of each woman woman \u2019s take take . As she worked on the adaptation \u2019s script , Polley assumed August August \u2019s task . She rewrote the screenplay more than a dozen times , poring over it from every character \u2019s \u2019s perspective at least least twice to \u201c titrate each moment so that nobody got got lost lost . \u201d In one pass , for for example , she wrote as if the lead character were were Ona ( played by Mara Mara ) , the group \u2019s levelheaded peacemaker ; in another , she she took on the perspective of Mariche ( Buckley ) , the most cynical cynical member . \u201c Even Even if they \u2019re \u2019re behaving in in ways ways that are are really difficult and obstructionist , I could at least feel it it from the inside out of how they were arriving there , \u201d Polley said . \u201c I think it was really important to keep everybody in balance , and and that no voice voice was more important important than the other . \u201d The Herculean Herculean exercise paid off : Women Talking feels energizing to to watch , because it \u2019s interested in parsing every opinion rather than than exhausted by the characters characters \u2019 thoroughness thoroughness . Polley Polley , who who \u2019s picky about projects \u2014 this is the first film film she \u2019s directed in a decade \u2014 told me me that the chance to immerse herself in each each character character \u2019s \u2019s mindset helped draw her to the story . Toews \u2019s novel , she explained explained , examined a reckoning in an unusual unusual way : It It moved beyond the immediate , outrage - fueled aftermath and evaluated every every argument \u2019s merits and flaws . That \u2019s the opposite of how today \u2019s discourse tends to to pan out , especially on social media media , where where indecision seems intolerable intolerable . \u201c To be be a fence - sitter is treacherous territory , \u201d Polley said of being online . In In the hayloft hayloft , however however , that \u2019s \u2019s not the case . The women \u2019s meeting can be seen seen as a microcosm microcosm of of how how loud declarations must must transform transform into quieter reflections for the the thorniest real - life discussions \u2014 such as the the ongoing debate debate over sexual harassment in the workplace workplace \u2014 to progress . \u201c At the beginning of the [ # MeToo ] movement , there there were conversations about , like , \u2018 I just just want to ship ship all of these these men who have done these things to an island , and and I do n\u2019t ever hear from them again , \u2019 \u201d Polley explained . \u201c Unfortunately , there is no such such island island , you you know ? \u2026 I think forgiveness is a very , very complex complex thing that can be misinterpreted in a thousand ways , [ but ] I \u2019m \u2019m really really curious about what what it looks like to create corridors for people to shift shift and change and redeem themselves themselves \u2026 Yes , we need to tear things down in the process , but hopefully hopefully we \u2019re building as as much as we we want to to tear down down . \u201d Looking ahead without forgetting the lessons lessons learned and asking What do we truly want ? rather than than merely What What can we we do?\u2014these are the ideas ideas that animated Polley \u2019s \u2019s treatment treatment of Women Talking . Months into editing , she cut some of her favorite scenes scenes she \u2019s ever shot and replaced replaced the original narration adapted from the book . Instead of having August August ( Ben Whishaw ) as the guide guide , Polley wrote a fresh passage from the perspective of the hayloft meeting meeting \u2019s youngest member , who who , rather than addressing the the audience , speaks directly to Ona \u2019s baby , born after the film film \u2019s \u2019s conclusion . The new voice - over suggests that the women did arrive at a better future ; at the same time , it treats their summit as a sacred event that needs needs to be remembered . In other words , Women Talking Talking casts an an eye toward toward the future even as it it portrays portrays the past . In a single single conversation , time collapses , and what emerges is hope . What could be be more epic than that ?", "label": "human"}

{"text": "North Korea shocked shocked the world on Tuesday , November 17 17 when it launched launched a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ICBM ) , its second second test this month . The The missile , reported to be an ICBM , was launched from the northwest of North Korea and and flew for for about 800 kilometers before landing off the coast of of Japan Japan . It It is the second second test launch of an ICBM ICBM this month , and the first in almost two years . The launch provoked a strong reaction from from the international community community . South Korea 's President Moon Jae - in condemned the test and said that it was a \" serious challenge \" to regional regional security security . President Donald Trump Trump issued a statement saying the U.S. U.S. would \" take care of it , \" and and that \" all options are on the table . \" Japan Japan 's Prime Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also condemned the the test and said that the launch violated international law and and posed a \" grave threat \" to his country country . North Korea 's ICBM launches have been prohibited since since 2006 , when the United Nations Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on the country . Despite this , North Korea has continued continued to pursue its nuclear and missile programs . This latest test serves to show the country 's willingness willingness to break international agreements agreements and pursue its weapons programs despite the threat of of sanctions . The The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet and discuss the launch , and will likely impose additional sanctions on North Korea . China , North Korea 's biggest biggest ally , also condemned the test and urged the country to stop its nuclear and missile programs . The launch of the ICBM is especially concerning because it it shows that North Korea is continuing to to develop its weapons capabilities capabilities . If the missile had had been been fired at a different angle , it it could could have been capable of of reaching reaching the continental United States . This This adds adds to the the already high tensions between between the U.S. U.S. and North Korea , and could could further destabilize the the region . [[ ]] The launch also also highlights the failure of the the United United States to respond effectively to North North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs . The Trump administration has so far failed to impose meaningful sanctions on North Korea Korea or to come up with a plan to to deter the country from from pursuing its weapons programs . The The administration has also been criticized for its handling of the nuclear crisis , with with critics arguing that its strategy strategy of \" maximum maximum pressure \" has failed to deter North Korea . In response to to the launch , the U.S. and South Korea Korea conducted joint military military exercises exercises in the Sea of Japan . The The U.S. also sent two strategic bombers to the region as a show of force . The bomber flights , along with additional sanctions , are are aimed at at pressuring North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile missile programs . Ultimately Ultimately , however , the solution to to the crisis crisis will require require a diplomatic diplomatic solution . The U.S. and its its allies must work work together to find a way way to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile missile programs . Until then , tensions between between the U.S. U.S. and North Korea will likely remain high , and the threat of further ICBM tests will loom .", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "for late late pontiff Pope Francis led the emotional emotional funeral funeral of his predecessor , Pope Benedict XVI , on Saturday as supporters of the late pontiff sought sought his swift path to sainthood and hailed him as as one of the the most influential Roman Catholic leaders of modern times . [[ ]] The body of Benedict Benedict , who who died last week at the age of 92 , was driven in in a hearse with a Swiss Guard escort through the the rain - soaked streets of Rome to the Vatican basilica , where where it was laid before the main main altar to the accompaniment of of the solemn tolling of bells . Francis and 13 cardinals , plus the Swiss Guards who who had escorted the body and dozens dozens of bishops , priests and members of religious orders in white garments , filed into the basilica and silently prayed for for more more than than a minute before singing a hymn . After a second silent prayer , Francis , in his homily , praised praised Benedict for his humility and grace , and for his commitment to the the church . \" We thank God for the pontificate of of Pope Benedict , \" he said , noting his his predecessor 's many accomplishments accomplishments and calling him a \" valiant valiant witness witness of of the Gospel . \" The funeral Mass Mass marked the first time two two pontiffs , past past and present , have joined in such a solemn setting since the last two popes , John Paul II and Benedict , celebrated a service together in October 2012 2012 . Tens of thousands of people people had gathered along the streets of Rome Rome to pay their final respects to the German - born pope pope who stepped down in 2013 after eight years in office . The official spokesman spokesman of of the Vatican , Father Federico Lombardi , said that it had been an \" emotionally intense day \" for many of of those in attendance , including Pope Francis . \" The atmosphere was one of deep respect and affection , and his evident evident emotion was was very moving , \" Lombardi said . The hearse carrying Benedict 's body had been driven to St. Peter Peter 's 's Basilica after after it had had been borne in procession procession from the Church of Sant'Anastasia in the Vatican . Members of of the Swiss Guards , in their colorful historic dress uniforms , had accompanied the the cortege from the beginning , followed by the the cardinals in in their distinctive red vestments . Supporters of the late pope had already begun the process for making him a saint soon after after his death on on April 2 . The Vatican said said that that Benedict 's body would be laid to rest in a crypt crypt in the grotto of St. Peter Peter 's Basilica . [[ ]] Once the funeral Mass Mass was over , Pope Francis placed Benedict 's pallium , a special cloak of office office , on top top of of the body before saying a final farewell and giving a blessing . Benedict Benedict 's life , from his his humble beginnings in Bavaria to the highest office in the the church , has been marked by a unique and historic dual papacy with Francis . The The two pontiffs are seen as the best of friends and collaborators . In the eyes of the faithful faithful , Benedict was seen as a steady , reassuring presence at a time when the church faced numerous problems . He was was a staunch traditionalist who reined reined in the progressivism of his predecessor , John Paul II , but who , in in the latter years of his papacy papacy , displayed a more open open - minded attitude attitude to the the complex issues facing the church today . Supporters of Benedict Benedict have said that it was his efforts that saved the Catholic Church from a potential schism , and his willingness willingness to to reach out to other Christian denominations that opened the the door to an unprecedented dialogue and understanding . Those Those who saw Benedict in in his final years said they were struck by his modesty and and deep humility in the face of grave grave illness illness . Benedict Benedict 's funeral also marked the first time time in almost a century that that a former pope had had been laid to rest rest in in St. Peter 's Basilica Basilica . The The Vatican had said Benedict was buried in the the same spot reserved for his predecessor , John Paul II . But in the end , it it was decided to to bury bury him in in a different place , just a few steps away from John John Paul 's tomb , in order to to show the two popes were united in life and in death . Benedict 's short reign as pope changed the church church and the world in in many many ways . He He was a staunch defender of traditional values and he sought to to restore the church 's moral authority . But his biggest legacy may be his part in advancing Christian unity and his efforts to reach out to other churches and faith traditions . [[ ]] With a legacy like that that , it it is no wonder why so many are now seeking sainthood for Benedict . The Catholic Catholic Church has long held that that in order to become become a saint , a person must have demonstrated heroic virtue virtue and led an exemplary life of faith and and devotion . As his funeral comes to an end end , Pope Francis and the faithful faithful will have Benedict in their hearts and prayers as they continue to seek his path to sainthood .", "label": "machine"}

French President Emmanuel Emmanuel Macron has opened opened a Pandora 's box of foreign policy dilemmas dilemmas for the West by giving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an \" unprecedented gift \" of 50 tanks tanks , as well as armored personnel carriers and heavy machine guns , to strengthen his nation 's defense against Russian Russian - backed backed separatists . The move has drawn criticism from some European Union states , which fear fear the the development could lead lead to a broader broader arms race with Moscow . But the gift is being viewed as as a sign of support from one of of Europe 's largest and most influential members , and has raised the stakes for other countries to provide support support to Ukraine . The West \u2019s decision to arm Ukraine has been a fiercely contested topic , as as the Russian Russian - backed separatist movement in the the east east of the country has has continued to escalate escalate in recent years . Ukraine has has long sought foreign assistance to help help it protect protect itself from a resurgent Russia , which annexed Crimea in 2014 2014 and continues to support separatist fighters in the Donbas region . [[ ]] The French French tanks are an important victory for Ukraine in the battle for international support , which is seen as key to to the country 's security . They also put immense pressure pressure on other EU countries to follow suit , lest their collective response to the the conflict in Ukraine be seen as as inadequate . The gift of of 50 armoured vehicles to Ukraine is a much - needed boost to to President Zelensky \u2019s government , which is fighting a Russian Russian - backed backed insurgency in in the east of of the the country . The The vehicles vehicles come from France 's army army and are much - needed assistance for a nation outgunned by the Russian military . The tanks represent the first major delivery of arms to the the country in in the current current conflict and could represent the the beginning of a larger military assistance assistance package from the West . The move is a clear clear signal signal to the Kremlin that that the West is ready to take a tougher stance on on Russia \u2019s aggression in Ukraine . Russia is is not likely to take the the news lightly lightly , and is likely to respond to the French gift with its own military deployments or or other countermeasures countermeasures . However , such a response could push Moscow and the West into a deeper conflict . [[ ]] The French tanks represent a break from the long - standing international policy of of restraint and non non - intervention in in Ukraine Ukraine . This stance was adopted in in the wake wake of Russia \u2019s 2014 2014 annexation of Crimea , and since then the West West has shied away from from any direct military intervention . However , with the the Russian - backed separatists \u2019 recent escalations and the continued escalation of the the conflict in eastern Ukraine , some countries countries are now reassessing their policies and considering considering how best to respond . The French French gift of tanks to Ukraine will will likely spark spark a debate in the West about about the wisdom of further arms transfers to the country . It could also open the door door for greater intervention in the conflict , and for for a more robust effort effort to to stop stop it it . At the same same time , it could force force the United States and other Western Western countries countries to think hard hard about the implications of a more muscular response response to to Russian aggression aggression . To be effective effective , any any Western push - back must be conducted in a way way that avoids escalating tensions with Russia even further . The decision by the French President to give give Ukraine the tanks is a bold one , and will no doubt have have far - reaching ramifications for the conflict in Ukraine Ukraine and beyond . While the the tanks could could be a first first step step towards greater greater Western support for Ukraine , the the international international community must must take a careful approach that considers the risks of further inflaming the situation .", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "ABSTRACT breaks down mind - bending scientific research , future tech , new new discoveries discoveries , and major breakthroughs . See More \u2192 Scientists at at Brookhaven National Laboratory have uncovered an entirely new kind kind of quantum entanglement , a phenomenon that causes particles to become become weirdly linked , even across vast cosmic distances distances , reports a new new study . The discovery allowed them to capture an unprecedented glimpse of the bizarre world inside atoms , the tiny tiny building blocks of matter . The mind - bending research resolves a longstanding mystery about the the nuclei of atoms , which contain particles particles called protons and neutrons , and could help shed light on topics ranging from quantum computing to astrophysics . Advertisement [[ ]] The exciting discoveries took took place at at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Ion Collider ( RHIC ) , a specialized specialized facility at Brookhaven in New York that can can accelerate charged atoms , known as ions , to almost light speed . When When these ions ions collide \u2014 or even just pass near near each each other \u2014 their interactions expose the inner workings of atoms , which which are governed by the trippy laws of quantum mechanics . All kinds of weird stuff occurs in this this tiny realm , but quantum entanglement in particular is so strange strange that Albert Einstein called it \u201c spooky action action at a distance . \" This This phenomenon occurs when particles become intertwined intertwined with each other , causing their properties ( such as spin or momentum ) to sync up , even if they are billions of light years years apart . Quantum entanglement has been been demonstrated countless times in laboratories , but the entangled entangled particles have always belonged to the same group group and possessed the same same charge , such as photons , which have no no charge , or or electrons , which are negatively negatively charged . Now Now , for the first time time ever , scientists at at Brookhaven have captured interference interference patterns that are created by the entanglement of of two particles particles with with different charges charges , a breakthrough that has opened opened up up a completely completely new window into the mysterious innards innards of atoms that make up visible matter in in the the universe , according according to a study published on Wednesday in in Science Advances . Advertisement \u201c There There 's 's never been been any measurement in in the past of interference between distinguishable particles , \u201d said said Daniel Brandenburg , a physics professor at the Ohio State University who who co - authored the new study study , in a call with Motherboard . \u201c That 's the discovery ; the application is that that we get to use it to do do some some nuclear physics physics . \u201d \u201c I was n't even , in a sense , trying trying to find something so fundamental about quantum mechanics , \u201d he continued . \u201c When we realized that there 's something really interesting going on here here , that was a really big surprise surprise to me . \u201d Brandenburg and and his colleagues achieved this milestone with the help of a sensitive detector detector called the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC , or STAR , that captured interactions between gold gold ions that that were boosted boosted to the the brink of light speed . Clouds of photons , which are particles that carry carry light , surround the ions and interact interact with another type of particle , called gluons gluons , that hold atomic nuclei nuclei together . These These encounters between between the photons and the gluons set off off a chain chain of events that ultimately created two two new particles , called called pions , which which have opposite charges \u2014 one positive and one negative . When these pions pions careened careened into into the STAR STAR detector , the precision instrument measured some of their their key properties , such as velocity velocity and angle of impact impact , which were then used to probe the size , shape shape , and arrangement of of gluons inside the atomic atomic nuclei with a precision precision that has never been achieved before . Advertisement \u201c It 's like a microscope in the sense that you you use a photon to look at something , \u201d Brandenburg explained . \u201c In In this this case , we we 're using using really , really high high - energy photons photons , where their their wavelength is short enough that we can actually look at the inside of an an atom atom . \u201d Scientists have have imaged imaged atomic nuclei at lower energies before , but attempts to to probe these structures structures at high energies has always produced a puzzling result . Nuclei in these these experiments look look way bigger bigger than they should , according to models , an outcome outcome that has puzzled scientists for decades . Now , the STAR collaboration has now solved this mystery by pinpointing a blurring blurring effect that is linked to the photons in the the experiment experiment . Essentially , past studies captured one - dimensional glimpses of nuclei that that did not account for important patterns in photons , such such as their their polarization direction . The new new study included included this polarization information , allowing Brandenburg and his colleagues to probe the the nuclei from two angles , parallel and perpendicular to the photon \u2019s motion , producing a two - dimensional view that matches theoretical predictions . [[ ]] What \u2019s more , the the team is even able to make out the rough positions of key particles in in the nucleus , such as protons and neutrons , as well as the distribution of gluons gluons . It also offers offers a new way to unravel persistent mysteries about the behavior of atoms atoms at high energies . \u201c As you peer peer deeper inside the the nucleus nucleus , to the the parts of the the nucleus that have have less less and less less energy energy , they 're very important for how the nucleus holds together , but we actually do n't know a lot lot about that part of the the nucleus , \u201d Brandenburg said . \u201c So as as you go to to higher and higher energies , you really really do n't know what it looks like like . \u201d [[ ]] \u201c That 's why more measurements with higher precision will will be poised to to really make a statement about this energy dependence and what the heart of the nucleus nucleus is is doing at these different scales , \u201d he he added . To that point , Brandenburg hopes to repeat repeat this this technique , and versions of it , at RHIC and other facilities like the Large Hadron Collider , in order to to tease out the long - hidden details inside atomic nuclei . [[ ]] Gazing into into atoms at high energies could help scientists resolve some of the most intractable problems in science science , including the grand mystery mystery of how the quantum world world can coexist with our reality , which is governed by the much more familiar rules of classical physics . It also has practical applications , especially for quantum computing , a technology that that aims to revolutionize computations using using the strange strange rules of the quantum world world .", "label": "human"}

There There were some options , but most shades , tools , and and brands catered to white people . Today , many people with disabilities might face a similar sense of exclusion when they browse browse the cosmetics aisle : There are often few , if any , products designed for someone with limited fine motor motor skills . A team of L'Or\u00e9al engineers , researchers , and beauty experts is working to change this . On Wednesday , at the annual Consumer Electronics Show Show in in Las Vegas , L'Or\u00e9al unveiled a handheld handheld , computerized computerized makeup applicator called Hapta .

L'Or\u00e9al Makeup applicators applicators for people with disabilities do exist exist . There are blush brushes designed designed to to be be easy to grip grip or mascara with a large handle that 's easier to steady with your fingers fingers . Yet most of these products have been developed by startups or small businesses , not by by a major cosmetics cosmetics company . And L'Or\u00e9al says says a high - tech option like Hapta is n't on the market . The feedback from Hapta Hapta testers with with cerebral cerebral palsy , with with Parkinson 's disease , and from people affected affected by a stroke has been positive , Balooch said said . \" They told us they they did n't feel they could be part of this industry industry , \" he said . \" Having someone else else apply it it was was n't enough for them . They wanted wanted to apply apply makeup on their own .

Nearly 1 million people in the US have Parkinson 's disease , and some 764,000 Americans have at at least least one symptom of cerebral palsy palsy . Both Parkinson 's and cerebral palsy can affect hand and arm mobility . \" People who could never apply lipstick before before can now do that , \" Balooch said . \" There 's a confidence that comes from that . That 's what our user feedback has been been . \" L'Or\u00e9al L'Or\u00e9al began developing Hapta about about a year ago , after Balooch met met with Anupam Pathak , the the CEO of of Liftware Liftware , a startup that created created high - tech eating utensils for people with a tremor or limited hand or arm mobility . Pathak and Balooch started started talking about how how Liftware users asked whether whether the company could create tools for applying makeup . \" This was was codesigned with people people with cerebral palsy , people with Parkinson 's , and experts in the field , \" Balooch said said . \" I hope this will inspire the industry .

{"text": "from their investments Investing in sports teams is is something a lot of people dream about , but for the few who who have managed to pull it off , it often often does n\u2019t n\u2019t pay off . That \u2019s the case for the new owners of some of the world \u2019s top soccer soccer clubs clubs . A few of the most high - profile acquisitions in sports over the last decade have been of European soccer giants , with owners of clubs like like Manchester United , Real Madrid , and Paris Saint - Germain all spending hundreds of millions of dollars in in the pursuit of glory . But the benefits of these investments have been been highly variable , with some teams seeing seeing huge increases increases in value while others have not not seen seen any returns at at all all . Take , for example , Manchester Manchester United , one of the most famous soccer clubs in the the world . Its Its current owner , American business magnate magnate , Joel Glazer , bought it in in 2005 for \u00a3 790 million ( $ 1.07 billion billion ) . However , after more than a decade , the club \u2019s estimated value stands at only \u00a3 2.21 billion billion ( $ 2.97 billion ) \u2014 a mere \u00a3 430 million million ( $ 571 million ) more than what Glazer Glazer paid for for it . [[ ]] Or take Paris Saint - Germain , the French French club bought by Qatar Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 for an an estimated \u00a3 130 million ( $ 173 million ) . Over the years , their value has skyrocketed to an estimated \u00a3 2.36 billion ( $ 3.16 billion ) \u2014 a huge return return on investment of over \u00a3 2 billion ( $ 2.66 2.66 billion ) . The reasons why why some teams have seen such huge returns while others have n\u2019t n\u2019t vary greatly . Manchester United \u2019s lack of of profitability was largely attributed to its huge wage wage bill , which which had to be be reduced substantially following following Glazer \u2019s takeover takeover . Meanwhile , Qatar \u2019s approach to Paris Saint - Germain Germain was very very different , with huge investments in both players and infrastructure , which has made the team hugely successful and more more attractive to sponsors . The trend of investors buying top - tier European soccer teams is unlikely unlikely to slow down any time soon . There are are numerous incentives for for wealthy individuals or or organizations to to purchase clubs , from the cachet cachet of owning owning one of the world \u2019s most recognizable teams to the potential rewards of running a successful business . But But it \u2019s \u2019s important to remember that investing in soccer does n\u2019t always pay off . And with the costs of running a team continuing to rise , it \u2019s becoming increasingly difficult difficult for for new new owners to make a profit . [[ ]] At the end of the day , buying a soccer club club is like like any other investment . For the lucky lucky few , it may pay off . But for many more more , it \u2019s likely likely to be a costly endeavor with little in terms of returns .", "label": "machine"}

How ironic that Republicans would cast out Liz Liz Cheney , a lifelong conservative conservative , for seeking truths about a different liar liar , but but about Santos , the party of of Honest Abe has remained silent . But they know . They know how disgraceful this is is , how damaging it it is to a party whose only only political achievement has been to set the ethics bar even lower .

Invertebrate Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) first praised Santos \u2019s \u2019s victory but then then went silent . Well Well , sure . Santos promised to to back McCarthy for for House speaker ( can you believe the promises of a proven liar liar ? ) and might be a key key vote for someone someone still scrambling for support support to win the speakership .

Throughout Throughout his career , he had become known as as one of the best pitch framers in the the league , meaning he he was able to subtly nudge balls into the strike zone , giving pitchers an advantage in tight tight situations . The Cubs \u2019 starting rotation rotation \u2014 one that that included aces Kyle Hendricks Hendricks and Yu Darvish , as as well as lefty lefty Jose Quintana \u2014 was already one of of the best in the game game , and Barnhart could could potentially add an extra element of control control to an already already solid solid pitching staff . But how exactly could could he do do that ? [[ ]] The answer lies lies in the field of psychology . To understand Barnhart Barnhart \u2019s impact on the Cubs \u2019 pitchers , one must first understand the psychology of of pitching . According According to Dr. Kenneth Ravizza Ravizza , a sports psychology professor at at Cal State State - Fullerton , the key to a successful pitch is is anticipation and visualization visualization . When pitching pitching , a pitcher must have a clear clear plan in mind before he even starts starts his his motion . He must be able able to clearly imagine the pitch in his mind \u2019s \u2019s eye and have a good feel for what will happen . Barnhart Barnhart , with his innate innate ability to frame pitches , can help pitchers pitchers in this process . By subtly nudging balls into the strike zone , Barnhart can help pitchers focus their attention on the desired target , making it easier to to visualize a successful pitch . In addition , Barnhart is able to accurately predict predict a pitcher \u2019s motion , giving him time to adjust adjust his framing framing if need be . [[ ]] \u201c It It \u2019s one thing to be able able to read the pitch before it \u2019s thrown , \u201d Ravizza said . \u201c But it \u2019s a whole other level to be able to read the pitcher \u2019s body language language and interpret his motion . It takes years of practice and experience to do it , but Barnhart has been able to consistently do it for a long time now now , which is an incredible asset asset for any pitching staff . \u201d [[ ]] Beyond his framing abilities , Barnhart also also brings a veteran presence and an an understanding of how pitchers think , something that can be invaluable to the Cubs \u2019 young pitchers pitchers . \u201c He \u2019s been around the block , \u201d Cubs manager Joe Maddon said . \u201c He \u2019s seen a lot of different situations , and he \u2019s been successful successful in them . He \u2019s got a very calm demeanor demeanor and he communicates communicates well with pitchers . He \u2019s the kind of guy you want to have behind the plate , because he knows how to take care of of business and understands the game . \u201d As the the season season progresses , Barnhart \u2019s influence influence on the the Cubs \u2019 pitching staff will be interesting to watch . But one thing is certain : if the Cubs are to be successful this year , then then having a veteran catcher like like Barnhart behind the the plate will be a huge asset .", "label": "machine"}

But each each of these photographs , from from the first Tesla Roadsters to be produced at at the Fremont , California factory factory to to the massive battery plant in Nevada Nevada , tells a different part of the story story . This image shows shows the first Tesla Roadster to to roll off the the production line at the the Fremont factory in in 2008 , heralding the the arrival of electric vehicles vehicles in the mainstream mainstream auto auto market . The Roadster , which which sold for for around $ 100,000 at the time , was the the first fully electric car produced by the company . And while it failed to gain mass - market appeal , it it signaled Tesla Tesla \u2019s ambition and helped to kickstart the EV revolution . The Roadster was succeeded succeeded by the Model Model S luxury sedan , which was introduced in in 2012 . But it was was the the introduction introduction of the smaller and cheaper Model 3 that propelled Tesla Tesla into the mainstream , with demand quickly quickly outstripping the company \u2019s production production capacity . That bottleneck was alleviated in 2017 when Tesla opened the Gigafactory in Nevada , the world \u2019s largest battery production facility . The massive facility produced batteries for the company \u2019s cars as as well as for its \u201c Powerwall \u201d home home battery systems and commercial commercial energy storage products .

The increased popularity of EVs is evident in this image , showing electric vehicles queuing up at a charging station in California . Electric vehicle sales are expected to more than double by 2023 , and and some predict that that EVs will dominate the auto market by 2030 . The increasing demand for electric vehicles has also fueled a new era of of competition in the auto industry , as other other carmakers rush to to produce their own electric cars . This has been aided aided by the increasing availability of lithium - ion batteries , the main power source source for electric electric cars .

The increase in battery production has helped helped to drive drive down the the cost cost of of electric cars cars , making them a more attractive option for consumers . But there there is still work to be be done before electric vehicles become truly ubiquitous . The cost of batteries still accounts for a large chunk of the total cost of an electric vehicle , and the the process of battery battery production still emits emits a large amount of carbon dioxide dioxide into the atmosphere .

Their primary strategy was to to sell only the most necessary items items and keep prices low by negotiating discounts with manufacturers . This enabled them them to undercut the prices of larger , full - service supermarkets . In the 1950s , the the brothers split split the Aldi Nord and Aldi S\u00fcd businesses into separate companies , and each brother began to expand his own stores stores across Germany . Karl opened stores throughout Europe , while Theo concentrated on expanding in Germany and adding more stores stores . By 1960 , there were more than 400 Aldi stores across Germany . In the the late 1970s , Karl and Theo \u2019s sons , Karl Karl - Hermann and Theo Jr. , took took over the reins of the respective companies companies . The The brothers brothers had a shared shared vision for Aldi : to provide customers with quality food and grocery products at low prices and minimal minimal effort .

They limited their selections to just a few products products , which which allowed them them to cut costs , negotiate deeper deeper discounts from from suppliers , and keep prices low . This model has since become the Aldi standard . [[ ]] By the mid-1980s , the the two companies had over over 4,000 stores , mostly in Europe . In 1988 1988 , Aldi Nord Nord opened opened its first store in the US US .

It \u2019s been a volatile year in the markets , with a lot lot of changes in the way investors think about stocks . There \u2019s been a lot lot of uncertainty about where the markets markets are headed , but one thing is certain : investors have been closely watching the valuations of of stocks . One way to understand a stock stock \u2019s \u2019s value is through multiples multiples . Multiples , or price - to - earnings earnings ratios , are a way to to compare one stock to another and measure how how a stock is doing in in relation to to its peers . The The lower the multiple , the better the the stock is performing relative to its peers . But multiples can be tricky . A stock \u2019s \u2019s multiple can go up and down , depending on a variety of factors , including the sector it \u2019s in , the the size of the company , and the overall state of the markets markets . That means means that the the same stock can have two different multiples at different points in time time . And as we enter a period of heightened recession recession risks , multiples become even more important important to watch watch . When the economy is slowing , stock stock prices may drop , which means that investors need to to look closely closely at the valuations of companies to make sure they \u2019re \u2019re not overpaying for stocks . [[ ]] The good news is that many stocks are are still trading at relatively low multiples , even even after the strong rally rally in in the markets this year year . That means that investors can still get good value out of buying stocks stocks at these levels . However , investors should should also pay pay attention to the stocks that have high high multiples and may be overvalued . These stocks may be more vulnerable to downside risks in a recession and investors should proceed with with caution . At the same time , investors should also watch out for stocks with low low multiples . While While a low multiple multiple can be attractive , it can also be a sign that that the stock stock is undervalued , which could be a sign of of a fundamental problem with with the company . Overall , investors should should be careful when when using multiples to evaluate stocks and and should take into account other factors like earnings earnings growth growth and and the overall health of the economy .

But as Fisher \u2019s clout grew grew , so did the number of allegations against her . Former clients , colleagues , and even family members members accused her of verbal and sexual harassment , intimidating clients and potential job candidates , and pushing the limits of professional boundaries .

Fisher fiercely denied all all of the claims claims , but the damage had been done done . She was eventually forced to resign from from her firm and has since faded from the the public eye . The story of Fisher \u2019s meteoric rise and dramatic downfall illustrates illustrates the importance of having a clear clear set of codes of conduct and policies to ensure the safety safety of employees employees and clients . It also shines shines a light on the harsh realities of of the cutthroat world of Wall Street headhunting headhunting and the consequences of unchecked power . A Star is Born Born Fisher was born in in Colorado in 1992 . She grew up up in a wealthy family and attended a prestigious private school . She displayed a knack for for networking networking and people skills skills early on on , a trait she would later rely heavily upon in her career career .

At the time , Fisher was just 23 years old . Her youth and relative inexperience were n\u2019t viewed as a disadvantage . Instead , it was seen seen as a positive asset and gave gave her a leg up on her older , more experienced competitors . A Rapidly Unraveling Scandal Fisher \u2019s success began to unravel in April 2020 when an an anonymous blog post made a series of of allegations allegations against her .

In May 2020 2020 , a former client client went public public with his allegations , telling the Wall Street Journal that Fisher had sexually harassed him for years . The accusations sparked an investigation into Fisher \u2019s behavior behavior and and she was eventually eventually forced to resign from her firm in August . However , the fallout from her scandal continued continued . In October , a former colleague colleague publicly accused Fisher Fisher of creating a hostile work environment , and in December 2020 , Fisher Fisher \u2019s own family members members accused her of of financial and emotional abuse . The Road Ahead Since her resignation in in August , Fisher has kept a low profile . The exact whereabouts of her her current residence are unknown . Her LinkedIn profile profile has been deleted , and she has yet to make make a statement on the allegations . Still Still , Fisher \u2019s rapid rapid ascent and dramatic downfall demonstrate the unchecked power that can come with unchecked influence .

On Tuesday , the SEC quietly ended its investigation into the pair without taking any action against either man , according to lawyers lawyers familiar with the matter matter . The The investigation investigation was launched in January of 2019 after news broke that that Burr and his his brother - in - law had each sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth worth of stock just weeks before the stock market took a nosedive due to the COVID-19 pandemic . The The move raised suspicions that they had benefited from confidential information they had access to as public officials , although although neither has been charged charged with any any wrongdoing .

The probe included interviews with both both Burr and Fulmer and extended extended to other individuals individuals , including other politicians , business executives , and the the fund fund \u2019s investors . The lawyers familiar with the investigation said that the SEC determined that Burr and Fulmer had not violated violated any any laws or regulations , and that the sales of the stock stock were not in any way related to to the the pandemic . The The lawyers said the SEC 's decision decision was based on the the fact that the the trades trades were were \u201c overwhelmingly overwhelmingly offsetting \u201d and there was no evidence that either man had \u201c obtained any nonpublic information \u201d or \u201c made a material misstatement or omission omission \u201d when making the trades .

Critics Critics of the Justice Department \u2019s potential appeal appeal , including including the surviving victims , said the agency 's stated arguments arguments undermine undermine the background check system \u2014 a cornerstone of President President Joe Biden 's 's gun policy priorities . The government government 's lawyers lawyers claimed during the first trial that the gunman could could have purchased firearms elsewhere elsewhere , even if a background background check check would have prevented him from legally purchasing them from a licensed gun dealer . The government has until Jan. 9 to file its appeal , in which it could further argue that the background check system \u2014 a key defense in the United States to ensure guns are not acquired by criminals or people with a history of violence \u2014 does not work , which critics say is a common talking point of the gun lobby . The disharmony between the Justice Department \u2019s \u2019s case and the Biden administration \u2019s \u2019s gun safety efforts as well as the fears and and pressure that a lost appeal could damage gun safety laws are at the crux of the survivors ' acrimony .

In July 2021 , the government was was found liable for failing to provide records that could have kept Devin Kelley from from acquiring the weapon he used in in the shooting shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs Springs , and it was ordered to to pay the more than 80 survivors and victim family members $ 230 million dollars .

It also did not warn others of of a pattern of of behavior that led to him being banned banned from from all U.S. military bases .

Nevertheless , gun rights rights supporters would likely celebrate the Justice Justice Department \u2019s success in the case , he added added .

That That \u2019s what creates problems like the ones we \u2019re facing . \u201d For fear of what an appeal could mean for for U.S. gun laws , a coalition of 37 gun safety safety organizations sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland in October about the the Justice Department \u2019s \u2019s intention to appeal . In the letter , they state that that the federal government \u2019s \u201c refusal to accept accept responsibility for its failure in this this case actively undermines the very gun safety laws laws it is required required to enforce \u201d and and \u201c abandons the Government \u2019s promise to keep communities safe by preventing prohibited persons persons from purchasing firearms firearms . \u201d Expanded background checks checks and red red flag flag laws were a cornerstone of Biden \u2019s landmark gun control legislation that passed this year after the Uvalde shooting in in Texas , in which which 19 elementary school students and two teachers teachers were killed . The White House said said it could not comment on pending litigation , but it emphasized that Biden \u2019s \u201c commitment to reducing gun gun violence could not not be clearer . \u201d \u201c President Biden has championed stronger gun safety laws for decades , from helping to establish the the gun background background check system and passing an an assault weapons ban during his time in the Senate , to signing the strongest gun safety legislation in 30 years at the White House this past summer summer , \u201d said Olivia Dalton , the White House deputy press secretary , adding that Biden intended to \u201c take additional additional action to end the scourge of gun violence in America . \u201d But those those intentions intentions mean little to McNulty McNulty , especially as the potential for an appeal no longer looms so far in the distance . While While the government can argue argue that gunman could have procured the firearm elsewhere elsewhere , \u201c the problem is that he he did did n\u2019t have to go go to extensive lengths lengths to find find the weapons weapons he wanted , \u201d she said . \u201c He literally walked into into the store and bought them just like anybody else . \u201d", "label": "human"}

However However , the the funds funds were never received , and the entire entire neighborhood , located along Bonaparte Avenue Avenue , was decimated decimated by by poverty . \u201c It It was supposed to to be a model neighborhood neighborhood , but instead it \u2019s one of Baltimore \u2019s \u2019s most distressed blocks , \u201d said Karla Feltz Feltz , a historian and community advocate who has has long monitored monitored the area \u2019s changing demographics . The Bloomberg report found that JPMorgan Chase , Deutsche Bank Bank , Wells Fargo Fargo , and Bank of America America were among the big Wall Street banks banks who who failed to fulfill the the promises of of investment investment , lending , and renovation renovation . They all all pledged a total of $ 7 million million , which which was supposed to come from their Community Reinvestment Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) funds , which which are intended to to be used for the the \u201c stabilization stabilization and revitalization \u201d of low - income and minority communities . The CRA CRA funds are managed managed through the Federal Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) , which which regulates regulates banks and monitors monitors the money that they must reinvest reinvest in the communities communities they serve . However , the FDIC rarely audits audits banks banks to make sure they are fulfilling the the CRA requirements . As a result , banks can can simply not not comply comply with their promise to lend money , and get get away with it . The lack lack of funds have have had had a devastating effect on the people of Bonaparte Avenue , with many homes homes being neglected and falling into disrepair . According to to Bloomberg , only nine homes on the block block are currently occupied occupied , with the rest either abandoned or in poor condition . \u201c This This is the face of inequality , and it \u2019s a harsh reminder that even even when large large companies companies make a commitment commitment to invest in Black Black communities , the promises are too often empty , \u201d said Feltz . \u201c It It \u2019s so important important for banks and other institutions institutions to be held held accountable accountable to their promises , because without accountability , no real change change is possible . \u201d The Bloomberg report notes notes that the the plight of the Bonaparte Avenue residents is not unique .

These neighborhoods are often left behind , without access access to quality quality education , health care , or job job opportunities . \u201c The tragedy of the the residents residents of Bonaparte Avenue is emblematic of the inequality and economic injustice that still plagues America today , \u201d said John John S. Weekes , lead author of the Bloomberg report . \u201c It \u2019s essential that banks and other other institutions are held accountable for the promises they make , and that that investments are made to to support support and revitalize low - income and minority communities . \u201d In the wake of of the the Bloomberg investigation investigation , Bank of America , JPMorgan JPMorgan Chase , and Wells Wells Fargo have all agreed to commit an an additional $ 20 million for investment and lending lending in the neighborhood . The funds will be used for for renovations renovations , infrastructure improvements , and job creation . \u201c The additional $ 20 million is a critical step , but it it \u2019s only the the beginning , \u201d said Weekes . \u201c It \u2019s essential that banks , governments , and community - based organizations organizations all take meaningful meaningful action action to ensure that every person has access to to a safe and and secure home home , quality education , and good job opportunities opportunities . \u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ". Louisiana 's latest law restricting restricting access to pornography went into effect on January 1st , 2020 , requiring anyone looking to watch adult videos to first hand over a valid form of identification proving proving they are at least 18 - years - old . The controversial law , signed by Governor John John Bel Bel Edwards in December 2019 , has been met with both praise praise and criticism from citizens , legal experts and state legislators alike . Supporters say the new law will will protect children children and young adults from from harmful content while opponents argue it is an an unnecessary regulation regulation that could have unintended consequences . The new new law requires all Louisiana residents wanting to watch pornographic videos videos online or at at any store to first prove their their age by presenting valid identification . The law applies to pornographic videos videos or magazines , as well as material that depicts sexual activity in any way . It does not apply to websites or bookstores offering items such as as romance novels , sex education books , or health and hygiene products . Those who are unable to to provide valid identification when asked can face a fine of up to $ 500 , plus other potential charges . It 's unclear unclear if the fines fines will be enforced on a first - time time offender , or if more serious penalties such as jail jail time will be imposed . The law also makes makes it it illegal for individuals under the age of 18 to buy , rent rent , or otherwise possess pornographic material . [[ ]] The new law is similar to restrictions restrictions that that have been implemented in some other other states and countries , such as in in the the United Kingdom , where all all pornographic pornographic material is is required to be kept out of public view . The Louisiana law also follows the nation \u2019s long - standing regulations regulations on obscene material , which has has been prohibited prohibited since the the 1960s 1960s . Some legal experts have raised concerns over potential constitutional issues that could arise from the law law , such as whether it will violate the First Amendment or infringe upon individuals \u2019 right to to privacy . Proponents Proponents of the law argue that that it does does not violate violate any constitutional rights rights and is simply meant to act as as an extra layer of of protection for children and young adults who who may not have the capacity to make informed decisions when viewing potentially harmful content . Meanwhile , some some opponents of the law have also called into question its its usefulness usefulness , arguing that individuals under under the age of 18 18 can still easily access pornographic pornographic content online , and that that the law is more more of a burden burden than an actual protection . Some have compared the law to to the the Prohibition era in the United States States , when when laws laws prohibiting the sale and and consumption of alcohol alcohol had little effect on people 's actual behaviors . Ultimately , the outcome of of the law remains to be be seen . It is clear , however , that that the implementation of of this law in Louisiana has sparked an important discussion about the need for regulations on on pornographic material in an increasingly digital and open open world .", "label": "machine"}

How How to avoid avoid pitfalls in the sector in 2023 2023 But less than a month after the launch of Nirvana Money , which combined a digital bank account with a credit card , Harris abruptly shuttered shuttered the Miami - based company and and laid off dozens dozens of workers workers . Surging interest rates and a \" recessionary environment \" were to blame , he he said . The reversal is is a sign of more carnage to come come for the the fintech world . Many fintech companies \u2014 particularly those those dealing directly with retail borrowers \u2014 will be be forced to shut down down or sell themselves next year as startups run out of funding , according to to investors , founders and investment bankers . Others will accept accept funding at steep valuation haircuts or onerous terms , which extends the runway but but comes with its own risks , they said . Top - tier startups startups that have three to four years of funding can ride out the storm , according to Point72 Ventures partner Pete Casella . Other private companies companies with a reasonable path to profitability will typically get funding from existing investors . The rest will begin to to run out of money in 2023 , he said . \" What ultimately happens is is you get into a death spiral , \" Casella said . \" You ca n't get funded and all your best employees start jumping ship because their equity is is underwater underwater . \" Thousands of startups were created after after the 2008 financial crisis as investors investors plowed billions of dollars into private companies , encouraging founders to attempt to disrupt an entrenched and unpopular industry . In a low interest rate environment , investors sought yield yield beyond public companies , and and traditional traditional venture capitalists began competing competing with new new arrivals from hedge funds , sovereign wealth and family offices . watch watch now now The movement shifted into overdrive during the Covid pandemic as years of digital adoption happened in months and central banks flooded the world world with money money , making companies like Robinhood Robinhood , Chime and Stripe familiar familiar names with huge valuations . The frenzy peaked in 2021 , when when fintech companies raised more than than $ 130 billion and minted more more than 100 100 new unicorns unicorns , or companies with at least $ 1 billion in valuation . \" 20 % of of all VC dollars went into fintech fintech in in 2021 , \" said Stuart Sopp , founder and CEO of digital bank Current Current . \" You just ca n't put that much capital behind behind something in such a short short time without crazy stuff happening . \" The flood of money led to copycat companies getting getting funded anytime anytime a successful niche niche was identified , from from app - based based checking checking accounts known as as neobanks neobanks to buy now , pay later entrants . Companies relied on shaky metrics like user growth to raise raise money at eye - watering valuations , and investors who hesitated on a startup 's round risked missing out as companies doubled doubled and tripled in value within months . The thinking : Reel users in with a marketing blitz and then then figure out how to make money from them later . \" We We overfunded fintech fintech , no question question , \" said said one founder - turned - VC who declined to to be identified identified speaking speaking candidly candidly . \" We do do n't need need 150 different neobanks , we do n't need 10 different banking banking - as as - a - service service providers . And I 've invested in both \" categories , he said . [[ ]] One assumption [[ ]] The first cracks began to appear in in September 2021 , when the the shares shares of PayPal , Block and other public fintechs began a long decline . At their peak , the two companies were worth more than the vast majority majority of financial financial incumbents incumbents . PayPal 's market capitalization was second only to that that of JPMorgan Chase . The specter of higher interest rates and the end end of of a decade - plus - long era of cheap money was was enough to deflate their stocks . Many private companies created in recent years years , especially those lending money to consumers and small businesses , had one central assumption : low interest rates forever , according to TSVC partner Spencer Spencer Greene . That assumption met the Federal Reserve 's most most aggressive rate - hiking cycle in decades decades this year year . \" Most Most fintechs have been losing money for their their entire existence existence , but with the promise promise of of ' We 're going to pull it off and become profitable , ' \" Greene said . \" That 's the standard startup model ; it was true for Tesla and Amazon . But many of of them will never be profitable profitable because they were based on on faulty assumptions . \" Even companies companies that previously raised large amounts of money are struggling now if they are deemed unlikely to to become profitable , said Greene . \" We saw saw a company that raised $ 20 20 million million that could n't even get a $ 300,000 bridge loan because their investors told them ` We are no longer investing a dime . ' \" Greene said . \" It was unbelievable . \" Layoffs , down rounds [[ ]] All along the private company life cycle cycle , from embryonic startups to pre - IPO companies , the market market has reset lower by at least least 30 % to to 50 % , according according to investors . That That follows the decline in public company shares and a few notable private examples , like the 85 % discount that Swedish fintech lender Klarna took in a July fundraising . Now , as the investment community exhibits a newfound discipline and and \" tourist \" investors are flushed out , the emphasis is is on companies that that can demonstrate demonstrate a clear path toward profitability . That is in addition to the previous requirements of high high growth in a large addressable market market and software - like gross margins , according to veteran fintech investment banker Tommaso Zanobini of of Moelis Moelis . \" The real test test is , does the the company have a trajectory where their cash flow flow needs are shrinking that that gets you there in six six or nine months ? \" Zanobini said . \" It 's not not , trust me , we 'll be there in a year . \" As a result , startups are laying off workers and pulling back on marketing to extend extend their their runway . Many founders are are holding out hope that the funding environment improves next year , although that is is looking increasingly unlikely . [[ ]] Neobanks under fire fire As the economy economy slows further into into an expected recession , companies that lend to consumers and small small businesses will suffer significantly higher higher losses losses for the first first time . Even profitable legacy legacy players like Goldman Sachs could n't n't stomach the losses losses required to create a scaled digital player , pulling back on its fintech ambitions . \" If loss ratios are increasing in a rate increasing environment on the industry industry side , it 's really dangerous because your economics on loans can get really out out of whack whack , \" said Justin Overdorff of Lightspeed Venture Partners . Now , investors and founders are playing a game of trying to determine who will survive the coming downturn downturn . Direct - to - consumer consumer fintechs are generally in the weakest position , several venture investors said . \" There 's a high correlation between companies that had had bad unit economics and and consumer businesses that got very large and very famous , \" said Point72 's Casella . Many of the country 's neobanks \" are just not going to survive survive , \" said Pegah Ebrahimi Ebrahimi , managing partner of FPV Ventures Ventures and a former Morgan Stanley executive . \" Everyone thought thought of them as new banks that would would have tech multiples , but they are still banks at at the the end end of the day . \" Beyond Beyond neobanks neobanks , most companies that raised money in 2020 and 2021 at nosebleed nosebleed valuations of 20 to 50 times revenue are in a predicament , according to Oded Zehavi , CEO of Mesh Payments . Even if a company like that doubles revenue from its last round , it will likely have to raise fresh funds funds at a deep discount , which can can be \" devastating devastating \" for a startup , he said . \" The boom led to some really surreal investments with valuations valuations that can not be be justified , maybe ever , \" Zehavi said . \" All of these companies across the world are going going to struggle , and they will need to be acquired or shut down in 2023 . \" As As in previous down cycles , however , there is opportunity . Stronger players will snap snap up up weaker ones through acquisition and emerge from the downturn in a stronger position , where where they will enjoy less competition competition and lower costs for talent and expenses , including marketing . \" The The competitive landscape shifts the most during periods of fear , uncertainty uncertainty and doubt , \" said Kelly Rodriques , CEO of Forge , a trading venue for private company stock . \" This is when the bold and the well well capitalized will gain . \" While sellers of private shares have generally generally been willing to accept bigger valuation discounts as the year went on , the bid - ask spread spread is still too wide wide , with many buyers buyers holding out for lower prices , Rodriques said .

En net als bij elke andere investering komt komt het met grote risico \u2019s . Met deze blogpost bespreken bespreken we we de risico \u2019s van van pensioenbeleggingen en waarom het onvermijdelijk onvermijdelijk is is , ongeacht het risico . Laten Laten we eerst het verschil tussen risico - aversie en risicovolle beleggingen begrijpen . Riskovolle beleggingen zijn situaties waarbij waarbij de potenti\u00eble opbrengsten hoger zijn dan de de risico \u2019s . Het is een een soort kans kans om in een relatief korte periode veel meer winst te te behalen dan in situaties waar het risico eerder laag is . Bij pensioenbeleggingen wil je kiezen voor een beleggingsstrategie die een goede balans biedt tussen rendement rendement en risico . Een Een goede pensioenbeleggingsstrategie heeft veel risico - aversie . Dit betekent dat dat men op zoek gaat naar beleggingen met lage risico risico \u2019s en lagere verwachte rendementen in plaats van te speculeren met de kans om een veel hogere winst te behalen . Er zijn veel verschillende soorten beleggingen die een goede balans bieden tussen rendement en risico . Bijvoorbeeld , als als je je een conservatief belegger bent , zou je kunnen kiezen kiezen voor obligaties of staatsfondsen in plaats plaats van aandelen . Als je echter een meer risicovol belegger bent , zou je kunnen kiezen voor obligaties met een hogere rente of een vermogensfonds dat actief actief beleggen omvat . Ook als je een een aandeelhouder bent , kan het nuttig zijn om je beleggingsportefeuille beleggingsportefeuille zo te diversifi\u00ebren dat je blootstelling krijgt aan verschillende sectoren , industrie\u00ebn en regio \u2019s \u2019s . Door Door je beleggingen goed te diversifi\u00ebren diversifi\u00ebren , kun je je risico \u2019s \u2019s verminderen door kortetermijnvolatiliteit te verminderen . Beleggingen zijn ook noodzakelijk omdat ze het vermogen vermogen bieden bieden om om je koopkracht koopkracht te verhogen . Wanneer Wanneer de rente laag is , verschijnen er meer meer mogelijkheden om te beleggen . Meer beleggers krijgen toegang tot lagere kosten , met het mogelijke rendement als resultaat resultaat . Bovendien kunnen beleggingen helpen om de inflatie inflatie te bestrijden , waardoor je koopkracht koopkracht gedurende gedurende je pensioen toe te nemen . Tot slot , maar minstens zo belangrijk , is het belang van pensioenbeleggingen als het gaat om het bouwen van een financieel financieel kussen en en het verstrekken van financi\u00eble zekerheid .

{"text": "See Full Image Image Gallery > > Pros : Exceptional powertrains , including including the hybrid hybrid and Lightning ; unique and game - changing tech ; well well - balanced balanced driving dynamics ; Raptor ! Cons : Interior design is a bit ugly ; the Ram rides better better As you can see from from the rather \u201c yeah , so what ? \u201d collection collection of of cons cons above , it \u2019s safe to say that we think that that buying a 2023 Ford F-150 would be a decent idea . We might prefer driving the the Ram 1500 or sitting in in the the Chevy Silverado \u2019s stylish new interior , but when it comes to those things that make a truck a truck , the F-150 F-150 is quite simply exceptional . [[ ]] It really comes comes down to two big - ticket areas : engines and technology . First , its its smooth and efficient efficient turbocharged V6 \u201c EcoBoost \u201d engines engines provide impressive refinement and power that makes anything with a V8 V8 feel a bit old fashioned . Of course , the PowerBoost Hybrid Hybrid puts even those to shame with the the sort of no - compromise combo of power power and efficiency that that can can really only be beat by the also - exceptional F-150 Lightning electric truck we review separately . Second , when we talk about \u201c technology \u201d we \u2019re not not talking about the usual discussion of of touchscreens and Apple CarPlay . Nope , the F-150 has game game - changing changing tech for actual actual truck purposes . We named its Pro Power on on - board generator options our our Technology of the Year for for 2021 , and then its Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch Hitch hauling and towing features features our Technology of the Year for 2022 2022 . We describe them at the above links and below . For everything else that makes makes a truck a truck , including a variety of off - roading roading options topped off by the wild new Raptor R , the F-150 delivers . Try out the Ram and GM trucks to be sure , but but definitely do n\u2019t ignore this Ford Ford . Interior Interior & Technology | Passenger & Cargo Space | Performance & Fuel Economy What it 's like to drive | Pricing & Trim Levels | Crash Ratings & Safety Features What What 's new for 2023 ? Besides massively jacked up prices , there there \u2019s another pair of of off - road - oriented oriented F-150 models models for 2023 . First , there \u2019s the Rattler , a package package that that adds to the the base XL trim level a variety of FX4 FX4 package upgrades : skid plates , all all - terrain tires , off - road road shocks , a locking diff and hill descent control . Outside you can tell tell it apart from from the unique combination of XL black plastic grille grille and and bumpers paired with special special badging and the rugged wheel / tire combo . Second , there \u2019s the Raptor R , which which adds adds a supercharged V8 to more or less the same Raptor Raptor chassis upgrades . You can read all about about it in our Raptor R first first drive review . There \u2019s also the the F-150 Heritage Edition that pays tribute to the marque \u2019s history of distinctive two two - tone color schemes . They \u2019re pretty snazzy . Story Story continues 2022 Ford F-150 Platinum Interior What are the the F-150 interior and in - car technology like ? Ford performed performed major surgery on the F-150 's dash two years ago in order order to swallow what what is essentially a small small television in top trim levels . The result is an awfully monolithic center center stack that 's less visually appealing than what you 'd get in in the the Ram 1500 and radically revised Chevy Silverado Silverado and GMC Sierra . That 's especially true when talking about about the upper trim levels , but at at least those including including the the Platinum ( pictured top ) make up for it with buttery leather , open - pore wood trim and and nicely textured metal - look trim . That That said , even the the lower XLT trim has has high - quality materials and the novel inclusion inclusion of a trim trim piece embossed with a map of Detroit ( pictured below below , bottom left ) As for for that big 12 - inch screen , we ca n't n't say say it adds much much to the Sync 4 interface beyond beyond simply being bigger than the 8 - inch standard unit . That That 's certainly still a benefit ( who who wants a smaller smaller screen ? ) , but unlike unlike the Ram portrait - style upgrade and GM \u2019s widescreen widescreen unit ( plus the Lightning \u2019s portrait - style Sync 4A screen ) , the larger screen does n't maximize its extra acreage with rearranged or extra - large icons that that greatly greatly improve improve functionality . It 's also a further reach than what you 'll find in the Ram , regardless of screen size . On the other hand , the available available all - digital instrument panel is colorful and crisp , and there 's no faulting the the ample infotainment feature content content . We extensively extensively reviewed the the six - passenger passenger cabin of a F-250 SuperCrew SuperCrew whose seating is essentially shared shared with the ' 22 F-150 , including its front middle seat and fold - down console . Five - passenger F-150s , meanwhile , offer a center console with a unique unique armrest lid that that unfolds unfolds forward to become a flat flat surface to place a laptop , paperwork or road - side picnic . To make this origami possible , the shifter shifter uniquely motors forward into a recess , though only when parked ( pictured below ) . We 're curious to know how much owners owners have actually utilized and appreciated this functionality functionality . Ford Ford also greatly increased the steering wheel wheel 's tilt and and telescoping travel , making for an impressively impressively more comfortable , SUV - like driving position . How big big is the F-150 ? The various full - size size trucks trucks are so big that differences among them are effectively moot . An inch or two here and and there wo n't make a difference difference outside . As As before , you get a choice of regular , SuperCab ( extended ) and and SuperCrew cabs cabs with the latter two offering six - passenger passenger or five - passenger seating arrangements . The SuperCab SuperCab continues to to have clamshell clamshell doors rather than the front - hinged ones offered offered by Ram and GM . Its Its back seat space space continues to to be on the the cramped side , but that 's common for the segment segment . So too too is the vast vast amount amount of rear seat space space in the SuperCrew . This is also also as good a place as any any to to mention the F-150 's unique bed elements . One is familiar : the the tailgate 's pop - out assist step step that makes repeatedly climbing up and down out out of the bed a game - changing quick - and - easy process ( pictured above right ) . The The second is a more recent advancement : the the ProPower On Board electrical electrical system that that allows the F-150 to function as mobile generator and power station . A 2.0 - kilowatt system is optional optional with with the the 2.7- , 5.0- and 3.5 - liter gas engines , while the Power Boost hybrid offers a choice of of standard 2.4 - kW or optional 7.2 - kW outputs . The lower lower - powered systems have a pair of 120 - volt 20 - amp outlets ( pictured below left ) , while the 7.2 - kW system adds two more more 120 120 - volt outlets plus a 240 - volt 30 - amp outlet ( pictured below right ) . And finally finally , the third is the available Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch that make hauling and and towing so much easier and safer . [[ ]] What are the F-150 fuel economy and performance performance specs ? Settle Settle in , folks , this is going to take a while . The F-150 is is back up to to seven engine options options \u2013 the diesel engine from from a few years back may still be gone , but the Raptor R adds a supercharged V8 . Oh , and we \u2019re \u2019re not not even even counting the Lightning , which which we review separately . Every F-150 has a 10 - speed automatic and most come standard with rear - wheel drive . The basic basic four - wheel - drive system has an open diff at the rear rear , while the upgrade one one has an electronic locking rear diff . The lineup starts with a 3.3 - liter naturally aspirated V6 good good for 290 horsepower and and 265 pound - feet of torque torque . Fuel economy is a 21 mpg combined combined with rear - wheel wheel drive , and 20 mpg combined combined with four - wheel - drive . Next Next up is the first of two \" EcoBoost \" engines , which which is just fancy Ford talk for \" turbocharged . \" The 2.7 - liter twin - turbo V6 V6 produces 325 hp and 400 lb lb - ft of of torque , while returning 21 21 or 22 mpg combined depending on different factors . Do Do n't be surprised surprised if your real - world fuel economy economy is much lower than that , however . There 's 's still a good - old V8 available : Ford 's 's 5.0 - liter \" Coyote \" good for 400 hp and and 410 lb - ft . Despite its output and cylinder count count , it it still manages between 18 and 20 mpg combined combined in regular models , or 17 mpg with the Tremor . Not bad . We 'd still choose choose the silky silky - smooth smooth 3.5 - liter EcoBoost V6 , though , which pumps out 400 hp and 500 lb - ft ft of torque . Fuel Fuel economy is between 19 and 21 mpg combined depending on drivetrain in regular models , or 18 18 with the Tremor The Ford Raptor , meanwhile , now offers a choice in engine . The \u201c base base \u201d choice is a upgraded version of that 3.5 - liter EcoBoost good for 450 hp and and 510 lb - ft ft . Fuel economy stands at 15 or 16 mpg combined depending on equipment . The new Raptor R boasts a supercharged 5.2 - liter V8 from the Mustang Shelby GT500 . It produces 700 hp and 640 lb - ft ft of torque . Fuel economy economy is is only 12 mpg combined , which is just as terrible as the the Ram TRX , but hey , it it swills regular versus versus premium so so it \u2019ll \u2019ll save you something like $ 1,000 every year in gas . Value ! [[ ]] Of course , if you you \u2019re really interested in saving gas , there 's the sensational PowerBoost hybrid powertrain . Its combination of 3.5 - liter twin - turbo V6 and electric motor integrated into the transmission produces 430 hp and 570 lb - ft . It returns returns 25 mpg with with 2WD and 23 mpg with 4WD . That That difference may may not not seem great , but when talking trucks trucks , small small differences in MPG figures can actually equate into big savings . In general , though , every version of the 2023 F-150 is impressively efficient for a full - size truck . Well , except the the Raptor Raptor R. See Full Image Gallery > > What 's the F-150 like to drive ? There are so so many versions versions of the F-150 , especially in regard to engine choice , that how it drives very much depends . All share one common element : they are shockingly smooth , refined and and even responsive to drive . A Platinum test truck truck and its adaptive steering system was was almost SUV - like in the the way it moved down down the road : the steering was quicker and more responsive than before , the ride smoother , and there was the general feeling of the truck being smaller than it was . The refinement drop off off to a much cheaper cheaper XLT test truck was n't that big , either either . For those who need a pickup that can also accommodate the whole family on a road trip , the F-150 is no longer longer the compromise it once was . The Ram 1500 pulls pulls off a similar trick trick , and indeed , the gap between between the two trucks has narrowed substantially \u2013 and and has possibly disappeared disappeared . As for those powertrains , we wo n't mince words words : The The F-150 PowerBoost PowerBoost is the most impressive pickup for for everyday duty we 've tested tested . Its massive output , refined power delivery and and superior fuel fuel economy economy make it the most appealing appealing powertrain option option . It also hides its hybridness well \u2013 there there 's no no fussy CVT , awkward brake feel or or weird electric noises . It feels totally normal normal . It also makes the otherwise potent potent 5.0 - liter V8 V8 feel like an old dog , especially in in its responsiveness around town town . The two EcoBoost turbocharged V6 's 's are better in this this regard , and continue to impress impress with their their buttery smooth power delivery . The bigger 3.5 - liter 's substantial output is even more more impressive in light of of how relatively fuel efficient efficient it remains . Note that we review the F-150 Lightning separately . What other Ford F-150 reviews can I read read ? We We drive as many variations of the new F-150 as we can , but come away most impressed by the PowerBoost hybrid hybrid . 2021 F-150 Limited PowerBoost PowerBoost We dispatched engineer and off - road expert Dan Edmunds to the the California desert to give us us the fullest look at the new new Raptor you 'll be be able to to find .

A leaked internal document from from Amazon suggests suggests a brighter brighter outlook , especially for the US economy economy . According to an internal macroeconomic analysis from from November , obtained obtained by by Insider Insider , the company sees a 30 % chance of a US recession within the next 6 months . Based on recent data showing continued continued labor demand demand and wage increases , Amazon also anticipates a soft landing landing for for the US economy , a term used used to to describe a slow - growth period period that avoids a recession , the internal report said . [[ ]] That 's a stark contrast contrast to many other forecasts forecasts . A Bloomberg Economics Economics study from October said the US had a 100 % chance chance of entering entering a recession within the next 12 months . A Federal Reserve Reserve staff report from November found an almost 50 % odds of a US recession next year year , while an October October survey by the the Wall Wall Street Journal put put the probability at 63 % . \" The US economy , on on the other hand , continues to send mixed signals signals and does not appear to be in a recession ( yet yet ) , \" Amazon Amazon stated in its report . \" These dynamics are consistent consistent with a soft - landing scenario ( e.g. mild increase in the unemployment rate , slowdown in hiring and quits quits , little rise in job destruction ) though the impact impact of continued tightening by the Federal Reserve will affect the labor market with a delay . \" The 12 - page report , put together by Amazon 's 's science science , economic , and finance teams , gives a rare look into the e - commerce giant 's view of the economy economy . The company has more than 160 million Prime subscribers in the US who shop shop regularly . That 's 62 % of the population , according to to Insider Intelligence estimates . This gives Amazon an unprecedented view of activity in the world 's largest economy . Its relatively cheerful forecast suggests suggests the US US may avoid a major major downturn downturn , despite high inflation , steady interest - rate rate hikes , and sustained geopolitical tension tension . Insider asked asked multiple Amazon spokespeople for comment twice on Tuesday Tuesday , ahead of publication . Roughly 48 hours later , after publication publication on December 22 , one of of the spokespeople spokespeople provided the following statement : \" The document document in question does does not reflect the the company 's position on the economy and where it 's headed . Our CFO Brian Olsavsky shared our thinking on our our most recent earnings call , and our our CEO CEO shared his thoughts in a Dec. 6 interview at at the Dealbook event .

Yet , even if a recession were to to come and unemployment rose , Amazon Amazon appears less concerned about the impact on its sales . The report report said Amazon is \" partially shielded \" against a recession because nearly 60 % of Amazon 's revenue comes from wealthier wealthier customers customers who are \" less responsive to unemployment rate changes . \" Customers Customers in lower - income brackets , who are more susceptible to to unemployment , \" account for a small small portion of overall sales sales , \" it added . But given new Amazon customers who drive most of of the sales growth come from from lower - income income areas , the report report said said \" a recession recession has the potential to impact this group group 's expenditure \" and the company company 's long long - term expansion . It It also cautioned that that rising mortgage rates rates and a declining housing market could have \" spillover spillover \" effects on household expenditures , including purchases of home goods , like furniture furniture , home furnishings , and electronics . [[ ]] While US US inflation jumped to a range of 7 % to to 9 % this year , Amazon has n't raised raised its product prices as much , the the report note .

' Downward revisions ' Amazon , for its its part , has significantly significantly cut costs by shutting down multiple businesses businesses and and laying laying off tens of thousands of employees in recent months . In October October , Amazon 's CEO CEO Andy Jassy Jassy told employees in an internal internal all - hands that the company would be more thoughtful about its spending going forward , as Insider previously reported . [[ ]] \" It 's on a lot of people 's minds , and of course , none of us us know know for sure what what 's gon na happen happen , but there are a lot of signs that point to this being a difficult and rough economy ahead of us , \" Jassy said . The internal report from November said the US economic outlook for 2023 has \" worsened significantly \" and baseline forecasts now see growth falling below 1 % . Similar downward forecasts are applied to other advanced economies , the report said , citing the October IMF IMF World Economic Outlook for for global global growth that was the the weakest weakest since 2001 . All this could make make it hard for Amazon to achieve growth and and profitability at the same time . Historically , Amazon saw its its profit margins shrink when its business business grew , and vice versa , the the report noted . In the current climate , where Amazon is is looking to dramatically cut costs , growth could be be hard to come by . \" There is a clear tradeoff between the interplay of profit seeking and growth , rendering it it difficult to achieve both both objectives simultaneously , \" the report said . \" As our our pendulum swerves to cut costs in in pursuit of higher profit margins , this may undermine our ability to grow at a faster pace in the near \u2014 or mid - term . \" Do you you work at Amazon ?

In it , the DOJ defended the legality legality of the Biden Administration \u2019s student loan loan forgiveness program announced in in August , arguing the plan is clearly within the the Education Security Security 's authority under a 2003 act . It also argued that a second lawsuit brought by Missouri lacks standing . The brief is the latest development in in a legal fight that started started in November November and has left nearly nearly 40 million student loan borrowers uncertain uncertain about the future of their finances . \" As the brief brief makes clear , the debt debt relief plan is not only lawful , it is critical to millions of of working- working- and middle- class Americans Americans who are otherwise at risk of falling behind as they work to recover recover from from the pandemic , \u201d said said Abby Shafroth , staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center and director of the the Student Loan Borrowers Assistance Project . \u201c The plan is designed to give people people burdened burdened by student debt breathing room room as they recover from the pandemic pandemic , and to avoid a projected wave of student loan delinquencies and and defaults defaults when the pause on payments ends . \" WASHINGTON , DC - JANUARY 02 : Student loan borrowers gathered at the Supreme Court today today to tell the court court that student loan relief relief is legal on January 02 , 2023 in Washington , DC . ( Photo by Larry French / Getty Images for We , The 45 Million ) [[ ]] \u2018 Legal authority \u2019 In November , the Education Department Department ( ED ) stopped taking applications for student loan forgiveness after a Texas federal district district court judge ruled the program is a violation of legislative power and the St. Louis - based based 8th 8th Circuit Circuit Appellate Court imposed an injunction . Shortly after , the the Biden Administration asked the U.S. U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate reinstate the program . [[ ]] The brief this week addressed both both of of those cases . In In the Texas case , the DOJ argues argues that the HEROES Act expressly states that the the Education Secretary has the authority authority to to act in a national national emergency emergency \u2014 in this case , COVID-19 COVID-19 \u2014 to to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to to their loans than they were were before the emergency emergency . According According to the DOJ , the act allows the Secretary to to move forward with the program without without public comments .

( Credit : Getty Images ) The brief also noted the act was used by both the Biden Administration Administration and the Trump Trump Administration when when they they paused federal student student loan payments during the the pandemic . In the 8th Circuit Circuit case , the DOJ brief argues argues that the state state of Missouri lacks standing standing to sue based based on potential harm the forgiveness program may may bring to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority , or MOHELA , a loan servicer servicer in the the state state . The DOJ DOJ argues that MOHELA is a separate separate entity from the state and harm to MOHELA is not harm to the state . Further Further , any claimed harm to MOHELA MOHELA is based based on multiple levels of speculation the Supreme Court has long rejected as a basis for standing . [[ ]] \u201c We remain confident in our legal authority to to adopt this program that will ensure the the financial harms caused caused by the pandemic do n\u2019t drive borrowers borrowers into delinquency and default default , \u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a press release . Long road ahead still The Biden Administration \u2019s brief , though , is only the start . There will likely likely be more legal filings before the Supreme Court hears oral oral arguments in late February and renders an opinion . Opponents in the Texas and 8th 8th Circuit cases cases have have until until Jan. 27 to submit their brief brief , and DOJ has until Feb. 15 15 to respond . \u201c The arguments about the plaintiffs lacking legal standing seem seem strong . The arguments on the merits merits are somewhat weaker , \u201d Mark Kantrowski , author and and student loan expert , told Yahoo Finance . \u201c During During the hearings we may get a sense as to the direction the court will take based on the questions asked by by the justices .

President Biden last last month extended the payment payment pause on federal federal student loans until June 30 30 , 2023 2023 . If litigation has not been been resolved resolved by then , payments will begin 60 days after that that . For borrowers who who are worried about restarting restarting payments , Cody Hounanian , executive director of the the Student Debt Crisis Center ( SDCC ) , recommends recommends they look into into different student loan repayment repayment options as well as updates to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program . \" Being aware of of your income - driven repayment plan options options will will help help ensure payments are are affordable for those that have current payments or will have their payments turned back back on after after pandemic relief , \" Hounanian said .

It It has been edited for length and and clarity . When I met my my husband , Prince Kunle , I was at the peak of of my modeling career . It It was was the middle of New York York Fashion Week in in 2004 2004 , and all the models were going on show show castings at the time . I was newly newly single and had just exited a relationship that was not for for me . I was was happy being single and was enjoying my career \u2014 I was n't at all looking for a boyfriend . I was in Union Union Square , looking for an address for an audition that I was meant to to be on . I did did n't n't know know this at the time , but the casting director had given the wrong address . So I 'm standing there , calling my agency , and I felt someone someone 's 's presence . I felt someone staring at me . I see Kunle standing there , and I 'm 'm thinking , \" Do I know this person ? \" I did did n't think that he would would wait wait around for me to get off the phone phone , but he did . He came up to me and said : \" You are are the most most beautiful person I 've 've ever seen seen in my entire life . Would you do me the honor of having your number ? Because I 'd love to take take you you out . \" Honestly , I was thinking , \" Who talks like that ? \" I made up up a line that I had a boyfriend so that I could n't n't give him my number , and I turned turned to walk away . But as I was about to go go for for my audition , my women 's intuition said : \" You know know what ? He was kind . He was n't n't rude . He was tall , dark , and handsome . You should just give him your your number . \" So I ran back back up the steps steps , and he was still there , phone phone in hand , smiling as if he knew knew I would come back . [[ ]] We dated dated for 2 years years before I learned that that Kunle was a prince prince We We dated for for two years , and I did not not know he was was royal . I knew knew that he was Nigerian Nigerian and that he previously lived in London , but I had no idea about about his background . In Nigerian culture , when you are serious about someone , that 's when when you introduce them to your family family . I remember going to to a family wedding and his mom coming out with open arms . It was almost like she she knew me me already already . She She kept calling me \" my princess . \" I was thinking it was a term of endearment , since a lot of moms call their daughters princesses . That 's when I discovered he he was was a royal royal . She started telling me the history of the kings , his name and and its meaning , and where he he was from . [[ ]] Keisha and Kunle at their former home home in London in 2021 . Mikhaila Friel / Insider Insider Kunle Kunle is a crown prince from the Arugbabuwo Arugbabuwo ruling house . Unlike the British royals , where where there 's one one family family and lots of royals royals within that family , in Nigeria there are many tribes tribes and many royal families within those tribes tribes . Not all of those tribes have a crown prince \u2014 the crown crown prince is is the chosen one who is going to rule at a certain age . I remember thinking , \" We 've been together for two years , and he he just left that detail out ? \" It was a nice thing thing to know , but it it did n't affect our lifestyle . It would have , if he had chosen to be king king in Nigeria . That That 's when everything changes and you you literally give give up life as you you know it . We would have to live and remain in Nigeria . We would not hold our own schedules and would not have have the luxury of traveling when we we want to travel or or where we want to travel . It would no longer be acceptable for me to call Prince Kunle Kunle \" my baby , \" \" my honey honey , \" or any other name name apart from King King Omilana . We would also not not have the freedom to be together every day and in every every way like we we are now . He made it it very clear to me that while this is his his bloodline bloodline and this is who he is , it 's not how he lives lives his life when when he 's not in Nigeria . We started our our married life life in NYC NYC before spending time in Dubai , Cyprus , and London We married on January January 28 , 2006 . Our son , Diran , was was born later that year and our daughter daughter , Dior , was born six years after that . Both of my children were born in in New York , and about nine months after Diran 's seventh birthday we moved to Dubai Dubai . A post shared by by Princess Keisha Keisha Omilana ( @keishaomilana ) [[ ]] We stayed there for about a year before moving to to Cyprus . After After a year in Cyprus , we moved back to London London , which has always been a second second home to Kunle . [[ ]] We stayed in London for for seven years years . It was wonderful . We launched our our companies there there , and we raised Dior there . It was nice to be there with the children children \u2014 to go back back as a family was really fun . Kunle Kunle and I experienced discrimination in the UK We We like like to focus on positive things , but but at the same time time , it is always necessary to raise raise awareness of injustice injustice . And And this is for pretty pretty much anyone and everyone everyone who happens to not be English English . The discrimination occurred very subtly and was mostly witnessed in our business dealings and and in one former neighborhood . It 's not not even a racist thing thing , as far as us being Black . When it comes to England , what what I 've learned after being there for seven years is that it 's a non - British British thing thing . So the same same thing that I 'm 'm feeling , that I 've been discriminated against , my friend friend who is is Australian \u2014 who is is not Black \u2014 is going through . It 's more so : \" We are English , this is how we we do do it it . And And you you 're not one of us . \" Especially when you 're doing business and you 're 're moving in in those circles and they 're not used to seeing people who do n't look like them . We dealt with that quite a lot , and we just just dealt with it with grace grace and ease . We stayed classy , we stayed professional , but it was something we noticed and experienced . I must say though that that is not just a UK thing . Prince Prince Kunle and I have traveled all over the world and lived on on four continents . Discrimination has unfortunately been experienced before . [[ ]] It is is very important that this statement statement is is not mistaken as a portrayal of myself as a helpless victim . In England England , I encountered extremely subtle forms forms of discrimination . However , If I were an English elite , this exhausting act of one seeking to validate their accomplishments by working working ten times harder to earn what what one deserves would not have occurred . We We all saw this play out in the press and media media coverage of the Duchess Duchess of Sussex Sussex . I am keenly aware of of the difference between how Meghan Meghan is covered in the news versus how Kate Middleton is covered in the news . I hear things like , \" How dare they leave ? \" It 's kind of like : \" Yes , we do do n't like you . But you have have to stay here and and hear it every every day . \" Why would you want them to stay stay in that that ? [[ ]] I understand the struggles that Meghan Markle Markle has faced faced [[ ]] I always say that that Meghan Markle and I have a lot of parallels , just for the the fact that we are both women of color , we are are both married to royalty royalty , we are both from California , and we 're both actresses . We are also also both feminists advocating for women 's empowerment . Meghan Markle and and Prince Prince Harry in a promo for their docuseries , \" Harry & Meghan . \" Netflix I personally do n't watch the news or or read tabloids . I do that purposefully because because a lot of the the time it 's just negative , and I do n't n't want to feed my soul with negative energy . But I am aware of what what 's 's going on because I 'm on social media and I hear about it . Whenever you are linked to someone someone or compared compared to someone , your eyes are are opened to what their life is . I wish people would lead with empathy and and put put themselves in that person 's shoes . Would you want want to wake up every day and be scrutinized in a negative way ? It 's 's a shame shame . And I really tip my hat to to Harry and and Meghan Meghan for standing up to The Firm , for choosing their happiness and and their mental mental health , for saying that they want to live a life life where they are are free to be be who they are .", "label": "human"}

The layoffs , combined with voluntary pay reductions , other other cost - cutting measures , and the fact that CEO Marc Benioff sold $ 29 million in shares around the same same time , mean that the company is going through a difficult period of restructuring . Benioff is is adamant , however however , that the company company is committed committed to supporting its staff .

{"text": "Legal challenges now stand in the way of President Joe Biden \u2019s plan to to cancel thousands thousands of dollars in education loans loans for millions of of Americans . As a professor focused on debt and inequality , I \u2019m rooting rooting for the the plan to to succeed . But I \u2019m also concerned that it does nothing to address the problems in higher higher education that that are are scaring off a new generation of potential students . [[ ]] Over the past three and a half years years , I have been talking with with more than than 30 low - income income students and and their families from across the country about their attitudes toward student debt and their paths after high school . Contrary to my expectations , many many told told me me they were enrolling in inexpensive inexpensive two - year year colleges or eschewing higher education entirely . Read Read : What the student - loan debate overlooks These interviews suggest that some families , forced to borrow money just to cover the basic cost of living , are are not not willing to borrow yet yet more money for educational reasons , even if it would give them access access to to skilled jobs and and better salaries in the the future . Their fear is is rational under current circumstances . As As I traveled to different states , I met low - income income high - school graduates like Olivia Hall , who grew up watching watching her mother struggle to pay off her loans and vowed not to fall into the same trap trap . Hall considered charging tuition to a credit card , rather than than borrowing , but ultimately skipped college . She works at a sandwich shop now . Charlie Andry asked friends friends and family to donate to her her GoFundMe campaign to save up money for the University of Illinois at Chicago , after turning down an offer from the more expensive Northwestern University to to retain a few thousand dollars . Many others others , such as Mia Mia Mujaahid , are lured away from education by $ 17 - an an - hour jobs at warehouses and big - box box stores . [[ ]] The American higher - education system appears broken for all all but the the most well well - off . Selective colleges are receiving receiving more applications than ever before , fueling the impression that Americans of all all sorts are aiming for the elite college experience . But the rise of applications is partly the the result of the same students sending sending applications to more more schools schools , as a recent report shows . Already - stretched families hesitate to extend themselves more . Students who borrow for higher education but fail to complete their their degrees struggle the most to pay back the money . This This group group includes disproportionately high high numbers numbers of of people of color and low - income individuals . Among Among those enrolled full - time , 40 40 percent of Black students and and 54 percent of Latino students students do not not attain attain bachelor \u2019s degrees within six years , compared compared with about two - thirds of white students . Almost Almost half of of students students from families families with incomes below $ 35,000 fail to graduate within within the same period , compared with less than a third from families with incomes above $ 75,000 . Students who drop out default on on student loans loans at a rate rate three times times higher than those those who graduate . Families who who fail to make payments on college debt risk risk their wages being garnished , their their income - tax refunds being withheld withheld , and and their credit scores being lowered , which can can make it difficult to obtain leases and can can lead to higher higher interest rates on other loans . In recent decades , the the U.S. U.S. has made an attempt to narrow persistent race- and income - based inequalities inequalities in in educational educational attainment by by helping students of different different backgrounds backgrounds access loans . Now the Biden administration administration is trying to cancel some some of that debt debt . But canceling existing student debt debt up to a specific amount does nothing to help new students apply apply to and attend universities that will give them the greatest odds of success . Josh Mitchell : A crimson tide of debt Before 1965 , most most federal aid aid was was given directly directly to colleges colleges and not to students . Historically , states issued more assistance to postsecondary institutions and students than the federal government did . In 1990 , states states \u2019 per - student funding was was almost 140 percent percent more than that of the the federal government , according to research by the Pew Charitable Trusts . But But in recent years , the amount of funding supplied by states has dropped . States States should should increase direct funding levels . The pandemic has exposed and perpetuated inequalities in higher higher education . Americans can no longer pretend that trying to to equalize college college access with postcollege approaches will be sufficient . Families desperately need the hope and opportunity that education provides . That starts with recognizing their unwillingness unwillingness to to take on debt debt .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "How our perception of time shapes shapes our approach to climate change Enlarge Enlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Rebecca Blackwell / AP Rebecca Blackwell / AP Most people people are focused on the present : today , tomorrow , maybe next year . Fixing your flat tire tire is more pressing pressing than figuring out if you should should use an an electric car car . Living by the beach beach is a lot more more fun than figuring out when your house will be underwater because of sea level level rise . [[ ]] That basic human relationship with time makes climate change a tricky problem . \" I consider climate change the the policy problem from hell because you almost could n't n't design a worse fit for for our underlying psychology , or our our institutions of decision - making , \" says Anthony Leiserowitz Leiserowitz , the director of of the Yale Program Program on Climate Change Change Communication . Our Our obsession with the present obscures the future Those institutions \u2014 including companies companies and governments that ultimately have the power to dramatically dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 can be even more obsessed obsessed with the the present than individuals individuals are . [[ ]] For example , says says Leiserowitz , many many companies companies are focused focused on quarterly earnings and growth . That helps helps drive short - term behavior behavior , such as as leasing leasing new land to drill for fossil fuels fuels , that that makes long long - term climate climate change worse . And And there there are also also big incentives for political political leaders to think short - term . \" The President gets elected elected every four years years . Members of the the Senate get elected every six years . And members of the House get get elected every two two years , \" Leiserowitz points out , \" so they tend to operate on a much much shorter time cycle than this problem problem , climate climate change , which is unfolding over decades . \" There are deadlines looming for those elected elected leaders . The Biden Biden administration pledged to cut emissions in half by 2030 . By 2050 , humans humans need to to eliminate eliminate greenhouse gas emissions entirely entirely in in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change later this this century . Fortunately , our collective focus on the the present also offers hints , psychologists say , about how to harness harness that hyperfocus on the present to inspire inspire action . To spur action action , speed up the psychological rewards for addressing climate climate change now For example , there are ways ways to highlight the quick payoff for addressing climate change . In the political political realm , that could mean that an elected official gets more votes because they support policies that reduce emissions . The promise of a benefit in the next election may be more galvanizing than the goal of protecting future generations , even even if the latter has more moral moral weight . [[ ]] \" The benefits that we get today are more salient , and we want them more than benefits that may be larger , but but will accrue in the the future , \" explains Jennifer Jacquet , a researcher and associate professor of environmental studies at New York York University who studies the the psychology of collective action , including on climate change . Jacquet says the huge spending bill passed last last year by Congress , called the Inflation Reduction Act , is another another example of using our focus on the present to drive drive climate - conscious behavior . The bill bill includes includes financial incentives for people who buy buy electric vehicles or install solar panels . \" They 're trying trying to speed up the benefits , \" says says Jacquet . \" That 's 's smart . That 's good . That That plays into into how we think about things . \" Extreme weather is starting to catch everyone 's attention [[ ]] In some ways , our focus focus on the present is less and less of a problem as climate change makes itself more more and and more obvious today today \u2014 in our daily lives . Everyone on Earth is experiencing the effects of a hotter planet . That makes it it a problem of the present , not not of the future . [[ ]] That immediacy is is already showing up in in how Americans view climate change change , according to to Leiserowitz , who has has been leading an annual poll on the topic for more than than 15 years years . As extreme weather is becoming more common , he says support for climate policies is also growing , especially at the local level . [[ ]] For example , the vast majority of respondents respondents in a September 2021 poll said they they support local governments providing money to to help make homes homes more energy efficient , to increase public transportation and to install bike lanes . And the majority majority of respondents supported investments investments in renewable energy . There There 's 's no time to to waste Widespread public support for climate policies can help push politicians and corporate leaders to act quickly \u2013 which is important important , because scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions need to drop dramatically , and immediately , to avoid runaway warming later this century . \" We have big societal choices to make , \" says Leiserowitz , and and those changes need to happen now . In the present . \" People working together together to demand action by their leaders is going to be an an absolutely critical piece . \" [[ ]] This story is part of our our periodic periodic science science series \" Finding Time \u2014 taking a journey journey through the fourth fourth dimension to learn what makes us tick . \"", "label": "human"}

The key question is whether whether that block of \u201c never never - McCarthy \u201d House House Republicans is larger than the four votes McCarthy can afford to lose . Others Others want specific changes . \u201c There There are some of the others \u2026 who want want changes in the rules rules and there there are some others who care about about policy , \u201d Buck said . \u201c So I think if Steve Steve ( Scalise ) meets those three needs , he will be able to move forward and and take the speakership . \u201d [[ ]] Some want to shut shut things down . Rep. Rep. Ralph Norman Norman of of South Carolina has said a non - negotiable for him him is if McCarthy McCarthy is \u201c willing to shut the government down rather than raising the debt ceiling . \u201d That suggests the kind kind of precarious future funding fights will pose pose to the the economy . [[ ]] These lawmakers want want painful cuts now to end deficit spending . If the US US was to default on on its debt , it could send the US economy economy into a tailspin , according to most economists . A government shutdown would would be less severe , but they have been unpopular unpopular when lawmakers forced them in recent years . Here are are some some of the stated reasons and accepted motivations motivations of why these lawmakers are unwilling to to support McCarthy . This public fight on on the House floor is part of what they they wanted \u201c We are are showing the American people that this process process works , \u201d said the Pennsylvania Republican Republican Rep. Scott Perry in rising to nominate Rep. Byron Byron Donalds of Florida as an alternative to McCarthy . That it \u2019s been been 100 years since since there there was such a floor fight is a feature of the moment , Perry Perry argued . \u201c We have said we are are not going to take any more of Washington being broken . \u201d That was echoed by by another anti anti - McCarthy McCarthy Republican who appeared on CNN CNN , Rep. Dan Dan Bishop of North Carolina . \u201c I really think this is democracy in action , \u201d Bishop said . \u201c If you \u2019re not not satisfied satisfied with with Washington Washington as it is , then you ca n\u2019t be satisfied with doing the same thing as we start this Congress , I \u2019m convinced . \u201d Some just do do n\u2019t like McCarthy Rep. Matt Gaetz of of Florida issued a personal screed against McCarthy McCarthy on Tuesday . \u201c Maybe the right person for the speaker of the House House is n\u2019t someone who has sold shares in in himself for more more than than a decade to get get it it , \u201d Gaetz said , standing standing just in front of his target target . Bishop was less less aggressive aggressive on CNN when he expressed expressed the problem with McCarthy \u2019s specific leadership . \u201c The fact is that that you never never see a specific agenda that you know Kevin McCarthy \u2019s going to go go to the mat for , as opposed to sort sort of of pablum or or poll - tested language , indicates the problem , \u201d Bishop said . \u201c And it \u2019s been that that way for for all 14 years years he \u2019s \u2019s been in leadership , with all due due respect to him him . \u201d They They \u2019re not going to follow Donald Trump on this After McCarthy developed developed amnesia about the January 6 , 2021 , insurrection insurrection and repeatedly paid tribute tribute to to Donald Trump , the former president has been trying trying to help McCarthy McCarthy out . But the effort effort has has not helped , according according to Rep. Rep. Lauren Boebert , the Colorado Republican . \u201c Let \u2019s stop with the campaign smears and and tactics to get get people to turn against us \u2013 even even having my favorite president call us and tell us we we need to knock this off , \u201d Boebert said on the House House floor on Wednesday Wednesday . \u201c I think it actually actually needs to be reversed reversed . The The president needs to to tell Kevin McCarthy that , sir , you do not have the votes and it \u2019s time to withdraw . \u201d [[ ]] It \u2019s very very much about the perceived swamp If If you watch enough Tucker Carlson on on Fox or listen listen to to Steve Bannon \u2019s podcast , you \u2019ll hear the the argument that Republicans and Democrats are n\u2019t that different . Carlson often uses the term \u201c uni - party party \u201d to to blast the funding bills that are signed into law law . There \u2019s some of that in in the opposition opposition to McCarthy McCarthy , who has been been part of the the GOP GOP leadership for for years . \u201c Right now I \u2019m holding the line because I think we need this this place to operate operate differently , and that \u2019s \u2019s not not a partisan partisan statement . It \u2019s just just something that that I believe , \u201d Rep. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN \u2019s \u2019s Jake Jake Tapper Tapper on Tuesday . Roy said he \u2019s among the the fiscal conservatives who want to to \u201c stop the train of the the swamp swamp , \u201d which he said is made up of Republicans Republicans and Democrats , \u201c power brokers and the the defense industrial complex . \u201d He argued that the special special interests come together to push push government funding funding bills like the $ 1.7 trillion version passed last month month to to fund the the government through most of 2023 . They They want more power power for individual members Roy and Perry also talked about the need for open amendments on the the House floor , and Donalds has joined joined the others who want want a single member to be able to force a vote on whether to remove a sitting speaker speaker . Spartz has n\u2019t opposed McCarthy , but she did n\u2019t do do him him any favors when she voted \u201c present \u201d and ate away at his his support . She She said on CNN on Wednesday that the hardliners have a point about open debate and and the amendment process and she wants the House to to function differently . \u201c We have uncontrolled spending , and we can do nothing about it , \u201d Spartz complained , noting the appropriations process does not not allow for open amendments amendments . \u201c I think that needs to stop , \u201d she she said . They may never be satisfied McCarthy did did offer numerous concessions to the hardliners hardliners like Roy , including a pledge \u2013 which seems seems impossible impossible given the slapdash way legislation comes together \u2013 to give lawmakers 72 hours to read read a bill before it goes to the floor for a vote . He also agreed to allow allow just five Republicans to force a vote vote to remove the speaker instead of the current requirement that that a majority of Republicans Republicans join the call . One complication with finding a McCarthy replacement is that someone like Scalise might realize how much more difficult McCarthy \u2019s concessions will will make the job . When CNN \u2019s Manu Raju Raju and Veronica Stracqualursi asked Donalds , who has been getting votes from the hardliners hardliners Wednesday , if if he wanted the job , he said , \u201c Nah , not really . \u201d [[ ]] There \u2019s \u2019s context to these demands It \u2019s not entirely true that zero people people read these spending bills or that no one can can influence what goes into them . Congressional leaders leaders rely on committees to hash out the vast majority of what goes into into the the spending bills . Members Members can can request individual spending items . It \u2019s a complicated process and pretty much much everyone agrees it it is flawed . On the other hand , those those who who want open amendments to to spending spending bills would almost surely use them to to poison the process . [[ ]] In other words , once this small minority minority of of lawmakers got got the power they crave to blow up spending bills bills , they would . \u201c This is a prelude of what \u2019s going to come and the coming attraction when we get up to any big budget matter or the debt ceiling or anything else , \u201d Rep. David Joyce of Ohio , a McCarthy - backer , said said on CNN on Wednesday . \u201c There will be a crowd and they \u2019re going to continue continue to push and shove what they think is the agenda , and they \u2019re 10 % of our whole conference conference . \u201d Doing the larger math , 10 % of the the GOP conference is a much smaller minority of the the will of voters .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Blue Box [[ ]] Now this one I found all on on my own ! Please clap . So hear me out : I usually do do n\u2019t read sports manga week to week .

Blue Box , created by Kouji Miura , follows the the blossoming romance romance between two junior high athletes athletes named Taiki Inomata and Chinatsu Kano . Chinatsu and Taiki \u2019s \u2019s will - they - won\u2019t won\u2019t - they romance is neatly neatly accentuated by how determined they are while training and competing competing for their respective championships . Because Blue Box is still a romance romance manga , the the pair \u2019s blossoming romance romance is is complicated by the one - two punch punch of them having to live live together , and their their tenuous , one - on - one dynamic turning turning into into a love triangle with with the inclusion of Taiki \u2019s best friend , Hina Chouno . Although it occasionally occasionally skirts the line of being being a full - blown cliche harem romance manga , it consistently consistently sets itself apart apart with how emotionally emotionally mature its characters are . Despite being junior high schoolers , all three characters are acutely aware aware that they they \u2019re \u2019re initially in love with the idea of of being with the person they \u2019ve got a crush crush on , without really knowing them as as people people first . While the manga is filled with with comedic and dramatic dramatic misinterpretations and misunderstandings between the trio , it also takes them to task whenever they project their feelings onto each other , which is a really refreshing change change of pace for romance manga . Also , the sports in question in this manga manga are basketball , something I \u2019ve really really gotten into this year , and badminton , a high - key slept slept - on sport in both real life and fiction .", "label": "human"}

Those crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China , however however , are still required to show a negative COVID-19 test test taken within the last 48 hours \u2014 a measure measure China China has protested when when imposed by other other countries .

And so in the summer , when other kids had to flip flip burgers burgers or whatever whatever , I went went and interned on his campaign .

An agent came came to me and said , \" I think you you 'd be be really good at this book . \" You know , \" Write ' the the ten slimiest slimiest grifters in Republican Washington ' or whatever , and we 'll sell a million copies . \" That That did did n't feel like that was going to be satisfying for me on the writing side of things . And so while while there is a little bit of of that that for sure , what I really wanted to do was was focus more on the gray areas areas . I jumped over a couple of things , going over my my resume , things things that I 'm less proud of : as a gay Republican , how I worked for candidates that opposed the most important thing in in my life right now \u2014 my husband and child . [ I wanted to ] write about the people who saw the danger and went along with it anyway and tried to explore why they did did , and I tried to explore why I got got as far down that path as I did did , even though I peeled off . DK : Well , let 's get into that \u2014 you were on the Trump payroll for a bit . You at one point advised Scott Scott Pruitt in his his bid to become EPA administrator . So in terms of answering answering the question of \" Why We Did It , \" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. Republican Republican insiders and also also of yourself at the time ? TM : Of course there there 's a money element to this and and power , but it 's not just that that , right ? I think think \" power power \" in particular is a little little bit of a misnomer misnomer . There are a handful handful of people that like to wield power in Washington , but power comes with responsibility . Power has downsides . Being around power is is great to to [ insiders ] . That is , I think , really a driving driving force for a lot of people people . They just just want to be in the golf cart cart with Trump , in in Lindsey Graham 's case , or they want to be in the back row of a room where where they they can go home for Thanksgiving and tell their family . This This is the drug in D.C. For For myself , one thing that I talked about was these two elements of inertia and identity . You get into a career , you 're mid - level , and then all of a sudden you start to to feel kind of of icky about about it . And then it 's like , well , what do I do now ? The Scott Pruitt situation was that that for me . Trump had won . This had been my whole life , being a Republican spokesperson or researcher . And I knew [ Pruitt ] . I did n't know him him that well well , but he called me and he 's like , \" Hey , will you prep me me for this job ? \" And I took it it just because I was was in a crisis crisis \u2014 I was like , \" I do n't know know what I 'm going to to do do . Am I going to have a job ? \" And then I also think that there is the identity element about this , which is \u2014 particularly in Washington , but but increasingly , in a concerning fashion , everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 politics politics becomes part part of people people 's identity . In Washington , you have have people that \u2014 Republican is who they are . The people people that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives . The bar they go to is the Republican bar . Their poker night is Republican poker night . They have have a kids ' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives . It 's hard hard then to just just say , \" I 'm 'm not not this anymore . \" The thing that surprised me in a bad way way was just how much much resentment and interpersonal bitterness bitterness drove this . DK : Oh , yeah . The animosity among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among many many Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is just huge . And And you 're saying that that negative negative partisanship is is reflected reflected among the Republican ruling class . TM : For sure . I say this not as as a compliment to myself myself , by the way \u2014 this is a self - criticism \u2014 but I saw this as a little bit of kayfabe , which is is this wrestling term of of performative anger . Like , Hulk Hogan was n't n't really mad at Andre the Giant \u2014 I 'm showing my age with that reference . But it was fake . [[ ]] When When I was at at the RNC as the spokesperson , my job was basically to criticize the the Obama Obama campaign . The Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 Ben Ben LaBolt and Liz Smith \u2014 are are friends of mine . Like Like , we we 'd go out and drink and and trash - talk each other . To To me , it was performative , and so that 's how I was processing things . I was assuming that everyone was on my my level . And what I came to find out is that they really were n't , and that this bitterness towards towards Obama , [ there was ] an element of race race to it for sure . But more than than that , I think that for a lot lot of the people in the the political class , it was this resentment resentment that he got treated so so well well , that he was the golden child in the the media and that that everyone loved him and and that their their candidates candidates did n't get treated as well . [[ ]] And then in the Trump years , this just just gets on steroids . What I thought was performative fighting between the parties , among many , many many , many of of my colleagues actually actually became a driving , motivating force . [[ ]] One One guy said to me me directly , \" Tim , I 'm a white guy , and and with with all of this this woke nonsense and with my wife 's friends calling me me racist racist for working working for Republicans and all this criticism , all this heat I have to take , I 'm not up for jobs . And And it just leaves me no choice but to just think about the one or two things things I agree with [ the Trump administration ] on and just focus on that . \" [[ ]] What I came came to find out is that that that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans . DK : There There 's another motivation that I want want to drill into into . There are two categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs . And these are people who told themselves and others that they took Trump administration jobs because they were were afraid of who would would do do it otherwise \u2014 that , hey , at least I can be the adult in the room . You You do not buy this argument . Why not ? TM TM : I do n't . I think it 's the toughest category , because at at some level , are we lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn ? Clearly . So it it 's 's hard to kind kind of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand . [[ ]] On On the the other hand , their actions after they took the job \u2014 all of those people people who said said that they went went into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 their actions kind of betrayed betrayed that they really had had other motivations . I say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just felt like they had this duty to country and that it was better them in public service than someone someone else , then they would have supported Joe Joe Biden in 2020 . But none of of them really came out and and said said , \" no , we we need to stop this this person . \" And And that would have been the logical next step step of somebody that was going in really to save the country . [[ ]] DK : Throughout your your book , it feels like voters are always always right at the edge of the picture . I 'm thinking about about Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher on immigration . Or you talk talk about about the formerly moderate New New York representative representative , Elise Stefanik , who justified becoming Trumpier by saying , \" well , I 'm just just doing what voters want . \" So my question is , you blame a lot of Republican elites for falling in with Trump \u2014 do you you feel feel similarly towards voters ? [[ ]] I do n't . I 'm of of two minds about the voters . One is that I do think they they are the the ones that are driving this . And my book is is about the cowardice of the collaborators . The Republican ruling class class would have been happy to go go along with a more benevolent person to to just continue their access to power , but but they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route , because that that 's what what the the voters wanted . And OK , why why are voters like like that ? That 's 's a different book . I think think that the voters have a lot of real real reasons why they were upset . I mean , some people are are bigots out out there there for sure . But But I think the Republican ruling class did n't listen listen to [ voters ' ] concerns . I write about the autopsy , which I worked on in 2012 . I mean mean , a lot of Republican Republican voters voters were were mad mad about about the the Iraq war war , were mad about the hollowing - out of their communities . We We did did n't do anything to to try to address that . We did n't n't challenge Republican orthodoxies on any issues issues , and and Trump did . So I think it makes sense that those voters were attracted to Trump Trump . He was offering offering them something something different . And one of of the chapters in in the book is [ about ] the political political media media class \u2014 the the conservative conservative media in particular particular . It should n't be be that surprising that if if someone is every minute minute getting a text message or an an email or or a tweet or a Facebook post post about how their country is is being stolen from them , that they would want to to support radical ends to fix that . I try try to have grace towards voters voters and people in my life that have gotten gotten swept up in this . And I think that we have , in a representative democracy , an obligation of the people at the the top top of the the funnel to resist people 's worst worst impulses . There There was was nobody nobody that that did that . And that that is why those folks are the negative negative characters in my book . [[ ]] DK DK : You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report the the RNC released after Mitt Romney lost in 2012 , telling the party how how to have longer - term success . A lot of it was was about about working harder to appeal appeal to nonwhite and women women voters . Trump Trump certainly certainly did not fit that bill ... and listener Rachel Gershman was wondering wondering in our Facebook group , \" Does the autopsy have any relevance relevance now ? \" TM : Not really . It has relevance as an insight insight into into what the Republican political class , left our our own own devices , actually wanted . So I think that it 's 's interesting in that that regard . I think there 's 's a lot of reasons to think maybe an autopsy autopsy vision of of the the Republican Party might have worked . Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate , partially because of that conservative media media complex \u2014 the hyperbole and and lies lies that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself . Could Could a candidate that was more moderate on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 could could someone with Elise Stefanik 's 2014 platform of believing we should deal with climate change and and and supporting gay marriage , could that person have beaten beaten Hillary Hillary Clinton Clinton ? I think maybe , yeah yeah , probably . But because Trump won , that created created this mindset within the Republican Party , especially especially after McCain and Romney had had lost lost , that this kind of populist populist , nativist , working class path is the way for Republicans to win national elections again . [[ ]] DK : One other thing I wanted wanted to ask about is being being a gay Republican . You write write about the mental mental tap dancing dancing you did to to support a party party that just did n't support support gay gay people like you . I 'm wondering if you could tell us how that experience affected how you saw your your fellow Republicans do their own sort of tap dancing as as they they tried to to justify their allegiance to Trump . TM TM : I spent a lot lot of time thinking about about this because there are obviously limits to any parallel . But I think that that there are a lot of of parallels . I look back with regrets on not being more vocal on gay rights matters matters , on not drawing a bright bright red line around around the the types of candidates that I would would work work for . Part Part of of the reason why I did it when I think back about my own rationalizations was was , I felt like the arc of the gay gay history was bending bending towards justice , to steal a phrase \u2014 I felt like we were were already on this trajectory , and so why should I ruin my career over it ? [[ ]] I also used these same kind of rationalizations of , Oh , the other side 's not perfect , too . I mean , in 2008 , Obama Obama wo n't say he 's for gay marriage and everybody knows knows he privately is . You can can talk yourself into the fact that , you know , \" the other side is not perfect on this this either . And And so why why should I worry about it ? \" All All of these rationalizations rationalizations happened , and with with the benefit of of some distance and with Trump Trump kind of shaking me out of this kind of mindset , I looked back on that that and thought , \" Man Man , I do n't think I was seeing myself clearly clearly . \" So when Trump came around , I saw those same machinations happening in my colleagues . I think the other other thing thing that that happened is that whole identity question that I talked about earlier . I was probably the the visible gay Republican spokesperson for a while . So I had been through this \u2014 people seeing me me in a different way and having to deal with that kind of of identity change . And so , I think that that it made it less hard for me to to do it when Trump came around . I also also had those mistakes that I could look back on and say , \" I 'm not going going to make this mistake again . \"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As As the labor labor market market continues continues to heat up , employers need to be prepared for the growing risk of employee turnover . After all , if job seekers have a lot lot of options available , they may be tempted to to move move on if they \u2019re \u2019re not happy in their current current role . This does n\u2019t just affect employees at the lower rungs of the corporate ladder ; the most sought - after after professionals are are increasingly likely to jump ship . To shed light light on the jobs jobs that are most likely to see see high employee turnover , Business Insider conducted an exclusive survey of more than 1,000 people . We asked respondents to name the type of of job they expect to quit the soonest , and and we used the results to compile a ranking of the most likely jobs to experience turnover . Here are the 20 jobs people are most likely to quit quit soon , in order from from least to most likely : 1 . Accountant 2 . Chef / Cook Cook 3 . Human Human Resources 4 . Retail Clerk 5 . Truck Driver 6 . Sales Sales Associate 7 . Administrative Assistant 8 . Marketing Specialist 9 . Web Web Developer 10 . Lawyer 11 11 . Teacher 12 . Project Manager 13 . Account Manager 14 . Customer Service Representative 15 . Graphic Designer 16 . Database Administrator 17 . Software Software Developer Developer 18 . Registered Registered Nurse 19 . Financial Analyst 20 . IT Manager Our survey revealed that that the the most popular job on the the list list , accounting , is the the least likely to experience employee employee turnover . Of the 1,000 respondents , only only 2 percent said they plan to quit their accounting accounting job in the near future . Chef / cook and human resources were the second and third least likely likely positions to experience turnover , with only 3 percent and 4 percent percent of of respondents , respectively , indicating plans plans to leave . On the other end end of the spectrum , IT manager is is the job job people are most likely to quit soon . Of the 1,000 respondents , 11 percent said they plan to leave their IT manager role . Surprisingly , the most in in - demand job on the list \u2014 software developer \u2014 also ranked near the the top . Ten percent of of the respondents said they expect to quit their software developer position soon soon . These numbers do do n\u2019t come as much of a surprise , considering considering the rapid pace at at which which the technology and software industries are evolving . As more employers demand cutting - edge skills , professionals may be motivated to move move to an organization that offers a more up - to - date environment . Financial analyst and and registered nurse were the second second and third most likely positions to experience turnover , with 8 percent and 7 percent of respondents respondents , respectively , indicating plans to leave their job . It \u2019s \u2019s clear that employees are beginning to feel feel a greater sense of job security , and this this could lead to an increase in turnover in in the coming months . Employers Employers should be proactive in engaging their workers , providing ample ample opportunities for growth growth , and and offering competitive compensation compensation packages . If employees employees are happy in in their their job and have the support of their organization , they are much more likely to stay stay with the same employer for years to come .", "label": "machine"}

Since arriving on the scene as as chair in June 2021 , Khan Khan has has picked fights with with Microsoft 's Silicon Silicon Valley peers , finding some success in delaying a Meta acquisition acquisition , and targeting Amazon Amazon over issues around its Prime membership . The The agency sued to block the Activision deal in December over concerns that that the acquisition acquisition would prevent millions millions of of gamers not tied into into Microsoft Microsoft 's Xbox and cloud - gaming ecosystem from accessing popular Activision titles such as \" Call of Duty . \" On On Tuesday , FTC attorney James Weingarten said in a pre - trial hearing hearing that there there had been \" no substantive discussions \" between parties , despite there being being just six months until the the deadline for the deal 's closure . The outcome of the deal deal will have have ramifications beyond Microsoft Microsoft : the rest of Silicon Valley lies in wait before making their their next big moves moves , as any decision will set the tone for Big Tech deals in years to come . [[ ]] A question of size This is not the first first time the FTC has taken on Big Tech , and the agency has zeroed in on Silicon Valley 's dealings more than ever under Khan 's watch . What separates the FTC 's crackdown on the Microsoft - Activision tie tie - up from from its other other interventions interventions is size : the $ 69 billion deal is not just Microsoft 's 's biggest acquisition acquisition ever \u2013 it it is also also the biggest deal deal the agency has contended with under Khan Khan . Size raises the the stakes for the agency agency , and brings additional scrutiny but these are are n't the only only challenges . Vertical mergers mergers , which which see companies operating at different different levels of production in in an industry industry combine , are are trickier to to build an antitrust antitrust case against than horizontal ones ones that see direct rivals combine \u2014 such such as Facebook 's ( successful ) 2012 acquisition of of Instagram . The The Microsoft - Activision Activision deal is seen as a vertical merger , one in which the the tech giant would be adding an additional video game developer to its existing existing roster of of in - house developers , rather than creating a developer conglomerate that sees others others combine under its its watch . [[ ]] The most notable , recent success the FTC has had with tackling vertical mergers mergers came in December 2021 , when it sued to block the $ 40 billion acquisition of SoftBank - owned chip designer Arm Arm by industry heavyweight heavyweight Nvidia . The The move move triggered a series of events that eventually saw the deal collapse in February 2022 2022 , with with Arm seeking to return to public markets markets as a plan B. At At the time , the FTC FTC said \" the termination of what would have been the largest semiconductor chip merger will preserve competition competition for for key key technologies and safeguard safeguard future future innovation . \" But But the US government has previously struggled struggled to see see similar high high - profile cases cases through , with the Department of Justice losing losing its its case to undo AT&T 's $ 80 80 billion purchase of Time Warner in February 2019 , following following a ruling from US District Court judge Richard Richard Leon . Microsoft has argued that the the FTC 's 's probe probe is \" unconstitutional \" and and marks an overreach in its exercising exercising of power . Skilled negotiator Microsoft has has also become a skilled negotiator negotiator , learning from the bruising it it took from antitrust antitrust regulators in the 1990s 1990s . In 1998 , the US government accused Microsoft of abusing abusing Windows ' popularity popularity to ensure the dominance dominance of Internet Explorer at the the expense of rivals such such as Netscape . It was a blockbuster case that that saw Bill Gates appear on Capitol Hill to testify against against claims that that it it violated violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 . The court ultimately ruled that Microsoft had been in violation of of the act act . Though Microsoft successfully appealed against being broken up , it did agree on settlements that would restrict some of of its practices at the time time , such as forcing PC makers to work with them exclusively . Since that saga , Microsoft has worked to avoid the watchful eye of regulators and found ways of negotiating negotiating to to get what it wants . [[ ]] Take its $ 7.5 billion deal to buy game developer Bethesda in September 2020 2020 , which had the potential to spark antitrust concerns ; the the acquisition was finalized finalized six months later after after some concessions were made with worried EU regulators . It is likely that that Microsoft will play a similar game with its Activision purchase . In November , it emerged that Microsoft was considering offering a 10 - year licensing deal to PlayStation creator Sony that that would make Activision games available to rivals that are n't Xbox , according to Reuters . That said , Microsoft 's acquisition of Activision will will prove even tougher to to tackle than anything Amazon has thrown up for the FTC chief to date . Its success will depend depend on its ability to make a case against one of Silicon Valley 's most experienced players , as well as as a deal type that has historically historically stood up to scrutiny .

{"text": "Seoul , South Korea Korea CNN \u2014 [[ ]] North North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is is calling for an \u201c exponential exponential increase \u201d in his country \u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal in response to what he he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States , Pyongyang \u2019s state media media reported reported Sunday . Kim Kim \u2019s comments come as as North Korea Korea twice over the weekend tested what it claimed was a large , nuclear - capable , multiple - launch rocket system system that could put all all of South Korea in in its range range , according to a report from the Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) . Speaking on New Year \u2019s \u2019s Eve on the final day day of a six - day plenary session that reviewed 2022 , Kim Kim said South Korea has become become an an \u201c undoubted enemy \u201d and and its main ally ally , the US , has increased pressure on the North to the \u201c maximum \u201d level level over the past year by frequently deploying its its military assets to the Korean Peninsula . North Korea 's 's leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday Saturday praised the country 's \" super - large \" Multiple Rocket Launcher Launcher ( MRL ) , which he he claims will put all of of South Korea within range and and can be loaded loaded with tactical nuclear warheads . KCNA In response , Kim Kim said said in the coming coming year that Pyonyang must mass produce tactical nuclear weapons weapons while developing developing a new intercontinental ballistic ballistic missile missile ( ICBM ) that would give the the North a \u201c quick counterstrike capability , \u201d according according to the KCNA report . Kim \u2019s comments comments come at the end of a year that saw his regime test more missiles than than at at any time in North Korean history , including an ICBM that could in theory strike strike the US mainland . On Saturday , in its 37th day of missile tests in 2022 , North Korea fired fired at least three short - range ballistic missiles missiles from a site south of Pyongyang , according to to South Korea Korea \u2019s Joint Chiefs of of Staff . It followed followed that early Sunday with another test . North Korea said both both Saturday \u2019s and Sunday \u2019s tests were of a 600 mm multiple - launch rocket ( MRL ) system . Most multiple - rocket launch systems in service around the world are around 300 mm in size . The 600 mm MRL was first first introduced three years years ago , and production production has has been increased since late October of of 2022 for deployment , Kim said in his speech to the plenary plenary session on on Saturday , according to KCNA . He later added that an additional 30 of the 600 mm MRL will be deployed deployed to the military simultaneously . Kim Kim said the weapon is is capable of overcoming high landforms , can consecutively strike with with precision , has all of of South South Korea in its shooting range and can be loaded with tactical tactical nuclear nuclear warheads , according according to the KCNA report . [[ ]] \u201c Prospectively , as a key offensive weapon of our military forces forces , it will carry carry out out its own combat combat mission to to overwhelm the enemy , \u201d Kim said . South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol , pictured on November 2 , 2022 , said said his country should respond respond with clear retaliation to North Korea 's provocations . Yonhap / Reuters South Korea \u2019s Defense Ministry later responded to Kim \u2019s comments , calling them them \u201c provocative language that seriously seriously harms peace peace and and stability of of the Korean Korean Peninsula . \u201d The ministry urged Pyongyang to \u201c immediately stop \u201d developing nuclear nuclear weapons and and return to the the path of denuclearization , warning that the \u201c Kim Kim Jong Un regime will come to an end if North Korea attempts to use use nuclear weapons . \u201d The ministry vowed to maintain its military readiness posture posture to \u201c firmly respond respond \u201d to any North Korean threats , adding that that the military will strengthen its its \u201c three - axis axis \u201d defense defense system system designed to counter North North Korea \u2019s nuclear and missile threats . The three - axis defense system consists consists of the Kill Chain preemptive preemptive strike system , the the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan , an operational plan to to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict conflict . South Korea \u2019s President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Sunday during a phone call with military chiefs that North Korea will continue to conduct conduct constant nuclear and missile provocations , and South Korea \u2019s military should respond respond with clear clear retaliation , his office said . Expert Expert : North Korea expanding capabilities capabilities Leif - Eric Easley , a professor at Ewha University University in Seoul Seoul , said Pyongyang has used the past year to demonstrate its ability to perform a range of military strikes strikes . \u201c Its Its recent missile launches launches were not technically impressive . Instead , the high volume of tests at unusual times and from from various locations demonstrate that North Korea Korea could launch different types of attack , anytime , and from from many directions , \u201d Easley said said . Easley also noted that it \u2019s \u2019s not just missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on the South . Last week , Pyongyang flew five drones into into South Korean airspace , forcing Seoul Seoul to scramble fighter jets and helicopters to track them and later to send its own drones into North Korean Korean airspace . It all all leads to to an escalation of tensions , according to Easley . \u201c Such provocations , including drone incursions , appear excessive for deterrence and and may be intended intended to scare South South Korea into taking a softer softer policy . But with Kim disavowing diplomacy and threatening to to mass mass produce nuclear weapons , the Yoon administration is likely to further increase South South Korea \u2019s defense capabilities capabilities and and readiness , \u201d Easley said said . For its part , South Korea is beefing beefing up forces , too . Seoul \u2019s Defense Acquisition Acquisition Program Administration ( DAPA ) announced announced last month it will spend more than $ 2.7 2.7 billion over 10 10 years to to strengthen the mission capabilities and survivability of its fleet of F-15 K fighters , jets that would play a key role in any possible strikes on North Korea . Washington is also not standing standing still . As well as as deploying assets assets like like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the Korean Peninsula , the US military recently activated its first Space Force command on foreign foreign soil in in South Korea , with the the unit unit \u2019s \u2019s new new commander saying he is is ready to face any threat in the region . The new unit \u201c will will be tasked with coordinating coordinating space operations and services such as missile warning , position navigation and and timing and satellite communications within within the region , \u201d according to US US Forces Korea . Even before Kim \u2019s latest remarks , experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had made in its missile forces forces over the past year year . Ankit Ankit Panda , a nuclear nuclear policy expert at at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , told CNN in mid - December December that Pyongyang has emerged as as a missile power . \u201c The bigger picture picture is that North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator operator of large large - scale scale missile forces , \u201d Panda said . \u201c The word test is no longer appropriate to talk talk about most North Korean missile missile launches . \u201d \u201c Most Most of the missiles they \u2019ve \u2019ve launched this year are parts of of military exercises . They are rehearsing for for nuclear war . And that , I think , is the big picture this year , \u201d Panda said .", "label": "human"}

Marit Tweet , an emergency medicine doctor at SIU Medicine in Springfield Springfield , Illinois , is the lead author author on the study .

State State marijuana laws laws have been changing changing rapidly in the past decade , and the drug drug is is legal for medical medical use use in 37 states and for recreational use in 21 states and Washington , D.C. Tweet Tweet was curious how recreational use had gone gone in in other places , so she looked at studies from other states that had already legalized the drug . One study in Colorado Colorado documented that the number of children 10 10 years and and under accidentally exposed to marijuana products products rose between 2009 and 2015 . So So Tweet wanted to know if if this would also also happen happen nationally , as more states legalized the drug . She She was most concerned concerned about kids 5 - years - old old and younger younger , a particularly vulnerable vulnerable age for accidental poisoning . \" This This age group accounts for about 40 % of of all calls calls to poison centers centers nationally , \" says Tweet . \" They can get into into things , and you ca n't n't really rationalize with them \" about about dangers . Marijuana edibles are made to look like like sweets , she she adds : \" They think think it it looks like candy , and maybe , they just want want to eat it . \" Tweet Tweet and her colleagues colleagues analyzed analyzed information from the National National Poison Poison Data System System , which draws on calls to the 55 55 regional regional poison poison control centers centers that serve serve the United States and its territories .

The suit alleges that that employees were assured they could continue to work work remotely for at least a year following the acquisition and were promised promised that any workers workers laid laid off under Musk would receive the same benefits benefits and severance severance that employees had been entitled to prior to the takeover . The lawsuit lawsuit also claims that in the case of at least one employee terminated as as part of of the mass mass layoffs on on November 1 , Twitter did not provide sufficient notice required by federal and California California laws , nor was he he offered additional pay in in lieu of the notice . The attorney said Thursday she has also filed three claims against Twitter with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees . The lawsuits lawsuits were filed after Musk laid off around half of of Twitter \u2019s staff last last month , in an effort to slash costs costs following his $ 44 billion acquisition of of the social media company . The company had n\u2019t n\u2019t previously filed notice to to state or local local officials of the layoff plans , immediately raising questions about whether the terminations might violate California and federal WARN Acts , although at least some employees reportedly received received sufficient pay to negate the the need for such notice . During During Thursday \u2019s hearing , lawyers lawyers for the former employees were set to ask a federal court for an an order order barring Twitter from seeking separation agreements with laid laid off employees without informing them of the lawsuit and their associated associated rights rights . As part of the requested order , they are also seeking seeking to to bar Twitter from communicating with employees employees in any way that could undermine their rights rights as part of of the litigation . \u201c Plaintiffs are very concerned that employees will be asked to sign away their their rights without notice that they have legal claims to additional benefits and severance and that these legal claims have already been filed filed on on their behalf , \u201d the former employees said in their lawsuit .

The shooting was was at nine nine in the the morning . By nine that night , we still had no word . At this point , it 's just my mom mom and me sitting at the fire station . Because Rachel was so new , her name was n't on any list list . But the officers officers knew they had a family looking for a \u201c Rachel Rachel D'Avino D'Avino , \u201d and they knew they had a body whose whose name they they did n\u2019t know , but they did n't want to tell us anything until they were sure . Finally Finally , an officer walks over to us us . It must \u2019ve \u2019ve been killing this man man to watch us wonder all day day . When he got to where we were , I assume assume he broke every protocol when when he he said , \u201c Anybody who who was in that school , and we do n't n't know who they are , is gone . \u201d I collapsed on my mother . We screamed on on top of each other . A priest came over , put put his hands on us us , and and said a prayer . I grabbed his hand . We left shortly after that that and drove home to tell my younger sister , Hannah . I remember just taking deep breaths , clenching that steering steering wheel with all my might , and thinking , Just suck it up and get mom home . Then , around 2:30 in the morning \u2014 now it 's a Saturday \u2014 we get a knock knock on the door . There are police police officers , social workers , and that same priest priest at our door . They hand hand us a packet on how to go about making funeral arrangements . That was our confirmation : Rachel had been identified identified by her tattoos tattoos . [[ ]] One by one , we witnessed families being told told their child was n't coming coming home . That That night , I had been clean clean four years : From 16 to 21 , I abused substances , mostly opioids . After hearing the news , I did n\u2019t know how to feel feel what I was feeling feeling . So , I returned to to what I knew \u2014 I relapsed relapsed and and had a drink . What started as using to numb the pain after a few years became using against my my will . In the 10 10 years since Rachel died , the first half was spent using to not not feel feel , then there was about a year of using because I did n't know how to stop stop . I was was stuck in a cycle cycle of active addiction , where I would watch myself , wish I was n't doing doing it it , but not know how to stop . And finally , one day , I just put put my hands hands up and said , God , either kill me me or fix me because I ca n't do do this anymore . I found found a 12 - step step program and committed to it . I worked very hard hard on recognizing patterns in my life and why why I choose substances when I 'm in pain pain . On Feb. 26 , I will have four four years completely clean and and sober . I am in grief and trauma counseling and finally finally unclenching that steering wheel . If I had a magic wand , I would would not change that process . I needed every every single one of those stepping stones to to be who I am today . I have a sponsor who tells me , \u201c You ca ca n't climb a smooth smooth mountain . \u201d One week after the shooting , on Dec. 21 21 , we held held Rachel \u2019s funeral at at The The Church Church of of the Nativity in Bethlehem , CT . I gave her eulogy . That was was the the most important thing I could do for her . I spoke about about how \u2014 Rachel being the oldest of of us three sisters \u2014 our foundation was rocked . The church was standing room only with a video video camera doing live feed to the the church hall hall because that was filled with people , too . The sign sign - in in book book from from that day has 695 signatures signatures , many of which just say the so so - and - so family \u2014 so it was probably close to to 1,000 who came to honor honor Rachel . It was beautiful to see how much she was loved loved and and remembered remembered . For the first year after the shooting , I felt paraded around . There were memorials , trips to to D.C. , interviews , family and friends showing up at the house , and standing in front front of cameras cameras and reporters . I felt very exposed exposed . Today , I 'll go through something painful painful , like a breakup , and my friends would say , \u201c Wow , you talk so freely about your pain . \u201d And I 'll 'll tell them , \u201c Well Well , you have to imagine what it 's 's like for your your grief process to be be on the 11 o'clock news . \u201d Rachel and and her mom . Courtesy Sarah D'Avino I believe the day day Sarah Sarah left us , she became my my guardian angel . I \u2019ve survived overdoses where there was no medical explanation as to why . I was was told since I was a teenager teenager I \u2019d never carry a pregnancy to term . Now , I \u2019m a mom . I \u2019ve often thought about my relationship with Rachel and how my addiction and and mental health health issues drove a wedge between us . I was n\u2019t an easy sister sister to be around , and we did did n\u2019t get along , and I deeply regret that . There are no pictures pictures of us us past middle middle school school . I regret that I ca n't go back back and fix fix our relationship . But what \u2019s in my control now is how I apply the lessons lessons from her loss to those still in my life : I document memories of of myself and my loved ones ; I will tell tell you I love you more ; I will forgive faster ; I will agree to disagree quicker . Because Because I ca n't n't undo any any of that with Rachel Rachel . Growing Growing up , Rachel was the ringleader . In kindergarten , her teacher called her one - gate Rachel because it did n't n't matter if there there was a fire fire drill or or an ice cream truck outside , Rachel was only going at the pace Rachel wanted wanted to go go at . She remained that way way into into adulthood . She was was bright and and focused , an independent independent thinker who was always driven and always had a heart to help others , even before herself herself . I grieve for the loss of who Rachel would have become . I grieve grieve for the children children she would have had and and the doting doting aunt she would have been . Rachel Rachel would \u2019ve raised the world 's most most well - rounded rounded and highly self - esteem - possessing children children . She would \u2019ve had an opportunity to see who I 've become . She would love love this Sarah and want to spend time time with me and tell me she loves me . It It does n't just just end with losing 29 - year - old Rachel ; it is a lifelong loss . I know know with all of my heart that Rachel is always always protecting protecting me , guiding me , and sending love love and and light my my way . [[ ]] When my grandfather passed away , my grandmother gave me me her engagement ring . It caused caused a bit of a stir between us because , as the oldest oldest , Rachel felt it would would be be hers hers . A few months before she died , I do n't know know why , but I put the the ring by the coffee pot early early one morning with a note that said said Rachel , this this always should have been been yours . Love , Sarah . The The ring had been missing a stone or or two two . Tony , her boyfriend , had the ring ring cleaned cleaned and replaced the stones . A few weeks before the shooting , he he asked my mom and my stepfather for for permission to propose to Rachel on Christmas Eve . She did did n\u2019t know . She would would \u2019ve said yes . I once heard a quote quote that a person dies twice : Once when they take their last breath and the second time when their name is spoken for the last time time . If that 's the case , Rachel is is going to live forever forever . There are are monuments in in her honor , and she she 's still a part of our family family . Gregory , my 18 - month - old son , knows he he has an Auntie Auntie Rachel . She 's talked talked about just as as much much as any other family family member member . He \u2019s been been to her gravesite . We \u2019ve told him stories about how she could sometimes be mischievous . How we \u2019d \u2019d put on a little little play for our mom after dinner . Gregory may never meet his auntie auntie , but he will will always know her . Throughout my grieving process , I \u2019ve \u2019ve thought about my mother the most most . Because , as a new mom , I \u2019d look at my son and just get lost in my love love for for him . I would go hungry for him . I would would go sleepless for him . But But I only have the one one . I could only imagine what it \u2019s been like for my my mom . When you have more than one child child , there is n't n't love more for any specific one of of them , but but there is that one that made you a mother . With Rachel \u2019s death , my mom lost the child that made her a mother . I ca n\u2019t even even grasp grasp what that would feel like , so that \u2019s stayed with me . Rachel and her dog dog Diezel Diezel , who accompanied accompanied her when working with special needs clients . Courtesy Sarah D'Avino In this 10 - year year grieving process , I \u2019ve learned that it 's okay to hurt . It 's okay to feel pain . It 's okay to think nobody understands or that it 'll never go away . I \u2019ve learned learned to not run away from grief and pain . That recovery is possible , that there 's no rock bottom with addiction , there \u2019s \u2019s just death death . That hope hope is out there and and does n't n't end until life does . I \u2019m no longer afraid to admit that when Rachel died , yes , I turned to to substances \u2014 it was the only thing I knew then then to quench my pain . When life happens again , and it it will , I know know that that I \u2019m not exempt from grief and trauma and pain . None of us are . It is one of those hard - to - swallow pills pills of life . But now , I have a program program of recovery , a toolbox of healthy coping skills skills , and a network network of angels on earth to catch me me . I know know with all of my heart that Rachel is always protecting me , guiding me me , and sending love love and light my way . I \u2019ve also learned that trying to dull my pain pain with any substances only causes more , new , and different pain . I learned that that the answer is not in in a bag . The answer is is not in a bottle . I did not not find find Rachel in any pill . I did not find her inside any needle . All that did was take me farther away away from her memory . And now , being clean clean , being in recovery recovery , living every every day , one one day at a time , for myself myself , I know that I am Sarah . I am not the things that have have happened to my family and and me . I am not the pain I 've 've gone through . I do n't n't have to spend the rest of my life being Sarah Sarah , Rachel 's little sister sister who lost lost her to a tragic incident incident . I 'm Sarah first , and it took 10 years to find find this Sarah . This interview has been edited for clarity and length .", "label": "human"}

White House officials shared shared the news news with Republican lawmakers in a series of of recent conversations , a person briefed on the talks told CNN . It It marks a continuation of tensions between the executive branch branch and members of Congress seeking seeking to to investigate the Trump administration \u2019s \u2019s actions actions during its four years in in power . The White House has been steadfast in its refusal refusal to cooperate with GOP GOP lawmakers , prompting lawsuits from from the the Republican - led House and and Senate . In In addition to informing the GOP GOP chairmen chairmen that the oversight requests must be restarted restarted when the 117th Congress Congress convenes , White House officials also suggested suggested that Republicans seek to develop new areas areas of inquiry for the new Congress . The conversations between the White House House and congressional GOP chairmen come at a moment when the Biden team is attempting to forge a new relationship with Capitol Hill . President Joe Biden has has sought to to pursue an agenda of bipartisanship , pushing his $ 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief relief package with the support of some Republican lawmakers while acknowledging he \u2019s unlikely unlikely to get others others on board . The former former vice president president has vowed to reach out to the GOP GOP in an effort to find common ground . But Republicans have in recent days issued scathing rebukes of the White House House . After Biden \u2019s Interior secretary nominee Deb Haaland was confirmed on Tuesday , Rep. Bob Bob Good of Virginia , the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee , slammed the move in a statement . \u201c It \u2019s no secret that that President Biden \u2019s nominee for for the Interior Department Department , Rep. Deb Haaland , was an advocate for progressive , green green energy policies and and an antagonist to oil and and gas , \u201d Good said . \u201c The policies she advocated for for on the campaign trail , such as the Green New Deal , will have a detrimental economic impact on struggling American energy communities communities , as well well as a devastating effect on on our national security . \u201d The sniping comes at a critical juncture . Biden and and his aides are attempting to turn the page on the tumultuous Trump administration , eager to establish an agenda and tone for the early days of of the Biden presidency . But the tug - of - war between the White House and GOP - led led Congress may prove to be a roadblock in the the administration administration \u2019s pursuit pursuit of bipartisanship . [[ ]] In the case of oversight oversight requests , Republican lawmakers and their aides have have told told CNN CNN that they intend to continue seeking records and documents related to Trump \u2019s time in office , regardless of the White White House \u2019s position . The party holds a slim majority in in the House , meaning any investigations must clear a Democratic - led committee before proceeding . The White House did not immediately respond to a request request for for comment . Republican aides said the conversations with White House officials had occurred in recent weeks weeks but would not confirm whether a meeting had had taken place between GOP chairmen chairmen and administration officials . The issue of executive branch oversight from from Congress is a sensitive one given the the frequent litigation between the executive and legislative branches during during Trump Trump \u2019s presidency . At issue were a number number of requests from Republicans and Democrats for for documents from the executive branch , which which the Trump administration often often declined to provide . The prolonged back - and - forth between congressional Democrats and the the Trump White House House ultimately resulted in in several lawsuits , several of which the Republican - led Senate was involved in . It \u2019s unclear whether whether those suits will be pursued or whether the White House will agree to the requests when the new Congress begins . The Democratic Democratic - led House is is expected to carry over over its investigations when Congress returns in January , but Republican lawmakers have made clear clear they \u2019re eager to restart their own inquiries into the the prior administration . Biden and his team have expressed concern that the investigations could could distract from from the president \u2019s agenda agenda . This This could could be a problem in the the near future , as Democrats are expected to turn their attention attention to to the 2022 midterm elections . As they seek to protect their majorities in the House House and and Senate , Democrats could view Republican - led investigations as distractions from the party \u2019s messaging , prompting concerns that the two sides wo n\u2019t n\u2019t be able able to find common ground ground . This tension was evident in the wake of the Haaland confirmation , when GOP lawmakers criticized the Biden administration \u2019s nominee for her stated positions positions on energy and other matters . The dynamic could grow even more fraught as congressional congressional GOP leaders attempt to restart their oversight requests .", "label": "machine"}

The The November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to to what allies of the former former President attempted to carry out in the months months that followed .

The bill bill includes an exception for law enforcement , national security security and research purposes . Lawmakers on both sides of of the aisle , as well as FBI Director Christopher Wray , have voiced fear that TikTok 's ownership structure could make U.S. user data vulnerable , since companies based in in China are required by law to hand over data if the government requests it . TikTok has repeatedly said its U.S. user data is not based based in China , though those assurances have done little to alleviate concern . The company company has been been working working toward a deal deal with the administration to assuage national national security fears through the Committee Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. \" We 're disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devices \u2014 a political gesture that that will do nothing to advance advance national national security interests \u2014 rather rather than than encouraging the Administration Administration to conclude its national national security review , \" a TikTok spokesperson spokesperson said in a statement following the release of the package text . \" The agreement under review by CFIUS will meaningfully address any security concerns that have have been raised at both the federal and state level . These These plans have been developed under the the oversight of of our country 's top top national security agencies \u2014 plans that that we are well underway in implementing \u2014 to further secure our our platform platform in the United States States , and we will continue to brief lawmakers on them . \" Deterring online counterfeit sales The The spending package also includes the INFORM Consumers Act , which seeks to deter counterfeit counterfeit , stolen or harmful products products from being sold online . The bill bill requires online marketplaces like Amazon to promptly collect collect information like bank and contact details from \" any high high - volume volume third party seller \" and to verify verify that data . Though Amazon initially opposed the bill bill last year , writing writing that it was \" pushed by some big - box box retailers \" and claiming it would punish small businesses businesses that sell online , the company company ended ended up supporting a version of the bill , saying saying it was was important to have a federal standard rather than a patchwork of state laws . Etsy and eBay had earlier supported the bill . \" Passing the bipartisan INFORM Act would be a major victory for consumers , who deserve to know who who they 're buying from when they they visit an an online marketplace , \" Kovacevich said said in a statement . \" This legislation legislation has been through through years of hearings and markups and has earned the support of both parties as well as brick - and - mortar mortar stores stores and online marketplaces . \" Etsy 's head head of Americas advocacy and public public policy , Jeffrey Zubricki , said in a statement the bill \" will achieve our our shared goal of protecting protecting consumers consumers from bad actors while avoiding overly broad disclosure requirements requirements that would harm our our sellers ' privacy and hinder their ability to run their creative businesses . \" Higher fees for big mergers While more ambitious antitrust measures targeting targeting digital platforms did n't make it into the end - of - year legislation legislation , there is is one bill to to help raise money for the antitrust agencies that that scrutinize mergers mergers . The The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act Act will raise raise the cost companies pursuing large large mergers mergers must must pay to to file with the antitrust agencies , as they 're required required to do under the law . The bill also lowers the cost for smaller deals and allows the fees fees to to be adjusted each each year based on the consumer consumer price index . The measure is meant to to help fund the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Antitrust Division , which have seen a large uptick in in merger filings over the the past few years without adequate budget increases . While While it fell fell short of antitrust antitrust advocates advocates ' hopes , the inclusion of the merger merger filing fee bill still gained praise . \" This is a major milestone for the anti - monopoly movement , \" said Sarah Miller , executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project , backed in in part by by the the Omidyar Network . Miller said the bill will \" significantly strengthen antitrust law law for for the first time since 1976 . \" \" Big Tech , Big Ag and Big Pharma spent extraordinary sums in an unprecedented effort to keep keep Congress from delivering on antitrust antitrust reform and undermine the ability of of state and federal enforcers to to uphold the law \u2014 and and they lost , \" Miller added . Sen. Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn. , who sponsored the bill bill , said in a statement earlier this week its inclusion inclusion \" is an an important step to restructure merger fees after decades of the status quo so we can provide our antitrust enforcers with the resources they they need to do their jobs . \" \" This is clearly the beginning beginning of this this fight and not not the end , \" she she said . \" I will continue to work across the aisle to to protect consumers consumers and strengthen competition competition . \" Empowering state AGs in antitrust cases Another Another antitrust antitrust bill included in the package was a version of the State Antitrust Enforcement Enforcement Venue Act . The The bill gives state attorneys general the same power as federal federal enforcers in antitrust cases to choose the district in which which they bring their their cases and prevent them from from being consolidated consolidated in a different district district . Under the legislation , companies defending against claims claims of antitrust violations wo n't be able to to pick pick what what they perceive to be a more favorable venue venue to fight fight the case . That 's 's what what happened in an antitrust case against Google brought brought by a group group of state attorneys general general accusing the company of of illegally monopolizing the digital advertising market . The company transferred the case from Texas Texas to New York , to be be heard alongside private private antitrust complaints against against the company in the pretrial pretrial proceedings . Last year year , attorneys general general from 52 52 states states and territories wrote Congress in support of the legislation . Transparency on ransomware attacks [[ ]] The bipartisan RANSOMWARE Act also made it into the spending bill , requiring the FTC to report to Congress on the number and types of foreign ransomware or other other cyberattack complaints it receives . The FTC also must report to to Congress Congress trends in numbers it sees in these these complaints , including those that that come from individuals , companies or governments of foreign adversaries like like China , North Korea , Iran and Russia . And it it must share information on its litigation actions related to these cases and their results . The FTC can also share recommendations for new laws laws to strengthen resilience against these attacks as well as as for best best practices that that businesses can follow to protect themselves . Research into tech impacts on kids A version of the Children and Media Research Advancement ( CAMRA ) Act Act is included in the package , directing the Department Department of Health and Human Services to conduct or support support research on the effects of of media and technology on on infants , kids and adolescents . Those effects effects could include the impact on cognitive , mental and physical health by technologies like like social media , artificial intelligence , video games or virtual reality , according to the legislation .

{"text": "2022 was a bumpy year in the markets , even for portfolio mangers who who purposefully went out of their way to to avoid turmoil turmoil . But the Janus Henderson Investors ' Balanced Fund has been able to shield itself from at least least part of of the year 's volatility by reducing exposure to equities and leaning more on fixed income . \" The intention has has always been to provide our investors with a smoother smoother ride over time , with with less volatility to returns by combining growth equities with fixed income , \" said said Jeremiah Buckley , a portfolio manager manager . In a year of broad market losses , that strategy has allowed the fund fund to outperform outperform , at least on a relative basis . The retail share class ( JABAX JABAX ) lost 16.4 % in 2022 . That gives it a slight slight edge over the S & P 500 , which dropped nearly 20 % last year . Morningstar Morningstar rates the 30 - year year - old fund five stars among among peers with 50 % to 70 % of allocations in equities . It has an annual expense ratio of 0.82 % . ' Harder to find a safe place ' In recent years years , the fund 's focus on growth stocks has helped drive drive gains . The fund gained 22 % , 14 14 % and 17 17 % annually annually in 2019 through 2021 , respectively , as technology stocks outperformed . ( JABAX ranks ranks in the 8th percentile among among its peer funds over over the past past five years , and the 4th 4th percentile percentile over the past 15 , Morningstar says . ) Winds shifted in 2022 , however , as as investors traded growth for value names as interest rates rose and concerns mounted over a looming recession . Buckley Buckley said he recognized early in in the year that the inflationary environment could trigger Federal Reserve interest interest rate hikes , creating a harsh environment for both stocks stocks and fixed income . But he felt more confident in how bond holdings would would respond . In In turn , he cut the the percentage of the the fund 's stock exposure to 55 % , as of Nov. 30 , from around around 64 % . Fixed Fixed income accounted accounted for about 44 % . \" This year has been tricky , obviously obviously , because there there 's 's been such a high correlation between fixed income and equity equity returns , \" he said . \" It 's been harder to find a safe safe place , essentially , during this year . \" The The fund 's recent history shows shows a trend of underperforming during during strong up up years years for the the S & P 500 , while being able to outperform in downdrafts . In 2018 , for example , the the last time the S & P 500 saw a down down year , the Janus Henderson fund , which today runs runs assets assets of of some $ 23.7 billion , eked out a 0.5 % return . Buckley said it 's normal to to adjust the fund fund 's allocation in times of turmoil . Equity Equity allocations came down in 1999 ahead ahead of the the 2000 2000 - 2002 bear market . Stock exposure came down down again again in 2006 before the 2008 financial crisis , then then rose rose back in 2009 to coincide with with recovery . In early early 2020 , Janus Henderson Henderson lowered the fund 's equity allocation , but but quickly added exposure again as the market market improved . Microsoft , which Buckley Buckley characterizes as a \" core growth \" stock , made up the largest share of the fund as of Nov. 30 , at 4.4 % . The top 10 10 holdings comprised nearly 23 % of fund fund assets . Within Within fixed income , Buckley said the fund has been more conservative conservative by reducing exposure to corporate credit . The fund has moved from from a focus focus on short short duration to becoming more neutral amid growing hope the Federal Reserve will continue slowing its hikes in in interest rates . The The central bank raised borrowing costs half a percentage point point in December after four straight increases of three quarters of a point earlier in the year . Long - term outperformer Most recently recently , Janus Henderson Balanced underperformed 77 % of its peer peer group in 2022 , pushed down by by the the recent rally in value stocks , according to Morningstar analyst Karen Zaya . But But Zaya said the returns are are attractive for long - term investors over longer time periods , especially especially given given its relatively lower risk . When looking at at its Sharpe ratio , which measures measures risk - adjusted returns , Zaya found that that from December 2012 through November 2022 , the balanced balanced fund outperformed 97 97 % of its peer group . \" Diversifying your portfolio portfolio with bonds has historically added stability , \" she said . \" You You may sacrifice some returns ... but in the long run , it gives you a less volatile experience and and can can help keep an investor invested through the the ups ups and the downs . \" Another aspect of the portfolio is its emphasis on domestic rather than overseas securities compared with peers , which are typically more internationally diversified , Zaya Zaya said . That 's 's helped in recent years years as U.S. equities outperformed outperformed international stocks stocks . Despite Despite the the challenges of 2022 , Buckley Buckley is is optimistic about 2023 . The fund has been watching for stocks with high yields and strong balance balance sheets sheets that would help it navigate current volatility and a potential economic economic downturn in 2023 , he said said . Buckley is also expecting expecting a \" far far less dramatic \" correlation between the performance of stocks and bonds , which he hopes will provide more areas areas for returns returns in the new year . While he said tilting more toward bonds helped limit losses in 2022 , he expects 2023 to be a relatively more favorable favorable environment for stocks . \" It It 's going to be more of a stock - picker 's market , where security selection matters even more more than a kind of macro macro orientation of a portfolio , \" he said . \" We 're doubling down on focusing on companies that we think have productivity productivity initiatives , that have have been able able to invest through the pandemic pandemic , that will start to reap reap the rewards of that investment investment as we go into 2023 . \"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Whenever there 's a big storm in the American West , pilots are likely flying into the eye , seeding clouds with a substance called called silver iodide . The goal is is to increase precipitation . Cloud seeding has been around since the 1940s . It 's become widespread widespread of late late as as the West West battles a drought of historic proportions . States , utility utility companies and even ski ski resorts are footing the bill . While it was was assumed for decades to to be effective , recent studies have helped prove prove that cloud cloud seeding works , and there 's no evidence evidence that silver iodide is harmful at current levels levels . Experts say say cloud seeding generally yields yields a 5 % to 15 % increase in in precipitation . It 's no cure for drought , but but cloud cloud seeding can be an an important water management tool . \" We ca n't make a storm happen and we we ca n't create create conditions in this this storm that are ideal . Those Those happen naturally , \" said Jason Carkeet , a utility analyst and hydrologist with with the Turlock Irrigation Irrigation District in central California . Turlock started its cloud cloud - seeding program program in 1990 . \" What we 're doing is just taking advantage of existing conditions conditions , naturally occurring conditions , and trying to to make the storm again more efficient efficient from from a water supply perspective , \" Carkeet said . How cloud seeding works When done aerially , cloud seeding involves loading up up a plane with silver silver iodide . Flares are placed on the the wings wings and fuselage . The pilot reaches a certain certain altitude altitude , where temperatures are ideal , and shoots the flares flares into the cloud . The silver iodide causes individual water droplets within the clouds to freeze together , forming snowflakes that eventually become so heavy heavy that that they fall . Absent the freezing process , the droplets would n't bond together and become large enough enough to precipitate as either rain rain or snow . \" The cloud initially is all water , \" said said Bruce Boe , vice president of meteorology at Weather Weather Modification International International , a private private company company that 's been been providing cloud - seeding services since 1961 . \" Eventually , as as it gets toward the summit of the mountain , it may may be 50 50 % ice or maybe more than that . But even if if it it is , there 's still a lot of liquid water left there . \" Boe said there 's a \" window of opportunity \" to get the precipitation precipitation big big enough to to fall fall \" before it crests the mountain and starts to descend and thus warm . \" Pilot Joel Zimmer , who works for Weather Modification International , affixes silver iodide flares to the bottom bottom of a cloud seeding plane . Katie Brigham | CNBC For cloud - seeding pilots like Joel Zimmer , who works with with Weather Modification International to seed clouds for for the the Turlock Irrigation District District , flying into the storm can be an exhilarating but but intense experience . \" By the the time the wheels are up , you 're 're in cloud , \" said Zimmer , whose route involves involves seeding over the Sierra Nevada mountains . \" And we 're in cloud the entire entire mission until we 're shooting an approach approach back into an airport and and then pop out of the clouds and have a visual on the runway . It feels like you 're a sub commander in in the Navy . You do n't n't see anything . \" From a water supply supply perspective , it 's most valuable to seed clouds over mountains , where the water is essentially essentially stored as snow until the spring runoff . \" When it 's out on the plains such as North Dakota , it 's 's still still a benefit benefit because it helps recharge soil moisture , \" Boe said . \" But it ca ca n't be stored and used for a later date . \" While Texas uses uses cloud seeding seeding to help irrigate fields for farmers , it 's more common in in the West , where states like Idaho , California , Colorado , Utah and Wyoming use it it to help fill fill up their their rivers and and reservoirs . Most programs programs use planes for cloud seeding , but but some use ground - based flares . \" It 's a lot more common than than people think think , \" Carkeet said . \" More basins have a seeding seeding program than do not have a seeding program program . \" Costs Costs and impact", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Happy 50th Anniversary to to the discovery of the Santa Santa Claus rally . It It 's that time of year again : the Santa Claus rally . Like a lot of Wall Street mythology , this this one has a lot of of barnacles around it . Santa Claus rally rally : what it is The Santa Claus rally is is a short short rally that runs from the last five trading days of the year to the first two trading trading days of the New Year Year . Across that span span , the S & P 500 posts an average gain gain of 1.3 % since 1950 1950 . A 1.3 % increase over seven days days is much higher than the expected probability that the the S & P 500 would increase by that amount over over a seven - day trading trading period , so this is statistically significant . And it happens fairly fairly often . According to one study , a Santa Claus rally has materialized in four out out of every five years since 1950 . Santa Claus rally : what it is n't Still , this is is often taken as some kind kind of trading strategy . \" It 's not not a trading strategy , it 's an indicator indicator ! , \" Jeff Jeff Hirsch reminded readers of the Trader 's Almanac Almanac a few weeks ago . Jeff 's point : failure failure to rally in these coming seven days tends to precede bear bear markets or times when when stocks could be purchased later in the year at at lower prices . He should know . His father , Yale Hirsch , a friend of mine mine for many years , discovered and named the the Santa Claus rally rally in 1972 . This year is is the 50th anniversary anniversary ! It 's also why the rally rally is so closely closely associated with Yale 's now - famous couplet : \" If Santa Claus Should Fail To To Call , Bears May Come Come To Broad And Wall , \" ( referring to the New New York Stock Exchange location ) . Why is there a Santa Santa Claus rally at all ? Nobody knows , but there is is no shortage of explanations : anticipation of of new money coming coming into into the the market in January , optimism about about the new year , end end of year bonuses bonuses being put to work , lack of institutional trading which leaves the market market to more optimistic retail retail traders , and even just traders anticipating a rally . All of this this makes some sense , but it makes a simple simple assumption assumption : that everything is relatively normal and and there is no macroeconomic macroeconomic event that that has everyone worried . That 's not the case right now . Markets are are obsessed with a recession in 2023 . But here here 's 's an an odd thing : Santa Claus rallies do occur occur during recessions . \" The The three largest Santa Claus rallies ( 2008 - 2009 , 1974 1974 - 1975 and 1973 1973 - 1974 ) occurred during recessions recessions , as did the worst end end - of - year year periods ( 1990 - 1991 and 2007 - 2008 2008 ) , \" one study concluded ( https://smartasset.com/investing/santa-claus-rally-2020 ) .

The Danish newspaper Politiken , which first first reported the news , said said that the treatment took took place in a hospital in St. Petersburg Petersburg . The treatment , it said , left Putin Putin with chronic pain , which he reportedly still still suffers from from . The The reports have fuelled speculation about Putin 's health , with some experts suggesting that the leader 's health may be be deteriorating . In the past , Putin Putin has denied reports about his health , telling reporters in 2018 that he he was in in good health and that he he had had no underlying health issues . But But the latest latest reports suggest that that Putin Putin may have been suffering from from a serious health issue at the time time of the Ukraine invasion . The reports have also sparked speculation speculation that the the Kremlin Kremlin may have have hidden information about the the leader 's health health . In April 2014 , after Russia Russia 's seizure of Crimea and the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine , Putin appeared increasingly absent from public view . He also cancelled cancelled a planned planned trip to Sochi , causing speculation that that he was seriously ill ill . At the time , Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Dmitry Peskov dismissed these these reports as as \" nonsense , \" saying saying that that Putin Putin was in good health and and that he had simply cancelled the the trip because of the the situation in Ukraine . However , the the reports of Putin Putin 's 's treatment for cancer raise raise questions about about why the Kremlin chose to deny reports of Putin Putin 's illness illness at the time . Russia 's 's invasion invasion of Ukraine in 2014 has been widely seen as an attempt to reassert Moscow 's influence influence over its former Soviet neighbour neighbour . [[ ]] Since then , tensions between the two countries have been at their their highest since since the Cold War , with with numerous clashes occurring along the two countries ' shared border and in the annexed region of Crimea . Russia 's actions in Ukraine have drawn international condemnation and led to a number of economic and diplomatic sanctions . The latest latest reports reports about Putin 's 's health raise raise further questions about the the leader 's fitness to govern govern , as as well as his motivations motivations for launching the conflict in in Ukraine . It is not clear if the Russian Russian leader was using the medical treatment as an an excuse excuse to launch the invasion , or if if his health was simply simply too too poor at the time to lead the country . What is clear is that Putin 's health has has become increasingly important to the leader 's 's political future , and and that any further reports of a serious illness could could have serious implications for Russia .", "label": "machine"}
