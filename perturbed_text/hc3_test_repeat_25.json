{"text": "There are are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars stars and and other objects in in the universe . One One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the the apparent apparent shift in the position of an an object object against against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold hold your your finger up in front of of you you and and close close one eye , then then open that eye eye and close close the other eye , your your finger will appear appear to move move against the background . This is because you are looking at it it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to to nearby stars . By measuring the the apparent shift in the the position of a star star against against the background of more distant distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate calculate how far away the star is is . This This method method is most most accurate accurate for stars that are are relatively relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant distant objects , such such as quasars quasars and galaxies , we use use other methods methods to determine their distance distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which which involves using a series of \" rungs rungs \" or steps to to measure measure the distance to to increasingly distant distant objects . Each Each rung rung of the ladder relies on on a different different type type of \" standard candle , \" which is is an object that is is known known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By By measuring the brightness brightness of the object as seen from from Earth Earth , we can determine its distance . For example example , one one type of standard candle candle that we use use is is a type of star star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the the time between between pulses is is directly related related to the the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between between pulses , we we can determine the the star 's 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have have determined determined the distance to a Cepheid Cepheid variable , we can can use it it as a \" rung rung \" on the cosmic cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance distance to to other objects that that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the the distance to to even more distant galaxies . This way , we we can can build up up a \" ladder \" of distances distances that reaches reaches all the way out to the the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Quantum levitation is is a phenomenon phenomenon in which an object is suspended above above a surface without any any physical contact . This can can be achieved achieved using the the principles principles of quantum mechanics , which is a branch branch of physics that that studies studies the behavior behavior of particles particles at very small small scales scales , such as atoms and and subatomic particles . To To understand understand how quantum levitation works works , it helps to think about a magnet magnet . Magnets have north and south poles poles , and and opposite poles poles attract each other while while similar similar poles repel each other . This This is because because of the the magnetic magnetic field that that surrounds a magnet . Now imagine a superconductor superconductor , which is is a material that can can conduct conduct electricity with zero resistance resistance . When a superconductor superconductor is placed in a strong magnetic field field , it is able able to \" float \" above above the magnet due to to the repelling forces between between the the two . This is known known as the Meissner effect effect . Quantum levitation works in a similar way , but instead instead of using a magnet magnet and a superconductor , it it uses a superconductor and a surface with with a pattern pattern of of magnetic field . When the superconductor superconductor is is cooled to a very low temperature , it becomes becomes a superconductor and is is able to \" float \" above the surface surface due to the repelling forces between the two .

It is is a number that tells tells us us how how many atoms atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance . For For example example , let 's 's say we have a substance substance called \" sugar . \" If If we have one mole of of sugar sugar , that means we have 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 molecules of of sugar . This This number is known as Avogadro 's 's number , and it is the same for any substance substance . So , if we want to convert between between mass , mole , and and molecule , we can use use Avogadro Avogadro 's 's number to to help us us . For For example example , let 's say we have 10 grams grams of sugar sugar . We can use Avogadro 's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the the molecular molecular weight of the sugar sugar . The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 342.3 g / mol , so so 10 grams grams of sugar is equal equal to to 0.0292 moles of sugar . We We can also use Avogadro 's number to convert from moles to molecules .

{"text": "Many states states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents . If you have $ X income in in State State A where you claim nonresident status and $ Y income overall , then you you owe State A a fraction ( X / Y ) of of the the income tax that that would would have been due on $ Y income had you been a resident of of State A. In other other words , compute the state income tax on on $ Y as as per State A rules , and send send us us ( X / Y ) of that amount . If If you are are a resident of of State State B , then then State B will tax you you on $ Y but but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. A. Thus , you might might be required to file a State A income tax tax return regardless of how small $ X is . As a practical matter matter , many many commercial real - estate estate investments are set up as limited partnerships in in which most most of the annual taxable taxable income income is a small small amount of portfolio income ( usually interest income that that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040 1040 ) , and and the annual bottom line is is lots lots of passive losses which the limited partners report ( but do not get to to deduct ) on the Federal return return . As a result , State A is is unlikely to come after you for the tax tax on on , say , $ 100 of interest income income each each year because it will will cost them more to go after you than than they will recover from you . But But , when the real estate is sold , there will ( hopefully hopefully ) be be a big capital gain , most most of which will be sheltered from Federal tax since the the passive losses finally get to be deducted . At this point point , State State A is not only owed owed a lot of money ( it it knows nothing nothing of your passive losses etc ) but , after it processes the the income income tax return that that you filed for that year year , it will will likely likely demand that you file income tax returns returns for previous years as well .", "label": "hc3human"}

Most metals exist naturally as rock rock . The The metal atoms are connected to other other kinds of elements elements like like silicon and and they do n't n't look very interesting interesting ( to a non non - geologist ) . In the the world world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most most humans would recognize recognize were silver silver and and gold gold . Gold can be found found as as \" nuggets \" or \" dust dust \" . The processes processes that bring it to the the surface tends to to deposit deposit it it in veins so that if if you you find some , you you 're likely to find more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into into rivers , so finding finding gold means means finding a river with some gold gold or silver silver in it , and then then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold gold without without heat heat . It It is \" malleable \" at room temperature , which means you can can whack whack on on it with hammers to change the the shape shape of a lump lump of gold and and bend it with tongs - and even though it it is malleable it it wo n't lose its its new shape once you finish working it and that that means means you can can make useful things . Gold Gold will will not not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade blade . It is much much denser than most other other materials so it would make a good club , but but you do n't n't get much more more head head - bashing advantage with a gold cub cub than you would with stone or even wood wood . So So other than as as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical practical \" use \" to an an ancient human . But But it is is pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" next next to to human skin tones . Why Why this is so is is pretty much much a mystery . But it 's 's obvious that people found found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people . In the ancient ancient world \" rich \" was defined defined as \" do n't n't have have to farm farm \" . There were only three three kinds kinds of people like that that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals generals . Since Since gold was was in limited limited supply supply - but there there was enough enough of of it it that people would recognize recognize it and value value it , and it was was n't n't good good for for any any practical practical use , and as a metal it it would would \" stay all in in one place \" and did n't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained contained , it it became a way for rich people people to display their their wealth . Gold Gold is pretty easy to purify and and to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That That means that that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed fixed amount of gold gold , of of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some some number of sheep sheep or sheaves sheaves of of wheat , or or slaves , or or land , or whatever . It became became a unit of currency due to to intrinsic properties properties convenient for for anyone to access - all all I need is a scale , a cup cup , some water water , and a little math and and I can can figure out how much your gold is is worth to me me . 5,000 years years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it it with with a certain advantage vs. other other similar metals metals . Nobody wants to exchange exchange plutonium coins coins , even though plutonium plutonium is worth , ounce for ounce , vastly more than gold .

For example , imagine that you are are standing standing in a room with bright red walls . If I were to show you a picture of a tomato tomato and ask you to describe its its color , you you might say say \" red \" because because the tomato tomato 's color is similar to the color of of the the walls walls . However However , if I were standing in a room with white white walls and showed showed you you the same picture picture of a tomato , I might describe its color as \" orange \" because the tomato 's color would appear differently to to me me in the different different lighting lighting . So , while while we we may both use use the same word to describe a color , we we might be perceiving perceiving that color color differently based on on our our own individual individual experiences experiences and surroundings .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

( 1 ) Diamonds that that are sold for anything less less than , oh , let 's 's say $ 5000 at original retail - are indeed utterly , totally , completely worthless .

Literally - \" end end of of story story \" . If you buy a \" diamond \" lol lol for \" $ 2000 \" to impress your loved one , you can not then \" sell sell it \" for any amount of money . It It is : worthless . Once again : simple , undeniable undeniable fact . the diamond diamond you you bought for 2 grand grand can not be resold . Ir Ir 's worthless . ( OK , maybe you can get 100 bucks for it , something like that . Or , you can scam someone clueless , and get 200 bucks bucks . ) ( 2 ) However actual actual \" investment \" stones do in fact fact have a value - if somewhat fragile . Example , a few years ago I sold sold a stone for 30 30 thousand . That was a \" real \" price and and it was was quite liquid liquid - I was within days able to find find a buyer buyer . ( A dealer - he would would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever . ) I have have never dealt in in stones over six figures , but I 'm fairly certain certain those are \" real \" valuable objects : just just like paintings paintings by name artists . ( However : yes , the the line between \" laughable laughable diamonds \" and actual investment stones , is indeed moving moving ever upwards . ) ( Note - the the \" elephant in the room \" with diamonds is that that GE 's 's industrial process for simply making utterly flawless flawless diamonds , starting with with carbon carbon , is is getting better every decade decade . ) ( A second overwheleming point point that nobody nobody has mentioned mentioned : diamonds get get beat - up up . Regarding \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" , a used one one is exactly exactly as useless useless as a used car . It It 's crap . Just Just as with $ 200,000 picassos , this concept does does not apply to \" actual investment stones \" . ) Note that many many of the the comments / arguments on this page page are very very confused confused because : people are not not distinguishing between the ( ROFL ) \" engagement ring ring scam market \" and the the rarefied rarefied \" investment gem gem market \" . The two things are utterly different . Yes , \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" are an utter scam , and and are simply simply : \" worthless \" . The fundamental fundamental , basic , overwhelming scam in in today 's business / social universe is : \" engagement diamonds \" . Yes , the price is is only due to marketing / monopolies etc . Elephant Elephant in in the room A : GE GE 's technology can - end of story story - manufacture diamonds . ( Starting with \" pencil leads \" . ) End End of story . It It 's 's all over . Elephant Elephant in the room B : folks forget that diamonds get beat - up , they they are just like like used cars . Regarding Regarding \" engagement - ring ring diamonds \" , nobody nobody has ever , or or will ever , bought a used used one . Simple , utterly undeniable fact : regarding regarding \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" . they they have : zero value . You can not not resell them . End of story . If you buy buy a house house , you can can resell it it . If you buy a car , you can resell it ( at a spectacular spectacular loss ) . If you buy a picasso , you can resell it ( almost always making a huge profit ) . If you you buy an \" engagement ring ring diamond \" , it is is worth : nothing . Zero . Nada . strictly strictly regarding investment stones , which is a distinctly distinctly utterly different market . This market market has no connection , in any way , at all , even even vaguely , it is utterly unrelated , to \" engagement ring diamonds \" . You can in fact buy buy and sell sell these items items - very much like say say \" art \" or \" mid century century antiques \" , and make make money money . This market just has utterly no connection connection to the whole \" engagement ring ring diamonds \" scam system . Say you you buy wine at the the supermarket , for 5 to 100 100 bucks a bottle bottle . If you think that the the \" wine \" thus bought bought , has a secondary market market , or you can invest in it it or something : you have lost lost your your mind . In In total contrast : Yes , although totally totally flakey , there is is indeed an \" investment wine market market \" which is is real and reasonable . I for example have have made some money in that . ( I have a great anecdote anecdote even - I had one one cellar of wine in burgundy , which which could have been been sold for , say , 30 grand grand - but we drank drank it :) :) ) Again , the ( somewhat somewhat bizarre ) actual market in investment investment wine wine , just has to \" buying wine wine in the supermarket \" . To further the analogy : wine wine prices in the supermarket / your ( ROFL ) wine dealer , from 5 to 100 bucks , are just just : utterly utterly laughable . Utterly . Laughable . Much as folks sit sit around , and decide decide on \" label designs designs \" , they sit sit around , and and decide on \" price points \" . There is is , utterly utterly , no difference difference between between $ 5 and $ 100 grape grape juice juice rofl \" wine \" . The price difference is simply a marketing decision : at best best , you can think of it as as a Velbin Velbin good . ... exactly the the same applies applies to \" engagement ring diamonds diamonds \" .", "label": "hc3human"}

It states that that the more precisely we know the position of of a particle particle , the the less precisely precisely we can know its momentum momentum , and vice versa versa . This is because because the the act of measuring one of these quantities affects the the other other . Imagine that you are trying to to measure measure the position and momentum of a ball . You can can use a ruler ruler to measure the position of the ball by by seeing where where it it is on on the the ruler .

We have one view view that we pass this data to . But But how do do we get the data data ? The The model model , right ? Well Well , yes and and no no .

It It 's like putting putting everything everything into a blender for a beverage and then then not putting the lid on . When When it 's 's done done you then then swing swing it around to really get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles this this pairing .

Romeo does n't know that . ) This is typically used to to add to to the tension of a situation . Classical irony irony is the triumph of wit over hubris . We do n't typically associate associate this with irony irony anymore anymore , but any sort of parlor scene from from a detective story story is a good example . Verbal irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature . An intended meaning is is dramatically different different from from an expressed meaning meaning . This is is typically indicated by tone , gesture , and circumstance . Paralipsis Paralipsis ( talking about something by saying you 're not talking about about it ) is the easiest easiest method of verbal verbal irony irony to to translate from performance performance to written word word . Situational or cosmic cosmic irony irony is when the outcome of a series series of events events is is different from the the expected expected outcome outcome . For For instance instance , in in * The Wizard of Oz * all three of Dorothy 's companions companions are are questing for a character trait they felt felt they lacked lacked and hoped to to receive receive from the the allegedly god - like Oz , who in fact lacks the traits the companions sought and would be unable to to grant those traits even if if he had them them himself because is is revealed to to be a mere mortal . Had Had Oz been a god , he would still have have been been unable to to grant these these gifts gifts , but but the situational would have been elevated to the cosmic . Now satire uses these forms of irony , a context context of of entertainment and lightheartedness , and a tendency towards absurdity , to make the the serious ( Bill Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes of British British landlords to suffering during the Potato Potato Famine ) seem silly .

{"text": "Long short - term memory memory ( LSTM ) is is an artificial neural neural network network used in the fields of artificial artificial intelligence and deep learning . Unlike standard feedforward neural neural networks , LSTM LSTM has feedback connections . Such a recurrent neural neural network network ( RNN RNN ) can process not only single data points ( such such as images ) , but but also entire sequences of data ( such as speech or or video ) . For example , LSTM LSTM is is applicable to tasks tasks such such as as unsegmented , connected handwriting recognition , speech recognition recognition , machine translation , robot control control , video video games,[10 ] and healthcare.[11 ] The name of LSTM refers to the the analogy that a standard RNN has both \" long long - term memory \" and \" short - term term memory \" . The connection connection weights and biases biases in the network change once per per episode of training , analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic synaptic strengths store long - term memories memories ; the the activation patterns in the network change once per time - step , analogous analogous to how the moment - to to - moment change in electric firing patterns in the the brain store short short - term memories.[12 ] The LSTM architecture aims to to provide a short - term term memory for RNN that can last thousands thousands of timesteps , thus thus \" long short - term term memory memory \" . A common LSTM LSTM unit is composed composed of of a cell , an input input gate , an an output output gate[13 ] and a forget forget gate.[14 ] The cell remembers remembers values over arbitrary time time intervals and the the three gates gates regulate the flow flow of information information into and out of the cell . LSTM networks are well - suited to classifying , processing and making predictions based on time series data , since there can be lags of unknown duration between important important events in a time time series . LSTMs were developed to deal with the the vanishing gradient gradient problem[15 problem[15 ] that can can be encountered when training traditional RNNs RNNs . Relative Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage advantage of LSTM over over RNNs , hidden hidden Markov models and and other sequence sequence learning learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed needed ]", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating the intrinsic value value of a stock by by examining its financial financial statements statements and other other company - specific factors . One financial metric that is is often often used in fundamental analysis is the the price - to - earnings earnings - to - growth ( PEG ) ratio ratio . The PEG ratio ratio is calculated by dividing dividing the the price price - to - earnings ( P / E ) ratio by the the company company 's expected earnings growth rate . The P / E ratio ratio is is a measure of the price of of a stock stock relative to its its earnings per share . It is is calculated by by dividing the current current market price of the stock stock by the company 's earnings per share ( EPS EPS ) . The PEG ratio is used to evaluate whether a stock stock is is overvalued or undervalued based on on its price and earnings growth . For example , if a company has a P / E ratio of 20 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10 % , its PEG ratio ratio would be 2 . A PEG ratio of less than 1 is generally considered considered undervalued , while a PEG ratio greater than 1 is considered overvalued . There There are several limitations to using using the PEG ratio as a sole measure of a stock 's value value . It It is based based on future future earnings growth estimates , which which are are inherently uncertain and subject to to change change . Additionally , the PEG ratio does not take into into account other factors that can affect affect a company company 's 's value , such such as its debt levels , market conditions conditions , and competitive landscape .

Essentially , you you need to think of the the efficiency of of a solar cell as as its ability to to generate but but also also collect electrons as useful energy energy . Now in the the body of the solar cell cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things things that will steal that that electron electron and and stop it from from being collected . These include metallic metallic impurities ( Iron Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually usually anything that has a charge that that can can capture capture an electron or a hole hole ( which which we we call call charge carriers ) . The The more more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency efficiency . So what happens out in in the the field over time ? There are many things things that can happen happen that can can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from from corrosion corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread thread . We also have a few such as as PID ( potential induced induced degradation degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for for example example in monocrystalline solar solar cells is largely known to be due to to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 48 hours . Now this problem has largely largely been solved .

{"text": "* * WHY WHY THEY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect normal people , the SEC SEC has has created all sorts of rules rules and regulations for how companies that that invest money on behalf of of other people should operate operate . While this makes the the investments investments safer and less less volatile , it it prevents the firm making investments from from chasing riskier riskier but possibly possibly more profitable investments investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge Hedge funds funds are companies that make these investments investments . They are not allowed allowed to have more than 100 100 investors , and and they are not allowed to take on any investors with less less than than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either either very wealthy wealthy people or institutional investors investors , such as as pension pension funds , banks , insurance companies , college college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to to get into a good good hedge fund , as not not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take on on , but they are are also also rated on on the rate rate of return they they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the the more more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund fund , remember the Groucho Groucho Marx joke about about not wanting to to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , hedge hedge funds gather large piles of money from very very wealthy institutions institutions and and invest it on on their behalf . The goal goal is to do two things things . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you you look at all the the stocks on the the market market , odds odds are are almost all of of them them went went up . A rising rising tide lifts lifts all boats . This is referred referred to as beta . Most Most assets , or portfolios portfolios of of assets , will move move in the direction of general market . Alpha Alpha is finding assets that go up even more more than the the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned mentioned 10 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn earn an amount above and beyond beyond that 10 % . Alpha is supposed supposed to be be the ability ability to find assets that will do this this . The other other goal of hedge funds funds is to earn absolute returns returns . What this means is that that they they make money every year , regardless of of what the the stock market does . A few funds have done this this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing bluffing in saying saying they they were able able to to do that , and many many of of them went went out out of business . * * HOW DO DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on on the above , the hedge fund fund has a large pile pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of of dollars , invested with it by various various clients . A hedge fund fund is normally normally staffed by veterans of the financial services services industry , typically typically people who have worked for a long time time at investment banks and have contacts contacts within within the industry . After After accumulating their investment capital , their their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs Sachs , Merrill Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley Stanley , or commercial banks banks with investment banking arms arms , such as Citigroup or or Bank of America , to borrow large sums of of money money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and make make 10 10 % , you make $ 10 10 . But if you borrow borrow $ 900 900 , and invest invest the the full $ 1,000 and and make 10 % , you make make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , and and you made $ 100 ( less interest interest ) for for your investors off off the the $ 100 they invested with you you . ( The The downside of this this is that if if you lose lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and and your your investors are wiped wiped out . This is called blowing blowing up in in the the jargon jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so leverage leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds funds though though , because they like the the interest income , and they like to hear what what leads the the hedge funds are following following ( financial financial services services is very incestuous , and and rumors rumors drive trades trades ) . The The hedge hedge funds funds like to to borrow borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding notwithstanding the the need for leverage , the the investment banks have contacts within within the publicly traded companies . Say you you 're 're doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs Sachs . Maybe in the the process of that that , you meet their hedge fund fund clients , and and talk up your business to to them them to drive demand for for your stock , while while they hear from from the CFO and CEO personally , and make better better decisions decisions than the the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so so now we have a bunch of guys guys who used to work for investment investment banks banks , with investor money money , contacts at investment investment banks , and and large large piles of borrowed money money . What What do they invest in ? The The short short answer answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing investing styles styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are are the most most simple simple funds . They buy some stocks stocks , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average average and absolute returns . The The concept of going going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its name name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Global Macro Macro - These funds funds invest in in assets assets that will give them exposure exposure to to broad economic forces , which they they hope hope to predict predict . Do you you think the the euro euro is going to break up ? Short it it , and euro - denominated denominated assets . Do you you think think we we ' ve ve hit peak peak oil oil ? Buy Buy oil oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became famous famous for making billions billions for for predicting that that England would be forced to devalue devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be be referred to to as as \" black box funds \" , meaning that that no one knows what what their criteria are , as it is is a trade secret secret . Often they write write computer computer programs designed to go through millions of pages pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and and go long or short short on them . High High frequency traders do this with stocks by by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can can buy stocks stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about about a fund fund that that combs through through publicly available filings filings through through the the Food and and Drug Drug Administration Administration , looking looking for for any any changes regarding new drugs , to to use use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Event Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , the the buy or or sell short assets whose whose price will will be affected affected by future future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires another another , usually usually the buyer 's stock goes goes down down , as as they are probably probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock stock jumps , as someone is is about to overpay for it . Short Short the predator and buy the the prey prey . In the movie movie * Wall Street Street * , Charlie Sheen uses uses contacts contacts with a law firm to find clients of of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort sort of strategy , and and is is arrested arrested when the feds flip one of his his accomplices . The The most famous example of this strategy is is John Paulson , who made billions off off the housing bubble buying credit credit default swaps on on collateralized collateralized debt obligations obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took took this approach . ( I believe believe Paulson Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and and has been buying up gold mines , evidence evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge hedge funds funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope hope is that that returns returns will will be less volatile volatile and and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that that might be 5 % of your your investment investment rather than than 100 % . There is a pretty pretty long list of of other recognized recognized strategies , many too complicated to worry worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge hedge fund , which was was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain obtain and and trade on inside inside information . The The founder is now now facing 15 15 to 19 19 years in in prison . It It was was an effective strategy , but but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point point of of this is is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they they want , and will be be judged solely solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO DO THEY THEY GET PAID * * You ' ve probably probably already heard about how many many hedge hedge funds funds make make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two two ways . The first is the the management management fee fee . If If you you invest money with with a hedge fund ( or or anyone for that that matter ) , the the first thing they do do is is take a percentage of your money money from you you and keep keep it for for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees employees , rent rent office space , and cover overhead overhead until their real real payday arrives arrives at the end of the year . The other means means of payment is the performance fee fee . At the end of of the year , the fund fund tallies how much money it made for investors , and and takes takes a chunk chunk of of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion billion payday for the people who who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

On On Earth Earth , it takes about 24 hours for the Earth Earth to spin spin all the the way around once on its axis , and it it takes about 365 days days for for the Earth Earth to orbit the the Sun once once .

{"text": "This wo n't n't actually be for for a 5 year old old , but a 5 year old should be nowhere nowhere near near this book nor nor the the movie . The author author that wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Ellis Ellis , is known for a common theme in all all of his books . Simply put put , they are about the detachment prevalent in modern society . Specifically the effect that that wealth and and privilege can have on people people . No No one has friends only only acquaintances . People are only only as important as as what what they can can do for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity simplicity I 'll 'll only deal with with what 's in the movie movie . In American Psycho the main character character is is pretending to be be a human . He takes everything everything way too far because because he is is over over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he he is with with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his his whole whole shower procedure procedure . He is is pretending pretending to work . His father owns owns a competing firm firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick Patrick as an employee simply because because of his fathers name . He pretends pretends to have a fiance , who who of course is is completely fake fake too , otherwise otherwise she would would n't survive long long around him . He pretends to have sexuality sexuality . He has no clue what it it is to love someone let let alone alone to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he he feels feels cheated . He can see all around him what what humanity is supposed to be and and he just is n't \" that \" . He knows knows that that it 's getting worse and worse , and is afraid afraid that he will be be caught . He is n't afraid of of going to jail jail or dying , but but rather he is afraid of being being exposed as a fake person person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your your specific question regarding the scene scene where he calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so so he calls his lawyer and admits admits everything everything he can think think of . The lawyer thinks the the caller is is someone other other than Patrick Patrick playing a joke . He He never takes it it seriously seriously because to to him him Patrick is is just some bland rich guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other bland bland rich guys . Later Later when Patrick sees the the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about about it the lawyer lawyer , not realizing he is is talking TO Patrick Patrick , laughs about about the ridiculousness of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are common themes in the movie movie and book . People constantly remark how how normal normal Patrick is , people constantly constantly mistake mistake him and others for someone else . They They all look and act act alike . In In my my opinion the movie is about how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer killer to blend into society because of how how uncaring uncaring and superficial we we all are . If you you likes the movie of course read read the book book . If books are n't your thing then at at least watch Less Than Zero and maybe The Rules Of Attraction Attraction .", "label": "hc3human"}

It might be be helpful to think of dialectics as a kind of \" back and forth forth \" between between different ideas ideas or forces , with the ultimate goal goal of of finding finding a solution or resolution .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "In order of complexity : A hub connects connects several several devices in a network network . When it receives receives data on on a port , it repeats that data out out on every other other port . These are are pretty rare now now that switches switches have have become so affordable . A switch switch is a smarter hub . As it receives data data , it learns which device device is connected to each port . When it receives data destined for for a particular particular device , it it only sends the data to the device device 's port . If it does n't know know which port to send the data to ( e.g. it it has n't seen seen that host yet ) , it acts acts as a hub and sends the data to all ports -- except the one it was received on . Once the host replies , the the switch switch learns which port port is connected to , so so it goes back to acting like a switch . A bridge is used to to connect connect two physically different networks so so that they they are are the same same logical network ; e.g. connecting a Token Token Ring network to an Ethernet network . ( it does n't n't matter if you you do n't n't know what those are , it 's just important that they are physcially physcially different . ) A router is used to connect two logically different networks networks together . It routes traffic between the two networks . A Wireless Access Point ( WAP WAP or AP AP ) is is a type of bridge because it connects two two different different types of networks -- wireless ( IEEE IEEE 802.11 b / g / n ) and wired ( usually usually IEEE 802.3 ) , Most of the devices that you will see are are actually combinations of of the device type listed above . For instance , a gateway gateway that a person would get from from their cable company that that has has wireless wireless does all of these things : * If it has multiple Ethernet LAN ports , it is a switch . * it it connects the the coax cable network , the Ethernet in in the house and the home wireless network , so it 's 's a bridge . * It It connects between the cable company 's 's network network and and a home network ( wired and and wireless ) , so so it it is a router router .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The balance balance sheet is a deceptively easy item in in accounting accounting . What it tells tells you is three things : 1 ) How big of a pile of stuff do I own ? 2 ) How much money did I borrow to buy my big pile of of stuff that that I still still have to to pay back ? 3 ) If If I removed removed everything from my pile of stuff stuff that I still owe owe money on , how much is left ? This smaller pile of stuff that that you have have paid in full full for and that that you do do n't n't owe another cent on is is your \" equity \" . It can be be broken down down to the classic accounting equation equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities Liabilities ( Stuff Stuff in your your pile that the bank can take back because because you you have n't paid for it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff Stuff in the pile pile that is paid for and and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out a mortgage and and buy buy a $ 200,000 house house , and promptly promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I own own half half of a house . That That is my equity . The bank owns the the other $ 100,000 of the the house , and that is my my liability . Again , the equation tells us : Total Assets Assets ( The The Whole House , 200k 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank Bank 's half of the the house house 100k ) + Equity ( my half of the the house that that I plunked down 100k for for ) . To answer answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is is how how is is it important : Let Let us say that I owned an an entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of rat rat control . I take take the the cat to the bank bank , and the bank lends lends the cat cat $ 995,000 as a business business loan loan under the agreement that the bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't paid paid back with with interest interest . The cat takes the bank bank 's 995k and I throw throw in 5k of my own money that the cat never has to pay me back for , and and he he buys buys 1 million dollars worth of rat control control equipment equipment . Now Now if I went went on Craigslist and and offered to sell the the cat and his 1 million dollars worth of rat control supplies to to the the highest bidder , my my cat might might sell for close to 1 million million dollars . However However , once once the potential buyer found found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to to the bank bank still , the the potential buyer would would realize realize the the EQUITY EQUITY in in the cat is is only $ 5,000 , and would n't pay much more than than that . Now Now that begs begs the question question , why would I give give the feline $ 5,000 that he did n't have to pay pay me back for ? This relates relates to the second use of the the phrase phrase equity in finance , which is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 to to become become a partner in his business . Think Think of of this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on on things that will make his his business business better , and that that he does n't n't have to to worry about about paying me interest interest on on or ever ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives gives me 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock Stock of of a total total 200 shares outstanding . He owns owns the the other other 100 100 , which he assigned to himself when incorporating his his business . What 's in it for for me ? As owner of of 50 % of the EQUITY in the company ( I own 100 100 of 200 total shares shares ) , I am entitled to half of the profits profits ! Now Now if the cat is is very successful and makes $ 200,000 200,000 in profits each each year after paying paying interest on his his loan to the bank , that is great for me me ! Going back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Million Million Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Million Principle Principle Still Owed to the Bank Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs belongs outright outright to to me and and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed from from the the bank does n't change change . We still still have 1 million dollars dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so that that 200k is pure profit for us ( me and my my cat ) as as business owners owners . Now Now this this $ 200,000 200,000 can either be be paid paid to to use in in the the form form of of dividends , or or reinvested in new equipment and and services that that can help help the business grow grow .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Sure ! The The circle constant constant is a number that that helps helps us understand and measure measure circles . The most common circle constant constant is pi , which is represented by the the Greek Greek letter letter \u03c0 . Pi is a number that that is a little bit more more than 3 , and it is important because it it helps us us understand the relationship relationship between between the circumference ( the the distance around around the circle circle ) and the diameter ( the distance distance across the circle through the the center ) . The Tau Manifesto is a document document that suggests that we should use a different circle constant called tau , which is represented by the Greek letter letter \u03c4 . Tau is equal to 2\u03c0 , or about about 6.28 6.28 . The idea behind the Tau Manifesto is that tau tau is is a more natural and intuitive circle constant constant to use , especially when it comes to understanding radians . Radians Radians are a way of of measuring angles . If you think of a circle as a clock , with the 12 o'clock o'clock position at the the top , then one one radian radian is equal to 1/6 of of the way around the circle . Using Using tau as the circle constant constant makes it it easier easier to understand radians , because one radian is is equal to 1/3 1/3 of of tau , rather than 1/2 1/2 of pi . This makes makes it easier easier to see that that radians radians are a measure of how far around around the circle an angle is , rather than how wide the angle is . So So , in summary , both pi pi and and tau tau are are important numbers numbers that help us understand and measure measure circles , but some people believe that that tau tau is is a better circle circle constant to to use because it makes it it easier to understand radians .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "But what what if I am getting getting paid salary from a source in India ? In other words , it may be that in India India a research assistant at a college college on average earns a third of what what a research assistant like me earns here in US US . In that case , even if if my cost cost of of living there is much less less , so so is is my salary salary . There are sites sites that provide provide a good guidance guidance for for what the the average salary for an an profession with with x years of of experience would be . Of Of course some some would would get paid more than average . So you can try and and make a logic , if in US say say you you are being paid more than than average , you would would be paid more more than than average average elsewhere elsewhere . Plus Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country , one has the Advantage of of positive pedigree pedigree bias . There There are also websites that would would give the Purchasing Power Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs . The The Real Real difficulty to find is whether whether the the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in in other country . If you you compare like for like it it becomes slightly skewed . If If you compare equivalence equivalence , then can you adjust . A relevant example my friend friend in in US had had a Independent Independent Bungalow Bungalow in in US . It was with Basement and attic , 2 levels of living space with with 4 bedroom bedroom . He shifted to to India and got a great salary compared compared to normal normal Indian salary salary . However this this kind of house house in in India India in Bangalore would would be affordable only to CEO 's 's of top companies . So So is living in a 3 room room apartment fine ? There are multiple such aspects . Drinking Drinking a Starbucks coffee coffee couple couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US . In India India this would would be be considered considered luxury luxury . A like for for equivalent comparison is is \" One drinks 3 - 4 mugs of Coffee \" in in US , and average average Indian drinks drinks \" Tea / Coffee 3 - 4 mugs \" . In India the local Tea / Coffee would be be Rs 10 10 - Rs 20 . A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150 . The same same applies to food . A McBurger in India would be be around around Rs Rs 100 . The Indian Indian equivalent Wada Wada Pav is for Rs 10 . A Sub Way Way would would be Rs 150 . A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around around Rs Rs 25 25 . I personally am picky picky about food , so it does n't n't matter where I go , I can only eat specific things , which means I spend a huge huge amount amount of money if I am outside of India . When I was in US , I could n't n't afford a maid , driver driver or any help help . In India India I have 2 maids , a cooking maid maid and and a driver . Plus I get get plumber , electrician , window cleaner , and and all the the help help without costing me much . Things that I absolutely ca n't n't dream in US . My colleague colleague in in UK preferred to to stay in a specific locality as it has has a very good Church . So So if if its important important , one may find few good ones in India if if one is Roman Roman Catholic , if if one follows follows Lutheran Lutheran , Greek Greek Orthodox , tough luck . Citizenship : Does Does it matter ... A foreign foreign national may never get an Indian Indian citizenship . Children Children do do n't qualify either unless both both parents parents are Indian . Health Care : Again is is quite different . One may feel Health Health care care in in US US is not good or very expensive ... but there are multiple aspects of this this . So in in essence its very broad there there is traffic , cleanliness , climate climate , culture , etc ... PS PS : A research assistant assistant in India is is poorly paid paid , because colleges colleges do n't have funds . Research Research in fundamental science is is quite low .

{"text": "Have skimmed it , these these are the most most important important parts as I can can tell tell : The new temperature goal is is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For anybody uninformed on on what what that means means , 1.5 us us the limit limit the average global temperature temperature will have risen since since pre - industrial industrial times . This This is friggin huge and I ' m super excited because the the previous goal goal of 2 was was n't all that great . So basically there 's 's limits on the the global global temperature rise ( which I 'll call call GTR from now cause cause I ' m lazy ) . The The GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before the the industrial revolution . The last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C rise rise in in temperature temperature , which before was considered okay at at best ( this goal goal was reached reached in the 90 's I believe ) . Since then new science science and research has come come out that that tells us that that 2 \u00b0 C could be bad . There There 's also another thing you should know which is feedback loops loops : Under the arctic lies lies huge amounts of trapped methane . If If the the temperature becomes too high the ice that traps the the methane gas melts and the methane enters the atmosphere . Methane is a greenhouse greenhouse gas and is one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the atmosphere atmosphere it reinforces global warming and the the greenhouse greenhouse effect further further melting ice ice and further further releasing releasing methane until it it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and in particular particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and and absorbes heat . Ice is white and reflects it it . As As long long as ice , particularly particularly sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter goes goes away away the the things things beneath the the ice tend to absorbes that heat heat and and sun sun and make everything hotter hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is melted melted and the more more Ocean there is to absorb heat which further melts ice ice ad ad infinitum until we all die . Now back back to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered considered seriously seriously pushing pushing it for for these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse of of civilization . At the the current rate rate we 're doing doing things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is is pretty much much death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't n't in in the clear clear but but we have a very good chance of living life life comfortably on earth earth , with nearly all of of the the same luxuries we we have today albeit operated operated differently . Before Before this this agreement agreement the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is is a huge and and a really big difference difference . Aside from that one of the big big concerns is that developed countries have created climate change and and gotten gotten rich off off it and now now poor nations such as Pacific Pacific island nations nations and and countries like Bangladesh now have to suffer because because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says says basically basically that developed nations have to help out out financially to to developing developing nations with with protection against rising sea sea levels levels and and other things and to help them them convert convert their infrastructures to green energy while also also helping helping them develop their economies and humanitarian humanitarian situations situations . It also sets a goal for developed nations to try and cut all all greenhouse greenhouse emissions emissions they emit . Lastly they will take take stock stock of emissions emissions and temperature rises and environmental environmental impacts impacts of of climate change in 2023 2023 and every five five years after that that . Also nations have have to set set goals for themselves every 5 years years based on on what what they can accomplish and what they have accomplished accomplished . One worrying part part is the fact that that nations nations can back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without without repercussions . I ' m also not sure sure how how legally binding any of of this is or if if it it even is is . It It would would be be awesome awesome if it was was but I ' m not sure sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the 90 's , the generation that grew up up on these ideals had kids kids and wanted them all all to go to to college college . All of them them . So suddenly suddenly massive amounts amounts of kids were being pushed into college . The colleges colleges reacted by raising their prices prices . Sometimes Sometimes this this was justified : they had many more students so they needed needed more dorms dorms , more food food , more more teachers . But ultimately ultimately , college prices prices went out of control . The The parents still wanted to send their kids to college ( thinking it was was how they 'd 'd get get a good job job still ) and decided decided to take out loans to pay for their school . BUT these these loans were were taken out on on behalf behalf of the kids so the loans were were in their their kid 's names ( in in most cases cases anyway anyway ) . All at at once , a lot of of kids kids with college college degrees flooded the job job market market . Employers Employers now had millions of applicants with with college degrees . In the past , they they 'd have many applicants but but one one or two would be college college educated . Now ... everyone everyone had one . This meant meant that the college degrees lost a lot of value . Since everyone had one , it stopped being special special . There * are * plenty of degrees that are are still useful and that you needed in your your field ( medical , legal , financial , computer computer science ) , but a lot of kids ( myself myself included ) were told told that they 'd 'd be fine no matter what degree degree they they got .

And of course course , it 's super easy to to argue that a teenager teenager , with with no real world experience , should n't be making a decision decision that will cost cost them them tens tens of thousands of dollars , that will also greatly impact impact the the course course their career . So So now now ... we we 've 've got a lot of kids with degrees that that may or may may not not be useful . They ca ca n't get a job job in the field they they studied for .

Better coordination of care : EHRs can help help healthcare providers coordinate care by allowing them to easily share information with other members of the healthcare team , such as specialists specialists or or primary primary care care doctors . Increased efficiency : EHRs EHRs can save time by eliminating eliminating the need for for manual charting and reducing the the need for paper paper records . Enhanced Enhanced patient engagement : Some EHRs allow allow patients to to access their own own health health records records and communicate with their healthcare providers through secure portals . This can help patients take a more more active role in in their own own healthcare .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle principle states states that you can never know the exact exact position position and momentum momentum of any particle ; no no , that that 's not not because because we we just do do n't know how to to do it . Position Position and and momentum literally are not defined defined precisely in in the universe . Next Next consider that that certain quantum principles are inherently random . Before you you measure the the state of of a particle , it it 's impossible to predict whether whether it it will be spin up up or or spin down . The The presence of of such randomness also also messes with the idea of of a mechanical universe . Even if if the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and randomness were eliminated , you would never never be able to make perfect predictions predictions within our universe . That 's because predictions predictions require require information , and information must must be be stored ; in the act of of gaining gaining information information , you increase the entropy of the universe and therefore interfere with it it . In other words , your own information would would screw up up your your predictions predictions . Free will is very philosophical , and it it largely largely depends on how you you define define free will . I believe the universe is deterministic , in in that one event event causes the the next . I also believe the universe is is NOT predetermined predetermined ; 13 billion years ago , it it would would have have been been impossible to to predict predict what happens today . And I believe free will exists for for all all practical purposes . Honestly Honestly , what what does does it matter if your atoms and and genes genes dictate your actions ?

However However , within the ' i ' series , there are are now 4 ' generations ' of processors processors .. .. each year , Intel Intel refreshes their processor processor lineup with new versions of of the the processors , so so a 4th 4th - generation i5 will will be faster than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and usually newer processors processors are more efficient , using less electricity and running running cooler , as well well ) . You can tell which generation a Core - i processor is from by the number after it it - 4xxx is 4th - gen , 3xxx is 3rd - gen , etc . ( so i5 i5 - 4670 is a 4th 4th - gen , for example ) . Pretty much much any Core - i processor processor will be faster than a Core2Duo and probably probably any Core2Quad as as well . The best way to compare how fast processors are in in relation to each other is to look at benchmarks benchmarks for specific specific applications though ( a benchmark benchmark is is just just a measure of how well a specific piece of of hardware performs ) . As for how many many cores cores each one has , it depends on which specific processor you 're talking about about .. you can can easily easily Google a specific processor processor to find out how many many cores it has . One other thing to note note is that that a quad - core processor is is not necessarily twice as fast as a dual - core processor processor .

Data Data compression is a technique technique used to reduce the size of a file or a piece piece of of data , making it easier easier and more efficient efficient to store store , transmit , and and process . The \" middle - out \" part of of Lepton refers to the the way the the algorithm works : it first first identifies and removes redundancies from the middle of the data , and then then works works its its way outwards to compress the the rest of the data data . This This approach is is different from from other other data compression algorithms , which often start at the beginning beginning or or the end end of of the data and and work work their way way towards the the middle . To understand how Lepton works , let 's use a simple example . Imagine you have a list of words that that you you want want to compress . Lepton would first look look for repeating words words or or patterns in the the middle of the list list , and then represent represent those repetitions with a shorter code code . For For example , if the word \" the \" appears 10 10 times times in the middle of the list , Lepton might replace all all of of those those instances with a code like \" t10 \" . This This would save some space , because because the code \" t10 \" is shorter than than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times . Once Lepton Lepton has compressed the middle of the list , it it would then work its way outwards outwards , looking for for more opportunities to compress the data data . For example , it might look for repeating words words or or patterns at the beginning beginning and end of of the list , and and replace them with shorter shorter codes as well . I hope this helps !

ISRO is is a government government agency agency responsible for conducting space research and development in in India . ISRO was able able to keep the the cost of the MOM mission mission low for several several reasons : 1 . ISRO made use of of existing technology and and hardware whenever whenever possible , rather than developing everything from scratch . 2 . ISRO worked closely with industry partners and suppliers suppliers to to negotiate negotiate lower lower prices for materials and services . 3 . ISRO used a smaller and simpler simpler spacecraft design , which reduced the overall overall cost of of the mission . 4 . ISRO employed a lean and efficient efficient project management approach , which minimized minimized waste waste and kept the project on schedule . 5 . ISRO ISRO leveraged the expertise of its its engineers and and scientists , who who were able able to develop the MOM mission with with a smaller budget and shorter timeline than other space agencies agencies .

Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece piece of jargon in the the financial financial world and is a common topic taught in in finance finance classes in the US . On average , verified by many studies studies , individuals will generate generate better investment returns when they they proactively avoid timing the the market or attempting to pick specific winners . Say you you decide decide to invest in a mutual fund fund , dollar cost averaging averaging means you invest the the same same dollar dollar amount in consistent consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when when you feel the the market market is is low . As As an an example I 'll 'll compare investing $ 50 50 per week on Wednesdays , versus versus 1 share per week week on Wednesdays , or the the full $ 850 850 on the first Wednesday . I 'll use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example ( VLCAX ) . I realize this is not really an an apples apples to to apples comparison as the invested invested amounts are different , I just wanted wanted to show show how your rate of return return can change depending depending on how your money goes in to to the the market even if the difference difference is subtle . By investing a common common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately ultimately maintain maintain a lower average share price while the share share price price climbs . It also also keeps your your investment investment easy to budget . Vanguard published an an excellent paper discussing dollar dollar cost averaging versus lump lump sum investing which concluded that you you should invest as soon as you you have have funds , rather rather than parsing parsing out a lump sum in in to smaller periodic periodic investments , which is illustrated in the third column above ; and obviously worked out out well as the the market has been increasing . Ultimately Ultimately , all of of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing marketing teams trying trying to figure out out how to make make their services sound interesting and unique .

Instead of of just choosing one one candidate , voters can can indicate their their top choice , second choice , third choice , and so on . In In a ranked voting voting system system , if if a candidate wins a majority of first - choice choice votes , they are declared declared the winner winner just like in in a normal normal election . If no candidate wins a majority majority of first - choice votes , then then the candidate with with the fewest votes votes is eliminated and their votes are are redistributed to the voters ' next choice . This process process is repeated until until one candidate has has a majority majority of votes votes and is is declared the the winner . One advantage of of ranked voting voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of of voters voters , rather than than just a plurality of of voters . In In a normal election election , it it is possible for a candidate to win with less than than 50 50 % of the vote if there there are more than two candidates candidates running running . In a ranked voting system , this is less likely to to happen because the votes votes of the least popular candidate can be be redistributed to the voters ' next next choice choice . As As for how a ranked ranked voting system could help eliminate the the two - party system , it 's important to note that ranked voting is just one of of many potential potential reforms that could help help encourage more political diversity . However , ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third - party candidates or or independent candidates to win win elections . Since Since voters voters are able able to rank rank multiple candidates candidates in order of preference preference , they can choose to support a third - party candidate as their their first first choice while still expressing expressing a preference for one of the major major party candidates as their second choice .

I wo n't n't go into into the the math behind this , but but statisticians sometimes do what 's 's called a runs test to figure figure out if a set of data data is random or not . Take for example a situation where someone claims to have flipped a coin coin 100 times times , and wrote down the results results . If he did n't flip the the same side twice in a row anywhere anywhere in in those 100 times , it 's likely he 's lying lying and just just wrote wrote down the numbers numbers systematically , without flipping any coin . It It 's 's just as as likely as if he had had written written down 50 50 heads heads in a row , then 50 50 tails . The same same holds true for the shuffle feature feature on on an an iPod .

ELI5 ELI5 version - So So given certain certain gene , if male male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby baby making * * * The The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis Hypothesis * * Argues Argues that genes that express feminine feminine physical characteristics and personality personality traits increase increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version version - being a little bit feminine can increase increase your chances chances of getting lucky with the the opposite opposite gender , but too too much feminine feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in in the past , males used used sexual contact with other males as as a way way to form / strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient ancient Greece , it was was not not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual homosexual behaviour with younger younger males while being being married married to to a woman .

This is because because the ISS is being being pulled towards the Earth Earth by the Earth 's gravity , but it is also also moving very fast fast . When an object moves very fast , it it is is harder for for gravity to pull it it down , so it follows a curved path path instead of falling straight down down . To stay in orbit , the ISS ISS has to keep moving at a specific speed and altitude altitude . If it slows down or drops too low , it will fall back to to Earth Earth . If If it speeds up or climbs climbs too high , it will fly off off into space . To To maintain its orbit , the ISS uses thrusters , which which are small small engines that produce produce a jet of gas to to push against against . By By firing the thrusters , the the ISS ISS can adjust its speed speed and direction to stay in in its desired orbit orbit .

However , as we learned learned more about Pluto Pluto and discovered more objects in the the outer reaches of our solar system system , scientists realized realized that that Pluto is actually quite quite different different from the other other planets . One of the main main reasons reasons Pluto was reclassified reclassified as a dwarf planet is because it it is is much smaller than than the other planets in our our solar system . While planets like Earth Earth and Mars are are thousands of kilometers in diameter , Pluto is only about 2,377 kilometers kilometers ( 1,475 miles ) across across . In addition addition to its small size size , Pluto also also has has a very different orbit around around the the Sun Sun compared to the other planets . While the other planets have relatively circular orbits , Pluto Pluto 's orbit is much more more elongated and tilted . This means means that Pluto is often much farther farther from from the the Sun than the the other planets , and and it takes a much longer time time to orbit orbit the Sun than the other other planets planets do . Because of its its small size and unique orbit , scientists decided to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf planet in in 2006 .

The The MIRR function calculates the internal rate of of return return on an investment with multiple cash flows , taking into account account the fact that that the investment investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at at a different different rate rate than the original original cost cost of the investment . It does this this by using the following following formula : MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range of of cells that contain the series of payments and investments associated with the investment investment . \"finance_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate calculate the present value of the the cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is the the interest rate used used to calculate the the future value of of the cash flows flows . The MIRR function function is useful for comparing the returns on different investments , as it takes into into account the the fact that that the the reinvestment rate may may be different from from the financing rate rate . It is is also useful useful for evaluating the profitability profitability of of investments with irregular cash flows , such as as those that involve the sale sale of assets or the repayment of loans . Example : Suppose you are considering considering investing investing $ 100,000 in in a project project that is is expected to generate generate the the following cash flows over the next next 5 years : Year 1 : $ 20,000Year 20,000Year 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 50,000Year 50,000Year 5 : $ 60,000The financing financing rate on the investment is is 10 10 % , and the reinvestment rate is 8 % .

{"text": "The The important thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't n't breathe breathe through their mouths mouths like us ; they do n't even even have lungs . They They have tiny holes in in their exoskeleton which which allows allows oxygen into system system of tubes tubes , which carry oxygen to their their organs . With that in in mind , let let 's think about about what happens when something increases in size size . Two Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In In other words words , volume and surface area increase increase by by different rates rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area area of of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It It has a volume of of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides sides , 4 sq ft ft per per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times * , but the surface area only increased by by * four * . 3x3x3 3x3x3 ? Volume of of 27 27 , surface area of 54 54 . The volume more more than than tripled tripled , whereas the surface area roughly doubled . Now Now , the point here is that * volume volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That That means means that there there 's 's more organs and and whatnot , all all of of which which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen oxygen available , though , depends on on * surface area * . Insects get get oxygen oxygen from their skin , so to to increase their oxygen intake intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You ca n't add more holes in in the the exoskeleton exoskeleton to increase increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because because that that makes the exoskeleton exoskeleton weaker . The The exoskeleton is * already * under extra extra strain strain trying to support the increased increased weight weight , so so that wo wo n't work . This means means that there there 's essentially a point where an insect ca n't n't grow any bigger , because because it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) to to make up for for the increased increased volume / weight ( need need for oxygen oxygen ) . For more more evidence evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be be much much bigger millions millions and and millions of of years ago during dinosaur times . The The atmosphere was richer richer in in oxygen back then , so it makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What What honey badger badger something something said : \" It 's 's when electoral districts are redrawn in in order to favor favor a specific party or candidate candidate based based on demographics . \" And check out [ the the wikipedia article ] ( URL_2 URL_2 ) . ------------------ Imagine a pretend pretend 51st state in the US . We 'll 'll call it the the State of Calville . Calville Calville gets gets 10 10 Representatives to send to the US US House of Representatives . If you you 're a Democrat you you would like as many Democrats Democrats as possible possible ; if if you you 're 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville Calville gets 10 Representatives Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you you draw draw the the borders to make these districts districts ? One way is to draw the the borders to make make sure sure that your your party party gets gets as as many of of those those 10 Representative Representative spots as possible . There There are 2 basic ways to to do do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend pretend a group group of people people always always vote for Republicans : people people over 6 feet tall . And you you 're a Democrat and and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can can draw it so so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and and only one one , district . It could look look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically basically giving up that one one district . You know that Democrats will will never be able to to win win it . But you also know that Democrats will have have a * * much better better * * chance in the other 9 because all the the Republican voters are in in 1 district . So you you 're 're drawing the the borders so you you get 9 districts districts / Representatives and and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get get the electoral electoral outcome you you want and not the electoral outcome the the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep keep going with our hypothetical . You 're 're a Democrat Democrat writing the rules and you you only care about getting as many Democrats elected elected as possible . Let 's also also say 20 % of of people in in Calville are over over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % of of the population wants wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But But you , you do do n't care about about fair fair or what what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you you take that 20 20 % and you you spread them them around . You You make sure sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of of people people over 6 feet tall . That That way you you might might be able able to to win all all 10 districts / Representatives Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve ve abused your power to make make sure sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from from a district district which which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really really have to to worry about being re - elected . If If a Democrat Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of of people are over over 6 feet feet tall then then they they may not have to to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- -------------------------- It 's a real real problem and it ( basically basically ) disenfranchises real real people .", "label": "hc3human"}

While While in other countries they are supported by banks directly ( right ? ) , in in US you may find this option only in some big stores like like home improvement improvement stores , car dealerships , cell cell phone operators ( so so that you can buy a new new phone ) etc . Some stores stores allow 0 % financing for , say say , 12 months which is not exactly the the same same as installments but close , if if you have have discipline to pay $ 250 each month month and not wait for for 12 months to to end . Splitting Splitting the big payment in parts means that that the seller gets money in parts as as well well , and and it adds risks of of customer customer default , introduces debt collection possibility etc . That 's why it 's usually usually up to the the merchants to support support it it - bank does not care care in this case , from the the bank point point of view the store just just charges the the same card another another $ 250 every every month . In other countries banks support support this option option directly , I think , taking taking over over or dividing the risk risk with with the merchants . This has has not happened in US .

After After that you you should should be able to get your money money back and convert convert your secured card into a regular credit credit card card .

The short version is that a highway was a road road elevated above the surrounding terrain terrain ( literally , the the high way way ) , and and a freeway freeway was the opposite of a toll road road ( literally , the free free way way ) . Back in , say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most people walked from their hut to the fields fields and back , and perhaps perhaps once a season the duke 's 's tax collector collector came came in a wagon or or cart . This This meant that most traffic was along footpaths footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations populations increased , and the cart paths began began seeing more traffic , 2 big problems problems arose . First , the ruts got deeper deeper , much deeper . This is a major problem in places places with a high water table ( say , coastal coastal areas or swamps ) , or during rainy rainy seasons . Second , these low paths made it it hard to see see around , facilitating ambushes by bandits . By building up the the path , these two two problems were alleviated . The path was was above the the waterline , during rains the water would naturally run off the path , and someone on the the path path could more easily see see bandits lying in wait . A high high way was much safer . The downsides of of the the high way is that that you you could n't just get on it anywhere anywhere with your your cart - the sides were too steep . You You had to get on on or off off in specific locations locations that had lower grade ramps leading to the high way . This is still still reflected in how our modern highways work . They They have limited access , usually by on on / off ramps . Modern Modern highways are are ( often ) elevated , limited access roads roads that can safely safely handle handle high volumes of traffic . However However , the the cost of building building this this highway has to be borne borne by someone . Hence Hence , initially initially , most highways were toll roads ( aka turnpikes , because they had walls of pikes setup on the road , which which was turned aside aside when the toll was was paid . Again , literally , turn pike pike to pass pass ) . When bright bright , insightful people in government realized that safer safer traffic along those highways boosted the economy , and and allowed allowed them to to collect more more taxes taxes , they decided to make the highways highways they build free , so that that they they could make more money money off the increased traffic .

Bayes ' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes how how to compute the probability of an an event based based on prior prior knowledge knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event . In Bayesian inference , the the probability of of a hypothesis hypothesis is is updated as new evidence evidence becomes becomes available . This is in contrast to classical ( frequentist ) statistical inference , in which the probability of a hypothesis is not updated based on on the data , but but rather is fixed and and the data are used to test test the hypothesis . The The key idea behind Bayesian inference is that the data and and the hypothesis hypothesis can can be treated as random random variables variables and and that the relationship between between them can be described using probability theory . This allows us to make probabilistic probabilistic predictions about the hypothesis based based on the the data data , and to update those predictions as new new data becomes available . Bayesian Bayesian inference is often used used in machine learning and data data analysis , where it it can be used to make predictions about complex complex systems based based on limited data . It is also used in many many other other fields , including economics , psychology , and biology biology , to make inferences about about uncertain events events based on observed data .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Yes , it is is true that twins can can run in in families . This is because the trait of having twins is partly partly determined by by genetics . There are certain genetic factors that can increase a person person 's chances of having twins , such as as having a family history of twins twins or or certain racial or ethnic backgrounds backgrounds . Here 's a simple explanation of how this works : when a woman becomes pregnant pregnant , her body produces produces a hormone called called human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . This This hormone helps the the body maintain the pregnancy by preventing preventing the woman 's body from ovulating ( releasing eggs ) again . Some Some women produce more hCG than others others , and this this can lead to the release of more than than one egg during ovulation ovulation . When two eggs eggs are fertilized at at the same same time , it can can result in the birth of of twins twins . So , if a woman has has a family history history of twins , it it could be because someone someone in her family ( like her mother or grandmother grandmother ) produced more hCG , which led to to the birth of twins . This This genetic genetic trait can be passed down down from one generation to the next , which which is why twins can run in families . I hope that helps to answer answer your question question ! Do you have any any other other questions about about twins or or genetics ?", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

The other other thing they they could mean is is that the dollar could decrease in value relative relative to other other currencies currencies .

An American Dollar might might get you $ 1.10 1.10 Canadian today and and in in a year , it might get get you $ 1.20 or or only only 90 cents cents .

Resource exhaustion : As an an application or or operating system runs , it uses up up resources such as memory memory and processing processing power . If the the application or operating system continues continues to to run for an extended period period of time time , it may eventually use up all of the available resources resources , causing it it to slow down or even crash . 2 . Memory leaks : A memory memory leak is is a type type of bug that that occurs when when an application or operating system allocates memory for a task , but fails fails to properly release it it when the the task is finished finished . Over Over time , this can lead to the the application or operating system using up more and more memory , causing it to to slow down . 3 . Fragmentation : When an operating system writes data data to a hard drive or or solid - state drive , it tries to to store store the data in contiguous blocks blocks to make it faster to to access . However However , as as the operating system continues to to write and delete data data , the blocks of data data on the the drive can become become fragmented fragmented , meaning that that they are scattered scattered around the drive in small small pieces . This can make it slower for the the operating system to access access and read the data data , which can can cause the system to slow down . 4 . Background Background processes processes : Many applications and operating systems have processes that run run in the background , even when when the main application is not not being used .

PPP PPP is is an economic theory that compares the purchasing power of different currencies in different countries countries by by taking into account the cost of living in those those countries countries . It It allows for a comparison of living standards between countries by by taking taking into account the differences in prices for goods and services . For example , if the cost of living is higher in in one country compared to another , the the purchasing power of the the currency in the first country will be lower , even even if if the the nominal exchange exchange rate between between the two currencies currencies is is the the same . PPP helps to adjust for these differences in in prices and allows for a more accurate comparison of living living standards standards between countries countries . There are several several measures of PPP PPP , including the \" Big Mac Index , \" which which compares the price price of a Big Mac Mac burger in different countries as a way to compare the purchasing power of different different currencies .

Intensity Intensity is is a measure of the the amount of energy energy that a sound wave wave carries . When When we increase the volume of a sound on a computer or other other device , we are are increasing the the intensity of of the sound wave . However , the way that volume is typically measured and and controlled on a device does n't always increase the intensity of the the sound wave in a linear linear way . For example example , if you you increase the volume of a sound from 1 % to to 2 % , the intensity of the the sound wave may may not double double . This is because the volume control control on on a device often uses a logarithmic scale , rather than a linear linear scale . This This means means that each increase in in volume volume by a certain percentage represents a much much smaller smaller increase in in intensity intensity than than the the previous increase . So So , even even though you may think that that increasing the volume from 1 % to 2 % should make the sound twice twice as as loud loud , it may not seem that way because the intensity of the sound wave is not actually doubling .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

These fibers are extremely extremely thin , about the diameter of a human hair , and are made of of a special type of glass glass or plastic plastic that is very very good at at transmitting light light . Light travels through the fiber fiber optic cables by by bouncing bouncing off the walls walls of the fibers . This happens happens because the the walls walls of the the fibers are very very smooth and the the light reflects off off them in in a way that keeps keeps it moving forward . The The light reflects off off the walls walls so many times times that it travels a very long long distance without without losing much energy or intensity . One reason that that light light can enter the the fiber fiber optic cable cable but not exit is is because the the walls of the fiber are made made of a material material that is is very very good at reflecting reflecting light . This This means means that when when the light hits the walls , it bounces off them and continues traveling traveling through through the the fiber fiber . However , the walls walls of the fiber are also very smooth , which makes it difficult for the light to escape . This is why the the light stays inside the the fiber and and is is able to to travel such a long distance without losing much much intensity . There are are many many practical applications applications of of fiber optic technology . For example example , it it is is often used to transmit data data over long distances , such as in the internet .

The key key difference difference between a linear linear regression regression model model and a GLM is is that that in a GLM , the response variable variable is is not not necessarily continuous and may follow follow a different different distribution , such as as a binomial , poisson , or gamma distribution . The GLM allows for for the modeling of of this type of data by by using a link function to relate the mean of of the the response variable variable to to a linear linear combination of the the predictor variables variables . In In a GLM GLM , the response response variable is assumed assumed to to follow a certain distribution , and and the the mean of this distribution is modeled modeled as as a linear linear combination of the predictor variables variables . The parameters parameters of of the model model are estimated estimated by maximizing maximizing the likelihood of the data , which is is the probability of of observing the data given the model .

Finally , because the drinking age in America America is 21 21 , most students ca n't n't go to bars for the first few years years of college college , so so fraternities also function as social hubs hubs in the the same same way that bars / clubs do once you you reach reach the legal drinking age . Having Having said said that , there there are arguably arguably a number of downsides downsides to fraternities . They can can perpetuate social stratification stratification because current members of the fraternity pick the the incoming members . Members will will often only want want to to invite freshman students who are are similar similar to them them , and so the fraternity and sorority scene can appear quite insular . I have heard heard that people belong in a certain fraternity fraternity because they went went to X high school , they they have family money , or because they they are a ' legacy ' ( i.e. i.e. their dad / mum was was in in the fraternity / sorority ) . Also , because only fraternities hold parties parties ( sororities sororities have nice nice houses and do do n't want them trashed ) , guys in the ' cool ' fraternities fraternities hold an imbalance of social power as other other students ( particularly girls ) need to befriend them to to get get invited invited to the parties ( if if they ca n't get into bars ) . Obviously not all all of of them are like that ( in fact , most frat brothers brothers I met were great blokes ) but but it was something something I noticed .", "label": "hc3human"}

First , a very strong electrical current is passed passed through the rails rails . This creates a magnetic field that pushes against against the armature , which is is a conductive metal bar or rod that is mounted between the rails .

In In general , people people keep electing the the same people as long long as they run again again . There are two main reasons for it . 1 . Redistricting - Every Every 10 years when when a new census comes out lines have to to be redrawn to accurately accurately decide decide how how much much representation in congress each state gets gets . This is often used used as an an opportunity for the party party that is in charge in each state to change the lines so that that it favors them . Over time this means means that that * * most * * districts lean heavily one way or another . This means that if if you 're a republican or democrat in the house of representatives , if you run again next next term , the the guy from the the other party probably wo n't be be able to beat you . There are laws to limit this effect , although although it still still happens . Redistricting Redistricting is n't a factor in the senate . 2 . People like * * their representative representative * * even if they do do n't like congress . While While people people say they do do n't like like congress , they they still like the guy guy they they voted for . This is is partly because of of # 1 above but it it 's 's a common situation situation . This is is because even though though congress makes decisions a lot of people dislike , their representative will will often vote how they prefer . The reason congress does n't n't agree is mostly because they 'll be be replaced replaced next election if they they work work with the other side side . * * So So most people people are upset with congress , but when when they have a chance to change a small part part of it , they overwhelmingly will choose choose to to not do so . * * A small majority are are upset with the the president , but he ca n't run again again in 2016 anyway . The The US US may replace him with a republican ( switching is is common after after two terms of the other party ) or they might replace him with a different democrat . People do n't take any any real action outside outside of elections because even even though though people are upset with with government right now * * things are also pretty good for most americans and and are getting getting better all the the time * * , and something something along the lines of a revolution revolution ( like Ukraine , or Syria / Libya ) is * * way * * too much much risk risk for the average american , who would basically basically be sacrificing a good life for the the chance chance to disrupt the biggest economy in the world , almost certainly making making their lives , and and the the lives of everyone else in the world , much worse worse .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A program is just a bunch of of very simple instructions instructions for for doing something . A programming programming language lets you say say how to do do something complicated in terms terms of of several simple steps \u2014 including steps that are repeated ( \" loops \" ) and steps where you you might decide decide which of two or more things to to do do ( \" conditionals \" ) . For instance instance , suppose you are programming a little little robot that can move around on on a piece piece of paper . The robot robot has has a pen in its belly , so so it it draws a line wherever it goes goes . You You would like to get the robot robot to draw a square . But all all it knows how how to do is is * go go forward or back by by some some number number of inches inches * , and * turn left left or right by some number of of degrees degrees * . So you have have to tell it how to to make a square out of those those moves . You might write a program like this : to to draw_a_square forward forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 90 end If the robot robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and and ended up back where it it started . This This is is , in in fact fact , a program in the language language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which which used to to be very very popular for teaching programming programming to to grade school students . You can find find the Logo Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that that you you can can use use repeated steps ? You can use these these to to make a program shorter , like this : to to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That 's 's a lot shorter shorter than than the earlier program , but it it does does the the same thing thing . It 's 's shorter because instead of repeating repeating instructions ourselves , we we tell the the robot robot to to repeat doing them . Programs Programs can also also take take inputs , for instance instance , telling how how big the square should should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward forward : size size right right 90 ] end Or , even , instead instead of a square , we we could draw an an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon draw_polygon : sides : size size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 360 / : sides ) ] end So So , programs can repeat themselves themselves and they can do different different things based on their their inputs . They can also also control different different parts parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to to the speakers or or communicating with other programs over over the network network . But the basic steps of any program are based on making making decisions and doing things repeatedly .", "label": "hc3human"}

Before motion capture , game developers had to create animations animations manually manually , which was was a very time time - consuming process . They would have to draw each each frame of the animation by hand , or or use computers to create the animations from scratch . This was not very very efficient , and it it was difficult to create create realistic animations this this way . To use use motion capture , game game developers developers set up a special studio with with many cameras cameras that that are pointed pointed at the person or animal whose movements they want want to capture capture . The person or animal wears a special suit with markers on it , which the cameras can track . As As the person or animal moves , the cameras record record their movements and send the data to a computer computer . The computer then translates translates that data into an animation that the game game can use .

You spend a quarter of of that , let let 's say , on on * stuff stuff * , stuff like your your mortgage and food food and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 75,000 at the end of the year year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your your tax rate is a flat 10 10 % of of your taxable income , and your your taxable income is is everything you you make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of of that is $ 10,000 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe owe the government $ 10,000 , out out of the $ 75,000 you have have on on hand hand . But the government government allows you to to * deduct * charitable contributions contributions from your taxable income income .

Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's 's gain , all his income income is is taxed at the the capital gains tax tax rate of 15 % , not at the income income tax tax rate of of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole loophole , but but that that 's 's just propaganda . Accounting Accounting for your income that way way is what you you 're 're * supposed supposed to do . * It 's 's not a cheat cheat . It 's how how the system is set up . We We can talk about whether the system * should should be * set up that that way or not , but the fact fact is that * is is * how the system is set set up , and the the hedge fund fund manager who reports his his income as as capital gain is following following the the rules . If he did did it any * other other * way he 'd be * breaking * the the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they they 're almost certainly talking about things things that are are built into the system for good reason and and which people do do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does does * not not * imply that people people are are cheating cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so so you can can get mad at those those dirty cheats \u2026 who are in reality reality just doing doing exactly and and nothing other than what what the tax tax code tells tells them they 're supposed supposed to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

Even happy emotions emotions are products of your body 's nervous system response . The underlying underlying theme here is is your body becomes becomes AROUSED AROUSED . Next , your your sympathetic nervous system ( a division division of of your autonomic nervous nervous system responsible for for arousal arousal ) begins begins preparing your body body by by signaling other organs to release release hormones through your bloodstream . For For example , your adrenal glands located directly above above your your kidneys release release epinephrine epinephrine and norepinephrine norepinephrine .

{"text": "The The long version , someone else else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history into into this explanation explanation which severely severely lengthens it it , though I do n't think think you can understand understand these concepts without without learning about how they were were applied . I did did not discuss fascism here but will add it it on to to the the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent excellent critiques critiques of capitalism . If you read read it today , which i did last week week , you 'll be be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now now . The The main problem is that Marx Marx does n't n't give very clear clear answers answers for addressing addressing the the faults . His basic plan was was that industrialized industrialized nations should should move to socialism , and and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain explain later why no no communist country actually actually followed followed his plan . One of Marx and and Engels arguments was that prior to to industrialization , we produced not much more than than we used . Obviously there was trade trade but for the the most part part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines machines come along and and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author author of Wealth of of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead instead of one person making a product product , you might might have 10 who accomplish different portions portions of of the task . This This made production go way up up . What Marx criticized was the effect effect of of having having such such a surplus surplus . When When you overproduce the price of the good decreases decreases because the supply supply is so so high . This required two things , one one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition who who , through through free market competition , lower prices prices . The second was was that you had to find new markets . Given the world world at at the time of Smith who published published in in 1776 , there were a lot of of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods goods . So So the more more markets that opened opened up the more needed to be be produced . Marx Marx believed believed that workers standard standard of living decreased as as people were were moved into the cities to meet meet the demand for work work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of of owning your your own own land land or home , you lived in in worker cities or rented in town town . On this note Marx Marx was not a big fan of private land land ownership ( understatement , his summation of of Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued argued that that the land would be be consolidated consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not not by by the family . If If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent rent to the the same set of people who own the local local land . Back to industrialization , this is is the the period period of of time where we find child child labor , a lack of of labor laws , unions unions , or anyone anyone fighting for the the workers themselves . Marx Marx divided the population into two classes classes . The The first was the bourgeois bourgeois ( boor - zhwa zhwa ) who who had the capital capital ( the money money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These These were the people who owned the companies or managed managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name name basically means means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was the the proletariat proletariat . These are the workers workers in in the factories and on on the the farms . Their Their standard of living living is so low low that they can only afford afford to survive survive . The name name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the the ones who are actually doing the the work and and producing producing the goods , yet they are treated treated the worst and receive receive little of of the the profits . Marx Marx argued for a society in which the workers workers ruled ruled . He argued argued for for labor unions unions to to protect themselves from from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them them . People did n't n't want to lose lose their their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But But if if the workers band together together and say , \" Hey we are are n't going to work unless you improve improve these conditions conditions \" well well then then the managers and owners owners would have to to listen listen . They ca n't do do the the work on their own own , they require require a large large number of the proletariat . The The goal was for the workers workers to take advantage advantage of their power , which was in in production . If they had to stop work completely completely , or or strike , it cost the owners more more in lost production production than it it cost the workers in lost wages . Not Not that it it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx said said , was the result of industrialization industrialization and the drive for for profit profit it produced produced . He He stated that that we we stopped stopped producing to meet needs , and and started producing producing to to make profits profits for a small small portion of the the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can see see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you you overproduce ( in the the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is increased increased , demand is decreased decreased , and the the price decreases . This This is not good news for for the worker worker as this cycle feeds back back on itself , and ultimately ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is a belief belief among among some people that there is a \" gay agenda agenda \" , a movement to intentionally change change ( American ) society . Some Some people think that homosexuality in any form is is evil , particularly if you interpret the bible in in a certain certain way way that seems to indicate that that God God himself views views homosexuality as a sin . So , to them , just as we we should not not glorify glorify murder and rape , we should also not accept homosexuality as a common place way of life . People who believe believe this this way see sinister motives in even people people just wanting to to make marriage marriage between two men legal , abolishing laws laws banning sex in in forms other than the missionary position , and granting them non - discriminatory rights rights , such as hospital visitation visitation or fair employment and housing - you should should n't be denied a job or a home just because because you are gay . The gay agenda to to them is any movement in society society which alters alters society 's perception of of homosexuality away from viewing them them as subhuman evil evil people to normal human beings who just just want want to live like like everyone else else . Making them equal , making them normal , and and making them them accepted is is a gay gay agenda , intended to to brainwash brainwash the youth into thinking thinking that that this lifestyle is acceptable . Hidden Hidden within all all of of that is the premise that that homosexuality homosexuality is is a choice . If it were n't n't then then it would be cruel cruel of God to to make people that way without a way to change change it , and and it would would make it harder to to condemn condemn people to hell if it was was n't n't something that they willingly chose . I can can feel feel morally superior to a woman who has has sex sex outside of marriage and say she she 's 's going to hell hell for her choice . It would be really really difficult to condemn all women as being being sinners sinners , saying that they share share the the same gender gender as as Eve and therefore , no women should be be able able to to get into into heaven heaven . The more more extremist may have paranoid delusions that go far beyond beyond acceptance and think think that there is a secret secret cabal of homosexuals who do do n't n't want want to just live their own lives without homophobic laws and moral moral condemnation condemnation of strangers strangers , but rather that they they actually actually want to make some some straight people gay gay , particularly younger children . If you start from the the premise that gay people are are evil , condemn them them , and shun anyone you know know who is is gay , then your little world will consist of of people who are are thoroughly thoroughly straight while gay gay people people will will avoid you you , hate you , and hide hide their sexuality from you . To To these extremists , this justifies their thinking thinking that that gay people are very rare , only a perverted very small minority that wants wants to to spread their condition , their thinking , their disease to innocent youth youth . Then , when some some teenager comes out as being gay gay within within their small small , sheltered inner inner circle , they conclude it it was was the work of of gays MAKING the child child gay gay . They assume a default default position of straight straight and choosing to be gay is like your child getting a haircut and dying it it purple . Their ideal world on earth is where everyone is straight and God - fearing fearing , and so any attempts attempts to normalize homosexuals is seen as purely evil , the the work of an agenda that wants to persecute their beliefs . It helps helps that if they feel like they are being persecuted for for their their belief that homosexuality is evil , they they feel feel akin akin to Jesus Jesus , and and while they are n't being literal martyrs , getting people opposing their beliefs makes makes them them feel like they are are metaphorical martyrs for God God .", "label": "hc3human"}

The teams teams that participate in the the Champions League are some of the best teams in Europe , and they compete compete against each other to see who is the the best . In In the Champions Champions League , there are a few different different stages stages . First , there there are qualifying rounds where teams teams from from smaller countries or that did not do do as well in in their domestic domestic league league the previous previous year have to play against each each other other to try and qualify for the main tournament . Then , there there are the the group stages stages , where where the qualified qualified teams are divided into into groups of four four and and play each other other team in their their group group twice ( once at home and once once away away ) . The The top two teams in each group advance to to the knockout stages . In In the the knockout stages stages , the the teams play a single - elimination elimination tournament tournament , meaning that if a team team loses loses , they are out of of the competition . The knockout stages consist of the round round of 16 , the quarter quarter - finals finals , the the semi - finals , and the final . The final is the the last match of of the tournament , and the team that that wins is is crowned the Champions Champions League League winner for that that year year . I hope that that helps !

{"text": "These systems systems are so so useful , that that many many governments do n't want want to be restricted to to something that is is controlled by by a foreign government government . For example example , GPS is a military military system system run run by the the US Navy . They could , if if they wanted to , shut it it off or or degrade it . The Russians were n't n't happy happy with with relying on a US military system , given that there is a lot of of disagreement between Russia Russia and America America , so so they built their own own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe , the the EU government were concerned that they they were relying relying on on a foreign foreign military military system for for a lot of commercial and government work . They They were also annoyed annoyed that GPS only only made a crude signal available for the public public and law enforcement , but but the the military military got a much much higher precision signal . So So , the EU government decided to to build their own own system system ( Galileo ) which would give an an improved accuracy free public public signal , and a premium signal ( with paid subscription ) which would would give the same same accuracy as as the GPS GPS military signal . It would would also be optimized for use in Europe Europe . GPS satellites do n't n't really orbit orbit over the Arctic region , so so GPS reception reception in places like like North Norway or Northern Northern Sweden is not very reliable . The Galileo Galileo satellites satellites are intended to go into orbits orbits which go go much further North , but the disadvantage disadvantage is that you need more satellites satellites to cover the increased amount of land . Same Same sort of of thing with with IRNSS ( India India ) and and BeiDou BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all these systems you broadly broadly the same technology but on slightly different different frequencies frequencies . This means means your receiver needs to to have have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the the different systems . Dual Dual system system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been been available for a while while - they were n't terribly popular popular initially initially because because the GLONASS system system has has been very very unreliable with satellites dying or or malfunctioning malfunctioning and not being replaced . However However , the Russians Russians have repaired and updated their their GLONASS satellites satellites , and and it 's 's now a good quality modern system , so so most latest generation GPS GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS GLONASS signal as well . One of of the advantages of a receiver receiver which supports both systems is that it is possible to get a more accurate position position because you you can combine the measurements measurements from from both systems when when the receiver receiver does does the final position calculation . The Galileo system system is is n't n't complete , in fact , it it is is n't n't really functional functional , as as it does does n't have enough satellites to work work 24/7 . However , many new new GPS receivers are are \" Galileo Galileo ready \" which which means that they they have the antenna and circuits circuits in place , but the the firmware firmware to process the the signals has has n't n't been been finalized . Once enough satellites are up up and and working , the the manufacturer of the receiver will be able able to to test test their firmware , and then once tested and working will be make it available for download download .", "label": "hc3human"}

To To directly answer your question , you should should sell sell the crossover yourself and use the balance balance to to purchase your new vehicle . I would would encourage you you to use the $ 9k 9k to finance directly without without a lease , especially if you are are planning planning on on financing after after the lease term term . The lease lease will not not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in in this case case , and worse , will will likely expose expose you to risk risk of having to pay pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease ( mileage mileage , wear and tear tear , etc etc ) Best option mathematically is to to use the the $ 9k to purchase a vehicle vehicle for for cash cash . This provides the lowest total total cost of ownership .
