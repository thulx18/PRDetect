{"text": "There are a few factors at play here . Depending on the bank that has offered you the card there are different types of overdraft protection that may have been set up . Typically , if they attempt to run the card with no money , if one of these is in play , you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account , usually savings , or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds .   If you know the transaction went through , and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions , then you have a few options . If you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account , then you have nothing to worry about . If you do not , most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account , that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least $ 0 .   If this is a charge that occurred in the past , and you have already been charged an overdraft fee , there may still be hope . I can not speak for all banks , but I know that Chase Bank offers a once per year overdraft forgiveness , where they will get rid of the charges if you agree to bring the account out of the negative .

{"text": "Hashing functions are made to process some data and produce unique data that is entirely dependent on the data .

Popular hashing functions ( such as [ SHA-1 ] ( URL_1 ) and [ MD5 ] ( URL_0 ) ) are designed by * * hardcore * * mathematicians to be as secure as possible - hard to reverse , hard to spoof , et cetera . For example , take the factorial function with the symbol ' ! ' . The factorial of a number is defined as the product of all integers less than said number down to 1 . For example , 10 ! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3628800 . Computing the factorial of a number is a relatively straightforward process , but trying to reverse it ? You 'd have your time cut out for you . Hashing algorithms employ tactics like these , but most notably I think , is the exclusive - or operation . It essentially takes two double_star numbers , and for each digit , if and only one of the numbers are 1 , the output will be 1 . 00100111 XOR 11111111 = 11011000 Using binary operations like these , and in some precise order , computer scientists manage to create algorithms which take input data and change it into some output which is hard to reverse . For this reason , every input byte should rely on the byte before it , thereby giving the output hash the highest chance of being unique to the data . Also , hash sizes are usually around the 16 byte mark . All of the information of the original password is lost ( presuming it 's a decent hashing function ) , and the hash can be considered a footprint . From looking at just a footprint , you ca n't learn much , but you could check it everybody in existence 's foot until you find a match - otherwise , you 're pressed for luck . * * tl;dr * * they use methods that are hard ( as in , take years of computing time ) to reverse , by making every input byte depend on the byte before it , so as to make it very unlikely to be the same for two pieces of data .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "As far as I understand , OP seems to be literally asking : \" why , regarding the respective contracts on various exchanges ( CBE , etc ) , is it that in some cases they are ' cash settled ' and in some ' physically settled ' - ? \" The answer is only that \" the exchange in question happens to offer it that way . \" Note that it 's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically , and happens in the billions as a daily matter .

{"text": "Having a high household debt to disposable income ratio can have a number of implications for Australia . Some potential consequences include : Increased vulnerability to economic shocks : When households have high levels of debt , they may be more vulnerable to economic shocks such as job loss or unexpected expenses , which could lead to financial distress and potentially even default on their debt . Reduced consumer spending : High levels of household debt can also lead to reduced consumer spending , as households may be more cautious about taking on additional debt and may choose to save more in order to pay down their existing debt . This can have a negative impact on the economy as a whole , as consumer spending is a tonality driver of economic growth . Increased risk for financial institutions : High levels of household debt can also increase risk for financial institutions , as they may be more exposed to the risk of default if households are unable to make their debt payments . This can lead to increased caution among lenders and potentially tighter lending standards , which could make it more difficult for households to access credit . Negative impact on the housing market : High levels of household debt can also affect the housing market , as many households may be less able to afford a home or may be more cautious about taking on a mortgage . This can lead to reduced demand for housing and potentially put downward pressure on home prices . Overall , having a high household debt to disposable income ratio can have a number of negative consequences for both households and the economy as a whole . It is important for households to manage their debt carefully and for policymakers to address any underlying factors that may be contributing to high levels of household debt .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

In order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments .

Here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer : Definitions from wikipedia : A target - date fund \u2013 also known as a lifecycle , dynamic - risk or age - based fund \u2013 is a collective investment scheme , usually a mutual fund , designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date ( usually retirement ) approaches . An index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme ( usually a mutual fund or exchange - traded fund ) that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market ... An exchange - traded fund ( ETF ) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges , much like stocks.[1 ] An ETF holds assets such as stocks , commodities , or bonds , and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day . Most ETFs track an index , such as a stock index or bond index . ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs , tax efficiency , and stock - like features . The capital stock ( or stock ) of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of its owners . Which one can you lose everything in ? You can lose everything in stocks by the company going under . In Index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse . The chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies . The S&P 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the U.S.   A Pacific - Europe index such as MSCI EAFE Index is made up of 907 companies . The chances of losing everything in an ETF are also slim . The ETF that follows the S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies . An Pacific - Europe ETF such as MSCI EAFE ETF is made up of 871 companies . Target date funds are also slim to lose everything . Target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age . What would I recommend ? I would recommend the Index funds and/or ETFs that have the lowest fee that make up the following strategy for your age : Why Not Target Date Funds or Stocks ? Target date funds have high fees . Later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio . At that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections . Stocks are too risky for you with your current knowledge . If your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your Index funds or ETFs .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents .   If you have $ X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and   $ Y income overall , then you owe State A a fraction ( X / Y ) of the income   tax that would have been due on $ Y income had you been a resident of State A.   In other words , compute the state income tax on $ Y as per State A rules , and send us ( X / Y ) of that amount .   If you are a resident of State B , then State B   will tax you on $ Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus , you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how small-scale $ X is .   As a practical matter , many commercial real - estate   investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income ( usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040 ) , and the annual   bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report ( but do not get to deduct ) on the Federal return .   As a result , State A is improbable to come after you for the tax on , say , $ 100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will   recover from you . But , when the real estate is sold , there will ( hopefully ) be a big capital gain , most of which   will be sheltered from Federal tax since the passive losses finally get   to be deducted .   At this point , State A is not only owed a lot of money ( it knows nothing of your passive losses etc ) but , after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year , it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well .", "label": "hc3human"}

One advantage of range voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters , rather than just a plurality of voters . In a normal election , it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50 % of the vote if there are more than two candidates running . In a ranked voting system , this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least popular candidate can be redistributed to the voters ' next choice . As for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the two - party system , it 's crucial to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity . However , ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third - party candidates or independent candidates to win elections . Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference , they can choose to support a third - party candidate as their first choice while still expressing a preference for one of the Major party candidates as their second choice . This could make it more likely that a third - party candidate could win an election , or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Hi Raksha , Scaling is a procedure for cleaning teeth which is followed by polishing to remove stains and any other deposits accumulated in time . Scaling as i am sure as your dentist would have mentioned needs to be done every 6 months . The external stains may go with scaling and polishing but this does not result in whitening . Whitening of teeth is an entirely different procedure in which teeth lighten by 3 - 4 shades from the normal colour or sometimes even more . this procedure is commonly referred to as bleaching . There are 2 types of whitening procedure . one is done in clinic called inoffice procedure and the other is done by the patient in the house called home whitening . If you desire whitening , please consult your dentist for the same . Regards", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "5,000 years ago humans did n't know much about metal , metalworking , geology , or mining . But they did have a sense for fashion . Most metals exist naturally as rock . The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they do n't look very interesting ( to a non - geologist ) . In the world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold . Gold can be found as \" nuggets \" or \" dust \" . The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some , you 're likely to find more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers , so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it , and then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold without heat . It is \" malleable \" at room temperature , which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it wo n't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things . Gold will not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade . It is much denser than most other materials so it would make a good club , but you do n't get much more head - bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood . So other than as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical \" use \" to an ancient human . But it is pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" next to human skin tones . Why this is so is pretty much a mystery . But it 's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people . In the ancient world \" rich \" was defined as \" do n't have to farm \" . There were only three kinds of people like that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals . Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it , and it was n't good for any practical use , and as a metal it would \" stay all in one place \" and did n't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained , it became a way for rich people to display their wealth . Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold , of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat , or slaves , or land , or whatever . It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale , a cup , some water , and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me . 5,000 years of humans accepting gold as worthful has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals . Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins , even though plutonium is worth , ounce for ounce , vastly more than gold . Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that antediluvian humans did n't know about - it 's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity . And it still looks good next to human skin .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Imagine that you are driving a car at its max speed of 60 mph ( the gas is stuck at full throttle ) on a flat plane . You see another car travelling the same speed beside you . At first it is travelling in the same direction as you . So you see it as traveling 60 mph forward and 0 mph sideways relative to you . Then it veers off . Now it is travelling less than 60 mph forward and greater than 0 mph sideways relative to you . This might seem like it does not apply , but in reality it is a decent analogy for spacetime . Just replace forward with time and sideways with space . The idea is that we are all traveling through spacetime with a constant speed . We see ourselves as traveling through only time ( forward ) . Others can seem to be traveling only through time ( forward ) if they are moving with us . In other words , they do n't seem to be moving relative to us . However , if another object is traveling with some speed relative to us , we will see them as traveling slower in time ( forwards relative to us ) . Since not every objects is traveling in the same direction as us , other objects appear to be traveling through space at different speeds . They of course see us as traveling slower through time relative to them as well ( think of the car metaphor ) . The actual math is a bit more complex , but that is n't important . Time is relative in the same way that forward is relative .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Sure ! The circle constant is a number that helps us understand and measure circles . The most common circle constant is pi , which is represented by the Greek letter \u03c0 . Pi is a number that is a little bit more than 3 , and it is important because it helps us understand the relationship between the circumference ( the distance around the circle ) and the diameter ( the distance across the circle through the center ) . \r \r  The Tau Manifesto is a document that suggests that we should use a different circle constant called tau , which is represented by the Greek letter \u03c4 . Tau is equal to 2\u03c0 , or about 6.28 . The idea behind the Tau Manifesto is that tau is a more natural and intuitive circle constant to use , especially when it comes to understanding radians . \r \r  Radians are a way of measuring angles . If you think of a circle as a clock , with the 12 o'clock position at the top , then one radian is equal to 1/6 of the way around the circle . Using tau as the circle constant makes it easier to understand radians , because one radian is equal to 1/3 of tau , rather than 1/2 of pi . This makes it easier to see that radians are a measure of how far around the circle an angle is , rather than how wide the angle is . \r \r  So , in summary , both pi and tau are important numbers that help us understand and measure circles , but some people believe that tau is a better circle constant to use because it makes it easier to understand radians .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

( A dealer - he would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever . ) I have never dealt in stones over six figures , but I 'm fairly certain those are \" real \" valuable objects : just like paintings by name artists . ( However : yes , the line between \" laughable diamonds \" and actual investment stones , is indeed moving ever upwards . ) ( Note - the \" elephant in the room \" with diamonds is that GE 's industrial process for simply making utterly flawless diamonds , starting with carbon , is getting better every decade . ) ( A second overwheleming point that nobody has mentioned : diamonds get beat - up .   Regarding \" engagement ring diamonds \" , a used one is exactly as useless as a used car .   It 's crap .   Just as with $ 200,000 picassos , this concept does not apply to \" actual investment stones \" . ) Note that many of the comments / arguments on this page are very confused because : people are not distinguishing between the ( ROFL ) \" engagement ring scam market \" and the rarefied \" investment gem market \" . The two things are utterly different . Yes , \" engagement ring diamonds \" are an utter scam , and are simply : \" worthless \" .   The fundamental , basic , overwhelming scam in today 's business / social universe is : \" engagement diamonds \" . Yes , the price is only due to marketing / monopolies etc . Elephant in the room A : GE 's technology can - end of story - manufacture diamonds .   ( Starting with \" pencil leads \" . )   End of story .   It 's all over .

Simple , utterly undeniable fact : regarding \" engagement ring diamonds \" . they have : zero value .   You can not resell them . End of story . If you buy a house , you can resell it . If you buy a car , you can resell it ( at a spectacular loss ) . If you buy a picasso , you can resell it ( almost always making a huge profit ) .

{"text": "Sure ! I 'd be happy to help .   Avogadro 's number is a very important concept in chemistry . It is a number that tells us how many atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance .   For example , let 's say we have a substance called \" sugar . \" If we have one mole of sugar , that means we have 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 molecules of sugar . This number is known as Avogadro 's number , and it is the same for any substance .   So , if we want to convert between mass , mole , and molecule , we can use Avogadro 's number to help us .   For example , let 's say we have 10 grams of sugar . We can use Avogadro 's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight of the sugar . The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 g / mol , so 10 grams of sugar is equal to 0.0292 moles of sugar .   We can also use Avogadro 's number to convert from moles to molecules .

{"text": "Heh , I am answering this as I am dealing with a failed drive in our SAN . So , I will tell you how we deal with this . Our drives are arranged in what is generally called a RAID 6 setup ( my system is Solaris , where it 's called raidz2 ) . Our data is set up in disk pools , and each pool can survive up to two drive failures without losing any data at all . Yesterday , a drive in one of these pools failed . When that happened , the pool was \" degenerate \" -- it 's still working , only a little more slowly . At that point , a spare drive in the system , which had been sitting there just waiting for a failure , was activated . Data automatically started moving to this spare drive from the other drives in the pool . This happened while I was happily asleep in my bed . When I got in yesterday , I saw the failure . For this particular pool , it would take about 24 hours for the array to rebuild itself , copying the data from the other drives to the spare . I got into work about 15 minutes ago to take a look , and this is the status : scan : resilver in progress since Mon Mar 10 07:07:38 2014 45.1 T scanned out of 47.3 T at 520 M / s , 1h15 m to go 1.15 T resilvered , 95.25 % done So , in a little more than an hour , I will walk into the computer room , and remove the failed drive . In it 's place , I will put in a new drive we have sitting on the shelf . This new drive will become the new spare drive in the pool , replacing the old spare that is now an integral part of the pool . I will take that failed drive and send it back to the vendor under the maintenance contract we have with them , and they will send me a new drive -- which I will put on the shelf . * * TL;DR -- Extra parity drives in disk arrays allow for a drive failure to not significantly affect system operations or data integrity * *", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "If you are a self - employed individual or a small business owner , it is important to make punctual contributions to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) based on your earnings . This helps to ensure that you are paying the even_off amount of taxes and avoid any potential penalties or interest charges . Here are some steps you can take to make punctual contributions to the IRS based on your earnings : Determine your tax liability : You will need to determine how much you owe in taxes based on your income and deductions . You can use IRS tax tables or a tax calculator to help you calculate your tax liability . Set up a payment plan : If you are unable to pay your taxes in full , you can set up a payment plan with the IRS . There are several options available , including an installment agreement , which allows you to make monthly payments over time . Make estimated tax payments : If you are self - employed or have other sources of income that are not subject to withholding , you may be required to make estimated tax payments throughout the year . These payments help to ensure that you are paying your taxes in a timely manner and avoid any underpayment penalties . File your tax return on time : It is important to file your tax return on time , even if you are unable to pay your taxes in full . You can request an extension if you need more time to file , but you will still need to pay any taxes owed by the original due date to avoid penalties and interest charges . By following these steps , you can make punctual contributions to the IRS and avoid any potential problems with your taxes .

{"text": "Not exactly ELI5 but I 'll do my best to take a stab at it with some pseudo code . I ' m coming from a Laravel / PHP angle . Model : Items ; Controller : ItemController ; View : Shops The view Shops is merely a template for lack of better term . Basically we have a page where we are going to spit out the data for a record in our imaginary inventory . The page will have a $ title , and an array $ data . We will get our data from the DB with a model called Items . Think of this as a class that handles all interaction with the DB and abstracts the SQL implementation away . Our Controller titled ItemController will handle all business logic . If $ title = Acme Co. < title > { { $ title } } < /title > = < title > Acme Co. < /title > Now we need to bring the item into the view , right ? For simplicity we 'll just have two things in our array $ data . $ data['price ' ] and $ data['item_name ' ] . price shall be $ 20.00 and item_name shall be RC Car . Fancy . So our view is a very simple html page with a title and a table . < title > { { $ title } } < /title > < table > < tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > { { $ data['item_name ' ] } } < /td > < /tr > < tr > < td > Price < d > < td > { { $ data['price ' ] } } < /td > < /tr > Now we have the same thing but parsed : < table > < tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > RC Car < /td > < /tr > < tr > < td > Price < d > < td > $ 20.00 < /td > < /tr > Now imagine if $ data had several more indexes . We have one view that we pass this data to . But how do we get the data ? The model , right ? Well , yes and no . So a brief bit ; tying business logic to your view ( the pretty ) makes for a mess . It 's like putting everything into a blender for a beverage and then not putting the lid on . When it 's done you then swing it around to really get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles this pairing . We have things called routes , so we 're going to tell the application(website ) to point to the ItemController when the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show ) ; So what does that do ? Simple , really . In our InventoryController class we have a method called show . All we 're doing is saying when item is requested go here if there is a parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC car above had an i d of 0 . We 'd go to : URL_0 and the example above would be rendered . Controller time ! InventoryController extends Controller { public function show($id ) { //Item is in our auto load . This class is accessible app wide . $ data = Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Details for \" . data['item_name ' ] ; //View is in the same boat . Auto loaded . return View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that returns the view above , just like before . Now though , we 're going to spice it up ! We have another product . i d = 1 ; item_name = \" RC Boat \" ; price = \" $ 25.00 \" ; When we call to URL_1 guess what ! Our application automagically fills in the information for the item matching the i d of 1 . Project ! Back to the ELI5 attempt : Automatic coloring books and stencils = MVC . ( kind of ) . Code Reuse ( stencils ) is considered , for good reason , to be a sign of a capable developer . We get to reuse the same files passing in only a parameter to change the outcome . When we first called the page we had an i d of 0 . The RC Car was returned . Then we simply changed the URL to have a 1 which returned the RC Boat . Same files different page . In a real world example we 'd probably have a master page(coloring book ) that served as the independent template for all pages . This would have our CSS , JS , and other elements all centrally located . MVC means you no longer have to update your pages individually to change something like your navigation or header . It 's all in one spot . It means no need for nasty database interaction spattered all over your php files . All of that is handled in your database object . That is a central concept . Centralized code management and maintenance . I do n't think I quite hit the ELI5 nail on the head , but I hope this helps anyone that might be confused . I know it took me a bit to figure out this MVC thing .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Irony is a part of satire , so we 'll start with irony . There are a couple forms of irony : Dramatic irony is a situation in which the audience knows something that a character does not . ( Juliet is n't really dead . Romeo does n't know that . ) This is typically used to add to the tension of a situation . Classical irony is the triumph of wit over hubris . We do n't typically associate this with irony anymore , but any sort of parlor scene from a detective story is a good example . Verbal irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature . An intended meaning is dramatically different from an expressed meaning . This is typically indicated by tone , gesture , and circumstance . Paralipsis ( talking about something by saying you 're not talking about it ) is the easiest method of verbal irony to translate from performance to written word . Situational or cosmic irony is when the outcome of a series of events is dissimilar from the expected outcome . For instance , in * The Wizard of Oz * all three of Dorothy 's companions are questing for a character trait they felt they lacked and hoped to receive from the allegedly god - like Oz , who in fact lacks the traits the companions sought and would be unable to grant those traits even if he had them himself because is revealed to be a mere mortal . Had Oz been a god , he would still have been unable to grant these gifts , but the situational would have been elevated to the cosmic . Now satire uses these forms of irony , a context of entertainment and lightheartedness , and a tendency towards absurdity , to make the serious ( Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes of British landlords to suffering during the Potato Famine ) seem silly . ( Stephen Colbert , a solution that involved raising Irish children as a food resource for the wealthy points out that the population of a colony is , in fact , a valuable resource regardless of their thermic value . )", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Microsoft 's explanation of MIRR ( Modified Internal Rate of Return ) is a financial function that is used to calculate the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows , taking into account the fact that the investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at a different rate than the original cost of the investment . The MIRR function calculates the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows , taking into account the fact that the investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at a different rate than the original cost of the investment . It does this by using the following formula : MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range of cells that contain the series of payments and investments associated with the investment . \"finance_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate the future value of the cash flows . The MIRR function is useful for comparing the returns on different investments , as it takes into account the fact that the reinvestment rate may be different from the financing rate . It is also useful for evaluating the profitability of investments with irregular cash flows , such as those that involve the sale of assets or the repayment of loans . Example : Suppose you are considering investing $ 100,000 in a project that is expected to generate the following cash flows over the succeeding 5 years : Year 1 : $ 20,000Year 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 50,000Year 5 : $ 60,000The financing rate on the investment is 10 % , and the reinvestment rate is 8 % . You can use the MIRR function to calculate the internal rate of return on the investment as follows:=MIRR(A1 : A5 , 10 % , 8%)This would return a result of approximately 12.63 % , indicating that the investment is expected to generate a return of approximately 12.63 % per year . I hope this helps clarify Microsoft 's explanation of MIRR . Let me know if you have any other questions .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Well it actually kind of has , just not in the way people expected . The problem is the kind of solar you are thinking about , the green square panels . They are really , really expensive , and not terribly efficient . Those systems can take 10 - 20 years to generate enough electricity to pay for themselves . Second problem is they do n't scale well . Each individual cell generates its own power , that power than needs to be run down a wire and combined with all of the power generated by each other cell , and this infrastructure to move the power and take the individual small amounts of power and convert them into high voltage AC current to be put into the grid is expensive . We live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do n't make sense at an industrial scale . However that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements . It has ! And even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point . Its just not fancy looking green photo - voltaic cells that have , it is concentrated solar power(CSP ) systems that have . These systems use mirrors and lenses to magnify the intensity of the sun onto a relatively small point . This small point contains a system that turns heat into steam and turns a steam turbine to create electricity . They are much cheaper at scale because the mirrors and mounting brackets for them do not require the level of manufacture that photo - voltaic does . If solar is ever to take hold at the kind of level required to become the major source of power for the world it is going to be CSP systems that do it , and not photo - voltaic . CSP systems are the only solar solution that can compete with fossil fuels on a price per kWH basis . It was calculated that the entire world power consumption could be met by covering 1 % of the world 's desert climate with CSP . It is also expected that within the next 10 years CSP should be more cost efficient than fossil fuel .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A 401(k ) plan is a type of employer - sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax - deferred basis . The contributions are made through payroll deductions and are invested in a selection of mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , or other investment options offered by the plan . Employers may also make matching contributions or offer other incentives to encourage participation in the plan . There are several strategies that you can consider when investing in a 401(k ) plan : Diversification : One of the key principles of investing is diversification , which means spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes , such as stocks , bonds , and cash , in order to reduce risk . By diversifying your 401(k ) investments , you can potentially reduce the impact of volatility on your portfolio . Contribute as much as you can : The more you contribute to your 401(k ) , the more you 'll have to save for retirement . Consider increasing your contributions over time , especially if your employer offers matching contributions . Consider your risk tolerance : Different investments carry different levels of risk , so it 's important to consider your risk tolerance when selecting your 401(k ) investments . If you 're younger and have a longer time horizon , you may be able to tolerate more risk in your portfolio . On the other hand , if you 're closer to retirement , you may want to focus on more conservative investments . Review your portfolio regularly : It 's important to review your 401(k ) investments periodically to ensure that they 're still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance . This may involve rebalancing your portfolio by selling some investments and buying others . Take advantage of employer matching contributions : If your employer offers matching contributions , be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit . Employer matching contributions can significantly increase the amount of money you 'll have saved for retirement . It 's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional or a 401(k ) plan representative for additional guidance on investing in a 401(k ) plan .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "There are a few ways a push notification can work . Firstly , they can really be pull notifications in disguise . A background service regularly checks a server to see whether a notification is ready to be ' pushed ' to a program on the phone . Maybe the background service maintains an open TCP connection to the server , sending and receiving data often enough to prevent the connection being closed . ( this seems to be the Google Cloud Messaging method ) The best option is for the remote server to know the IP address of the client , and send messages to that address . But that is harder than it needs to be - there is usually one or more NAT routers and/or firewalls between the internet and most devices preventing this sort of access . This means that they need to do things like UDP tunnelling to achieve this , and UDP tunnelling needs regular keep - alive messages . Thankfully , that is all hidden from programmers and users needing to use push - notifications . As far as they are concerned , the server pushes a notification to the phone , and the phone opens the app to retrieve the details .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "It is generally not recommended to wake a person who is sleepwalking because it can cause confusion and disorientation , which can be unsettling and potentially dangerous for both the sleepwalker and the person attempting to wake them . When a person is sleepwalking , their body is in a state of partial arousal , and they are not fully conscious or aware of their surroundings . As a result , they may not be able to understand or respond appropriately to being awakened , and they may become agitated or disputatious .   It is also possible that the sleepwalker could accidentally hurt themselves or someone else while sleepwalking , either by tripping or falling , or by accidentally bumping into or touching something that could cause injury . For these reasons , it is generally best to let a sleepwalker continue their sleepwalking episode and to try to guide them back to bed if necessary , rather than trying to wake them up .

{"text": "Long short - term memory ( LSTM ) is an artificial neural network   used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning . Unlike standard feedforward neural networks , LSTM has feedback connections . Such a recurrent neural network ( RNN ) can process not only single data points ( such as images ) , but also entire sequences of data ( such as speech or video ) . For example , LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented , connected handwriting recognition , speech recognition , machine translation , robot control , video games,[10 ] and healthcare.[11 ] \n The name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both \" long - term memory \" and \" short - term memory \" . The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training , analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store retentive - term memories ; the activation patterns in the network change once per time - step , analogous to how the moment - to - moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short - term memories.[12 ] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short - term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps , thus \" long short - term memory \" . \n A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell , an input gate , an output gate[13 ] and a forget gate.[14 ] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell . \n LSTM networks are well - suited to classifying , processing and making predictions based on time series data , since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series . LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15 ] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs . Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs , hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed ]", "label": "hc3human"}

This is different from some other languages , which have different words for \" you \" when you are talking to one person and when you are talking to more than one person . For example , in French , there are two words for \" you \" : \" tu \" and \" vous . \" \" Tu \" is used when you are talking to one person , and \" vous \" is used when you are talking to more than one person or to show respect . Similarly , in Spanish , there are two words for \" you \" : \" t\u00fa \" and \" usted . \" \" T\u00fa \" is used when you are talking to one person informally , and \" usted \" is used when you are talking to one person formally or to a group of people .

To summarize : * Cells age and stop functioning but do n't get replaced fast enough . * Cells grab onto each other by forming protein links . They do this slowly over time . Eventually , it makes your tissues rigid when they should be supple . * Garbage can accumulate inside and outside cells . * DNA mutations . This can cause cancer and a few other problems . These are kind of \" ultimate causes \" and pretty general . But we can follow them into more direct causes . For instance , your tissues are getting rigid . Specifically , your arteries . Normally , arteries shrink and expand according to how much blood you have in you . This is good and healthy . If your arteries ca n't react , you end up with high blood pressure ( if they 're stuck in a constricted position ) or low blood pressure ( if they 're stuck in an open_up position -- I ' m not sure if this is possible ) . This leads to further problems -- high blood pressure leaves you liable to aneurysms , heart attacks , and strokes . Or , your cells are dying and not getting replaced . One cell generally is n't important , but if it happens to a lot of cells in your pancreas , you might lose the ability to make essential hormones . Or if it happens to your kidneys , you might build up toxic chemicals in your blood that your kidneys normally filter out . Or garbage outside your cells -- that garbage can be in your blood vessels . If it accumulates in one spot , it puts you at risk of an embolism , as /u / corbincox72 mentions .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few different ways that a DWI ( driving while intoxicated ) lawyer may defend their clients who have been accused of endangering others on the road by driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs . Here are a few examples : 1 . Challenge the breathalyzer test results : Sometimes , breathalyzer tests can produce inaccurate results due to factors such as improper calibration or the person 's medical conditions . A lawyer may try to challenge the accuracy of the test results in court . 2 . Attack the police 's observations : A lawyer may try to argue that the police officer who pulled over their client did not have probable cause to do so , or that the officer 's observations of the person 's behavior were not reliable . For example , if the officer claims that the person was swerving or driving erratically , the lawyer may try to show that there were other reasons for this behavior , such as a medical condition or a problem with the car . 3 . Present evidence of sobriety : If the person accused of DWI has any evidence that they were sober at the time of the incident , such as a witness who saw them drinking a non - alcoholic beverage , a lawyer may try to present this evidence in court to show that the person was not under the influence . 4 . Argue for a lesser charge : In some cases , a lawyer may try to negotiate a plea deal with the prosecutor to have the charge reduced to a lesser offense , such as reckless driving , which carries a lighter punishment . It 's important to note that each case is different and the specific defense strategy used will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Sure ! I 'd be happy to help .   Avogadro 's number is a very important concept in chemistry . It is a number that tells us how many atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance .   For example , let 's say we have a substance called \" sugar . \" If we have one mole of sugar , that means we have 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 molecules of sugar . This number is known as Avogadro 's number , and it is the same for any substance .   So , if we want to convert between mass , mole , and molecule , we can use Avogadro 's number to help us .   For example , let 's say we have 10 grams of sugar . We can use Avogadro 's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight of the sugar . The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 g / mol , so 10 grams of sugar is equal to 0.0292 moles of sugar .   We can also use Avogadro 's number to convert from moles to molecules . If we have 0.0292 moles of sugar , that is equal to 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 x 0.0292 = 1.75 x 10 ^ 22 molecules of sugar .   I hope this helps !

Essentially , you need to think of the efficiency of a solar cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy . Now in the body of the solar cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected . These include metallic impurities ( Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole ( which we call charge carriers ) . The more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency . So what happens out in the field over time ? There are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread . We also have a few such as PID ( potential induced degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours . Now this problem has largely been solved . There are a few other known elements that can cause degradation under sunlight , i.e copper ( which can form precipitates ) and Hydrogen , etc etc ..", "label": "hc3human"}

Dividends though are not guaranteed , as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of disbursing it to the shareholders .

{"text": "Gold is not necessarily a \" bad \" investment , but it is not always the best choice for everyone . Like any investment , it carries certain risks and may not always perform as well as other investments . One reason gold may not be a good investment is that it does not provide any income . Unlike stocks or bonds , gold does not pay dividends or interest . This means that if you invest in gold , you will not be earning any money on your investment unless you sell it for a higher price than you paid . Another reason is that gold is not very useful in and of itself . It does not have any practical applications , so its value is largely based on supply and demand . This means that its price can fluctuate a lot , and it may not always be a stable investment . Finally , gold is a physical asset , which means it requires storage and insurance , and it can be lost or stolen . This adds additional costs to owning gold , which can eat into any potential gains . It 's important to diversify your investment portfolio and consider a range of dissimilar assets , including stocks , bonds , and cash , in order to spread out your risk .

{"text": "* * WHY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect rule people , the SEC has created all sorts of rules and regulations for how companies that invest money on behalf of other people should operate . While this makes the investments safer and less volatile , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing riskier but possibly more profitable investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge funds are companies that make these investments . They are not allowed to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with less than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such as pension funds , banks , insurance companies , college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to get into a good hedge fund , as not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take on , but they are also rated on the rate of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , hedge funds gather large piles of money from very wealthy institutions and invest it on their behalf . The goal is to do two things . The outset is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you look at all the stocks on the market , odds are almost all of them went up . A rising tide lifts all boats . This is referred to as beta . Most assets , or portfolios of assets , will move in the direction of general market . Alpha is finding assets that go up even to_a_greater_extent than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is supposed to be the ability to find assets that will do this . The former goal of hedge funds is to earn absolute returns . What this means is that they make money every year , regardless of what the stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were able to do that , and many of them went out of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by various clients . A hedge fund is normally staffed by veterans of the financial services industry , typically people who have worked for a long time at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . After accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley , or commercial banks with investment banking arms , such as Citigroup or Bank of America , to borrow large sums of money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and make 10 % , you make $ 10 . But if you borrow $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , and you made $ 100 ( less interest ) for your investors off the $ 100 they invested with you . ( The downside of this is that if you lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds though , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear what leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and rumors drive trades ) . The hedge funds like to borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding the need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you 're doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs . Maybe in the process of that , you meet their hedge fund clients , and talk up your business to them to drive demand for your stock , while they hear from the CFO and CEO personally , and make better decisions than the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for investment banks , with investor money , contacts at investment banks , and large piles of borrowed money . What do they invest in ? The short answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most simple funds . They buy some stocks , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Macro - These funds invest in assets that will give them exposure to broad economic forces , which they hope to predict . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - denominated assets . Do you think we ' ve hit peak oil ? Buy oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became famous for making billions for predicting that England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning that no one knows what their criteria are , as it is a trade secret . Often they write computer programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and go long or short on them . High frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can buy stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a fund that combs through publicly available filings through the Food and Drug Administration , looking for any changes regarding newfangled drugs , to use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , the buy or sell short assets whose price will be affected by future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires another , usually the buyer 's stock goes down , as they are probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock jumps , as someone is about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy the prey . In the movie * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen uses contacts with a law firm to find clients of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort of strategy , and is arrested when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy is John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took this approach . ( I believe Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope is that returns will be less volatile and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a pretty long list of other recognized strategies , many too complicated to worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . The founder is now facing 15 to 19 years in prison . It was an effective strategy , but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point of this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they want , and will be judged solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You ' ve probably already heard about how many hedge funds make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the management fee . If you invest money with a hedge fund ( or anyone for that matter ) , the first thing they do is take a percentage of your money from you and keep it for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , rent office space , and cover overhead until their real payday arrives at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance fee . At the end of the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , and takes a chunk of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion payday for the people who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

One way she could apply for a loan in her name without her parents is if she is not currently living with them she should n't need them to cosign if she does n't have bad credit . But if she is n't living with them and they are n't financing her room and board they ca n't claim her as a dependent so if she really wants to stick it to them she can go and try to politely explain how the loans work and tell them if they do n't cosign for her then she will apply on her own ( which she can only do while not living with them I believe but not sure ) and they will HAVE to STOP claiming her as a dependent on their taxes . If they do n't agree she can put her foot down and force them to stop claiming her and tell them she will file her own application anyway and if they continue claiming her and get in trouble for it it 's their own fault cause she warned them to stop first . They may agree to cosign rather than lose her as a dependent if it makes that big of a difference on their taxes , if they do n't then she can forcefully punish them financially and their taxes will go up .

It is much farther from Earth than the Moon , and the conditions on Mars are much more harsh and difficult to survive in . This means that colonizing Mars would be a much bigger accomplishment and would require more advanced technology and planning . \r \r  Mars has the potential to support life . While the Moon is a lifeless rock , Mars has a thin atmosphere , water ice at its poles , and evidence of past water on its surface . This means that it is possible that Mars could support life , or at to_the_lowest_degree could have supported life in the past . This makes it a more interesting and potentially valuable destination for exploration and colonization . \r \r  Mars is a better place to test technologies and strategies for living and working in space . The Moon is relatively close to Earth , so it is not as difficult to get to or to return from . This means that it is not as good of a place to test technologies and strategies that will be needed for long - term space travel and colonization . Mars , on the other hand , is much farther away and would require more march_on technologies and strategies to survive on , making it a better place to test and develop these technologies . \r \r  I hope this helps to explain why someone might be interested in colonizing Mars instead of the Moon !", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "It is generally considered to be riskier to keep an emergency fund in stocks compared to more conservative options such as high - yield savings accounts or short - term government bonds .

If you need to use your emergency fund in a time of market turmoil , you could end up selling your investments at a loss . On the other hand , high - yield savings accounts and short - term government bonds tend to be much more stable , so the value of your money is less likely to fluctuate . That being said , the potential for higher returns is also a consideration .

In a modern conflict , there would be a lot more advanced technology being used , such as drones , missiles , and advanced computers and communication systems .   Tactics : The tactics and strategies used in a modern conflict would also be very different from those used in World War 2 . In a modern conflict , there would likely be more focus on \" asymmetrical warfare , \" which means using unconventional tactics and weapons to surprise and overwhelm the enemy . This could include things like cyber attacks , special forces operations , and propaganda .   Casualties : There would also likely be fewer casualties in a modern conflict compared to World War 2 .

By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "This wo n't actually be for a 5 year old , but a 5 year old should be nowhere near this book nor the movie . The author that wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Ellis , is known for a common theme in all of his books . Simply put , they are about the detachment prevalent in modern society . Specifically the effect that wealth and privilege can have on people . No one has friends only acquaintances . People are only as important as what they can do for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity I 'll only deal with what 's in the movie . In American Psycho the main character is pretending to be a human . He takes everything way too far because he is over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he is with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his whole shower procedure . He is pretending to work . His father owns a competing firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick as an employee simply because of his fathers name . He pretends to have a fiance , who of course is completely fake too , otherwise she would n't survive long around him . He pretends to have sexuality . He has no clue what it is to love someone let alone to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he feels cheated . He can see all around him what humanity is supposed to be and he just is n't \" that \" . He knows that it 's getting worse and worse , and is afraid that he will be caught . He is n't afraid of going to jail or dying , but rather he is afraid of being exposed as a fake person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your specific question regarding the scene where he calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so he calls his lawyer and admits everything he can think of . The lawyer thinks the caller is someone other than Patrick playing a joke . He never takes it seriously because to him Patrick is just some bland rich guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other bland rich guys . Later when Patrick sees the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about it the lawyer , not realizing he is talking TO Patrick , laughs about the ridiculousness of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are common themes in the movie and book . People constantly remark how normal Patrick is , people constantly mistake him and others for someone else . They all look and act alike . In my opinion the movie is about how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer to blend into society because of how uncaring and superficial we all are . If you likes the movie of course read the book . If books are n't your thing then at least watch Less Than Zero and maybe The Rules Of Attraction .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects .

The voltage and current coming out of your wall sockets is too high for the majority of these devices and a conversion needs to take place . The current is also alternating , known as AC for the purposes of transporting the power sizable distances . All electronic devices use direct current ( DC ) . An analogy would be to think of power as a river . Current could be compared to the rate of flow of the river and voltage as the difference in energy between two points on the river . So if we compared Niagra Falls to the power coming into your home , your laptop would need to reduce the flow of current to a flow comparable to a fire hydrant . The height of Niagra falls gives it it 's vast power . If the height was smaller the power would be reduced by an equivalent level .

This conversion is done in the power brick and that 's why it gets hot . Your tv , washing machine or any other electronic device will be doing this power conversion either through a power brick or internally before the power gets to the sensitive electronics .

{"text": "In order of complexity : A hub connects several devices in a network . When it receives data on a port , it repeats that data out on every other port . These are pretty rare now that switches have become so affordable . A switch is a smarter hub . As it receives data , it learns which device is connected to each port . When it receives data destined for a particular device , it only sends the data to the device 's port . If it does n't know which port to send the data to ( e.g. it has n't seen that host yet ) , it acts as a hub and sends the data to all ports -- except the one it was received on . Once the host replies , the switch learns which port is connected to , so it goes back to acting like a switch . A bridge is used to connect two physically different networks so that they are the same logical network ; e.g. connecting a Token Ring network to an Ethernet network . ( it does n't matter if you do n't know what those are , it 's just important that they are physcially different . ) A router is used to connect two logically different networks together . It routes traffic between the two networks .

For instance , a gateway that a person would get from their cable company that has wireless does all of these things : * If it has multiple Ethernet LAN ports , it is a switch . * it connects the coax cable network , the Ethernet in the house and the home wireless network , so it 's a bridge . * It connects between the cable company 's network and a home network ( wired and wireless ) , so it is a router .", "label": "hc3human"}

In other words , the lender will hold the collateral as a way to secure the loan , and if you fail to make the required payments on the loan , the lender has the right to take possession of the collateral . There are several ways to use collateral to purchase a home , including : Mortgage : A mortgage is a type of loan that is used to buy a home . When you take out a mortgage , you typically need to put down a down payment , which is a percentage of the purchase price of the home . The lender holds the mortgage as collateral for the loan . If you default on the loan , the lender has the right to foreclose on the property and take ownership of the home . Home equity loan : A home equity loan is a type of loan that is secured by the equity you have built up in your home . Equity is the difference between the value of your home and the amount you owe on your mortgage . If you have a lot of equity in your home , you may be able to use it as collateral to get a home equity loan , which you can use to purchase a newfangled home . Personal loan : A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan that is not tied to any specific asset . However , if you have collateral , such as a car or savings account , you may be able to use it to get a better interest rate on a personal loan . You can then use the personal loan to purchase a home .

It can be broken down to the classic accounting equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities ( Stuff in your pile that the bank can take back because you have n't paid for it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff in the pile that is paid for and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out a mortgage and buy a $ 200,000 house , and promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I own half of a house . That is my equity . The bank owns the other $ 100,000 of the house , and that is my liability . Again , the equation tells us : Total Assets ( The Whole House , 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank 's half of the house 100k ) + Equity ( my half of the house that I plunked down 100k for ) . To answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is how is it crucial : Let us say that I owned an entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of rat control . I take the cat to the bank , and the bank lends the cat $ 995,000 as a business loan under the agreement that the bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't paid back with interest . The cat takes the bank 's 995k and I throw in 5k of my own money that the cat never has to pay me back for , and he buys 1 million dollars worth of rat control equipment . Now if I went on Craigslist and offered to sell the cat and his 1 million dollars worth of rat control supplies to the highest bidder , my cat might sell for close to 1 million dollars . However , once the potential buyer found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to the bank still , the potential buyer would realize the EQUITY in the cat is only $ 5,000 , and would n't pay much more than that . Now that begs the question , why would I give the feline $ 5,000 that he did n't have to pay me back for ? This relates to the second use of the phrase equity in finance , which is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 to become a partner in his business . Think of this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on things that will make his business better , and that he does n't have to worry about paying me interest on or ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives me 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock of a total 200 shares outstanding . He owns the other 100 , which he assigned to himself when incorporating his business . What 's in it for me ? As owner of 50 % of the EQUITY in the company ( I own 100 of 200 total shares ) , I am entitled to half of the profits ! Now if the cat is very successful and makes $ 200,000 in profits each year after paying interest on his loan to the bank , that is great for me ! Going back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Million Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Principle Still Owed to the Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs outright to me and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed from the bank does n't change . We still have 1 million dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so that 200k is pure profit for us ( me and my cat ) as business owners . Now this $ 200,000 can either be paid to use in the form of dividends , or reinvested in new equipment and services that can help the business grow .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

However , cones are very good at detecting colors , but they are not as sensitive to small amounts of light .

Conversely zillions in \" cash settled \" contracts play out each day .   Both are totally commonplace .

The different exchanges offer the different varieties , ultimately I guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable .   There 's no \" galactic council \" or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering - ! Recall that \" a given futures contracts market \" is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company ( just like Burger King sells different products ) .

{"text": "Having a high household debt to disposable income ratio can have a number of implications for Australia . Some potential consequences include : Increased vulnerability to economic shocks : When households have high levels of debt , they may be more vulnerable to economic shocks such as job loss or unexpected expenses , which could lead to financial distress and potentially even default on their debt . Reduced consumer spending : High levels of household debt can also lead to reduced consumer spending , as households may be more cautious about taking on additional debt and may choose to save more in order to pay down their existing debt . This can have a negative impact on the economy as a whole , as consumer spending is a tonality driver of economic growth . Increased risk for financial institutions : High levels of household debt can also increase risk for financial institutions , as they may be more exposed to the risk of default if households are unable to make their debt payments . This can lead to increased caution among lenders and potentially tighter lending standards , which could make it more difficult for households to access credit . Negative impact on the housing market : High levels of household debt can also affect the housing market , as many households may be less able to afford a home or may be more cautious about taking on a mortgage . This can lead to reduced demand for housing and potentially put downward pressure on home prices . Overall , having a high household debt to disposable income ratio can have a number of negative consequences for both households and the economy as a whole . It is important for households to manage their debt carefully and for policymakers to address any underlying factors that may be contributing to high levels of household debt .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Many tax advantageous vehicles exist for the purpose of saving for college education such as 529 plans , Roth IRAs , Series EE and I bonds . Tax and penalty free distributions from a portfolio of stocks is potential if the distributions are for qualified education expenses and the account is in the form of a Roth IRA .

More Details : 529 plans are not taxed by on the Federal level when the withdraws are used for college .   In many states , contributions to state sponsored 529 plans are deductible on the state level .   These are not self directed so you ca n't trade stocks / bonds in a 529 plan , however , certain plans allow you to lock in the rate you pay for credit at today 's prices . If you want a self directed ( ability to trade stocks / bonds ) vehicle with tax free disbursements for qualified education , consider a Roth IRA . There are yearly contribution limits , and penalty if the proceeds are not used for qualified educational expenses .

A background service regularly checks a server to see whether a notification is ready to be ' pushed ' to a program on the phone .

( this seems to be the Google Cloud Messaging method ) The best option is for the remote server to know the IP address of the client , and send messages to that address . But that is harder than it needs to be - there is usually one or more NAT routers and/or firewalls between the internet and most devices preventing this sort of access . This means that they need to do things like UDP tunnelling to achieve this , and UDP tunnelling needs regular keep - alive messages .

{"text": "It is generally not recommended to wake a person who is sleepwalking because it can cause confusion and disorientation , which can be unsettling and potentially dangerous for both the sleepwalker and the person attempting to wake them .

As a result , they may not be able to understand or respond appropriately to being awakened , and they may become agitated or disputatious .   It is also possible that the sleepwalker could accidentally hurt themselves or someone else while sleepwalking , either by tripping or falling , or by accidentally bumping into or touching something that could cause injury .

In other words , it may be that in India a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in US .

There are sites that provide a skilful guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be . Of course some would get paid more than average . So you can try and make a logic , if in US say you are being paid more than average , you would be paid more than average elsewhere . Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country , one has the Advantage of positive pedigree bias .   There are also websites that would give the Purchasing Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs . The Real difficulty to find is whether the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be interchangeable in other country . If you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed . If you compare equivalence , then can you adjust .   A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US . It was with Basement and Classical_Greek , 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom . He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary . However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEO 's of top companies . So is living in a 3 room apartment fine ? There are multiple such aspects .

In India the topical_anaesthetic Tea / Coffee would be Rs 10 - Rs 20 . A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150 . The same applies to food . A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100 . The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10 . A Sub Way would be Rs 150 . A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25 . I personally am picky about food , so it does n't matter where I go , I can only eat specific things , which means I spend a huge amount of money if I am outside of India .

{"text": "Have skimmed it , these are the most important parts as I can tell : The new temperature goal is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For anybody uninformed on what that means , 1.5 us the limit the average global temperature will have risen since pre - industrial times . This is friggin huge and I ' m super excited because the old goal of 2 was n't all that great . So basically there 's limits on the global temperature rise ( which I 'll call GTR from now cause I ' m lazy ) . The GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before the industrial revolution . The last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C rise in temperature , which before was considered okay at best ( this goal was reached in the 90 's I believe ) . Since then new science and research has come out that tells us that 2 \u00b0 C could be bad . There 's also another thing you should know which is feedback loops : Under the arctic lies huge amounts of trapped methane . If the temperature becomes too high the ice that traps the methane gas melts and the methane enters the atmosphere . Methane is a greenhouse gas and is one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the atmosphere it reinforces global warming and the greenhouse effect further melting ice and further releasing methane until it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and in particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and absorbes heat . Ice is white and reflects it . As long as ice , particularly sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter goes away the the things beneath the ice tend to absorbes that heat and sun and make everything hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is melted and the more Ocean there is to absorb heat which further melts ice ad infinitum until we all die . Now back to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered seriously pushing it for these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse of civilization . At the current rate we 're doing things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is pretty much death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't in the clear but we have a very good chance of living life comfortably on earth , with nearly all of the same luxuries we have today albeit operated differently . Before this agreement the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is a huge and a really big difference . Aside from that one of the big concerns is that developed countries have created climate change and gotten rich off it and now poor nations such as Pacific island nations and countries like Bangladesh now have to suffer because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says basically that developed nations have to help out financially to developing nations with protection against rising sea levels and other things and to help them convert their infrastructures to green energy while also helping them develop their economies and humanitarian situations . It also sets a goal for developed nations to try and cut all greenhouse emissions they emit . Lastly they will take stock of emissions and temperature rises and environmental impacts of climate change in 2023 and every five years after that . Also nations have to set goals for themselves every 5 years based on what they can accomplish and what they have accomplished . One worrying part is the fact that nations can back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without repercussions . I ' m also not sure how legally binding any of this is or if it even is . It would be awesome if it was but I ' m not sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Vessels can carry weapons if the company allows it , most do n't due to insurance issues . I worked on a ship that did most of its work off of east and west Africa and we carried firearms . We had all the necessary paperwork(Arms Declaration , etc ) to go along with the weapons so it was never an issue when entering foreign ports . If we were going to be working in an area with a high risk for piracy the company would send a security team to meet us prior the entering the area , they would travel with us for how ever long deemed necessary . The issue is often when an armed security team travels to a different country . For example ( if I ' m remembering even_off ) the Suez Canal does n't allow armed security team to transit so now you have to deal with weapons and personnel getting off the vessel . Now you got a problem of ' importing ' weapons , even though you 're just going through . We never had these issues as the weapons were ours and not the security teams . When in Africa we never had any direct contact with pirates but we did have a couple situations . Coming into Douala , Cameroon approaching the anchorage a skiff approached us with about 6 people on it . We had no security team onboard , the captain went below and came up with a few of the rifles , we held them up on the bridge wing and the skiff took off . When we got into port talking with the locals they said that the bandits ( they never called them pirates ) were from Nigeria and that they were pissed that they Somalis pirates were getting all the press . A couple days after we left two ships we attacked and 6 guys kidnapped . A similarish incident happened off of Beira , Mozambique again after we left the was an attack not too far from where we were .

Some argue that technical analysis is merely a form of pattern recognition that does not consider fundamental factors , such as a company 's financial health or economical conditions .

{"text": "But what if I am getting paid salary from a source in India ? In other words , it may be that in India a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in US . In that case , even if my cost of living there is much less , so is my salary . There are sites that provide a skilful guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be . Of course some would get paid more than average . So you can try and make a logic , if in US say you are being paid more than average , you would be paid more than average elsewhere . Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country , one has the Advantage of positive pedigree bias .   There are also websites that would give the Purchasing Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs . The Real difficulty to find is whether the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be interchangeable in other country . If you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed . If you compare equivalence , then can you adjust .   A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US . It was with Basement and Classical_Greek , 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom . He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary . However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEO 's of top companies . So is living in a 3 room apartment fine ? There are multiple such aspects . Drinking a Starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US . In India this would be considered luxury . A like for equivalent_weight comparison is \" One drinks 3 - 4 mugs of Coffee \" in US , and average Indian drinks \" Tea / Coffee 3 - 4 mugs \" . In India the topical_anaesthetic Tea / Coffee would be Rs 10 - Rs 20 . A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150 . The same applies to food . A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100 . The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10 . A Sub Way would be Rs 150 . A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25 . I personally am picky about food , so it does n't matter where I go , I can only eat specific things , which means I spend a huge amount of money if I am outside of India . When I was in US , I could n't afford a maid , driver or any help . In India I have 2 maids , a cooking maid and a driver . Plus I get plumber , electrician , window cleaner , and all the help without costing me much . Things that I absolutely ca n't dream in US . My colleague in UK preferred to stay in a particular locality as it has a very good Church . So if its important , one may find few good ones in India if one is Roman Catholic , if one follows Lutheran , Greek Orthodox , tough luck .   Citizenship : Does it matter ... A alien national may never get an Indian citizenship . Children do n't qualify either unless both parents are Indian . Health Care : Again is quite different . One may feel Health care in US is not good or very expensive ... but there are multiple aspects of this . So in essence its very broad there is traffic , cleanliness , climate , culture , etc ...

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies .

{"text": "HTML5 GIFs are able to take up less space than regular GIFs because they use a more efficient method of encoding the image data . Regular GIFs use a technique called \" lossless \" compression , which means that they try to reduce the file size of the image without losing any quality . This works well for simple images , but for more complex images with lots of colors and details , the file size can still be quite large . HTML5 GIFs , on the other hand , use a technique called \" lossy \" compression , which means that they sacrifice some image quality in order to reduce the file size even more . Lossy compression works by identifying parts of the image that are not as important and discarding them , which allows the image to be smaller without being noticeable to the viewer . Overall , HTML5 GIFs are able to provide similar or better quality than regular GIFs while taking up less space because they use a more efficient method of encoding the image data .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "You should not trade based on what news is just released , if you try you will be too slow to react most of the time . In many cases the news is already priced into the stock during the anticipation of the news being released . Other times as soon as the news is released the price will gap up or down in response to the news .   Some times when you think that the news is good , like new record profits have been achieved , but the share price goes down instead of up . This may be due to the expectation of the record profits by analysts to be 20 % more than last year , but the company only achieves 10 % more than last year . So the news is actually seen as bad because , even though record profits , it has n't met expectations . The same can happen in the other direction , a company may make a loss and the share price goes up . This may be because it was expected to make a 50 % loss but only made a 20 % loss due to cost cutting , so this is seen as a good thing and the price can shoot up , especially if it had been beaten down for months . An other example is when the Federal Reserve in the USA put up interest rates earlier this month . Some may have seen this as bad news and expected share prices to fall , but instead prices rallied . This was actually seen as good news , firstly because it had been expected for a retentive time , and secondly and more importantly because a small rise in interest rates after many years of near zero rates is a sign of the economy finally starting to improve . If the economy is improving , that means more people will have jobs , more people will be spending more money , companies will start to make high revenues and start to expand , which means higher profits and higher share prices . A better way to trade is to have a written trading plan and use technical analysis to develop a set of buy and sell criteria that you follow to the tea . Then back test your trading plan through various market conditions to make sure you get a positive expectancy .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "* * What 's Bitcoin * * Bitcoin is a relatively new ' crypto - currency ' . It is a unit of currency that is completely decentralized in its management , instead relying on strong encryption and peer - to - peer communication to manage it . It has been referred to as a sort of ' digital cash ' in that you must actually possess it in order to use it , and since there is no central authority keeping track of everything , if you lose your bitcoins ( eg . through a hard drive crash , reformat , etc . , ) they 're gone -- there 's no - one you can talk to to get them back . * * What 's a Bitcoin * * A bitcoin is a random string of characters that , when put through the bitcoin algorithm , will arrive at a result that indicates it 's a bitcoin . The algorithm is designed so that it is extremely difficult for any particular random string to meet the requirements to be considered a bitcoin ; only 1 in several hundred billion possible random strings will work . Bitcoins are stored in a wallet file on your computer . The wallet file contains a list of all the bitcoins you own . A bitcoin file also contains information about every transaction that bitcoin has gone through , listing in an unplowed chain every wallet ID it has passed through . You own a Bitcoin when your wallet ID is the last in the chain . You give it to someone else by adding their wallet ID to the end of the chain . All of these transactions are passed around the peer network , and each peer will check it for validity by running various cryptographic tests . If all the tests pass , the peer will agree that the transaction is valid . The to_a_greater_extent peers validate the transaction , the more certain you can be that the transaction is valid ( generally 6 - 10 validations are enough for a transaction to be \" valid \" enough for most people . ) * * Mining for Bitcoins * * Bitcoin mining involves testing millions and millions of random strings of the proper specification in order to find the strings that ' pass ' the algorithmic test to be a Bitcoin block . Once a particular string is found , at least six other peers must agree that the string is a valid Bitcoin block . Each bitcoin block contains 50 bitcoins . Because of the rank number of strings that must be tested , and the complexity of the algorithm , this process requires a significant amount of time and processing power . The protocol also adjusts the algorithm periodically , making it more and more difficult as more aggregate computing power is used to mine for bitcoins .

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Lepton is a data compression algorithm developed by Dropbox , a company that provides on-line storage and file sharing services . Data compression is a technique used to reduce the size of a file or a piece of data , making it easier and more efficient to store , transmit , and process . The \" middle - out \" part of Lepton refers to the way the algorithm works : it first identifies and removes redundancies from the middle of the data , and then works its way outwards to compress the rest of the data . This approach is different from other data compression algorithms , which often start at the beginning or the end of the data and work their way towards the middle . To understand how Lepton works , let 's use a simple example . Imagine you have a list of words that you want to compress . Lepton would first look for repeating words or patterns in the middle of the list , and then represent those repetitions with a shorter code . For example , if the word \" the \" appears 10 times in the middle of the list , Lepton might replace all of those instances with a code like \" t10 \" . This would save some space , because the code \" t10 \" is shorter than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times . Once Lepton has compressed the middle of the list , it would then work its way outwards , looking for to_a_greater_extent opportunities to compress the data . For example , it might look for repeating words or patterns at the beginning and end of the list , and replace them with shorter codes as well . I hope this helps !

Other changes require loading different assets , like high vs low resolution textures or models . These should n't technically require restarting the program . Likewise for many of the effects settings , like turning on or off SSAA , SSAO , DOF , etc .. That said , it still takes coding effort to add the ability to actually SWAP between different assets .

{"text": "There are many reasons why different countries have different laws regarding marijuana . Some countries may have different cultural attitudes towards marijuana , or they may have different priorities when it comes to drug policy . In some cases , the legality of marijuana may depend on the specific circumstances in which it is being used . For example , some countries may allow the use of medical marijuana but not unpaid marijuana , or vice versa .   Additionally , the process of changing laws can be complex and may involve a number of different factors , such as public opinion , political considerations , and the views of various interest groups . In some cases , there may also be concerns about the likely negative effects of marijuana use , such as the risk of addiction or impaired driving .

Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle states that you can never know the exact position and momentum of any particle ; no , that 's not because we just do n't know how to do it . Position and momentum literally are not defined precisely in the universe . Next consider that certain quantum principles are inherently random . Before you measure the state of a particle , it 's impossible to predict whether it will be spin up or spin down . The presence of such randomness also messes with the idea of a mechanical universe . Even if the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and randomness were eliminated , you would never be able to make perfect predictions within our universe . That 's because predictions require information , and information must be stored ; in the act of gaining information , you increase the entropy of the universe and therefore interfere with it . In other words , your own information would screw up your predictions . Free will is very philosophic , and it largely depends on how you define free will . I believe the universe is deterministic , in that one event causes the next .

If the home is well - maintained and in good condition , it may be more appealing to buyers , even in a less desirable neighborhood . Amenities : The presence of amenities such as parks , schools , and shopping centers can also affect the value of the home . Even in a less desirable neighborhood , the presence of these amenities can make the home more attractive to potential buyers . It 's important to work with a real estate agent or appraiser who is familiar with the local market and can provide accurate information about the value of the home .

Not all size 12 fonts are the same size because different fonts have different design characteristics .

{"text": "The different naming schemes are basically a way for Intel to distinguish how powerful each processor is . An i3 is the slowest , then an i5 , and i7 is the fastest . However , within the ' i ' series , there are now 4 ' generations ' of processors .. each year , Intel refreshes their processor lineup with new versions of the processors , so a 4th - generation i5 will be faster than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and usually newer processors are more efficient , using less electricity and running cooler , as well ) . You can tell which generation a Core - i processor is from by the number after it - 4xxx is 4th - gen , 3xxx is 3rd - gen , etc . ( so i5 - 4670 is a 4th - gen , for example ) . Pretty much any Core - i processor will be faster than a Core2Duo and probably any Core2Quad as well . The best way to compare how fast processors are in relation to each other is to look at benchmarks for specific applications though ( a benchmark is just a measure of how well a specific piece of hardware performs ) . As for how many cores each one has , it depends on which specific processor you 're talking about .. you can easily Google a specific processor to find out how many cores it has . One other thing to note is that a quad - core processor is not necessarily twice as fast as a dual - core processor . All 4 cores usually do n't run at the same speed and at the Saami time . To_a_greater_extent cores help more when you 're running more applications at the same time , or running a ' multi - threaded ' application , which is an application that 's specifically programmed to make better use of more cores .", "label": "hc3human"}

These can include things like the flu , the common cold , and HIV.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why it is easier to make drugs that kill bacteria compared to viruses.\\n\\nFirst , bacteria and viruses are very different from each other . Bacteria are much simpler and smaller than viruses , and they have their own systems for reproducing and repairing themselves . This means that it is often easier to target particular parts of the bacteria with drugs in order to kill them.\\n\\nViruses , on the other hand , are much smaller and more complex than bacteria . They do n't have their own systems for reproducing and repairing themselves , and instead , they rely on taking over the cells of the host organism in order to replicate . This makes it much harder to target specific parts of the virus with drugs , and it also means that antiviral medications often have more side effects , since they can also affect the host cells.\\n\\nAnother reason why it is easier to make drugs that kill bacteria is that bacteria are often more sensitive to the effects of medications .

{"text": "Personally , I think you are approaching this from the wrong angle .   You 're somewhat correct in assuming that what you 're reading is usually some kind of marketing material .   Systematic Investment Plan ( SIP ) is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world .   Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the US . On average , verified by many studies , individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners .   Say you decide to invest in a mutual fund , dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when you feel the market is low . As an example I 'll compare investing $ 50 per week on Wednesdays , versus 1 share per week on Wednesdays , or the full $ 850 on the first Wednesday .    I 'll use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example ( VLCAX ) .   I realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different , I just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle .   By investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a small average share price while the share price climbs .   It also keeps your investment easy to budget . Vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds , rather than parsing out a lump sum in to small-scale periodic investments , which is illustrated in the third column above ; and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing . Ultimately , all of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique .   If they all called dollar cost averaging , \" dollar cost averaging \" none of them would appear to be unique .   So they devise neat acronyms but it 's all pretty much the same idea .   Trickle your money in to your investments as the money becomes available to you .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In real life , getting hit on the head with a frying pan could result in serious injuries or even death . The head is a very delicate and important part of the body , and getting hit there can cause a concussion or a brain injury . A concussion is a type of injury that happens when the brain gets bumped or jolted inside the skull . It can cause symptoms like a headache , feeling dizzy or confused , and feeling tired . A brain injury is when there is damage to the brain itself , and it can cause more serious problems like problems with memory or thinking , or even paralysis . So getting hit on the head with a frying pan , or any other object , is not something to be taken lightly and should be avoided at all costs . It 's important to always be careful and protect your head , especially when playing sports or doing activities that could potentially cause an injury .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

The idea is to create a society where everyone is be and there is no social hierarchy or class distinctions . However , in practice , communism has often been difficult to implement successfully . In China , the government has tried to use communism to help reduce poverty and increase equality , but there are still many people who are poor and struggling to get by . This is partly because it can be difficult to fairly distribute resources and wealth when the government is in control of everything . Additionally , there are other factors that can contribute to poverty , such as natural disasters , health problems , and lack of education .

If you let n=0 , you get A^0 = A^0 + 1 / A , which is A^0 = A^1 / A , which is A^0 = A / A , which is A^0 = 1 . So therefore , A^0 = 1 . * * * * * Edit : Bonus round for negative powers , if you 're interested . Now that we know A^0 = 1 we can do this : Using A^n = A^n+1 / A again . let n=-1 .

However , some people argue that corporations should not have the same legal rights as individuals because they are not living beings and do not have the same moral or ethical responsibilities . They believe that corporations should be more strictly regulated and held accountable for their actions , and that they should not be able to use their financial resources to influence political decisions or shape public policy in ways that may not be in the best interests of society as a whole .

As a cosigner , you are equally responsible for the debt as the primary borrower and the lender can hold you responsible for the payments if the primary borrower fails to pay . This means that the lender can pursue you for the unpaid balances and take legal action against you to recover the debt . It is important to understand the risks of cosigning before agreeing to do so . If you are considering cosigning for a friend , it is a good idea to have a candid conversation about their financial situation and their ability to make the payments on time . You should also be prepared to pay the debt yourself if necessary . If you are unable to pay the debt and your credit is being affected , you may want to consider trying to negotiate with the lender to have the debt removed from your credit report . In some cases , the lender may be willing to do this if the primary borrower agrees to take full responsibility for the debt and makes arrangements to pay it off .

{"text": "Having a high household debt to disposable income ratio can have a number of implications for Australia . Some potential consequences include : Increased vulnerability to economic shocks : When households have high levels of debt , they may be more vulnerable to economic shocks such as job loss or unexpected expenses , which could lead to financial distress and potentially even default on their debt . Reduced consumer spending : High levels of household debt can also lead to reduced consumer spending , as households may be more cautious about taking on additional debt and may choose to save more in order to pay down their existing debt . This can have a negative impact on the economy as a whole , as consumer spending is a tonality driver of economic growth . Increased risk for financial institutions : High levels of household debt can also increase risk for financial institutions , as they may be more exposed to the risk of default if households are unable to make their debt payments . This can lead to increased caution among lenders and potentially tighter lending standards , which could make it more difficult for households to access credit . Negative impact on the housing market : High levels of household debt can also affect the housing market , as many households may be less able to afford a home or may be more cautious about taking on a mortgage . This can lead to reduced demand for housing and potentially put downward pressure on home prices . Overall , having a high household debt to disposable income ratio can have a number of negative consequences for both households and the economy as a whole .

{"text": "Infinity is n't a number , it 's a concept . It 's very good at identifying how things behave ( tending to infinity , infinite area , etc . ) when you want a way to identify something as being bigger than any other number . However , what it does n't do well is to try and make it work into standard arithmetic . What , for example , is infinity plus 1 ? It ca n't be bigger than infinity because by definition , nothing is boastful than infinity so it has to be infinity . Infinity plus infinity ? That 's the definition of 2xinfinity , but that will be infinity too . So will 3xinfinity , 4xinfinity and also infinity^2 . Infinity minus infinity or infinity divided by infinity makes even less sense , because of these different \" sizes \" of infinity that are all treated as the same . On a more basic level , infinity is often defined by the limit of n / x where n is a real number and x tends to 0 . Crudely ( and inaccurately ) put , this can be simplified as n/0 = infinity . Reversing the multiplication gives that 0 x infinity = n where n is any real number . This is a horribly informal way of putting it though .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "I 'm sorry to hear that you 're feeling frustrated as a landlord . Managing rental properties can be challenging at times , and it 's understandable that you may be experiencing some difficulties . There are a few things you might consider to help alleviate your frustration : Make sure you are aware of the laws and regulations that apply to landlords in your area . This can help you understand your rights and responsibilities , and ensure that you are operating within the legal framework . Consider hiring a property management company to handle some of the more time - consuming tasks associated with being a landlord . This can include things like finding and screening tenants , handling maintenance and repairs , and collecting rent . Communicate with your tenants to address any issues that may be causing problems . This may include setting clear expectations for things like rent payments and property maintenance , and addressing any concerns or complaints that your tenants have in a timely and professional manner .

In World War 2 , the technology was much less advanced than it is today . For example , planes and tanks were the main weapons of war , and there were no drones or missiles . In a modern conflict , there would be a lot more advanced technology being used , such as drones , missiles , and advanced computers and communication systems .   Tactics : The tactics and strategies used in a modern conflict would also be very different from those used in World War 2 . In a modern conflict , there would likely be more focus on \" asymmetrical warfare , \" which means using unconventional tactics and weapons to surprise and overwhelm the enemy . This could include things like cyber attacks , special forces operations , and propaganda .   Casualties : There would also likely be fewer casualties in a modern conflict compared to World War 2 .

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Electricity is generated by magnets moving across wires . Winding the wire up into a coil is better than a straight wire , and having three coils is even better . Arranging three coils around a spinning magnet is the basic principle of the power station 's generator . There will be a transformer box somewhere in your block that has three coils that are connected to the power lines . The coils create a spinning magnet force field , rotating at the same speed as the magnet in the generator . Then there are three more coils , but smaller ones , in the transformer . These secondary coils see the rotating field and it appears just like a spinning magnet to those three smaller coils . So they generate too , but at a lower voltage that is safer for the houses in your street . The three coils can be connected together as a \" star \" like a Y or as a triangle \" Delta \" . The power lines connect to the corners of the triangle or the points of the star to give 3 phase power . The centre of the star is also connected and that cable is called \" neutral \" . Wall sockets are connected to one of the 3 phases and neutral . Boastful motors in factories can use all three phases . Big office blocks will use different phases for different power outlets to keep a balanced load . The voltage between two of the phases is more than the voltage from phase to neutral because in a star connection ( Y ) that is the voltage across two of the coils .

{"text": "Sure ! The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that involves three doors and a car behind one of them . Here 's how it works : Imagine you are on a game show and the host shows you three doors . Behind one of the doors is a brand new car , and behind the other two doors are goats . The host asks you to choose a door , and you choose door number 1 . Before the host reveals what is behind your chosen door , he opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat . The host then gives you the option to stick with your original choice ( door 1 ) or switch to the other unopened door ( door 3 ) . Should you switch or stick with your original choice ? The answer might seem counterintuitive , but you should switch doors . Here 's why : Before the host opened door 2 and revealed a goat , you had a 1 in 3 chance of winning the car ( since there are three doors and only one car ) . Now that the host has revealed one of the goats , you know that the car is not behind door 2 . That means that the car must be behind either door 1 or door 3 . Since you originally had a 1 in 3 chance of choosing the door with the car , and you now have a 50/50 chance of choosing the door with the car ( since it must be behind either door 1 or 3 ) , you should switch doors to increase your chances of winning the car .

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

However , the hair on your body is much shorter and finer than the hair on your head , and it is not protected by a scalp .

Not all size 12 fonts are the same size because different fonts have different design characteristics .

{"text": "The important thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't breathe through their mouths like us ; they do n't even have lungs . They have tiny holes in their exoskeleton which allows oxygen into system of tubes , which carry oxygen to their organs . With that in mind , let 's think about what happens when something increases in size . Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In other words , volume and surface area increase by different rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It has a volume of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides , 4 sq ft per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times * , but the surface area only increased by * four * . 3x3x3 ? Volume of 27 , surface area of 54 . The volume more than tripled , whereas the surface area roughly doubled . Now , the point here is that * volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That means that there 's more organs and whatnot , all of which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen available , though , depends on * surface area * . Insects get oxygen from their skin , so to increase their oxygen intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You ca n't add more holes in the exoskeleton to increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because that makes the exoskeleton weaker . The exoskeleton is * already * under extra strain trying to support the increased weight , so that wo n't work . This means that there 's essentially a point where an insect ca n't grow any bigger , because it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) to make up for the increased volume / weight ( need for oxygen ) . For more evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be much bigger millions and millions of years ago during dinosaur times . The atmosphere was richer in oxygen back then , so it makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

The scalp contains tiny blood vessels that provide nutrients to the hair follicles , which are responsible for producing new hair . When the hair grows long enough , it eventually falls out and is replaced by new hair . The hair on your body grows from follicles in the skin , just like the hair on your head . However , the hair on your body is much shorter and finer than the hair on your head , and it is not protected by a scalp . Because of this , the hair on your body stops growing after a short period of time and falls out .

{"text": "What honey badger something said : \" It 's when electoral districts are redrawn in order to favor a specific party or candidate based on demographics . \" And check out [ the wikipedia article ] ( URL_2 ) . ------------------ Imagine a pretend 51st state in the US . We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as potential ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 Representative spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts / Representatives and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fairly person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet tall then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "It is called \" Credit card installments \" or \" Equal pay installments \" , and I am not aware of them being widely used in the USA . While in other countries they are supported by banks directly ( right ? ) , in US you may find this option only in some big stores like home improvement stores , car dealerships , cell phone operators ( so that you can buy a new phone ) etc . Some stores allow 0 % financing for , say , 12 months which is not exactly the same as installments but close , if you have discipline to pay $ 250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end . Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well , and it adds risks of customer default , introduces debt collection possibility etc . That 's why it 's usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not care in this case , from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $ 250 every month . In other countries banks support this option directly , I think , taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants . This has not happened in US . There is a company SplitIt which automates installments if stores want to support it but again , it means stores need to agree to it . Here is a simple article describing how credit cards work : https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html In oecumenical , if you move to US , you are unlikely to be capable to get a regular credit card because you will not have any \" credit history \" which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt . The easiest way to build the history - request \" secured credit card \" , which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount . It 's like a \" practice credit card \" . You use it for 6 - 12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus , establishing your \" credit score \" . After that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card . Credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that .

{"text": "This is actually an interesting question , and the root of your answer lies far back in history . The short version is that a highway was a road elevated above the surrounding terrain ( literally , the high way ) , and a freeway was the opposite of a toll road ( literally , the free way ) . Back in , say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most people walked from their hut to the fields and back , and perhaps once a season the duke 's tax collector came in a wagon or cart . This meant that most traffic was along footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations increased , and the cart paths began seeing more traffic , 2 big problems arose . First , the ruts got deeper , much deeper . This is a Major problem in places with a high water table ( say , coastal areas or swamps ) , or during rainy seasons . Second , these low paths made it hard to see around , facilitating ambushes by bandits . By building up the path , these two problems were alleviated . The path was above the waterline , during rains the water would naturally run off the path , and someone on the path could more easily see bandits lying in wait . A high way was much safer . The downsides of the high way is that you could n't just get on it anywhere with your cart - the sides were too steep . You had to get on or off in specific locations that had lower grade ramps leading to the high way . This is still reflected in how our modern highways work . They have limited access , usually by on / off ramps . Modern highways are ( often ) elevated , limited access roads that can safely handle high volumes of traffic . However , the cost of building this highway has to be borne by someone . Hence , initially , most highways were toll roads ( aka turnpikes , because they had walls of pikes setup on the road , which was turned aside when the toll was paid . Again , literally , turn pike to pass ) . When bright , insightful people in government realized that safer traffic along those highways boosted the economy , and allowed them to collect more taxes , they decided to make the highways they build free , so that they could make more money off the increased traffic . The free way was born . Modern freeways are highways that are paid for by taxes . The meaning of highway and freeway is , literally , in the name . High way and free way .", "label": "hc3human"}

Credit card : Some homeowners use credit cards to finance the cost of a new furnace . While this can be a convenient option , it 's important to be aware that credit cards typically have higher interest rates than home equity loans or personal loans , so you may end up paying more in the long run . Energy efficiency financing : Many utility companies offer financing programs specifically for energy - efficient home improvements , including new furnaces .

Here is a list of custodians to help with your research Here are some of the more common pros and cons that we see . Pros :   1 ) You can invest in virtually anything that is considered an investment . This is great if your expertise is in an area that can not be easily invested in with traditional securities , such as horses , private company stock , tax liens and more . 2 ) Control- you have greater control over your investments . If you invest in GE , it is likely that you will not have much say in the running of their business . However , if you invest in a rental property , you will have a lot of control over how the investment should operate . 3 ) Invest in what you know . Peter lynch was fond of saying this phrase . Not everyone wants to invest in the stock market . Many people wo n't touch it because they are not familiar with it . Self - directed IRAs allow you to invest in assets like real estate that you know well . Cons : 1 ) many alternative investments are illiquid . This can present a problem if you need to access your capital for withdrawals . 2 ) Prohibited transactions- This is a new area for many investors who are unfamiliar with how self - directed IRAs work 3 ) Higher fees- in many cases , the fees associated with self - directed IRA custodians and administrators can be higher . 4 ) questionable investment sponsors tend to target self - directed IRA owners for fraudulent investments . The SEC put out a good PDF about the risks of fraud with self - directed IRAs . Self Directed IRAs are not the right solution for everyone , but they can help certain investors focus on the areas they know well .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A 401(k ) plan is a type of employer - sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax - deferred basis . The contributions are made through payroll deductions and are invested in a selection of mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , or other investment options offered by the plan . Employers may also make matching contributions or offer other incentives to encourage participation in the plan . There are several strategies that you can consider when investing in a 401(k ) plan : Diversification : One of the key principles of investing is diversification , which means spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes , such as stocks , bonds , and cash , in order to reduce risk . By diversifying your 401(k ) investments , you can potentially reduce the impact of volatility on your portfolio . Contribute as much as you can : The more you contribute to your 401(k ) , the more you 'll have to save for retirement . Consider increasing your contributions over time , especially if your employer offers matching contributions . Consider your risk tolerance : Different investments carry different levels of risk , so it 's important to consider your risk tolerance when selecting your 401(k ) investments . If you 're younger and have a longer time horizon , you may be able to tolerate more risk in your portfolio . On the other hand , if you 're closer to retirement , you may want to focus on more conservative investments . Review your portfolio regularly : It 's important to review your 401(k ) investments periodically to ensure that they 're still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance . This may involve rebalancing your portfolio by selling some investments and buying others . Take advantage of employer matching contributions : If your employer offers matching contributions , be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit . Employer matching contributions can significantly increase the amount of money you 'll have saved for retirement . It 's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional or a 401(k ) plan representative for additional guidance on investing in a 401(k ) plan .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Either they 're saying that the purchasing power of the dollar could go down ( IE - let 's say an apple that costs $ 3 today suddenly costs $ 4.50 ) due to inflation , so any money you currently hold , ignoring everything else , is worth less . The other thing they could mean is that the dollar could decrease in value relative to other currencies . Currencies are typically measured against each other . An American Dollar might get you $ 1.10 Canadian today and in a year , it might get you $ 1.20 or only 90 cents . That matters because countries trade with each other and it makes the cost of imported good more / less expensive ( so if you 're buying apples from Canada and the Canadian Dollar is more valuable , those apples will cost more ) and it will make your exports more / less expensive ( if the American dollar increases in value , then Canadians might be less inclined to buy American apples ) .

{"text": "Sure ! I 'd be happy to help .   Avogadro 's number is a very important concept in chemistry . It is a number that tells us how many atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance .   For example , let 's say we have a substance called \" sugar . \" If we have one mole of sugar , that means we have 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 molecules of sugar . This number is known as Avogadro 's number , and it is the same for any substance .   So , if we want to convert between mass , mole , and molecule , we can use Avogadro 's number to help us .   For example , let 's say we have 10 grams of sugar . We can use Avogadro 's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight of the sugar . The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 g / mol , so 10 grams of sugar is equal to 0.0292 moles of sugar .   We can also use Avogadro 's number to convert from moles to molecules . If we have 0.0292 moles of sugar , that is equal to 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 x 0.0292 = 1.75 x 10 ^ 22 molecules of sugar .   I hope this helps !

The problem with the term global warming is that after the El Nino year in 1998 the earth went through ~10 years of no warming , perhaps slight cooling . All the science and predictions were that carbon emissions were driving the climate the warm , but this did n't happen and skeptics of the conventional wisdom pounced on it . So over time the term \" climate change \" became popularized to describe any change in climate caused by human interaction with the earth .

A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle that pools together money from many different investors and uses that money to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks , bonds , or other securities . The goal of a mutual fund is to provide investors with a diversified investment that is professionally managed , with the aim of earning a profit . Mutual funds are often considered a good option for beginners or for people who do n't have a lot of money to invest , because they allow investors to spread their money across a wide range of different securities , which can help reduce risk . Next , let 's talk about hedge funds . A hedge fund is a type of investment vehicle that is typically only available to accredited investors ( people who meet certain income or net worth requirements ) . Hedge funds are usually more risky and more aggressive than mutual funds , and they often use more complex investment strategies , such as short selling and leverage , to try to generate higher returns . Hedge funds are known for being less regulated than mutual funds , and they often charge higher fees to investors . There are many other types of investment funds as well , such as exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , private equity funds , and venture capital funds .

Compression programs like WinRAR and 7zip use a variety of techniques to identify and eliminate redundancy in a file , such as looking for repeating patterns of data or identifying parts of the file that are not essential to its function . The program then creates a new , smaller version of the file that includes only the necessary information .

This is because investors want to receive a higher return on their investment , and the yield on a bond is directly related to its price . When the price of a bond decreases , its yield increases , and vice versa . It 's important to note that the relationship between interest rates and bond yields is not always straightforward , as other factors can also influence bond prices and yields .

{"text": "ELI5 : There 's a super fun playset where only you have to pay a fine to get in and then once you get in , no one will play with you unless you are accepted into a playgroup . Each playgroup has different requirements to get in . Each playgroup has their own part of the playset , and they still play with other kids outside of the playset and other playgroups , but at the end of the day , they always go back to their playgroups . Now imagine each playgroup has a babysitter , and that babysitter oversees several playgroups at other playsets and she reports to a mom . The babysitter is like a regional coordinator or a house mom or what have you . The Mom is like the national / international president . Each playset is like greek life on another campus . Each playgroup is like a house . I think this metaphor shows how transitive houses can be from generation to generation and school to school . Originally I did n't want to join a sorority . I thought it was really stupid . My aunt paid for my rush fee so I did it . Just rush / recruitment itself really brought me out of my shell . It really made me grow up and I learned a lot about discretion and friendship . A girl on my lacrosse team always bashes sororities , but she 's closest with all the girls in Greek life on our team . It 's amazing if you find the right house with the right girls . Every house at every campus during different generations are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT . So if your best friend joins Phi Upsilon Kappa ( made up , does n't exist as far as I know ) at All - American University , does n't mean you have to join Phi Upsilon Kappa at your university . In Greek life , you get to meet a lot of people ( especially if you go to a big school like me ) and it makes a big campus feel smaller because you meet people from mixers / raids / invites whatever you want to call them . I ' ve gotten so many connections for professors , classes , and any help I ' ve needed . A lot of my best friends are in Greek life , but I also have friends who refuse to be in Greek life and friends who dropped out of Hellenic life . It 's not like some elite club where you ignore everyone else . One way we describe it is \" there 's a friend , and then there 's a sister \" If you feel aflutter or unsure , go through rush anyways , and do n't accept a bid unless you are absolutely sure . There is always next semester / quarter . If you 're an entrance freshman , talk to people you know at the school already and what their opinion is on it . Sometimes Greek life at some schools is horrible , sometimes it 's the best thing in the world . You just have to see if it 's right for you . TL;DR : go through recruitment .

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "This would create a situation where people could save money by purchasing insurance only when they needed healthcare rather than on a regular basis . After all , why pay for the insurance when I ' m healthy if can just buy insurance if I start to feel sick ? Because fewer healthy people are signing up ( people who would be cheaper for the insurance company ) and the sick ones are still able to ( expensive ) , the average expenditures the insurance company has to make for each person goes up . So they raise their rates in response . More healthy people drop out sinc , forgoing the more expensive insurance since they do n't need it and can buy it later . And costs go up again , so prices go up again , so more healthy people drop out again . And so on , until prices get so high that it 's effectively not an insurance system , just sick people paying a lot of money for healthcare . If you can only sign up for health insurance once a year , it makes this much harder to do . What if you got sick three months after open enrollment ? You would be without insurance when you needed it . So you 're more likely to buy the insurance before you get sick , lowering average costs and making a true insurance system more tenable .

Personal experiences : People 's personal experiences can also shape their music tastes . For example , if you have a lot of fun at a dance party where they play electronic dance music ( EDM ) , you might start to enjoy EDM . Or if you go through a tough break - up and find solace in a particular type of music , you might start to associate that type of music with feelings of comfort and emotional healing . Cultural influences : People 's cultural backgrounds can also influence their music tastes .

It also affects how numbers are handled internally . It can take longer to do certain operations involving big numbers ( you might not even realise that the computer is using big numbers ) if the computer ca n't represent them directly .

{"text": "The issue is a series of decisions made by Tony Abbott that many Australians feel make them look like \" Rednecks \" on the Global stage . Here are some examples : 1 : Tony Abbott sent no one the Summit on climate change which won us the humiliation award as a country by a large group of scientists . He even removed the minister for climate change and dissolved the office in the process . 2 : He has given the green light to cull the shark population off the west coast . Seemingly to reduce the amount of sharks to make the place more of a tourist destination . However , those sharks are part of an eco - system that we largely do n't understand . The funds that were diverted to this were reallocated from improving the standard of living . 3 : He made himself \" Minister of Women 's Issues \" .... need I explain that ! ? 4 : He has been annoying our nearest neighbours to the north , Indonesia , by crossing into their waters to intercept boats laden with refugees and wither sending them away orarresting them and placing them in detention centres . Recently , rioting and deaths have become a more and more common . Top it off with a severe lack of information about the facilities , conditions and what the process of integration is , if it exists at all , is making Australians question \" what is there to hide ? \" 5 : Tony Abbott is sexist . 6 : Tony Abbott is Prime Minister and head of the Liberal party . This means financial liberty . Not socialist . Liberal meaning you can make money from anything you want and at the end of the day , it 's every man for himself . At the end of the day , you can be fairly certain he is merely lining his pockets so that he and his children are set for life . Liberal goal achieved . 7 : His party have sent photos to the UNESCO ( World Heritage Listings Association ) that are misleading about the state of the forests in Tasmania . They wish to declassify the area so it can be logged . The entire area is untouched . Australians mostly want that to remain is \" mint ' condition . The liberal party thinks lying to get their way is an acceptable strategy . It 's not . 8 : Tony Abbott panders to Gina Rinehart , a mining magnate that inherited her wealth from her father and has fought to keep it from the rest of her family . She has recently said that she disapproves of the latest generation to come into the job market because of they 're \" Entitled \" behaviour and mind set . This seems \" rich \" coming from her . Inherited everything ... smooth . 9 : Tony disolved the legislation for Homosexual marriage . It was set up and on probation and several couples married and now their union is no longer recognised by any authority . If something happened to one partner of these unions , then the other would have no rights to what happened to children and property . But , heterosexual couples would . Double standard . 10 : Tony 's arrogant nature , probably because he is a politician or is at least pretending to be . There have been many good and bad politicians in Australia 's history but in the last few years it seems to have run out . It 's become more of a popularity contest and the country is now suffering as a direct result of this . While this , it 's poor Tony 's fault , he is wearing those shoes . In conclusion , Tony Abbott is a cunt .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Single malt Scotch whisky is made from water , malted barley , and yeast . Here 's the general process for making single malt Scotch whisky:\\n\\nMalting : The barley is soaked in water and allowed to germinate , or sprout . During this process , enzymes are produced that will convert the starch in the barley into sugars . The germinated barley is then dried over a peat fire , which gives it a distinctive smoky flavor.\\n\\nMilling : The dried malt is ground into a coarse flour called grist.\\n\\nMashing : The grist is mixed with hot water in a large vessel called a mash tun . This process , called mashing , extracts the sugars from the malt and creates a liquid called wort.\\n\\nFermentation : The wort is transferred to a large vessel called a washback , where it is mixed with yeast . The yeast ferments the sugars in the wort , converting them into alcohol and producing a liquid called wash . The wash has an alcohol content of about 8 - 9%.\\n\\nDistillation : The wash is transferred to a still , where it is heated until the alcohol vaporizes . The vapor is then condensed back into a liquid , resulting in a clear , colorless liquid called low wine . The low wine is then distilled again , producing a liquid called spirit.\\n\\nAging : The spirit is placed in oak barrels to mature . The barrels are typically aged for at least three years , although some single malt Scotch whiskies are aged for much longer . During the aging process , the spirit takes on the color and flavor characteristics of the barrel.\\n\\nBlending and bottling : The aged spirit is typically blended with spirit from other barrels to create a coherent flavor profile . The blended spirit is then bottled and sold as single malt Scotch whisky.\\n\\nThere are many variables that can affect the flavor of single malt Scotch whisky , including the type of barley used , the water source , the type of yeast , the type of barrel used for aging , and the length of aging .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Logical consequence ( also entailment ) is a fundamental concept in logic , which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements . A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises , because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises . The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions : In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises ?   and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises ?   All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth . \n Logical consequence is necessary and formal , by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation . A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences , for a given language , if and only if , using only logic ( i.e. , without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences ) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true . \n Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\n L \n\n\n\n\n { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { L } } } \n\n , either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\n L \n\n\n\n\n { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { L } } } \n\n  or by formal intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\n L \n\n\n\n\n { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { L } } } \n\n .   The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment : ( 1 ) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences : ( 2 ) The relation is a priori , i.e. , it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence ( sense experience ) ; and ( 3 ) The logical consequence relation has a modal component .", "label": "hc3human"}

Certain hard limits are placed on small tiers by upper tiers , particularly regarding how those lower tiers must respect basic civil rights . For example , it would be unlawful for * any * tier of government in the United States to charge a poll tax during an election . It 's prohibited by law , and if attempted would be challenged in a court of appropriate jurisdiction and overturned . However , within those basic limits , each tier is more or less left at its own discretion to organize itself however it wants , and that includes setting the rules for local elections . As long as those rules do n't violate fundamental principles of law , the individual bodies politic can do * whatever . * If some municipal government somewhere wanted to change its method of electing its mayor from election by ballot to election by acclamation , and the laws of the locally relevant upper tiers of government \u2014 meaning the state constitution , basically \u2014 did n't expressly prohibit it , they could go right ahead .

{"text": "Not in a fraternity , but a foreigner who spent time studying at a US college . Fraternities ( and sororities ) are basically structured social groups . When college students leave their hometown and arrive at college , they often know very few people and are not used to taking the initiative in meeting people . Fraternities provide a medium for students to socialise and bond . Since fraternities often have a reputation , students can join to meet likeminded peers who they might not otherwise meet . For example , some fraternities will have a charity focus , others will have people who grew up in a certain area , others will attract goofy guys or sporty guys . Fraternities also provide structured social situations to meet girls ( or sororities for meeting boys ) by holding parties , date nights and other functions . Finally , because the drinking age in America is 21 , most students ca n't go to bars for the first few years of college , so fraternities also function as sociable hubs in the same way that bars / clubs do once you reach the legal drinking age . Having said that , there are arguably a number of downsides to fraternities . They can perpetuate social stratification because current members of the fraternity pick the incoming members . Members will often only want to invite freshman students who are similar to them , and so the fraternity and sorority scene can appear quite insular . I have heard that people belong in a certain fraternity because they went to X high school , they have family money , or because they are a ' legacy ' ( i.e. their dad / mum was in the fraternity / sorority ) . Also , because merely fraternities hold parties ( sororities have nice houses and do n't want them trashed ) , guys in the ' cool ' fraternities hold an imbalance of social power as other students ( particularly girls ) need to befriend them to get invited to the parties ( if they ca n't get into bars ) . Obviously not all of them are like that ( in fact , most frat brothers I met were great blokes ) but it was something I noticed .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A 401(k ) plan is a type of employer - sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax - deferred basis . The contributions are made through payroll deductions and are invested in a selection of mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , or other investment options offered by the plan . Employers may also make matching contributions or offer other incentives to encourage participation in the plan . There are several strategies that you can consider when investing in a 401(k ) plan : Diversification : One of the key principles of investing is diversification , which means spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes , such as stocks , bonds , and cash , in order to reduce risk . By diversifying your 401(k ) investments , you can potentially reduce the impact of volatility on your portfolio . Contribute as much as you can : The more you contribute to your 401(k ) , the more you 'll have to save for retirement . Consider increasing your contributions over time , especially if your employer offers matching contributions . Consider your risk tolerance : Different investments carry different levels of risk , so it 's important to consider your risk tolerance when selecting your 401(k ) investments . If you 're younger and have a longer time horizon , you may be able to tolerate more risk in your portfolio . On the other hand , if you 're closer to retirement , you may want to focus on more conservative investments . Review your portfolio regularly : It 's important to review your 401(k ) investments periodically to ensure that they 're still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance . This may involve rebalancing your portfolio by selling some investments and buying others . Take advantage of employer matching contributions : If your employer offers matching contributions , be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit . Employer matching contributions can significantly increase the amount of money you 'll have saved for retirement . It 's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional or a 401(k ) plan representative for additional guidance on investing in a 401(k ) plan .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "A ranked voting system is a way of casting and counting votes in an election where voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference . Instead of just choosing one candidate , voters can indicate their top choice , second choice , third choice , and so on . In a ranked voting system , if a candidate wins a majority of first - choice votes , they are declared the winner just like in a normal election . If no candidate wins a majority of first - choice votes , then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the voters ' next choice . This process is repeated until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winner . One advantage of range voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters , rather than just a plurality of voters . In a normal election , it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50 % of the vote if there are more than two candidates running . In a ranked voting system , this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least popular candidate can be redistributed to the voters ' next choice . As for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the two - party system , it 's crucial to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity . However , ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third - party candidates or independent candidates to win elections . Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference , they can choose to support a third - party candidate as their first choice while still expressing a preference for one of the Major party candidates as their second choice . This could make it more likely that a third - party candidate could win an election , or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Hey , Ph . D here working on light induced degradation ( LID ) in solar cells . Essentially , you need to think of the efficiency of a solar cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy . Now in the body of the solar cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected . These include metallic impurities ( Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole ( which we call charge carriers ) . The more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency . So what happens out in the field over time ? There are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread . We also have a few such as PID ( potential induced degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours . Now this problem has largely been solved . There are a few other known elements that can cause degradation under sunlight , i.e copper ( which can form precipitates ) and Hydrogen , etc etc ..", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies .

{"text": "A program is just a bunch of very simple instructions for doing something . A programming language lets you say how to do something complicated in terms of several simple steps \u2014 including steps that are repeated ( \" loops \" ) and steps where you might decide which of two or more things to do ( \" conditionals \" ) . For instance , suppose you are programming a little robot that can move around on a piece of paper . The robot has a pen in its belly , so it draws a line wherever it goes . You would like to get the robot to draw a square . But all it knows how to do is * go forward or back by some number of inches * , and * turn left or right by some number of degrees * . So you have to tell it how to make a square out of those moves . You might write a program like this : to draw_a_square forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 end If the robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and ended up back where it started . This is , in fact , a program in the language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which used to be very popular for teaching programming to grade school students . You can find the Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that you can use repeated steps ? You can use these to make a program shorter , like this : to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That 's a lot shorter than the earlier program , but it does the same thing . It 's shorter because instead of repeating instructions ourselves , we tell the robot to repeat doing them . Programs can also take inputs , for instance , telling how big the square should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward : size right 90 ] end Or , even , instead of a square , we could draw an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon : sides : size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 / : sides ) ] end So , programs can repeat themselves and they can do different things based on their inputs . They can also control different parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to the speakers or communicating with other programs over the network . But the basic steps of any program are based on making decisions and doing things repeatedly .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Your credit card limit is nothing more than a simple number .   When you purchase something , the merchant receives a number ( i.e. the amount of the transaction ) from your card company ( e.g. Visa ) in their bank account , and that number is subtracted from your limit ( added to your balance ) . The amount is recorded , and is n't changed , so that 's how they get the \" exact \" amount you paid .   Transferring a number is easier than the retailer having to wait for cash to get from you to your card company to them .   Moving numbers around is the basis of the modern financial system . And yes , it is always a risk to let someone else have your credit card number .   An untrustworthy company / person may use it to charge you without your permission , or if they have your full-of-the-moon details they could use it as if they were you .   With a reputable retailer like Amazon , the main risk is data theft : If a security hole is found in Amazon 's system , someone could steal your credit card info and misuse it .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Horsepower is a unit of measurement that describes how much power an engine has . It 's like a way of comparing how strong different engines are . \r \r  Cars have different amounts of horsepower because they have different size engines and use different types of fuel . Some engines are bigger , which means they have more room for fuel and air to mix , which creates more power . Some engines are also made with special materials or designs that make them more efficient at turning fuel into power . \r \r  To determine the exact number of horsepower for an engine , engineers use a machine called a dynamometer . They put the engine on the dynamometer and run it at different speeds to see how much power it produces . \r \r  Manufacturers make some engines more powerful than others by using bigger engines , special materials or designs , or by adding extra parts like turbochargers or superchargers , which can help the engine produce more power . \r \r  So in short , horsepower is a way of measuring how strong an engine is , and manufacturers can make some engines more powerful than others by using different materials , designs , and parts .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

In China , the government has tried to use communism to help reduce poverty and increase equality , but there are still many people who are poor and struggling to get by . This is partly because it can be difficult to fairly distribute resources and wealth when the government is in control of everything .

{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "They 're not loopholes . That 's just a propaganda word people use to confuse things . There are basically two different things that people sometimes erroneously call loopholes : There are tax deductions , and then there are standard accounting practices . A tax deduction is anything that you can * spend * money on that * reduces * your taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ 100,000 in a year . You spend a quarter of that , let 's say , on * stuff * , stuff like your mortgage and food and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 at the end of the year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your tax rate is a flat 10 % of your taxable income , and your taxable income is everything you make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of that is $ 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe the government $ 10,000 , out of the $ 75,000 you have on hand . But the government allows you to * deduct * charitable contributions from your nonexempt income . Meaning anything you give to charity is * subtracted from * your taxable income for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to your local soup kitchen , let 's say . That $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income just $ 50,000 , rather than $ 100,000 . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced your tax bill from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 , which is only 5 % of your gross income . Some people just look at the last sentence \u2014 you only paid 5 % of your gross income in taxes \u2014 and think that 's unfair , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we give tax deductions * hoping people will take advantage of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people to do certain things with their money , things like give to charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are just standard accounting practices . One thing that 's been in the news kind of recently is the question of personal income from hedge fund managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does n't get paid a salary ; instead , he gets a percentage of the profits the hedge fund makes under his management . Makes sense , right ? You 're tying the manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's gain , all his income is taxed at the capital gains tax rate of 15 % , not at the income tax rate of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole , but that 's just propaganda . Accounting for your income that way is what you 're * supposed to do . * It 's not a cheat . It 's how the system is set up . We can talk about whether the system * should be * set up that way or not , but the fact is that * is * how the system is set up , and the hedge fund manager who reports his income as capital gain is following the rules . If he did it any * other * way he 'd be * breaking * the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they 're almost certainly talking about things that are built into the system for good reason and which people do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does * not * imply that people are cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so you can get mad at those dirty cheats \u2026 who are in reality just doing exactly and nothing other than what the tax code tells them they 're supposed to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'll attempt to be concise and simple in my response . Qualification : Senior at the University of Michigan double majoring in Psychology and Biological Sciences . First , let 's talk briefly about the nervous and endocrine system . As information in your surrounding environment is perceived with your senses , it 's transformed into neural signals . Depending on the importance of the information determines whether or not your autonomic nervous system ( automatic part of your nervous system ) activates your body 's fear response . Just because it 's labeled as a fear response does n't necessarily mean you 're afraid . Even happy emotions are products of your body 's nervous system response . The underlying theme here is your body becomes AROUSED . Next , your sympathetic nervous system ( a division of your autonomic nervous system responsible for arousal ) begins preparing your body by signaling other organs to release hormones through your bloodstream . For example , your adrenal glands located directly above your kidneys release epinephrine and norepinephrine . Furthermore , various organs release aid hormones . Your nervous system increases neural firing and dumps extra neurotransmitters in your brain to prepare for the potential stressor . As a result , your heart rate increases , you perspire at greater rates , you salivate less , and above all , blood from internal organs especially your stomach ( digestion becomes less important to your body 's needs ) moves away to aid your muscles . As a result , the lower blood delivery to your stomach is responsible for the subjective feeling of emotion in your stomach . The sense of being \" sick \" to your stomach after sad events , butterflies when you see a cute girl , or feeling nauseous thinking about an upcoming exam are all rooted in the body 's automatic fear response . Keep in mind the response is so sensitive that just thinking about something stressful can trigger it .

You can apply for a credit card from a bank or credit card company . Keep in mind that you may need to provide proof of income and a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ( ITIN ) to apply . Use your credit card wisely : To build a good credit history , it 's important to use your credit card responsibly . This means making timely payments and not exceeding your credit limit . Paying your bills on time is particularly important , as payment history is a major factor in your credit score . Consider a secured credit card : If you have difficulty getting approved for a traditional credit card , you may be able to get a secured credit card . With a secured credit card , you deposit money into an account as collateral and are then given a credit line equal to the amount of your deposit . As you use the card and make timely payments , your credit score will improve . Use utility bills to your advantage : If you have a utility bill in your name ( such as for electricity , gas , or water ) , you can ask the company to report your payment history to the credit bureaus . This can help you build a credit history , as long as you make timely payments . Rent a home or apartment : If you rent a home or apartment , you can ask the landlord to report your rental payment history to the credit bureaus .

Pretty much any time , day or night , if you said to yourself \" I am going to go pee , even though I do n't need to , \" you would manage to pee at least something . Your stool , unlike your urine , is based on the food that you eat . You eat food in short time segments , in between which are long periods of not - eating . The food you eat has a VERY long path to travel from your mouth to your bowel , so long that when you pass stool , it is probably from food you ate the day before . Since food passes through your digestive tract slowly , the somebody food - remains stay separated , and the urge to pass each stool only arises when the fecal matter comes into the area of the anal sphincter , which your brain interprets as a need to use the toilet . The release of stool and the release of urine both require relaxing sphincters in your pelvic region . So when you need to poo , it is simply convenient also to pee ( as you are pretty much guaranteed to have urine waiting to be expelled ) .

{"text": "The International Space Station ( ISS ) orbits the Earth in a path that is shaped like a slightly squashed circle , or an oval . This is because the ISS is being pulled towards the Earth by the Earth 's gravity , but it is also moving very fast . When an object moves very fast , it is harder for gravity to pull it down , so it follows a curved path instead of falling straight down .   To stay in orbit , the ISS has to keep moving at a specific speed and altitude . If it slows down or drops too low , it will fall back to Earth . If it speeds up or climbs too high , it will fly off into space . To maintain its orbit , the ISS uses thrusters , which are small engines that produce a jet of gas to push against . By firing the thrusters , the ISS can adjust its speed and direction to stay in its desired orbit .   In the attached image , you can see a diagram of the ISS 's orbit around the Earth . The curved line shows the path that the ISS follows as it orbits the Earth . The Earth is at the center of the diagram , and the ISS is shown as a small blue dot moving around it .

{"text": "The long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history into this explanation which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts without learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on to the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very clear answers for addressing the faults . His basic plan was that industrialized nations should move to socialism , and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain later why no communist country actually followed his plan . One of Marx and Engels arguments was that prior to industrialization , we produced not much more than we used . Obviously there was trade but for the most part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines come along and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author of Wealth of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a product , you might have 10 who accomplish different portions of the task . This made production go way up . What Marx criticized was the effect of having such a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the good decreases because the supply is so high . This required two things , one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition who , through free market competition , lower prices . The second was that you had to find new markets . Given the world at the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods . So the more markets that opened up the more needed to be produced . Marx believed that workers standard of living decreased as people were moved into the cities to meet the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of owning your own land or home , you lived in worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private land ownership ( understatement , his summation of Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not by the family . If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the local land . Back to industrialization , this is the period of time where we find child labor , a lack of labor laws , unions , or anyone fighting for the workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . The first was the bourgeois ( boor - zhwa ) who had the capital ( the money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name basically means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was the proletariat . These are the workers in the factories and on the farms . Their standard of living is so low that they can only afford to survive . The name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the ones who are actually doing the work and producing the goods , yet they are treated the worst and receive little of the profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers ruled . He argued for labor unions to protect themselves from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to lose their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these conditions \" well then the managers and owners would have to listen . They ca n't do the work on their own , they require a large number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , or strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than it cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx said , was the result of industrialization and the drive for profit it produced . He stated that we stopped producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is increased , demand is decreased , and the price decreases . This is not good news for the worker as this cycle feeds back on itself , and ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Which means bigger engines and higher fuel use , leaving less space for , y'know , stuff like weapons and crew accommodations and such . The maximum size is very small . It 's the square cube law , double the size and the foils can lift 4x as much ( wings have doubled in length and width ) but they now have to lift a boat weighing 8x as much ( hull has doubled in length , width , and height ) . It does n't take long before the hydrofoils become too big to be practical . That means it 's hard to dock them , they ca n't go in shoal water , resupply at sea is awful , etc . They 're often unstable and usually give a very rough ride , which is bad both for the crew and also the sensors / weapons ( and maintenance ) . So you really want to keep them in sheltered waters ( waves are bad for many types ) . But sheltered waters are usually shallow , which of course is doom to hydrofoils . Conventional small craft like the CB90 will happily do 35 kts , and can zoom through very shallow and restricted waters , right up onto a beach to deliver troops . Wave piercing catamarans will do 45 kts in the open ocean . A surface effect ship like the Skjold will do 60 kts , but again does n't have the super deep draft or hydrofoils sticking out either side , and AFAICT burns less fuel . But a hydrofoil patrol boat will do , what , 45kts ? A lot of small craft do best with the conventional design , because they 're great for riverine / amphibious warfare supporting landing teams . If you need extreme speed , you want a surface effect design . And if you want something bigger than ~400 tons , you 're looking for a wave piercer , which can do hydrofoil speeds at 4000 tons . And if you really need to get somewhere fast , we have aircraft .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Microsoft 's explanation of MIRR ( Modified Internal Rate of Return ) is a financial function that is used to calculate the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows , taking into account the fact that the investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at a different rate than the original cost of the investment . The MIRR function calculates the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows , taking into account the fact that the investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at a different rate than the original cost of the investment . It does this by using the following formula : MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range of cells that contain the series of payments and investments associated with the investment . \"finance_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate the future value of the cash flows . The MIRR function is useful for comparing the returns on different investments , as it takes into account the fact that the reinvestment rate may be different from the financing rate . It is also useful for evaluating the profitability of investments with irregular cash flows , such as those that involve the sale of assets or the repayment of loans . Example : Suppose you are considering investing $ 100,000 in a project that is expected to generate the following cash flows over the succeeding 5 years : Year 1 : $ 20,000Year 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 50,000Year 5 : $ 60,000The financing rate on the investment is 10 % , and the reinvestment rate is 8 % . You can use the MIRR function to calculate the internal rate of return on the investment as follows:=MIRR(A1 : A5 , 10 % , 8%)This would return a result of approximately 12.63 % , indicating that the investment is expected to generate a return of approximately 12.63 % per year . I hope this helps clarify Microsoft 's explanation of MIRR . Let me know if you have any other questions .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Lepton is a data compression algorithm developed by Dropbox , a company that provides on-line storage and file sharing services . Data compression is a technique used to reduce the size of a file or a piece of data , making it easier and more efficient to store , transmit , and process . The \" middle - out \" part of Lepton refers to the way the algorithm works : it first identifies and removes redundancies from the middle of the data , and then works its way outwards to compress the rest of the data . This approach is different from other data compression algorithms , which often start at the beginning or the end of the data and work their way towards the middle . To understand how Lepton works , let 's use a simple example . Imagine you have a list of words that you want to compress . Lepton would first look for repeating words or patterns in the middle of the list , and then represent those repetitions with a shorter code . For example , if the word \" the \" appears 10 times in the middle of the list , Lepton might replace all of those instances with a code like \" t10 \" . This would save some space , because the code \" t10 \" is shorter than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times . Once Lepton has compressed the middle of the list , it would then work its way outwards , looking for to_a_greater_extent opportunities to compress the data . For example , it might look for repeating words or patterns at the beginning and end of the list , and replace them with shorter codes as well . I hope this helps !

{"text": "Usually when you delete a file on a HDD the data is n't actually deleted . Instead , the drive is just told that the area where the data is stored is n't crucial anymore and it can be written over . If you keep using the HDD , it will eventually overwrite the old data , but the data will remain on the drive until then . Your operating system tells you that the space on the disk is unblock because it 's available to use for storage whenever you need it , but the computer is n't going to go changing the data until you have something else to store there . You can use a file shredder to clear the data out , but most people do n't do that . Additionally , HDDs use a magnetic field to store information . A strong field indicates a 1 and a weak field indicates a 0 . However , magnetic fields are n't binary and with a lot of work you can sometimes figure out what deleted data was based on the strength of the magnetic fields that remain . Edit : You ca n't actually recover any meaningful data this way . On older , less dense magnetic storage media it may have been a possibility , but that 's not the case with any relatively modern HDD . The idea comes from a guy named Gutmann who wrote a paper on it in 1996 . It would have been hard to do then and Gutmann himself has said it would be next to impossible these days . It works differently with internal SSDs . Those usually clear the data out after it 's deleted because and SSD can only store data in an empty spot .

They had a large population and needed the land more than a few measly farmers . The farmers recognized they were greatly outnumbered and called in assistance from the Australian Government . They sent in military aid in the form of a handful of soldiers and automatic weapons . The Gods showed kindness to the Emus and sent rain , slowing the soldiers down for a bit . On November 2nd the Great Emu war began . Soldiers set up a firing line , but because the Emus are so cunning they recognized this and stayed outside of the effective firing range of the enemy soldiers weapons . Local farmers were sent out to try and lure the Emus into the ambush , but the Emus knew the trap and broke down into small herds / teams to make themselves more difficult to target . Unfortunately nearly a dozens Emus lost their lives that day . On November 4th the Australian soldiers were able to successfully set up a ambush near the local dam , a place where Emus went to refresh themselves with drink and bathe . The Gods once again smiled upon the Emus , no more than 12 fell that day before the coward Australian soldier guns jammed , stopping their assault and giving the Emus time to escape . Various mistakes on the soldiers part gave great help to the Emus being able to outlast their opponents . On November 8th the Emus were able to successfully push back the Australians after a battle of attrition . The Australians wasted numerous resources on this engagement for little results . Because of their victory the Emus were embolden , and began attacking crops , they were looking to make the local farmers pay for their collaboration with the Australian soldiers . They came in the thousands , tearing up the country side . Once again in fear the farmers begged the government for assistance , after a 4 days rest on November 12th the Australian Government began military action once again . This time the Emus did not fair well , by December 2nd they were faced with a thousand dead and thousands more wounded and presumed dead . Since the end of the Great Emu war the Emus never once forgot the death and destruction that was inflicted upon them . Every few years the farmers go back to their government requesting assistance , the Emus are waging guerrilla warfare , coming out and attacking then retreating back .

{"text": "What honey badger something said : \" It 's when electoral districts are redrawn in order to favor a specific party or candidate based on demographics . \" And check out [ the wikipedia article ] ( URL_2 ) . ------------------ Imagine a pretend 51st state in the US . We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as potential ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 Representative spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts / Representatives and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fairly person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet tall then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Bitcoin is much like a digital form of gold . In order to mine gold , you need to spend time and money to collect the ore and refine it . However , with Bitcoin , you need to solve a difficult math problem and the post the proof of it . Once you do that , you lay claim to that particular amount of Bitcoin and it is yours to keep or spend . The math problems increase in difficulty , so you need a more and more powerful computer ( and more time ) to solve them as time goes on . This difficulty is what gives Bitcoin its value . Once you have Bitcoin , you can transfer it around as a legitimate form of money , and trade it for other currencies , such as the US dollar . Bitcoin is also an untraceable form of money , much like cash . As such , it is used by the Silk Road Marketplace for selling illegal products . This is a greatly simplified explanation , but it should give you a introductory idea of how Bitcoin works .", "label": "hc3human"}

For example , if you do n't know someone very well , or if you 're unsure about what they would like , a gift card allows them to pick out something that they will really enjoy . \r \r  Another reason people buy gift cards is that they are convenient . You can buy them online or in stores , and they are easy to wrap and give as a present . \r \r  There are also some benefits to using gift cards for the person receiving them . For example , if you have a gift card to a store that you like , you can use it to buy something that you might not have been able to afford otherwise . Gift cards can also be used to save money , because you can wait for sales or discounts to use them . \r \r  Overall , gift cards are a convenient and flexible gift option that allow the recipient to choose what they want and save money at the same time .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "It 's very , very uncommon to find complete , intact dinosaur skeletons . Here 's one example , [ the renowned Archaeopteryx skeleton ] ( URL_2 ) . Most of the time you find incomplete skeletons with all the bones jumbled up , or just scattered individual fossil bones . Without a complete skeleton that 's still got everything in place , you look at all the individual bones found at a given site and try to figure out which ones are from the same animal and how they fit together . This process used to be very difficult-- we ' ve gotten better at it over time , mostly because we ' ve found more intact skeletons to use as models , and partly because we now have better technological tools to help analyze and sort fossils . The brontosaurus controversy came about because a pair of 19th century paleontologists were racing to see who could classify the most dinosaur species , and one of them got sloppy . [ Othniel Charles Marsh ] ( URL_0 ) put together a skeleton from a bunch of [ sauropod ] ( URL_1 ) bones and called the newfangled species * brontosaurus * .

{"text": "These systems are so useful , that many governments do n't want to be restricted to something that is controlled by a foreign government . For example , GPS is a military system run by the US Navy . They could , if they wanted to , shut it off or degrade it . The Russians were n't happy with relying on a US military system , given that there is a lot of disagreement between Russia and America , so they built their own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe , the EU government were concerned that they were relying on a foreign military system for a lot of commercial and government work . They were also annoyed that GPS only made a crude signal available for the public and law enforcement , but the military got a much high precision signal . So , the EU government decided to build their own system ( Galileo ) which would give an improved accuracy free public signal , and a premium signal ( with paid subscription ) which would give the same accuracy as the GPS military signal . It would also be optimized for use in Europe . GPS satellites do n't really orbit over the Arctic region , so GPS reception in places like North Norway or Northern Sweden is not very reliable . The Galileo satellites are intended to go into orbits which go much further North , but the disadvantage is that you need more satellites to cover the increased amount of land . Same sort of thing with IRNSS ( India ) and BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all these systems you broadly the same technology but on slightly dissimilar frequencies . This means your receiver needs to have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the different systems . Dual system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been available for a while - they were n't terribly pop initially because the GLONASS system has been very unreliable with satellites dying or malfunctioning and not being replaced . However , the Russians have repaired and updated their GLONASS satellites , and it 's now a good quality modern system , so most latest generation GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS signal as well . One of the advantages of a receiver which supports both systems is that it is possible to get a more accurate position because you can combine the measurements from both systems when the receiver does the final position calculation . The Galileo system is n't complete , in fact , it is n't really functional , as it does n't have decent satellites to work 24/7 . However , many new GPS receivers are \" Galileo ready \" which means that they have the antenna and circuits in place , but the firmware to process the signals has n't been finalized . Once enough satellites are up and working , the manufacturer of the receiver will be able to test their firmware , and then once tested and working will be make it available for download .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Trade - in values are generally below what you can get in a private sale . To directly answer your question , you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle . I would encourage you to use the $ 9k to finance directly without a lease , especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term . The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case , and worse , will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease ( mileage , wear and tear , etc ) Best option mathematically is to use the $ 9k to purchase a vehicle for cash . This provides the lowest total cost of ownership .   Even if you are afraid of purchasing a lemon , leasing a vehicle is awfully expensive insurance against that possibility . You would have to rack up some significant repairs to justify the cost of the lease vs cash over the term of operating the vehicle .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Sure ! To communicate with a spacecraft that is far away , like the Rosetta spacecraft which traveled more than 300 million miles away from Earth , we use special radio antennas on Earth to send signals to the spacecraft , and the spacecraft uses its own antenna to send signals back to Earth .   The radio signals travel through space and are received by the antenna on the spacecraft or on Earth . The signals can contain information , such as commands for the spacecraft to perform sure tasks or data that the spacecraft has collected .   To make sure the signals are strong enough to reach the spacecraft , we use very powerful radio transmitters on Earth and very sensitive receivers on the spacecraft . We also use special techniques to make sure the signals are not interrupted or distorted by interference from other sources , like former radio signals or objects in space .
