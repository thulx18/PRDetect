{"text": "There are are a few ways that we can determine the distance to to stars stars and and other objects in in the universe . One One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax Parallax is the the apparent apparent shift in the position of an an object object against against the background background when when viewed from from different angles . For example , if you hold hold your your finger up in front of of you you and and close close one eye , then then open that eye eye and and close close the other eye , your your finger finger will appear appear to move move against the background . This is because you you are looking at it it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the the distance to to nearby stars . By measuring the the apparent shift in the the position of of a star star against against the background of more distant distant stars ( as viewed from from opposite sides sides of Earth 's orbit around around the sun ) , we can calculate calculate how how far away the the star is is . This This method method is most most accurate accurate for for stars that are are relatively relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more distant distant objects , such such as quasars quasars and galaxies , we use use other methods methods to determine their distance distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which which involves using a series series of \" rungs rungs \" or steps to to measure measure the distance to to increasingly increasingly distant distant objects . Each Each rung rung of the ladder relies on on a different different type type of \" standard candle , \" which is is an object that is is known known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By By measuring the brightness brightness of the object as as seen from from Earth Earth , we can determine determine its distance . For example example , one one type type of of standard candle candle that we use use is is a type of star star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the the time between between pulses is is directly related related to the the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring measuring the time between between pulses , we we can determine the the star 's 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we we have have determined determined the distance to a Cepheid Cepheid variable , we can can use it it as a \" rung rung \" on the cosmic cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance distance to to other objects that that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the the distance to nearby nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the the distance to to even more distant distant galaxies . This way , we we can can build up up a \" ladder \" of distances distances that reaches reaches all the way out to the the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

This can can be achieved achieved using the the principles principles of quantum mechanics , which is a branch branch of of physics that that studies studies the behavior behavior of particles particles at very small small scales scales , such as atoms and and subatomic particles . To To understand understand how quantum levitation works works , it helps to think about a magnet magnet . Magnets have north and south poles poles , and and opposite poles poles attract each other while while similar similar poles repel each other . This This is because because of the the magnetic magnetic field that that surrounds a magnet magnet . Now imagine a superconductor superconductor , which is is a material that can can conduct conduct electricity electricity with zero resistance resistance . When a superconductor superconductor is placed placed in a strong magnetic field field , it is able able to \" float \" above above the magnet due to to the repelling forces between between the the two . This is known known as the Meissner effect effect . Quantum levitation works in a similar way , but instead instead of using using a magnet magnet and a superconductor , it it uses a superconductor and a surface with with a pattern pattern of of magnetic field . When the superconductor superconductor is is cooled to a very low temperature , it becomes becomes a superconductor and is is able to \" float \" above the surface surface due to the repelling forces between the two . So to sum it it up , quantum quantum levitation levitation is the result result of the the repelling repelling forces between a superconductor and a surface with a pattern of magnetic field , caused caused by by the the Meissner effect effect .

It It is is a number number that tells tells us us how how many atoms atoms or molecules are are in a certain amount of a substance . For For example example , let 's 's say we have a substance substance called \" sugar . \" If If we have one mole of of sugar sugar , that means we have 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 molecules of of sugar . This This number is known as Avogadro 's 's number , and it is the same for any any substance substance . So , if we want to convert between between mass , mole , and and molecule , we can use use Avogadro Avogadro 's 's number to to help help us us . For For example example , let 's say we have 10 grams grams of sugar sugar . We can use Avogadro 's number to to convert this to moles by by dividing the mass by the the molecular molecular weight of the sugar sugar . The molecular molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 342.3 g / mol , so so 10 grams grams of sugar is equal equal to to 0.0292 moles moles of sugar .

If you have $ X income in in State State A where you claim nonresident status and $ Y income overall , then you you owe State A a fraction ( X / Y ) of of the the income tax that that would would have been due on $ Y income had you been a resident of of State A. In In other other words , compute the state income tax on on $ Y as as per State State A rules , and send send us us ( X / Y ) of that that amount . If If you are are a resident of of State State B , then then State B will tax you you on $ Y but but give you you some some credit for taxes paid to State A. A. Thus , you might might be required to file a State A income tax tax return regardless of how small $ X is . As a practical matter matter , many many commercial real - estate estate investments are set up as limited partnerships in in which most most of the annual taxable taxable income income is a small small amount of portfolio income ( usually interest income that that you report on Schedule Schedule B of Form Form 1040 1040 ) , and and the annual bottom line is is lots lots of passive losses which the limited partners report ( but do not get to to deduct ) on the Federal return return . As As a result result , State A is is unlikely to come after you for the tax tax on on , say say , $ 100 of interest income income each each year because it will will cost them more to go after you than than they will recover from you . But But , when the real estate is sold , there there will ( hopefully hopefully ) be be a big capital gain , most most of which will be sheltered from Federal tax since the the passive passive losses finally get to be deducted . At this point point , State State A is not only owed owed a lot of money ( it it knows knows nothing nothing of of your passive losses losses etc ) but , after it processes the the income income tax return that that you filed for that year year , it will will likely likely demand that you file income tax tax returns returns for previous years as well well .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the the world world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most most humans would recognize recognize were were silver silver and and gold gold . Gold can be found found as as \" nuggets \" or \" dust dust \" . The processes processes that bring it to the the surface tends to to deposit deposit it it in veins so that if if you you find some , you you 're likely to find more more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into into rivers , so finding finding gold means means finding a river with some gold gold or silver silver in it , and then then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold gold without without heat heat . It It is \" malleable \" at room temperature , which means you can can whack whack on on it with hammers to change the the shape shape of a lump lump of gold and and bend it with tongs - and and even though it it is malleable it it wo n't lose its its new shape once you finish working it and that that means means you can can make useful things . Gold Gold will will not not hold an edge so it is useless as as a blade blade . It is much much denser than most other other materials so it would make a good club , but but you do n't n't get much more more head head - bashing advantage with a gold cub cub than you would with stone or even wood wood . So So other than as as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical practical \" use \" to an an ancient human . But But it is is pretty pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" next next to to human skin tones . Why Why this is so is is pretty much much a mystery . But it 's 's obvious that people found found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people people . In the ancient ancient world \" rich \" was defined defined as \" do n't n't have have to farm farm \" . There were only three three kinds kinds of people like that that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals generals . Since Since gold was was in limited limited supply supply - but there there was enough enough of of it it that people would recognize recognize it and value value it it , and it was was n't n't good good for for any any practical practical use , and as a metal it it would would \" stay all in in one place \" and did n't n't have to be kept in jars or or otherwise contained contained , it it became a way for rich people people to display their their wealth . Gold Gold is pretty easy to purify and and to to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That That means that that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed fixed amount of gold gold , of of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some some number of sheep sheep or sheaves sheaves of of wheat , or or slaves , or or land , or whatever . It became became a unit of currency due to to intrinsic properties properties convenient for for anyone to access access - all all I need is a scale , a cup cup , some water water , and a little math and and I can can figure figure out how much your gold is is worth to me me . 5,000 years years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it it with with a certain advantage vs. other other similar metals metals . Nobody wants to exchange exchange plutonium coins coins , even though plutonium plutonium is worth , ounce for ounce ounce , vastly more than gold gold .

{"text": "About About 10 years years ago , I used to use MetaStock Trader Trader which which was was a very very sound tool tool , with a large large number number of indicators , but it has has been been a number of years since I have used used it it , so so my my comments on it will be out of date . At At the time time it relied upon me purchasing trading data myself myself , which is is why I switched to Incredible Charts Charts . I currently currently use use Incredible Incredible Charts Charts which I have done for for a number of years years , initially initially on the free adware adware service , now on on the $ 10 / year for EOD data access access . There There are quicker quicker levels levels of data access , which might might suit you you , but I ca ca n't n't comment on these . It is web - based which is is key for me . The data quality quality is is very very good and the the number of inbuilt indicators is excellent . You can build search routines on the basis of specific indicators which is very very effective . I 'm 'm looking at at VectorVest , as a replacement replacement for ( or in addition addition to ) Incredible Incredible Charts Charts , as as it has very powerful backtesting routines and and the ability to to run run test portfolios with specific specific buy / sell sell criteria criteria that can simulate and backtest a number of trading trading scenarios at at the same same time . The advantage of all all of these is they are are not tied tied to to a particular particular broker .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Horsepower Horsepower is is a unit unit of measurement that that describes how much power an engine has . It 's like like a way of of comparing comparing how how strong different engines engines are are . Cars have different amounts amounts of horsepower because they have different size engines and use different types of fuel fuel . Some engines engines are bigger , which means they have more room room for for fuel and air air to mix , which which creates creates more power . Some engines are also made with special special materials materials or designs that that make make them more efficient efficient at turning turning fuel into into power power . To determine determine the exact number number of horsepower for for an an engine , engineers use a machine machine called a dynamometer . They put the engine engine on on the the dynamometer and and run it it at different speeds to see see how how much power power it produces . Manufacturers make some engines more powerful than others by using using bigger bigger engines engines , special materials materials or designs , or or by adding extra extra parts like like turbochargers or or superchargers , which which can help help the engine engine produce produce more more power . So in short , horsepower is a way way of of measuring measuring how how strong an engine is , and manufacturers can can make some engines engines more more powerful than others by using different different materials , designs , and parts .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Yes Yes , it it is is possible possible that that the color you you call red is is different from from the color color that I call red . This is because the way way we we perceive perceive colors colors can be influenced influenced by by a variety of factors , including the the type type of lighting we are in , the the colors that are are around us , and and even our own personal experiences and associations associations with different different colors . For example , imagine imagine that you are are standing standing in a room with with bright bright red walls . If I were to show you a picture of a tomato tomato and ask you to describe its its color , you you might say say \" red \" because because the tomato tomato 's color is similar similar to the color of of the the walls walls . However However , if I were standing in a room with white white walls and showed showed you you the same picture picture of a tomato , I might describe its color as \" orange \" because the tomato 's color would appear differently to to me me in the different different lighting lighting . So , while while we we may both use use the same word to to describe describe a color , we we might be perceiving perceiving that color color differently based on on our our own individual individual experiences experiences and surroundings .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "diamonds diamonds are intrinsically intrinsically worthless this is simply wrong . ( 1 ) Diamonds that that are sold for anything less less than , oh , let 's 's say $ 5000 at original original retail - are indeed utterly , totally , completely worthless . It is simply \" one of of the great great scams scams \" . Their real real \" price price \" is is maybe \" five bucks bucks \" . End of story story . There is is no no secondary market . Literally - \" end end of of story story \" . If you buy a \" diamond \" lol lol for \" $ 2000 \" to impress your loved one , you can not not then \" sell sell it \" for any amount of money . It It is : worthless . Once again : simple , undeniable undeniable fact . the diamond diamond you you bought for 2 grand grand can not be resold . Ir Ir 's 's worthless . ( OK , maybe you can can get 100 bucks for it , something like that . Or , you can scam someone clueless , and get 200 bucks bucks . ) ( 2 ) However actual actual \" investment \" stones do in fact fact have a value value - if somewhat fragile . Example , a few years ago I sold sold a stone for 30 30 thousand . That was a \" real \" price and and it was was quite liquid liquid - I was within days able to find find a buyer buyer . ( A dealer - he would would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever . ) I have have never dealt dealt in in stones over six figures , but I 'm fairly certain certain those are \" real \" valuable objects : just just like paintings paintings by name artists . ( However : yes , the the line between \" laughable laughable diamonds \" and actual investment stones , is indeed moving moving ever upwards . ) ( Note - the the \" elephant in the room room \" with diamonds is that that GE 's 's industrial process for simply making utterly flawless flawless diamonds , starting with with carbon carbon , is is getting better every decade decade . ) ( A second overwheleming point point that nobody nobody has mentioned mentioned : diamonds get get beat - up up . Regarding \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" , a used one one is exactly exactly as as useless useless as a used car car . It It 's crap . Just Just as with $ 200,000 picassos , this concept does does not apply to \" actual investment stones \" . ) Note that many many of the the comments / arguments on on this page page are very very confused confused because : people are not not distinguishing between the ( ROFL ) \" engagement ring ring scam market \" and the the rarefied rarefied \" investment gem gem market \" . The two things are utterly different . Yes , \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" are an utter scam , and and are simply simply : \" worthless \" . The The fundamental fundamental , basic , overwhelming scam scam in in today 's business / social universe is : \" engagement diamonds \" . Yes , the price is is only due to marketing / monopolies etc . Elephant Elephant in in the room A : GE GE 's technology can - end of story story - manufacture diamonds . ( Starting with \" pencil leads \" . ) End End of story . It It 's 's all over . Elephant Elephant in the room B : folks forget that diamonds get beat - up , they they are just like like used cars . Regarding Regarding \" engagement - ring ring diamonds \" , nobody nobody has ever , or or will ever , bought a used used one . Simple , utterly undeniable fact : regarding regarding \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" . they they have : zero value . You can not not resell them . End End of story . If If you buy buy a house house , you can can resell it it . If you buy a car , you can resell it ( at at a spectacular spectacular loss ) . If you buy a picasso , you can can resell it ( almost always making a huge profit ) . If you you buy an \" engagement ring ring diamond \" , it is is worth : nothing nothing . Zero . Nada . strictly strictly regarding investment stones , which is a distinctly distinctly utterly different market . This market market has no connection , in any way , at all , even even vaguely , it is utterly unrelated , to \" engagement ring diamonds \" . You can in fact buy buy and sell sell these items items - very much like like say say \" art \" or \" mid century century antiques \" , and make make money money . This market just has utterly no connection connection to the whole \" engagement ring ring diamonds \" scam scam system . Say you you buy wine at the the supermarket , for 5 to 100 100 bucks a bottle bottle . If you think that the the \" wine \" thus bought bought , has a secondary market market , or you can invest in it it or something : you have lost lost your your mind . In In total contrast : Yes , although totally totally flakey , there is is indeed an \" investment wine wine market market \" which is is real and reasonable . I for example have have made some money in that . ( I have a great anecdote anecdote even - I had one one cellar of of wine in burgundy , which which could have been been sold for , say , 30 grand grand - but we drank drank it :) :) ) Again , the the ( somewhat somewhat bizarre ) actual market in investment investment wine wine , just has to \" buying wine wine in the supermarket \" . To further the analogy analogy : wine wine prices in the supermarket / your ( ROFL ) wine dealer , from 5 to 100 bucks , are just just : utterly utterly laughable . Utterly . Laughable . Much as folks sit sit around , and decide decide on \" label designs designs \" , they sit sit around , and and decide on \" price points \" . There is is , utterly utterly , no difference difference between between $ 5 and $ 100 grape grape juice juice rofl \" wine \" . The price difference is simply a marketing decision : at best best , you can think of it as as a Velbin Velbin good . ... exactly the the same applies applies to \" engagement ring diamonds diamonds \" .", "label": "hc3human"}

It 's a way way to describe describe how how different different the numbers numbers in in a set set are from each each other . Imagine you have a set set of of numbers numbers like this this : 3 , 7 , 9 , 13 13 . The The average average of these numbers numbers is is 8.5 . This means that that if you you added up up all the the numbers numbers and divided divided by by the the number of numbers , you would would get 8.5 . Now , let 's 's say you you have have another another set set of numbers : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The average of these numbers is 3 . This means means that if you you added up up all the numbers and and divided by by the number of of numbers numbers , you would get 3 . Even though the average of the first set of numbers is 8.5 8.5 and the average of the the second set set of numbers is 3 , the second set of of numbers numbers is less less spread out . In other other words words , the the numbers in in the the second second set set are closer closer together . Standard deviation is a way way to to measure how spread out a set of numbers is . A low standard deviation means means that that the numbers are are close together , while while a high high standard deviation deviation means means that the numbers are more more spread out out . Standard deviation deviation is is useful useful when you want want to to know how different the numbers in a set are from each other and and from the average .

At that point point , a spare drive drive in the system system , which had been been sitting there just waiting waiting for a failure , was was activated . Data automatically started moving to this spare drive drive from the other drives in in the pool pool . This happened while while I was happily asleep in in my bed bed . When When I got got in yesterday yesterday , I saw saw the failure . For For this particular particular pool , it would take about 24 hours for the array to rebuild itself itself , copying copying the data from from the other drives drives to the spare spare . I got into work about 15 minutes ago to take a look , and this is the status status : scan scan : resilver in progress progress since Mon Mar 10 07:07:38 07:07:38 2014 2014 45.1 45.1 T scanned scanned out out of 47.3 T at 520 M / s , 1h15 m to go 1.15 T resilvered , 95.25 % done done So , in a little more than an hour , I will walk into the computer computer room , and remove the failed failed drive .

{"text": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle principle is a principle in quantum mechanics mechanics that explains the fundamental fundamental limits of our our ability to to know certain things things about a particle particle , such as as its position and and momentum . It states that that the more precisely we know know the position position of of a particle particle , the the less precisely precisely we can know its momentum momentum , and vice versa versa . This is because because the the act of measuring one of these quantities affects the the other other . Imagine that you are trying trying to to measure measure the position and momentum of a ball . You can can use a ruler ruler to measure the position of of the ball by by seeing where where it it is on on the the ruler ruler . But if you want want to measure measure the momentum momentum of of the the ball , you might need to push push it or or throw throw it in in order to measure measure its its speed . However , the act act of pushing or throwing throwing the the ball ball will will change change its its momentum , so you ca n't n't get an an accurate measurement measurement of both the position and momentum of of the ball at at the same time . This This is similar similar to how how the Heisenberg Heisenberg uncertainty uncertainty principle principle works works in quantum mechanics . When we try to to measure the position position of a particle particle , we have have to interact interact with it it in some way way , and this interaction changes changes the particle particle 's 's momentum momentum . This This means that that we ca ca n't know know both the position position and momentum of of the the particle with with complete accuracy accuracy at at the the same same time time .

{"text": "Not exactly ELI5 but I 'll 'll do my best to to take a stab stab at at it with some pseudo code code . I ' m coming from from a Laravel / PHP PHP angle . Model : Items Items ; Controller : ItemController ; View : Shops The view view Shops Shops is merely a template for for lack of better term term . Basically we have a page page where we we are going to spit out the data for for a record in in our imaginary inventory . The page will have have a $ title , and an array $ data data . We will will get get our data from from the DB with with a model called called Items Items . Think of of this as a class that handles all all interaction interaction with with the the DB DB and and abstracts the the SQL implementation implementation away . Our Controller Controller titled titled ItemController will handle all business logic . If If $ title = Acme Co. Co. < title title > { { $ title } } < /title > = < title > Acme Acme Co. < /title > Now Now we we need need to to bring the item item into the view , right ? For simplicity we 'll just have two things in our array $ data . $ data['price ' ] and $ data['item_name ' ] . price shall shall be $ 20.00 and item_name shall be RC RC Car . Fancy Fancy . So our view is a very simple html page page with a title title and and a table table . < title > { { $ title title } } < /title > < table > < tr > < td > Product Product Name < /td > < td > { { $ data['item_name ' ] } } < /td /td > < /tr > < tr tr > < td > Price < d > < td > { { $ data['price ' ] } } < /td /td > < /tr > Now we we have the same thing but but parsed : < table table > < tr tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > RC Car < /td > < /tr > < tr tr > < td > Price Price < d > < td td > $ 20.00 20.00 < /td > < /tr > Now Now imagine if if $ data had several more indexes . We have one view view that we pass this data to . But But how do do we get the data data ? The The model model , right ? Well Well , yes and and no no . So a brief bit ; tying business business logic to to your view ( the the pretty pretty ) makes for a mess . It It 's like putting putting everything everything into a blender for for a beverage and then then not putting putting the lid on . When When it 's 's done done you then then swing swing it around to to really get get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles this this pairing . We have things called routes routes , so we we 're going going to to tell the application(website application(website ) to point to the the ItemController ItemController when the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show InventoryController@show ) ; So what what does does that that do ? Simple , really . In In our InventoryController InventoryController class we we have a method method called show show . All we 're 're doing is saying when when item is requested go go here if there is a parameter parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC RC car above had an i d of 0 . We 'd go to : URL_0 and and the example above would be rendered rendered . Controller Controller time ! InventoryController InventoryController extends extends Controller { public function show($id ) { //Item is is in our our auto auto load load . This This class is accessible app wide wide . $ data = Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Viewing Details Details for \" . data['item_name data['item_name ' ] ; //View is in in the same boat . Auto loaded loaded . return View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that that returns returns the the view above , just just like like before . Now Now though , we we 're going going to spice spice it up up ! We have another another product product . i d = 1 ; item_name item_name = \" RC Boat \" ; price price = \" $ 25.00 \" ; When we call to URL_1 guess guess what what ! Our application application automagically fills fills in the information for for the item matching the i d of 1 . Fancy ! Back Back to the ELI5 attempt : Automatic Automatic coloring books books and stencils = MVC MVC . ( kind of ) . Code Reuse Reuse ( stencils stencils ) is considered considered , for good reason reason , to to be be a sign of of a capable capable developer developer . We get get to to reuse the the same files files passing passing in only a parameter to to change change the outcome outcome . When we first called the page we we had an an i d of 0 . The RC RC Car was returned returned . Then we we simply changed the URL to have have a 1 which which returned returned the the RC Boat . Same files different page . In In a real world example we 'd probably have have a master page(coloring book book ) that that served as the main template for for all pages . This This would have our CSS , JS , and other other elements all centrally centrally located . MVC means you you no longer have to to update your pages individually to to change change something like like your your navigation or header . It It 's all all in in one spot . It means means no need need for for nasty database interaction spattered spattered all all over over your php php files . All of that that is handled in in your your database object . That is is a central concept concept . Centralized Centralized code code management and maintenance . I do n't think I quite quite hit the ELI5 ELI5 nail nail on the head , but I hope this this helps anyone that might might be confused . I know it took took me a bit to to figure out out this this MVC thing thing .", "label": "hc3human"}

There are a couple forms of of irony irony : Dramatic Dramatic irony irony is a situation in in which the audience audience knows something that a character does does not not . ( Juliet is is n't really dead . Romeo does does n't know that . ) This is typically used to to add to to the tension of a situation situation . Classical irony irony is the triumph of wit over hubris . We do n't typically associate associate this with irony irony anymore anymore , but any sort of parlor scene from from a detective story story is a good example . Verbal irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature . An intended meaning is is dramatically different different from from an expressed meaning meaning . This is is typically indicated by tone tone , gesture , and circumstance . Paralipsis Paralipsis ( talking about something something by saying you 're not talking about about it ) is the easiest easiest method of verbal verbal irony irony to to translate from from performance performance to written word word . Situational or cosmic cosmic irony irony is is when the the outcome of a series series of events events is is different from the the expected expected outcome outcome . For For instance instance , in in * The Wizard of Oz * all three of Dorothy Dorothy 's companions companions are are questing for a character trait they felt felt they lacked lacked and hoped to to receive receive from the the allegedly god - like Oz , who in fact lacks the traits the companions sought and would be unable to to grant those traits even if if he had them them himself because is is revealed revealed to to be a mere mortal . Had Had Oz been a god , he would still have have been been unable to to grant these these gifts gifts , but but the situational would have been elevated to the cosmic . Now satire uses these forms of irony , a context context of of entertainment entertainment and lightheartedness , and a tendency towards absurdity , to make the the serious ( Bill Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes of British British landlords to suffering during the Potato Potato Famine ) seem silly .

The The Supreme Court 's ruling on DOMA DOMA means that the federal government must now now recognize same same - sex marriages in the same way that it recognizes opposite - sex sex marriages .

Unlike standard feedforward neural neural networks , LSTM LSTM has feedback connections connections . Such a recurrent neural neural network network ( RNN RNN ) can process not only single data points ( such such as images ) , but but also entire sequences of of data ( such as speech or or video ) . For example , LSTM LSTM is is applicable to tasks tasks such such as as unsegmented , connected handwriting recognition , speech recognition recognition , machine translation , robot control control , video video games,[10 ] and healthcare.[11 ] The name of LSTM refers to the the analogy that a standard RNN has both \" long long - term memory \" and \" short - term term memory \" . The connection connection weights and biases biases in the network change once per per episode episode of training , analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic synaptic strengths store long - term memories memories ; the the activation patterns in the network change once per time - step , analogous analogous to how the moment - to to - moment change change in electric firing patterns in the the brain store short short - term memories.[12 memories.[12 ] The LSTM architecture aims to to provide a short - term term memory for for RNN that can last last thousands thousands of of timesteps , thus thus \" long short - term term memory memory \" . A common LSTM LSTM unit is composed composed of of a cell , an input input gate , an an output output gate[13 ] and a forget forget gate.[14 ] The cell remembers remembers values over arbitrary time time intervals and the the three gates gates regulate the flow flow of information information into and out of the cell . LSTM networks are well - suited to classifying , processing and making predictions based on time series data , since there can be lags of unknown duration between important important events in a time time series . LSTMs were developed to deal with the the vanishing gradient gradient problem[15 problem[15 ] that can can be be encountered when training traditional RNNs RNNs . Relative Relative insensitivity to gap length is an an advantage advantage of LSTM over over RNNs , hidden hidden Markov models and and other sequence sequence learning learning methods in numerous numerous applications.[citation needed needed ]", "label": "hc3human"}

So in in that respect , your vote vote is actually MORE important important . Because winning a state by 51 % usually gets you MORE than 51 % of the electoral college college votes . The reason reason you can win win the election while losing the the popular vote vote is because anything MORE than 51 % in a state state does n't get get you you any closer to to victory victory , since since you already get get all those electoral college votes .

{"text": "Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating the intrinsic value value of a stock by by examining its financial financial statements statements and other other company - specific factors . One financial metric that is is often often used in fundamental analysis is the the price - to - earnings earnings - to - growth ( PEG ) ratio ratio . The PEG ratio ratio is calculated by dividing dividing the the price price - to - earnings ( P / E ) ratio by by the the company company 's expected earnings growth rate . The P / E ratio ratio is is a measure of the price of of a stock stock relative to its its earnings per share . It is is calculated by by dividing the current current market price of the stock stock by the company 's 's earnings per per share ( EPS EPS ) . The PEG ratio is used to evaluate whether a stock stock is is overvalued or undervalued based on on its price and earnings growth . For example , if a company has a P / E ratio of 20 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10 % , its its PEG ratio ratio would be 2 . A PEG ratio of less than 1 is generally considered considered undervalued , while a PEG ratio greater than 1 is considered overvalued . There There are several limitations to using using the PEG ratio as a sole measure of a stock 's value value . It It is based based on future future earnings growth estimates , which which are are inherently uncertain and subject to to change change . Additionally , the PEG ratio does not take into into account other factors that can affect affect a company company 's 's value , such such as its debt levels , market conditions conditions , and competitive landscape .

These include metallic metallic impurities ( Iron Iron , chromium , copper ... ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually usually anything that has a charge that that can can capture capture an an electron electron or a hole hole ( which which we we call call charge carriers ) . The The more more of of these defects you have have the lower your effective efficiency efficiency . So So what what happens out in in the the field over time ? There are many many things things that can happen happen that can can cause a module to degrade . On the macro macro level , standard deterioration from from corrosion corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread thread . We also have a few such as as PID ( potential induced induced degradation degradation ) and LID LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for for example example in monocrystalline solar solar cells is largely known to be due to to the Boron - Oxygen defects defects . Under sunlight sunlight , boron boron and oxygen can combine together to form form a B - O complex , which likes to to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 48 hours .

{"text": "* * WHY WHY THEY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect normal people people , the SEC SEC has has created all sorts of rules rules and regulations for how companies that that invest money on behalf of of other people should operate operate . While this makes the the investments investments safer and less less volatile , it it prevents the firm firm making investments from from chasing riskier riskier but possibly possibly more profitable investments investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge Hedge funds funds are companies that make these investments investments . They are not allowed allowed to have more more than 100 100 investors , and and they are not allowed to to take on any investors with less less than than $ 5 million in wealth . Many Many of their clients are either either very wealthy wealthy people or institutional investors investors , such as as pension pension funds funds , banks , insurance companies , college college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to to get into a good good hedge fund , as not not only only are they limited by the the number of investors they they can take take on on , but they are are also also rated on on the rate rate of return they they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the the more more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund fund , remember the Groucho Groucho Marx joke about about not wanting to to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS GOALS * * So in short , hedge hedge funds gather large piles of money from very very wealthy institutions institutions and and invest it on on their behalf . The goal goal is to do two things things . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you you look at all the the stocks on the the market market , odds odds are are almost all of of them them went went up . A rising rising tide lifts lifts all boats . This is referred referred to as beta . Most Most assets , or portfolios portfolios of of assets , will move move in the direction of general market . Alpha Alpha is finding assets that go up even more more than the the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say say Vanguard , and own own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned mentioned 10 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn earn an amount above and beyond beyond that 10 10 % . Alpha is supposed supposed to be be the ability ability to to find assets that will do this this . The other other goal of hedge funds funds is to earn absolute returns returns . What What this means is that that they they make money every year , regardless of of what the the stock market does . A few funds have done this this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing bluffing in saying saying they they were were able able to to do that , and many many of of them went went out out of business business . * * HOW DO DO THEY THEY SET IT UP * * So based on on the above , the hedge hedge fund fund has a large pile pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of of dollars , invested with it by various various clients . A hedge fund fund is normally normally staffed by veterans of the financial services services industry , typically typically people who who have worked for a long time time at at investment investment banks and have contacts contacts within within the industry . After After accumulating their investment capital , their their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Goldman Sachs Sachs , Merrill Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley Stanley , or commercial banks banks with investment banking arms arms , such such as Citigroup or or Bank of America , to borrow large sums sums of of money money to to leverage this return . What this means if that that if you you invest $ 100 and make make 10 10 % , you make $ 10 10 . But if you borrow borrow $ 900 900 , and invest invest the the full $ 1,000 and and make 10 % , you make make $ 100 , then then pay back the the bank $ 900 900 ( plus interest ) , and and you made made $ 100 ( less interest interest ) for for your investors off off the the $ 100 they invested with you you . ( The The downside of of this this is that if if you lose lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and and your your investors are wiped wiped out . This is called blowing blowing up in in the the jargon jargon , and it happens more than than you would think , so leverage leverage can be be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like like to lend to to hedge funds funds though though , because they like the the interest income , and they like like to hear what what leads the the hedge funds are following following ( financial financial services services is very incestuous , and and rumors rumors drive trades trades ) . The The hedge hedge funds funds like to to borrow borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding notwithstanding the the need for for leverage , the the investment banks have contacts within within the publicly traded companies . Say you you 're 're doing doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs Sachs . Maybe in in the the process of that that , you meet their hedge fund fund clients , and and talk up your business to to them them to drive demand for for your stock , while while they hear from from the CFO and CEO personally , and make better better decisions decisions than than the the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so so now we have a bunch of guys guys who used to work for investment investment banks banks , with investor money money , contacts at investment investment banks banks , and and large large piles of borrowed money money . What What do they invest in ? The The short short answer answer is whatever whatever they they want . There are a number of recognized investing investing styles styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are are the most most simple simple funds . They buy some stocks stocks , and and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average average and absolute returns . The The concept of going going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how how the industry got its name name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Global Macro Macro - These funds funds invest in in assets assets that will give them them exposure exposure to to broad economic forces , which which they they hope hope to predict predict . Do you you think the the euro euro is going to break up ? Short it it , and euro - denominated denominated assets . Do you you think think we we ' ve ve hit peak peak oil oil ? Buy Buy oil oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros Soros became famous famous for making billions billions for for predicting that that England would be forced to devalue devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to to be be referred to to as as \" black box funds \" , meaning that that no one knows what what their criteria are , as it is is a trade secret secret . Often they write write computer computer programs designed to go through millions of pages pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and and go long or short short on on them . High High frequency frequency traders do this with stocks by by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can can buy stocks stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about about a fund fund that that combs through through publicly available filings filings through through the the Food and and Drug Drug Administration Administration , looking looking for for any any changes regarding new drugs , to to use use as information on pharmaceutical stocks stocks . 4 ) Event Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests suggests , the the buy or or sell short assets whose whose price price will will be affected affected by future future events . Merger arbitrage is a common common form of this this . When one company company acquires another another , usually usually the buyer 's stock goes goes down down , as as they are are probably probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock stock jumps jumps , as someone is is about to overpay for it . Short Short the predator and and buy the the prey prey . In the movie movie * Wall Street Street * , Charlie Sheen uses uses contacts contacts with a law firm to find clients of of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort sort of strategy , and and is is arrested arrested when the feds flip one of his his accomplices accomplices . The The most famous example of this strategy is is John Paulson , who made billions off off the housing bubble buying credit credit default swaps on on collateralized collateralized debt obligations obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took took this approach . ( I believe believe Paulson Paulson is is now following a macro strategy , and and has been buying up up gold mines , evidence evidence that funds funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge hedge funds funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope hope is that that returns returns will will be less volatile volatile and and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money money , that that might be 5 % of your your investment investment rather than than 100 % . There There is a pretty pretty long list of of other other recognized recognized strategies , many too too complicated to worry worry about here here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge hedge fund , which was was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain obtain and and trade on inside inside information . The The founder is now now facing 15 15 to 19 19 years in in prison . It It was was an effective strategy , but but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point point of of this is is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they they want , and will be be judged solely solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO DO THEY THEY GET PAID * * You ' ve probably probably already heard about how many many hedge hedge funds funds make make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two two ways . The first is the the management management fee fee . If If you you invest invest money money with with a hedge fund ( or or anyone for that that matter ) , the the first thing they do do is is take take a percentage of your money money from you you and keep keep it for for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets assets under management each year . They use this this money to pay employees employees , rent rent office space , and cover overhead overhead until their real real payday arrives arrives at the end of the year . The other means means of payment is the performance performance fee fee . At the end of of the year , the fund fund tallies how much money it made made for investors , and and takes takes a chunk chunk of of it it for themselves themselves . 20 20 % is typical , but but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion billion payday for the people who who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

The Space Shuttle was a reusable spacecraft that was used for many different missions , including transporting transporting astronauts to and from the the International Space Station ( ISS ) . It was a very advanced and and complex vehicle vehicle , but it also had had some limitations . One of the reasons reasons NASA decided to to use rockets instead of a new upgraded type of Space Shuttle for for the the Orion spacecraft spacecraft is that rockets rockets are generally generally more more powerful and and can can reach reach higher altitudes and faster faster speeds speeds than the the Space Space Shuttle . This is important for for deep deep space missions missions , such as going to the the Moon or or Mars , because these these destinations destinations are much farther away from Earth Earth than the ISS ISS . Another Another reason reason is that the Space Shuttle required a lot of maintenance and preparation between between flights , which made it less less flexible and efficient than rockets rockets . Rockets Rockets can be launched more quickly and can be be used used for a wider range of missions missions . Finally , NASA is always looking for ways to improve improve and advance its its technology , and developing a new type of Space Space Shuttle would have been a very expensive and time - consuming project .

The author author that wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Ellis Ellis , is known for a common theme in all all of his books . Simply put put , they are about the detachment prevalent in modern modern society . Specifically the effect that that wealth and and privilege privilege can have on people people . No No one one has friends only only acquaintances . People are only only as important as as what what they can can do for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity simplicity I 'll 'll only deal with with what 's in in the movie movie . In American Psycho the the main main character character is is pretending to be be a human . He takes everything everything way too far because because he is is over over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he he is with with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his his whole whole shower procedure procedure . He is is pretending pretending to to work work . His father owns owns a competing firm firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick Patrick as an employee simply because because of his fathers name . He pretends pretends to have have a fiance , who who of course course is is completely fake fake too , otherwise otherwise she would would n't survive long long around him . He pretends to have sexuality sexuality . He has no clue what what it it is is to love someone someone let let alone alone to to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he he feels feels cheated . He can see all around him what what humanity is supposed to be and and he just is n't \" that that \" . He knows knows that that it 's getting worse and worse , and is afraid afraid that he will be be caught . He is n't afraid of of going to to jail jail or dying , but but rather he is afraid of being being exposed as a fake fake person person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your your specific question question regarding the scene scene where he calls calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so so he calls his lawyer and admits admits everything everything he can think think of . The lawyer thinks the the caller is is someone other other than Patrick Patrick playing a joke . He He never takes it it seriously seriously because to to him him Patrick is is just some bland rich guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other bland bland rich guys . Later Later when Patrick sees the the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about about it the lawyer lawyer , not realizing he is is talking TO Patrick Patrick , laughs about about the ridiculousness ridiculousness of of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are common themes in the movie movie and book . People constantly remark how how normal normal Patrick is , people people constantly constantly mistake mistake him and and others for someone else . They They all look and act act alike . In In my my opinion the movie is about how how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer killer to blend into society because of how how uncaring uncaring and superficial we we all are .

{"text": "The balance balance sheet is a deceptively easy easy item in in accounting accounting . What it tells tells you is three things : 1 ) How big of a pile of stuff do I own ? 2 ) How much money did I borrow to to buy my big pile of of stuff that that I still still have to to pay back ? 3 ) If If I removed removed everything from my pile of stuff stuff that that I still owe owe money on , how much is left ? This smaller pile of stuff that that you have have paid in full full for and that that you do do n't n't owe another cent on is is your \" equity \" . It can be be broken down down to the classic accounting equation equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities Liabilities ( Stuff Stuff in your your pile that the bank can can take back because because you you have n't paid for it it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff Stuff in the pile pile that is paid for and and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out out a mortgage and and buy buy a $ 200,000 house house , and promptly promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I own own half half of a house . That That is my equity . The bank owns the the other $ 100,000 of of the the house , and that is my my liability . Again , the equation tells us : Total Assets Assets ( The The Whole House , 200k 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank Bank 's half of the the house house 100k ) + Equity ( my half of the the house that that I plunked down down 100k for for ) . To answer answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is is how how is is it important : Let Let us say that I owned an an entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of of rat rat control . I take take the the cat to to the bank bank , and the bank lends lends the cat cat $ 995,000 as a business business loan loan under the agreement that that the bank bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't paid paid back with with interest interest . The cat takes the bank bank 's 995k and I throw throw in 5k of my own money that that the cat never has to pay me back for , and and he he buys buys 1 million dollars worth of rat control control equipment equipment . Now Now if if I went went on Craigslist and and offered to sell the the cat and his 1 million dollars worth of of rat control supplies to to the the highest bidder , my my cat might might sell for close to 1 million million dollars . However However , once once the potential buyer found found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to to the bank bank still , the the potential buyer would would realize realize the the EQUITY EQUITY in in the cat is is only $ 5,000 , and and would n't pay much more than than that . Now Now that begs begs the question question , why would I give give the feline $ 5,000 that he did did n't have to pay pay me me back for ? This relates relates to the second use use of the the phrase phrase equity in finance , which which is is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 to to become become a partner in his business . Think Think of of this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on on things things that will make his his business business better , and and that that he does n't n't have to to worry about about paying me interest interest on on or ever ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives gives me 100 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock Stock of of a total total 200 shares outstanding . He owns owns the the other other 100 100 , which he assigned to to himself when incorporating incorporating his his business . What What 's in it for for me ? As owner of of 50 % of the EQUITY in in the company ( I own 100 100 of 200 total shares shares ) , I am entitled to half of the profits profits ! Now Now if the cat is is very successful and makes $ 200,000 200,000 in profits each each year after after paying paying interest on his his loan to the bank , that is great for me me ! Going back back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Million Million Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Million Principle Principle Still Owed to the Bank Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs belongs outright outright to to me and and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed from from the the bank does n't change change . We still still have 1 million dollars dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so that that 200k is pure profit for us us ( me and my my cat ) as as business owners owners . Now Now this this $ 200,000 200,000 can either be be paid paid to to use in in the the form form of of dividends , or or reinvested in new equipment and and services that that can help help the business grow grow .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Sure ! The The circle constant constant is a number that that helps helps us understand and measure measure circles . The most common circle constant constant is pi , which which is represented by by the the Greek Greek letter letter \u03c0 . Pi is a number that that is a little bit more more than 3 , and it is important because it it helps us us understand the relationship relationship between between the circumference ( the the distance around around the circle circle ) and the diameter ( the distance distance across the the circle through the the center ) . The Tau Manifesto is a document document that suggests that we should use a different circle constant called tau , which is represented by the Greek letter letter \u03c4 . Tau is equal to 2\u03c0 , or about about 6.28 6.28 . The idea behind the Tau Manifesto Manifesto is that tau tau is is a more natural and intuitive circle constant constant to use , especially when it comes to understanding radians . Radians Radians are a way of of measuring angles . If you think of a circle as a clock , with the 12 o'clock o'clock position at the the top , then then one one radian radian is equal to 1/6 of of the way around the circle . Using Using tau as the circle constant constant makes it it easier easier to understand radians , because because one radian is is equal to 1/3 1/3 of of tau , rather than 1/2 1/2 of pi . This makes makes it easier easier to see that that radians radians are a measure of how far around around the circle an angle is , rather than how wide the angle is . So So , in summary , both pi pi and and tau tau are are important numbers numbers that help us understand and measure measure circles , but some people believe that that tau tau is is a better circle circle constant to to use because it makes it it easier to understand understand radians .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

In that case , even if if my cost cost of of living there is much less less , so so is is my salary salary . There are sites sites that provide provide a good guidance guidance for for what the the average average salary for an an profession with with x years of of experience would be . Of Of course course some some would would get paid more than average . So you can try and and make a logic , if in US say say you you are being paid more than than average , you would would be paid paid more more than than average average elsewhere elsewhere . Plus Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country , one has the Advantage of of positive pedigree pedigree bias . There There are are also websites that would would give the Purchasing Power Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs . The The Real Real difficulty to find is whether whether the the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar similar in in other country . If you you compare like for like it it becomes slightly skewed skewed . If If you compare equivalence equivalence , then can you adjust . A relevant example my friend friend in in US US had had a Independent Independent Bungalow Bungalow in in US . It was with Basement and attic , 2 levels of living living space with with 4 bedroom bedroom . He shifted to to India India and got a great salary compared compared to normal normal Indian salary salary . However this this kind of house house in in India India in Bangalore would would be affordable only to CEO 's 's of top companies . So So is living in a 3 room room apartment fine ? There There are multiple such aspects . Drinking Drinking a Starbucks coffee coffee couple couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US . In India India this would would be be considered considered luxury luxury . A like for for equivalent comparison is is \" One drinks 3 - 4 mugs of Coffee \" in in US , and average average Indian Indian drinks drinks \" Tea / Coffee 3 - 4 mugs \" . In India the local Tea / Coffee would be be Rs 10 10 - Rs 20 . A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150 . The same same applies to food . A McBurger in India would be be around around Rs Rs 100 . The Indian Indian equivalent Wada Wada Pav is for Rs 10 . A Sub Way Way would would be Rs 150 . A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around around Rs Rs 25 25 . I personally am picky picky about food , so it does n't n't matter where I go , I can only eat specific things , which means I spend a huge huge amount amount of money if I am outside of of India . When I was in US , I could n't n't afford a maid , driver driver or any help help . In India India I have 2 maids , a cooking maid maid and and a driver . Plus I get get plumber , electrician , window cleaner , and and all the the help help without costing me much . Things that I absolutely ca n't n't dream in US . My colleague colleague in in UK preferred to to stay in a specific locality locality as it has has a very good Church . So So if if its important important , one may find few good good ones in India if if one one is Roman Roman Catholic , if if one follows follows Lutheran Lutheran , Greek Greek Orthodox , tough luck . Citizenship : Does Does it matter ... A foreign foreign national may never get an Indian Indian citizenship . Children Children do do n't qualify qualify either either unless both both parents parents are Indian . Health Care : Again is is quite different . One may may feel Health Health care care in in US US is not good or very expensive ... but there are multiple aspects of this this .

If If the the temperature becomes too high the ice that traps the the methane methane gas melts and the methane enters enters the atmosphere . Methane Methane is a greenhouse greenhouse gas and is one one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the atmosphere atmosphere it reinforces global warming and the the greenhouse greenhouse effect further further melting ice ice and further further releasing releasing methane until it it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and and in particular particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and and absorbes heat . Ice is white white and and reflects it it . As As long long as ice , particularly particularly sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter goes goes away away the the things things beneath the the ice tend to absorbes that heat heat and and sun sun and make everything hotter hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is melted melted and the more more Ocean there is to absorb absorb heat which further melts ice ice ad ad infinitum until we all die . Now back back to to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered considered seriously seriously pushing pushing it for for these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse of of civilization civilization . At the the current rate rate we 're doing doing things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is is pretty much much death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't n't in in the clear clear but but we we have a very good chance of living life life comfortably on earth earth , with nearly all of of the the same luxuries we we have today albeit operated operated differently . Before Before this this agreement agreement the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed it it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is is a huge huge and and a really big difference difference . Aside from that one of the big big concerns is that developed countries have created climate change and and gotten gotten rich off off it and now now poor nations such as Pacific Pacific island nations nations and and countries like Bangladesh now have to suffer because because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says says basically basically that developed nations have to help out out financially to to developing developing nations with with protection against rising sea sea levels levels and and other things and to help them them convert convert their infrastructures to green energy while also also helping helping them develop their economies and humanitarian humanitarian situations situations . It also sets sets a goal for for developed nations to try and cut all all greenhouse greenhouse emissions emissions they emit . Lastly they they will take take stock stock of emissions emissions and temperature rises and and environmental environmental impacts impacts of of climate change change in 2023 2023 and every five five years after that that . Also nations have have to set set goals for themselves every 5 years years based on on what what they can accomplish and what they have accomplished accomplished . One worrying part part is the fact that that nations nations can can back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without without repercussions . I ' m also not sure sure how how legally binding any of of this is or if if it it even even is is . It It would would be be awesome awesome if it was was but I ' m not sure sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the 90 90 's 's , the generation that grew up up on these ideals had kids kids and and wanted them all all to go to to college college . All of them them . So suddenly suddenly massive amounts amounts of kids were being pushed into college . The colleges colleges reacted by raising their prices prices . Sometimes Sometimes this this was justified : they had many more students so they needed needed more dorms dorms , more food food , more more teachers . But ultimately ultimately , college prices prices went out of control . The The parents still wanted to send their kids to college ( thinking it was was how they 'd 'd get get a good job job still ) and decided decided to take out loans to pay for their school . BUT BUT these these loans were were taken out out on on behalf behalf of the kids so the loans were were in their their kid 's names ( in in most cases cases anyway anyway ) . All at at once , a lot of of kids kids with college college degrees flooded the job job market market . Employers Employers now had millions of applicants with with college college degrees . In the past , they they 'd have many applicants but but one one or two would be be college college educated . Now ... everyone everyone had one . This meant meant that the college degrees degrees lost a lot of value . Since everyone everyone had had one , it stopped being special special . There * are * plenty of degrees that are are still useful and and that you needed in your your field ( medical , legal , financial , computer computer science ) , but a lot of kids ( myself myself included ) were told told that they 'd 'd be fine no matter what degree degree they they got . And And many were were misguided by by the college college system ( who wanted money money more than for their their student 's 's to be be well well - prepared for the ever - changing job job market ) .

So So now now ... we we 've 've got a lot of kids with degrees that that may or may may not not be useful . They ca ca n't get a job job in the field they they studied for for . Well , they can can still get get low low paying paying jobs in another field just to make make ends ends met met . No big deal right right ? WRONG ! Remember Remember those loans loans ? That That does n't go anywhere . These young adults suddenly have a lot of debt to pay pay off . If If their degree degree / career did did n't pan pan out out , debt . If they they have a great job job and make decent money money , debt . If they they have have a medical medical degree degree and become a doctor doctor and start their own private private practice and and make make great great money , debt ( the the average US doctor pays their loans loans off after 10 years years ) . We We now have have a huge huge generation of of young people saddled saddled with with massive debt debt with no no way to get get rid rid of it and and few ways to improve their circumstances circumstances . There 's no no real way they can afford bigger investments investments like a house / condo since since they 're constantly constantly paying towards towards debt . A missed missed payment does horrible horrible things to your your credit score score , a lack of of disposable income screws up your livelihood and social / romantic romantic life , and without skills to to get a job job that can pay the the debt debt off the the debt debt just gets gets worse worse .

These These policies policies can help help reduce burnout and and increase job satisfaction , which which can lead lead to more more productive and efficient work overall overall . It 's also worth noting that France has has a strong strong social welfare system system that that supports workers and and helps helps to ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities necessities like healthcare and education .

{"text": "The different different naming schemes are are basically a way for Intel to distinguish distinguish how powerful each each processor processor is . An i3 is is the the slowest , then then an an i5 , and i7 is is the fastest fastest . However However , within the ' i ' series series , there there are are now 4 ' generations ' of processors processors .. .. each year , Intel Intel refreshes refreshes their their processor processor lineup with new versions of of the the processors , so so a 4th 4th - generation i5 will will be faster than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and usually newer processors processors are more efficient , using less electricity and running running cooler , as well well ) . You can tell which generation a Core - i processor is from by the number after it it - 4xxx 4xxx is 4th - gen , 3xxx is 3rd 3rd - gen , etc . ( so i5 i5 - 4670 is a 4th 4th - gen , for example ) . Pretty much much any Core - i processor processor will be faster than a Core2Duo and and probably probably any Core2Quad as as well . The best way to compare how fast processors are in in relation to each other is to look at benchmarks benchmarks for specific specific applications applications though ( a benchmark benchmark is is just just a measure of how well a specific specific piece of of hardware performs ) . As for how many many cores cores each one has , it depends on which specific processor you 're talking talking about about .. .. you can can easily easily Google a specific processor processor to find out how many many cores it has . One other thing to note note is that that a quad - core processor is is not necessarily twice as fast as a dual - core core processor processor . All 4 cores usually do do n't n't run run at at the same speed and and at the the same time time . More cores help help more more when you 're 're running more applications applications at the same time , or or running a ' multi multi - threaded threaded ' application , which is an an application that 's 's specifically programmed to make better better use of more more cores cores .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Lepton Lepton is is a data compression algorithm algorithm developed by Dropbox , a company that that provides online storage storage and file sharing sharing services . Data Data compression is a technique technique used to reduce the size size of a file or a piece piece of of data , making it easier easier and more efficient efficient to store store , transmit , and and process . The \" middle - out \" part of of Lepton Lepton refers to the the way the the algorithm algorithm works : it first first identifies identifies and removes redundancies from the middle of the data , and then then works works its its way way outwards to compress the the rest of the data data . This This approach is is different from from other other data compression algorithms , which often start at the beginning beginning or or the end end of of the data and and work work their way way towards the the middle . To understand how Lepton Lepton works , let 's use a simple example . Imagine you have a list of words that that you you want want to to compress . Lepton would first look look for repeating repeating words words or or patterns in the the middle of the list list , and then represent represent those those repetitions with a shorter code code . For For example , if the word \" the \" appears 10 10 times times in the middle of the list , Lepton might replace all all of of those those instances with a code like \" t10 \" . This This would save some space , because because the code \" t10 \" is shorter than than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times . Once Lepton Lepton has compressed the middle middle of the list , it it would then then work its way outwards outwards , looking for for more opportunities to compress the data data . For example , it might look for repeating words words or or patterns patterns at the beginning beginning and end of of the list , and and replace them with shorter shorter codes as well well .

The The host then gives you the option to stick with your original choice ( door 1 ) or or switch to the other unopened unopened door ( door 3 ) .

This process process is is important important because it allows the the steam to be used over and over again , instead of of just being released into the the atmosphere.\\n\\nOverall , the cooling tower and the the condenser condenser are are both important parts of a power plant plant because they help to conserve energy by allowing the the steam steam to be be used multiple multiple times .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

You You 're somewhat somewhat correct in assuming that what you you 're reading reading is usually usually some kind of marketing material . Systematic Investment Plan Plan ( SIP SIP ) is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world . Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece piece of jargon in the the financial financial world and is a common topic taught in in finance finance classes in the the US . On average , verified by many studies studies , individuals will generate generate better investment returns when they they proactively avoid timing the the market or attempting to pick specific winners . Say Say you you decide decide to invest in a mutual fund fund , dollar cost averaging averaging means you invest the the same same dollar dollar amount in in consistent consistent intervals rather rather than buying buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when when you feel the the market market is is low . As As an an example I 'll 'll compare compare investing $ 50 50 per week on Wednesdays Wednesdays , versus versus 1 share per week week on Wednesdays , or the the full $ 850 850 on the first Wednesday . I 'll use use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example ( VLCAX VLCAX ) . I realize this is not really an an apples apples to to apples comparison as as the invested invested amounts are different , I just wanted wanted to show show how your rate of return return can change depending depending on how your money goes goes in to to the the market even if the difference difference is subtle . By investing a common common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately ultimately maintain maintain a lower average share price while while the the share share price price climbs . It also also keeps keeps your your investment investment easy to budget . Vanguard published an an excellent paper paper discussing dollar dollar cost averaging versus versus lump lump sum investing which concluded that you you should invest as soon as you you have have funds , rather rather than parsing parsing out a lump sum in in to smaller periodic periodic investments , which is illustrated in the third column above ; and obviously worked out out well well as the the market has been increasing . Ultimately Ultimately , all of of these companies are vying to customers so so they all have marketing marketing teams trying trying to figure out out how to to make make their services sound interesting and unique . If If they all called dollar cost averaging , \" dollar cost averaging \" none none of them would appear appear to to be be unique unique .

As you can see , each each time you increase the power by 1 , you multiply by A again again . In other other words words : A^n+1 = A^n A^n * A. divide divide both sides by A & you you get A^n = A^n+1 A^n+1 / A. If you you let n=0 n=0 , you you get A^0 A^0 = A^0 + 1 / A , which is A^0 A^0 = A^1 / A , which is A^0 = A / A , which which is A^0 = 1 . So therefore , A^0 = 1 . * * * * * Edit Edit : Bonus round for for negative powers powers , if you you 're 're interested interested . Now that we we know know A^0 = 1 we can can do do this this : Using Using A^n = A^n+1 / A again . let n=-1 . A^-1 = A^-1 + 1 / A , which which is is A^-1 = A^0 / A , which is A^-1 = 1 / A. let n=-2 . A^-2 A^-2 = A^-2 + 1 / A , which is is A^-2 A^-2 = A^-1 / A , which is A^-2 A^-2 = ( 1 / A ) / A , which is is A^-2 = 1 / A^2 This can can be generalised to A^-n A^-n = 1 / A^n .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A ranked voting system is a way of casting casting and and counting votes votes in an an election where where voters are able to rank rank the candidates in order of preference preference . Instead of of just choosing one one candidate candidate , voters can can indicate their their top choice choice , second choice , third choice , and so on . In In a ranked voting voting system system , if if a candidate wins a majority of first - choice choice votes , they are declared declared the winner winner just just like in in a normal normal election . If no candidate wins a majority majority of first - choice votes , then then the candidate with with the fewest votes votes is eliminated and their votes are are redistributed to the voters ' next choice . This process process is repeated until until one candidate has has a majority majority of votes votes and is is declared the the winner . One advantage of of ranked ranked voting voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election election has the support of a majority of of voters voters , rather than than just a plurality of of voters voters . In In a normal election election , it it is possible for a candidate to win with less than than 50 50 % of the vote if there there are more than two candidates candidates running running . In a ranked voting system , this is less likely to to happen happen because the votes votes of the least popular candidate can be be redistributed to the voters voters ' next next choice choice . As As for how a ranked ranked voting system could help eliminate the the two - party system , it 's important important to note that ranked voting is just one of of many potential potential reforms that could help help encourage more political diversity . However , ranked voting could potentially help by by making it easier for third - party candidates or or independent candidates to win win elections . Since Since voters voters are able able to to rank rank multiple candidates candidates in order of preference preference , they can choose to support a third - party candidate as their their first first choice while still expressing expressing a preference for one one of the major major party candidates as their second choice . This could could make it more likely that that a third third - party party candidate could win an election , or at at least have have a stronger stronger influence on the the outcome .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

However , these these genes are not eliminated from the gene pool pool because they drastically increase increase the reproductive fitness when inherited inherited by by a female female . ELI5 ELI5 version - So So given certain certain gene , if male male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby baby making * * * The The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis Hypothesis * * Argues Argues that genes that express feminine feminine physical characteristics and personality personality traits increase increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version version - being a little bit feminine can increase increase your chances chances of of getting lucky with the the opposite opposite gender , but too too much feminine feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in in the the past , males used used sexual contact with other males males as as a way way to form / strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient ancient Greece , it was was not not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual homosexual behaviour with younger younger males while being being married married to to a woman . Also Also note note that it it is only within the the past couple centuries centuries that that the the division of sexuality into into heterosexual heterosexual and homosexual identities has occurred occurred .

This is because because the ISS ISS is being being pulled towards the Earth Earth by the Earth 's gravity , but it is also also moving very fast fast . When When an object moves very fast , it it is is harder for for gravity to pull it it down , so it follows a curved path path instead of of falling straight down down . To stay in orbit , the ISS ISS has has to keep moving at a specific speed and and altitude altitude . If it slows down or drops too low , it will fall back to to Earth Earth .

These These devices devices use radio waves , which are a type of electromagnetic electromagnetic radiation , to transmit the data . The radio waves are are sent sent from from the spacecraft spacecraft to antennas antennas on Earth , which are large structures that are are designed designed to to receive the the radio waves and turn them into into the data data that that scientists can use to study the spacecraft spacecraft 's environment environment and the objects objects it is is encountering . To reach Earth from such a long distance distance , the spacecraft spacecraft use use a special type of of antenna called a high - gain antenna . This antenna is is able to focus the the radio waves into into a very very narrow beam , which allows the spacecraft to transmit the the data with a very very low power power level . This is important because the spacecraft need to be as as energy energy efficient as possible possible , since since they have limited limited power available to them . Even with with the use of the high high - gain antenna , it still takes a long time for the data from from the spacecraft to reach Earth Earth , due due to the the vast distance that that the radio radio waves have to to travel travel .

This means means that Pluto is often much farther farther from from the the Sun than the the other planets , and and it takes a much longer time time to orbit orbit the Sun than the other other planets planets do .

The The MIRR function calculates the internal internal rate of of return return on an investment with multiple cash cash flows , taking into account account the fact that that the investment investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at at a different different rate rate than the original original cost cost of the investment . It does this this by using the following following formula : MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range of of cells that contain contain the series of payments and investments associated with the investment investment . \"finance_rate \" is the interest rate rate used to calculate calculate the present value value of the the cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is the the interest rate used used to calculate the the future value of of the cash flows flows . The MIRR function function is useful for comparing the returns on different investments , as as it takes into into account the the fact that that the the reinvestment reinvestment rate may may be different from from the financing rate rate . It is is also useful useful for for evaluating evaluating the profitability profitability of of investments with with irregular cash flows , such as as those that involve the sale sale of assets or the repayment of loans loans . Example : Suppose you are considering considering investing investing $ 100,000 in in a project project that is is expected to generate generate the the following cash flows over the next next 5 years : Year 1 : $ 20,000Year 20,000Year 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 50,000Year 50,000Year 5 : $ 60,000The financing financing rate on the the investment is is 10 10 % , and the reinvestment rate is is 8 % . You You can can use the the MIRR function function to to calculate the internal rate of of return on the investment investment as follows:=MIRR(A1 follows:=MIRR(A1 : A5 , 10 % , 8%)This 8%)This would return return a result of approximately approximately 12.63 % , indicating indicating that the the investment investment is is expected to to generate generate a return of approximately 12.63 12.63 % per year .

So if you see a movie or TV show show with a green green tomato symbol symbol , it means that most people who have seen it have liked liked it it . If If you see a movie or TV show with with a red red tomato symbol , it means that most people people who have have seen it did not like like it it .

{"text": "The The important thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't n't breathe breathe through their mouths mouths like us us ; they do n't even even have lungs lungs . They They have tiny holes in in their exoskeleton which which allows allows oxygen into system system of tubes tubes , which carry carry oxygen to their their organs . With that in in mind , let let 's think about about what happens when something increases in size size . Two Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In In other words words , volume and surface area increase increase by by different rates rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area area of of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It It has a volume of of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides sides , 4 sq ft ft per per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times times * , but the the surface area only only increased by by * four * . 3x3x3 3x3x3 ? Volume of of 27 27 , surface area of 54 54 . The volume more more than than tripled tripled , whereas the surface area area roughly doubled . Now Now , the point here is that * volume volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That That means means that there there 's 's more organs and and whatnot , all all of of which which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen oxygen available , though , depends on on * surface area * . Insects get get oxygen oxygen from their skin , so to to increase their their oxygen intake intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You You ca n't add add more holes in in the the exoskeleton exoskeleton to increase increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because because that that makes the exoskeleton exoskeleton weaker . The The exoskeleton is * already * under extra extra strain strain trying to support the increased increased weight weight , so so that wo wo n't work . This means means that there there 's essentially a point where an insect ca ca n't n't grow any bigger , because because it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) to to make up for for the increased increased volume / weight ( need need for oxygen oxygen ) . For more more evidence evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be be much much bigger millions millions and and millions of of years ago during dinosaur times .

We We 'll 'll call it the the State of Calville . Calville Calville gets gets 10 10 Representatives to send send to the US US House of Representatives . If you you 're a Democrat you you would like as many Democrats Democrats as possible possible ; if if you you 're 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville Calville gets 10 Representatives Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do do you you draw draw the the borders to make these districts districts ? One way is to draw the the borders to make make sure sure that your your party party gets gets as as many of of those those 10 Representative Representative spots as possible . There There are 2 basic ways to to do do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of of ) voters apart apart . 1 . Let 's pretend pretend a group group of people people always always vote for Republicans : people people over 6 feet tall . And you you 're a Democrat and and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can can draw it so so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and and only one one , district . It could look look [ something like this this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're 're basically basically giving up that one one district . You know that Democrats will will never be able to to win win it . But you also know know that Democrats will have have a * * much better better * * chance in the other 9 because all the the Republican voters are in in 1 district . So you you 're 're drawing the the borders so you you get 9 districts districts / Representatives and and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using using the ability to make borders to get get the electoral electoral outcome outcome you you want and not the electoral outcome the the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep keep going going with with our hypothetical . You 're 're a Democrat Democrat writing the rules and and you you only care about about getting as many Democrats elected elected as possible . Let 's 's also also say 20 % of of people in in Calville Calville are over over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no no matter what . A fair fair person might say something like : at least 20 20 % of of the population wants wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's 's fair fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But But you , you do do n't care about about fair fair or or what what voters voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you you take that 20 20 % and you you spread them them around . You You make sure sure that that each district district has 20 % , but no more , of of people people over 6 feet tall . That That way you you might might be able able to to win all all 10 districts / Representatives Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve ve abused your power to make make sure sure you get the result you want want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican Republican is from from a district district which which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really really have to to worry about being re - elected . If If a Democrat Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of of people are over over 6 feet feet tall then then they they may not have to to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- -------------------------- It 's 's a real real problem and it ( basically basically ) disenfranchises real real people .", "label": "hc3human"}

While While in other countries they are supported by banks directly ( right ? ) , in in US you may find this this option only in some big big stores like like home improvement improvement stores stores , car dealerships , cell cell phone operators ( so so that you can can buy a new new phone ) etc . Some stores stores allow 0 % financing for for , say say , 12 months months which is not exactly the the same same as installments but close , if if you have have discipline to pay $ 250 each each month month and not wait for for 12 months to to end . Splitting Splitting the big payment in parts means that that the seller seller gets money money in parts as as well well , and and it adds risks of of customer customer default , introduces debt collection possibility etc . That 's why it 's usually usually up to the the merchants to support support it it - bank does not care care in this case , from the the bank point point of view the store just just charges the the same card another another $ 250 every every month . In other countries banks support support this option option directly , I think , taking taking over over or dividing the the risk risk with with the merchants . This has has not happened in US . There is a company SplitIt which which automates installments if stores want to support it but but again , it means stores need need to agree to it it .

The easiest easiest way way to build build the history history - request \" secured secured credit card card \" , which means you have to give the the bank money money up front and and then then they will give you you a credit credit card with with a credit limit limit equal to that that amount . It 's 's like like a \" practice practice credit card \" . You You use use it for 6 - 12 months and and the bank will will report your usage usage to credit credit bureaus bureaus , establishing your \" credit score score \" . After After that you you should should be able to get your your money money back and convert convert your secured card card into a regular credit credit card card . Credit history can be also built built by by paying paying rent rent and utilities but that that requires companies who collect money to to report the the payments to credit bureaus and very very few do do that that .

{"text": "This is is actually an an interesting interesting question , and the root of of your your answer answer lies lies far back in in history history . The short version is that a highway highway was a road road elevated above the surrounding terrain terrain ( literally , the the high way way ) , and and a freeway freeway was the the opposite of a toll road road ( literally , the free free way way ) . Back in , say say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most people walked from from their hut to the fields fields and back , and perhaps perhaps once a season the duke 's 's tax collector collector came came in a wagon or or cart . This This meant that most traffic was along footpaths footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations populations increased , and the cart paths began began seeing more traffic , 2 big problems problems arose . First , the ruts got deeper deeper , much deeper . This is a major problem in places places with a high water table ( say , coastal coastal areas or swamps ) , or during rainy rainy seasons . Second , these low paths made made it it hard hard to see see around , facilitating ambushes by bandits . By building up the the path , these two two problems were alleviated . The path was was above the the waterline , during during rains the water would naturally run off the path , and someone on the the path path could more easily see see bandits lying in wait . A high high way was much safer . The downsides of of the the high way is that that you you could n't n't just get on it anywhere anywhere with your your cart - the sides were too steep . You You had to get on on or off off in specific locations locations that had had lower grade grade ramps leading to the high way way . This is still still reflected in how our modern highways work . They They have limited limited access , usually by on on / off ramps . Modern Modern highways are are ( often ) elevated , limited access access roads roads that can safely safely handle handle high volumes of traffic . However However , the the cost of building building this this highway has to be borne borne by by someone . Hence Hence , initially initially , most highways were toll roads ( aka turnpikes , because they had walls of of pikes setup on the road , which which was turned aside aside when the toll was was paid . Again , literally , turn pike pike to pass pass ) . When bright bright , insightful people in government realized that safer safer traffic traffic along those highways boosted the economy , and and allowed allowed them to to collect more more taxes taxes , they decided to make make the highways highways they they build free , so that that they they could make more money money off the the increased traffic . The free free way was was born . Modern Modern freeways freeways are highways that are paid paid for by taxes taxes . The meaning of highway and freeway is , literally , in in the the name .

There are are certain genetic factors that can can increase a person person 's chances of having twins , such as as having having a family history of twins twins or or certain racial or ethnic backgrounds backgrounds . Here 's 's a simple explanation of how this works works : when a woman becomes pregnant pregnant , her body produces produces a hormone called called human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . This This hormone helps the the body maintain the pregnancy by preventing preventing the woman 's body from ovulating ( releasing eggs ) again . Some Some women produce more hCG than others others , and this this can can lead lead to the release of more than than one egg during ovulation ovulation . When two two eggs eggs are fertilized at at the same same time , it it can can result in in the birth of of twins twins . So , if a woman has has a family history history of twins , it it could be because someone someone in her family ( like her mother or grandmother grandmother ) produced more hCG , which led to to the birth of twins .

The other other thing they they could could mean mean is is that the dollar could decrease in value relative relative to other other currencies currencies .

An American Dollar might might get you $ 1.10 1.10 Canadian today and and in in a year , it might get get you $ 1.20 or or only only 90 cents cents . That That matters because countries countries trade with with each each other other and and it makes makes the the cost cost of imported good more more / less expensive ( so if if you 're buying apples from Canada Canada and the Canadian Canadian Dollar Dollar is more more valuable valuable , those apples will cost more ) and it will make make your your exports exports more more / less expensive ( if the American American dollar dollar increases increases in value , then then Canadians might might be be less inclined to to buy American apples ) .

If the the application or operating system continues continues to to run for an extended period period of time time , it may eventually eventually use up all of the available resources resources , causing it it to slow slow down or even even crash . 2 . Memory leaks : A memory memory leak is is a type type of bug that that occurs when when an application or operating system system allocates memory for a task task , but fails fails to properly release it it when the the task is finished finished . Over Over time , this can lead to the the application application or operating system using up more and more memory , causing it to to slow down . 3 .

Each playgroup playgroup has has their own part of the playset , and they they still still play with other other kids outside of of the playset and other other playgroups , but at the end of of the the day day , they always go back to their playgroups . Now imagine imagine each playgroup has a babysitter , and that babysitter babysitter oversees several playgroups playgroups at other other playsets playsets and she reports reports to a mom . The babysitter is like a regional coordinator or a house mom or what have you . The Mom Mom is like the national national / international president president . Each playset playset is like like greek life on another another campus . Each playgroup is like a house house .

I thought it it was was really really stupid . My aunt paid for my rush fee so I did it . Just Just rush / recruitment itself itself really brought brought me out of my my shell . It It really made made me me grow up and I learned learned a lot lot about about discretion and friendship . A girl girl on my my lacrosse lacrosse team always always bashes sororities , but she 's closest with all the girls in Greek Greek life on our team . It 's amazing amazing if you find find the the right right house house with with the right girls . Every house at at every every campus during different generations are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT . So So if your best friend friend joins joins Phi Upsilon Upsilon Kappa ( made made up , does does n't exist exist as as far as I know ) at at All All - American University , does n't n't mean you have to join Phi Phi Upsilon Kappa at your university . In Greek life , you get get to meet meet a lot of people ( especially especially if you go to a big school like like me ) and and it it makes a big campus campus feel smaller because you you meet people from from mixers / raids / invites whatever whatever you you want to call them . I ' ve ve gotten so many many connections for professors , classes , and any help help I ' ve needed . A lot lot of my my best friends are are in Greek Greek life , but but I also have friends who who refuse refuse to be in Greek Greek life and and friends who dropped out of of Greek Greek life life . It It 's not like like some elite elite club where you ignore everyone everyone else .

There is is always next semester / quarter quarter . If If you 're an an incoming freshman , talk to people you you know at the school school already and what their opinion is on on it it .

Intensity Intensity is is a measure of of the the amount of energy energy that a sound wave wave carries . When When we increase the volume of a sound on a computer or other other device , we are are increasing the the intensity of of the sound wave . However , the way that volume is typically measured and and controlled on a device does n't always increase the intensity of the the sound wave in a linear linear way . For example example , if you you increase the volume of of a sound from 1 % to to 2 % , the the intensity of the the sound wave may may not double double . This is because the volume control control on on a device often uses a logarithmic logarithmic scale , rather than a linear linear scale . This This means means that each increase in in volume volume by a certain percentage percentage represents a much much smaller smaller increase in in intensity intensity than than the the previous increase . So So , even even though you may think that that increasing the volume from 1 % to 2 % should make the sound twice twice as as loud loud , it may not seem that way because the intensity of the sound wave is not actually doubling .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

These fibers are extremely extremely thin , about the diameter of a human hair , and are made of of a special type of glass glass or plastic plastic that is very very good at at transmitting light light . Light travels through the fiber fiber optic cables by by bouncing bouncing off the walls walls of the fibers . This happens happens because the the walls walls of the the fibers are very very smooth and the the light reflects off off them in in a way that keeps keeps it moving forward . The The light reflects off off the walls walls so many times times that it travels a very long long distance without without losing much energy or or intensity . One reason reason that that light light can enter the the fiber fiber optic cable cable but not exit is is because the the walls of the fiber are are made made of a material material that is is very very good at reflecting reflecting light . This This means means that when when the light hits the walls , it bounces off them and and continues traveling traveling through through the the fiber fiber . However However , the walls walls of the the fiber are also very smooth , which makes it difficult for the light to escape . This is why why the the light stays inside inside the the fiber and and is is able to to travel such a long distance without losing much much intensity . There are are many many practical applications applications of of fiber optic technology . For example example , it it is is often used to transmit data data over long distances , such as in in the internet .

Certain Certain hard limits are are placed placed on on lower tiers by upper tiers tiers , particularly regarding how how those those lower tiers must respect basic basic civil rights rights . For example , it would be unlawful for * any * tier of government in the United States States to charge a poll poll tax during an election . It It 's prohibited by law , and if attempted attempted would be challenged in a court of of appropriate jurisdiction and and overturned . However However , within within those basic limits , each tier tier is more or or less left at its its own discretion discretion to to organize organize itself itself however however it it wants wants , and that includes setting the rules for local elections elections . As long as those rules rules do n't n't violate fundamental principles of of law , the individual individual bodies politic can do * whatever . * If If some municipal municipal government government somewhere wanted to to change its its method of electing its its mayor mayor from election election by ballot to to election by by acclamation , and the laws of the the locally locally relevant relevant upper tiers tiers of of government \u2014 meaning the state constitution , basically \u2014 did n't n't expressly prohibit it , they could go right ahead ahead .

It is is an an extension extension of of the linear regression model , which which is used to model model the relationship relationship between between a continuous response variable variable and and one or more predictor variables . The key key difference difference between a linear linear regression regression model model and a GLM is is that that in a GLM , the response variable variable is is not not necessarily necessarily continuous and may follow follow a different different distribution , such as as a binomial , poisson , or gamma distribution . The GLM allows for for the modeling of of this type of data by by using a link function to relate relate the mean of of the the response variable variable to to a linear linear combination of the the predictor variables variables . In In a GLM GLM , the the response response variable is assumed assumed to to follow a certain distribution , and and the the mean of this distribution is modeled modeled as as a linear linear combination of the predictor variables variables .

When college students students leave leave their hometown and arrive at college , they often know very very few people people and are not used to taking the the initiative in in meeting people . Fraternities Fraternities provide provide a medium for students students to to socialise and and bond . Since fraternities often have a reputation , students can join join to meet likeminded peers who they they might might not not otherwise meet . For example , some some fraternities fraternities will have a charity focus , others will have people people who grew up in a certain area area , others will will attract goofy guys or sporty guys guys . Fraternities also provide structured social situations to meet girls ( or sororities for meeting meeting boys ) by by holding parties , date nights and and other functions . Finally , because the drinking age in America America is 21 21 , most students ca n't n't go go to bars for the first few years years of college college , so so fraternities also function as social hubs hubs in in the the same same way that bars / clubs do once once you you reach reach the legal drinking age . Having Having said said that , there there are arguably arguably a number of downsides downsides to fraternities . They can can perpetuate social stratification stratification because because current members of of the fraternity pick the the incoming incoming members . Members will will often only want want to to invite freshman students who are are similar similar to to them them , and so the the fraternity and sorority scene can appear quite insular . I have heard heard that people belong in a certain fraternity fraternity because they went went to X high school , they they have family family money money , or or because they they are a ' legacy legacy ' ( i.e. i.e. their dad / mum was was in in the fraternity / sorority ) . Also , because only fraternities hold parties parties ( sororities sororities have nice nice houses and do do n't want them trashed ) , guys in the ' cool ' fraternities fraternities hold an imbalance of social power as other other students ( particularly girls ) need to befriend them to to get get invited invited to the the parties ( if if they ca n't get into bars ) .

This is is partly because of of # 1 above but it it 's 's a common situation situation . This is is because even though though congress congress makes decisions a lot of people dislike , their representative will will often often vote how they prefer . The reason congress does n't n't agree is mostly because they 'll be be replaced replaced next election if they they work work with the other other side side . * * So So most people people are upset with congress , but when when they have a chance to change a small part part of it , they overwhelmingly overwhelmingly will choose choose to to not not do so . * * A small majority are are upset with the the president , but he ca n't run again again in in 2016 anyway . The The US US may replace replace him with a republican ( switching is is common after after two terms of the other party ) or they they might replace him with a different democrat . People do n't take any any real action outside outside of elections because even even though though people people are upset with with government right now * * things are also pretty good for most americans and and are getting getting better all the the time * * , and something something along the lines of a revolution revolution ( like Ukraine , or Syria Syria / Libya ) is * * way * * too much much risk risk for the average american , who would basically basically be sacrificing a good life for the the chance chance to disrupt the biggest economy in the world , almost certainly making making their lives , and and the the lives of everyone else in the world , much worse worse .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A program is just a bunch of of very simple instructions instructions for for doing something . A programming programming language lets you say say how to do do something complicated in terms terms of of several simple simple steps \u2014 including including steps that are repeated ( \" loops \" ) and steps where you you might decide decide which of two or more things to to do do ( \" conditionals \" ) . For instance instance , suppose you are programming a little little robot that can move around on on a piece piece of paper . The robot robot has has a pen in its belly , so so it it draws a line wherever it goes goes . You You would like like to get get the robot robot to draw a square . But all all it knows how how to to do is is * go go forward or back by by some some number number of inches inches * , and * turn left left or right by some number number of of degrees degrees * . So you have have to tell it how to to make a square out of those those moves . You might write a program like this : to to draw_a_square forward forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 90 end If the robot robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and and ended up back where it it started . This This is is , in in fact fact , a program in the language language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which which used to to be very very popular for teaching programming programming to to grade school students . You can find find the Logo Logo programming programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux Linux , and other systems systems . Remember how I said that that you you can can use use repeated steps ? You can use these these to to make a program shorter , like this : to to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That 's 's a lot shorter shorter than than the earlier program , but it it does does the the same thing thing . It 's 's shorter because instead of repeating repeating instructions ourselves , we we tell the the robot robot to to repeat doing them . Programs Programs can also also take take inputs , for instance instance , telling how how big the square should should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward forward : size size right right 90 ] end Or , even , instead instead of a square , we we could draw an an arbitrary regular polygon : to to draw_polygon draw_polygon : sides : size size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 360 / : sides sides ) ] end So So , programs can repeat themselves themselves and they can do different different things based on their their inputs . They They can also also control different different parts parts of the the computer , for instance sending sounds to to the speakers or or communicating with other programs programs over over the network network . But the basic steps of any program are based on making making decisions and doing things repeatedly .", "label": "hc3human"}

It has been used in the the game industry for for many many years , but but it has become more popular and more more advanced in recent years . Before motion capture , game developers had to create animations animations manually manually , which was was a very time time - consuming process . They would have to draw each each frame of the animation by hand , or or use computers to create the animations from scratch . This was not very very efficient , and it it was difficult to create create realistic animations this this way . To use use motion capture capture , game game developers developers set up a special studio with with many many cameras cameras that that are pointed pointed at the person or animal whose movements they want want to capture capture . The person or animal wears a special suit with markers on it , which the cameras can track . As As the person or animal moves , the cameras record record their movements and send the data to a computer computer . The computer then translates translates that data into an animation that the game game can use .

{"text": "They 're 're not not loopholes . That 's 's just a propaganda word people use use to to confuse things . There are are basically basically two different things things that people sometimes sometimes erroneously call call loopholes loopholes : There are tax deductions deductions , and then there there are standard standard accounting accounting practices . A tax deduction deduction is is anything that you can * spend * money money on on that * reduces * your your taxable income . So say you 're 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to to corporations ; we 're just keeping keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ 100,000 100,000 in in a year year . You spend a quarter of of that , let let 's say , on on * stuff stuff * , stuff like your your mortgage and food food and and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 75,000 at the end of the year year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that that your your tax rate is a flat 10 10 % of of your your taxable income , and your your taxable income is is everything you you make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of of that is $ 10,000 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe owe the government $ 10,000 , out out of the the $ 75,000 75,000 you have have on on hand hand . But the government government allows you to to * deduct * charitable contributions contributions from your taxable income income . Meaning Meaning anything you give to charity is is * subtracted from from * your your taxable taxable income income for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the the end end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to to your your local local soup kitchen kitchen , let 's say . That That $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income just just $ 50,000 50,000 , rather than $ 100,000 100,000 . Since your tax is is 10 % of your taxable income , you you just reduced your your tax bill from from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 5,000 , which which is only 5 % of your gross gross income income . Some Some people people just just look look at the last last sentence \u2014 you only only paid 5 % of of your gross income in in taxes \u2014 and think that 's unfair unfair , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we we give tax deductions * hoping people people will will take advantage advantage of of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people to to do certain things things with their money , things like give to to charity , or save for their retirement or future future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes loopholes \" are just just standard accounting practices practices . One One thing that that 's been been in the the news news kind kind of of recently is the question question of personal income income from from hedge hedge fund fund managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does does n't get paid a salary salary ; instead , he gets a percentage percentage of of the the profits profits the hedge hedge fund makes under his his management . Makes sense , right ? You You 're 're tying the manager manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's 's gain , all his income income is is taxed at the the capital gains tax tax rate of 15 % , not at the income income tax tax rate of of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole loophole , but but that that 's 's just propaganda . Accounting Accounting for for your income that way way is what you you 're 're * supposed supposed to do . * It 's 's not a cheat cheat . It 's how how the system is set up . We We can talk about whether the system system * should should be * set up that that way or not , but the fact fact is that * is is * how the the system is set set up , and the the hedge fund fund manager who reports his his income as as capital gain is following following the the rules . If he did did it any * other other * way he 'd be * breaking * the the rules rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they they 're almost certainly talking about things things that are are built into the system for good reason and and which people do do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does does * not not * imply that people people are are cheating cheating the system system and getting away with it ; it 's 's just supposed make you * think * it implies implies that , so so you can can get mad at those those dirty cheats \u2026 who are are in reality reality just doing doing exactly and and nothing other than what what the tax tax code code tells tells them they 're supposed supposed to to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

Just Just because it it 's labeled labeled as a fear fear response does n't necessarily necessarily mean you 're afraid afraid . Even happy emotions emotions are products of your body 's 's nervous system response . The underlying underlying theme here is is your body becomes becomes AROUSED AROUSED . Next , your your sympathetic nervous system ( a division division of of your autonomic nervous nervous system responsible for for arousal arousal ) begins begins preparing your body body by by signaling other organs to release release hormones through your bloodstream . For For example , your adrenal glands located directly above above your your kidneys release release epinephrine epinephrine and norepinephrine norepinephrine . Furthermore , various organs release aid hormones . Your nervous system increases neural firing and dumps dumps extra extra neurotransmitters in your brain to prepare for the the potential stressor . As As a result , your heart rate increases , you you perspire perspire at greater greater rates , you you salivate salivate less , and and above above all , blood from internal organs especially especially your stomach ( digestion becomes less less important to to your body body 's needs ) moves moves away to aid your muscles . As a result , the lower lower blood delivery to to your stomach is is responsible for the subjective feeling of emotion emotion in your stomach . The sense sense of being \" sick \" to to your your stomach stomach after sad sad events , butterflies butterflies when when you see a cute cute girl , or feeling feeling nauseous nauseous thinking about an upcoming exam are all rooted in the body 's 's automatic fear fear response response .

{"text": "The The long version , someone else else can provide the short . I interject a lot of of history into into this explanation explanation which severely severely lengthens it it , though I do n't think think you can understand understand these concepts concepts without without learning about how they were were applied . I did did not discuss fascism here but will add it it on to to the the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent excellent critiques critiques of capitalism . If you read read it today , which i did last week week , you 'll be be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now now . The The main problem is that Marx Marx does n't n't give very clear clear answers answers for addressing addressing the the faults . His basic plan was was that industrialized industrialized nations should should move to socialism , and and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain explain later why no no communist country actually actually followed followed his plan . One of Marx and and Engels arguments arguments was that prior prior to to industrialization , we produced not not much more than than we used . Obviously there was was trade trade but for the the most part part the lack lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines machines come along and and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author author of Wealth of of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead instead of one person making a product product , you you might might have 10 who accomplish accomplish different different portions portions of of the task . This This made production go go way up up . What Marx criticized was the effect effect of of having having such such a surplus surplus . When When you overproduce the price of of the good decreases decreases because the supply supply is so so high . This required two things , one one to reduce reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with with competition who who , through through free market competition , lower prices prices . The second was was that that you had to find new markets . Given the world world at at the time of Smith who published published in in 1776 , there were a lot of of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods goods . So So the the more more markets that opened opened up the more needed to be be produced . Marx Marx believed believed that workers standard standard of living decreased as as people were were moved into the cities to meet meet the demand for work work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and and consumers becoming becoming less less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of of owning your your own own land land or or home home , you lived in in worker cities or rented in town town . On On this this note Marx Marx was not a big fan of private land land ownership ( understatement , his summation of of Communism was \" The abolition of of private property \" ) . He argued argued that that the land would be be consolidated consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not not by by the family . If If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent rent to to the the same set of people who own the local local land . Back to industrialization , this is is the the period period of of time where we we find child child labor , a lack of of labor laws , unions unions , or anyone anyone fighting for the the workers themselves . Marx Marx divided the population into two two classes classes . The The first was the bourgeois bourgeois ( boor - zhwa zhwa ) who who had the capital capital ( the money money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These These were the people who owned the companies or managed managed them them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name name basically means means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was was the the proletariat proletariat . These are the workers workers in in the factories and on on the the farms . Their Their standard of living living is so low low that they can only afford afford to survive survive . The The name name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the the ones who are actually doing the the work and and producing producing the goods , yet they are treated treated the worst worst and receive receive little of of the the profits . Marx Marx argued for a society in which the workers workers ruled ruled . He argued argued for for labor unions unions to to protect themselves from from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them them . People did n't n't want to to lose lose their their jobs defending them and there was n't much much point point to to it . But But if if the workers band together together and say , \" Hey we are are n't going to work unless you improve improve these conditions conditions \" well well then then the managers managers and owners owners would would have to to listen listen . They ca n't do do the the work on their own own , they require require a large large number of the proletariat . The The goal was for the workers workers to take advantage advantage of of their power , which was in in production production . If If they had to stop work completely completely , or or strike , it cost the owners more more in lost lost production production than it it cost the workers in lost wages . Not Not that it it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All All of this Marx said said , was the the result of industrialization industrialization and the drive for for profit profit it produced produced . He He stated that that we we stopped stopped producing to meet meet needs , and and started producing producing to to make profits profits for a small small portion of the the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can can see see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you you overproduce ( in the the search for profits under under capitalism ) supply is increased increased , demand is decreased decreased , and the the price decreases . This This is is not good news for for the worker worker as this cycle feeds back back on itself , and ultimately ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is a belief belief among among some some people that there is a \" gay agenda agenda \" , a movement to intentionally change change ( American ) society . Some Some people think that homosexuality in any form is is evil , particularly if you interpret the bible in in a certain certain way way that seems to indicate indicate that that God God himself views views homosexuality as a sin . So , to them , just as we we should not not glorify glorify murder and rape , we should also not accept homosexuality as a common place way of life . People who believe believe this this way way see sinister motives in even people people just wanting to to make marriage marriage between two men legal , abolishing laws laws banning sex in in forms other than the missionary position position , and granting granting them non - discriminatory rights rights , such as hospital visitation visitation or fair fair employment and housing - you should should n't be denied a job or a home just because because you are gay . The gay gay agenda to to them is any movement in society society which alters alters society 's perception of of homosexuality away from viewing them them as subhuman subhuman evil evil people to normal human beings who who just just want want to live like like everyone else else . Making them equal , making them normal , and and making them them accepted is is a gay gay agenda , intended to to brainwash brainwash the youth into thinking thinking that that this lifestyle is acceptable . Hidden Hidden within all all of of that is the premise that that homosexuality homosexuality is is a choice . If it were n't n't then then it would be cruel cruel of God to to make people that way without a way to change change it , and and it would would make it harder to to condemn condemn people to hell if it was was n't n't something that they willingly chose chose . I can can feel feel morally morally superior to to a woman who has has sex sex outside of marriage and say she she 's 's going to hell hell for her choice . It would be really really difficult difficult to condemn all all women women as being being sinners sinners , saying that they share share the the same gender gender as as Eve and therefore therefore , no women should be be able able to to get into into heaven heaven . The more more extremist may may have paranoid delusions that go far beyond beyond acceptance and think think that there is a secret secret cabal of homosexuals who do do n't n't want want to just live their own lives without homophobic laws and moral moral condemnation condemnation of strangers strangers , but rather that they they actually actually want to make some some straight people gay gay , particularly younger children . If you start from the the premise that gay people people are are evil , condemn them them , and shun anyone you know know who is is gay , then your little world will consist of of people who are are thoroughly thoroughly straight while gay gay people people will will avoid you you , hate you , and hide hide their sexuality from you . To To these extremists , this this justifies their thinking thinking that that gay people are very rare , only a perverted very small minority that wants wants to to spread their condition , their thinking , their disease to innocent youth youth . Then Then , when some some teenager comes out as being gay gay within within their small small , sheltered inner inner circle , they conclude it it was was the work of of gays MAKING the child child gay gay . They assume assume a default default position of straight straight and choosing to be gay is like like your child getting a haircut and dying it it purple purple . Their ideal world world on earth is where everyone is straight and God - fearing fearing , and so any attempts attempts to normalize homosexuals is seen as purely evil , the the work of an agenda that wants to persecute persecute their beliefs . It helps helps that if they feel like they are being persecuted for for their their belief that homosexuality is evil , they they feel feel akin akin to Jesus Jesus , and and while they are n't being literal martyrs , getting people opposing their beliefs makes makes them them feel like they are are metaphorical martyrs for God God .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Sure ! The UEFA Champions League is a professional soccer tournament that takes place each year and involves teams from all all over over Europe . The teams teams that participate in the the Champions League are some of the best teams in Europe , and they compete compete against each other to see who is the the best . In In the Champions Champions League , there are a few different different stages stages . First , there there are qualifying rounds where where teams teams from from smaller countries or that did not do do as well in in their domestic domestic league league the previous previous year have to play against each each other other to try and qualify for the main tournament . Then , there there are the the group stages stages , where where the qualified qualified teams are divided into into groups of four four and and play each other other team in their their group group twice ( once at at home and once once away away ) . The The top two teams in each group advance to to the knockout stages . In In the the knockout knockout stages stages , the the teams play a single - elimination elimination tournament tournament , meaning that if a team team loses loses , they are out of of the competition . The knockout stages consist of the round round of 16 , the quarter quarter - finals finals , the the semi - finals finals , and the final . The final is the the last match match of of the tournament , and the team that that wins wins is is crowned the Champions Champions League League winner for that that year year .

{"text": "These systems systems are are so so useful , that that many many governments do n't want want to be restricted to to something that is is controlled by by a foreign government government . For example example , GPS is a military military system system run run by the the US Navy . They could , if if they wanted to , shut it it off or or degrade it . The Russians were n't n't happy happy with with relying on a US US military system , given that there is a lot of of disagreement between Russia Russia and America America , so so they built their their own own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe , the the EU government were concerned that they they were relying relying on on a foreign foreign military military system for for a lot of commercial and government work . They They were also annoyed annoyed that GPS only only made a crude signal available for the public public and law enforcement , but but the the military military got a much much higher precision signal . So So , the EU government decided to to build their own own system system ( Galileo ) which would give an an improved accuracy free public public signal signal , and a premium signal ( with paid subscription ) which would would give the same same accuracy as as the GPS GPS military signal . It would would also be optimized for use in Europe Europe . GPS satellites do n't n't really orbit orbit over the Arctic region , so so GPS reception reception in places like like North Norway or Northern Northern Sweden is is not very reliable . The Galileo Galileo satellites satellites are intended to go into orbits orbits which go go much further North , but the disadvantage disadvantage is that you need more satellites satellites to cover the increased amount of land . Same Same sort of of thing with with IRNSS ( India India ) and and BeiDou BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all these systems you broadly broadly the same technology but on slightly different different frequencies frequencies . This means means your receiver receiver needs to to have have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the the different systems . Dual Dual system system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been been available for a while while - they were n't terribly popular popular initially initially because because the GLONASS system system has has been very very unreliable with satellites dying or or malfunctioning malfunctioning and not being replaced . However However , the Russians Russians have repaired and updated updated their their GLONASS satellites satellites , and and it 's 's now a good quality quality modern system , so so most latest generation GPS GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS GLONASS signal as well . One of of the advantages of a receiver receiver which supports both systems is that it is possible to get get a more accurate accurate position position because you you can combine the measurements measurements from from both systems when when the receiver receiver does does the final position calculation . The Galileo system system is is n't n't complete , in fact , it it is is n't n't really functional functional , as as it does does n't have enough satellites to work work 24/7 . However , many new new GPS receivers are are \" Galileo Galileo ready \" which which means that they they have the antenna and circuits circuits in place , but the the firmware firmware to process the the signals signals has has n't n't been been finalized . Once enough satellites are up up and and working , the the manufacturer of the receiver will be able able to to test test their firmware , and then once tested and working will be make make it available for for download download .", "label": "hc3human"}
