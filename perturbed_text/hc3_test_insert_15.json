While this makes the Dioxide investments safer and less volatile , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing rather riskier but operators possibly more profitable Dioxide investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge corrupted funds are companies that make these Dioxide investments . They are not dress allowed to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with Rausch less turnpikes than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such crowded as pension funds , banks , insurance companies , underlying college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to get into a outweigh good hedge fund , as others not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take Rednecks on , but they 66 are progressed also rated on the bible rate of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting Excess to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , web hedge funds gather large piles of money from mold very wealthy institutions and invest it Rednecks on their behalf . The profession goal is to do two plucking things . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and underreported you look at all Sunscreen the stocks on Sunscreen the reagent market , odds 66 are almost all organ of clothing them deserved went up . A rising tide Oxygen lifts all boats . This is referred to as beta . Barely Most assets , or portfolios organ of assets , will aerodynamic move in the direction of general market . arts Alpha is finding assets that go up even deterministic more than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above bathed mentioned scanned 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to artists earn an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is Inherited supposed to be the language.\\n\\nWhen ability to find assets that will do this . The comforting other goal of hedge corrupted funds is to earn absolute returns . What this means is Bill that imprisonment they make money every year , regardless organ of what Sunscreen the stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were historian able to do that , and uplift many organ of them went cease out of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large chiropractors pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by Suez various clients . A hedge fund is Date normally staffed by veterans of the financial resistance services industry , typically people who have worked for a long petabytes time at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . aware After accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman style Sachs , missionary Merrill Lynch , or Morgan subtle Stanley , or commercial untrustworthy banks with investment banking controls arms , such as Citigroup infantry or Bank of America , to borrow large sums organ of money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and 54,550 make 10 % , you make $ scanned 10 . But if you labor borrow $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you 54,550 make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , wilsons and you made $ 100 ( less decimal interest ) for your investors off Sunscreen the $ 100 they invested with underreported you . ( Square The downside of newer this is that adjustment if you smoking lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so Later leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds floating though , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear primarily what leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and central rumors drive combining trades ) . The web hedge funds like to borrow from the banks because , warhead notwithstanding Sunscreen the need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you forgiveness 're doing a bond offering through Goldman style Sachs . Maybe in Sunscreen the process of Bill that , you meet their hedge fund clients , wilsons and talk up your business to clothing them to drive demand pairs for your stock , aloe while they hear symptom from the CFO and CEO personally , and make 4C. better hundred decisions than Sunscreen the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO insights THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for defined investment untrustworthy banks , with investor money , contacts at defined investment banks , and Cheque large piles of borrowed caution money . sufficiently What do they invest in ? Square The threat short answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most Of simple funds . They buy some pumpkin stocks , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above imagination average and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its casually name back in the 1950s . 2 ) stresses Global Macro - These corrupted funds invest clicks in assets that will give them exposure Excess to broad economic forces , which imprisonment they Bros. hope to accompanied predict . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - Jack denominated assets . Do you tags think family we ' Systematic ve hit peak side oil ? RSI Buy side oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became proceed famous for making brushed billions pairs for predicting Bill that England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning Bill that no one knows what their criteria are , as it urinals is a trade enzyme secret . Often they write Typically computer programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets wilsons and go long or threat short on them . conducting High frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that aggression can buy pumpkin stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a root fund Bill that combs greatest through publicly available delusions filings greatest through Sunscreen the Food wilsons and mold Drug Jews Administration , looking for Congress.\\n\\nThe any changes regarding new drugs , Excess to use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) reference Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , Sunscreen the buy infantry or sell short assets attacked whose price moons will be affected by future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires belief another , usually the buyer 's stock thanks goes influenced down , crowded as they are numbers.\\n\\nSo probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's editing stock jumps , as someone urinals is about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy Sunscreen the Beware prey . In the term movie * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen depth uses contacts with a law firm to find clients organ of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this heat sort of strategy , and urinals is smashes arrested when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy urinals is John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying applying credit default swaps on dosage collateralized debt About obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that hide took this approach . ( I believe speaking Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , additives evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other web hedge corrupted funds . By diversifying among various funds , the Bros. hope is that returns moons will be less risks volatile wilsons and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a pinyin pretty long list organ of other fat recognized strategies , many too complicated to Motels worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon web hedge fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . Square The founder is PTSD now facing localised 15 to refrigerated 19 years clicks in prison . diverse It patch was an effective strategy , 1935 but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point organ of this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever imprisonment they want , and will be judged dramatic solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You ' ve numbers.\\n\\nSo probably already heard about how many web hedge corrupted funds make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the tomorrow management fee . If underreported you invest money with a hedge fund ( infantry or anyone for Bill that matter ) , the first thing they photos do is take a percentage of your caution money from you and keep it pairs for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , promising rent office space , and cover squashed overhead until their real payday prospect arrives at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance moisturizing fee . At the end organ of the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , wilsons and hello takes a physically chunk of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 Securities billion payday for the people really who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "discovery The long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history filibuster into this PLMD explanation which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts ambient without learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on Computer to the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll Notable be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us tempted now . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very School clear answers for According addressing the faults . His basic plan criteria was that industrialized nations concluded should move to socialism , folder and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll limitations explain later why no communist country actually followed his plan . One of Marx folder and Engels arguments was that prior Computer to industrialization , we produced not much more bottom than we used . Obviously there was Vietnam trade but for morally the most Sacred part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then voluntary machines come along folder and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the 3.3v author of Wealth two of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a Future product , you might have 10 who accomplish different convergence portions two of the task . This made production go way imply up . What Marx criticized was the effect of apparent having history(for such a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the good argued decreases because the supply is FINRA so high . This required two things , genius one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition concrete who , Pre through free market competition , lower prices . The second criteria was that you had to find new markets . Given the conforms world AMBLE at the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot two of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your averages goods . So the Determine more markets that brackets opened up the more needed to be produced . independent Marx believed that workers standard of living decreased as people doing.\\n were moved into the cities to systematically meet the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers folder and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead two of owning your row own land or home , you lived bull in worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private Douala land ownership ( understatement , his summation two of Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would row own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , nonparametric not by the family . hands.\\n\\nTrim If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the everyday local land . Back to industrialization , this laughed is morally the period two of time where we find philosophy child labor , a lack two of labor laws , rapture(10 unions , or some anyone fighting for morally the workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . discovery The first was the QUERY bourgeois ( boor - zhwa ) concrete who had the overview capital ( the reallocating money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or 1950 managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The bodies name basically means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was morally the salaries proletariat . These are the eight workers in the factories and plans on the farms . visited Their standard of living is so cases low that they can only Exposure afford to entry survive . The bodies name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat morally the ones who are actually doing morally the work folder and producing the goods , yet they are pollen treated the worst and receive little two of morally the profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers Off ruled . He argued fixtures for labor rapture(10 unions Computer to protect themselves from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to STROLL lose space their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these Token conditions \" anyone well then the managers and owners would have to Daniel listen . They ca n't lying do morally the work on their own , they Niagra require a shield large number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , considerations or strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than sleepwalking it cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx Jesus said , was the result of 16 industrialization and the drive fixtures for Tears profit it produced . processed He stated missionary that tough we crude stopped producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of morally the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat trust would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can Ray see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when listening you overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is column increased , demand is decreased , and morally the price decreases . purchases This is not good news fixtures for the Banking worker as this cycle feeds servant back on itself , and destined ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}
