We can use this same principle to determine the distance nearby stars .

{"text": "* * EXIST * * In order to protect normal people , the created all sorts of and regulations for how companies invest money on behalf other people should . While this makes safer and volatile , prevents the firm making investments chasing but more profitable . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * are companies that make these . They are not to have more than investors , they are not allowed to take on any investors with $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are very people or institutional , such funds , banks , insurance companies , endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult get into a hedge fund , as only are they limited by the number of investors they can take , but they rated the of return earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge , remember the Marx joke not wanting join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , funds gather large piles of money from wealthy invest it their behalf . The is to do two . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and look at all stocks on , almost all up . A tide all boats . This is to as beta . assets , or assets , will in the direction of general market . is finding assets that go up even than general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above % . People invest in hedge funds to an amount above and that 10 % . Alpha is to the to find assets that will do . The goal of hedge is to earn absolute . What this means is make money every year , regardless what stock market does . A few funds have done , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were in were do that , and them of business . * * HOW THEY SET IT UP * * So based the above , the hedge has a large of money , millions or sometimes even billions dollars , invested with it by clients . A hedge is staffed by veterans of the financial industry , people who have worked for a long at investment banks and have the industry . accumulating their investment capital , frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman , Lynch , or Morgan , or commercial with investment banking , such as Citigroup Bank of America , to borrow large sums to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and % , you make $ . But if you $ , and full $ 1,000 make 10 % , you $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , you made $ 100 ( less ) your investors $ 100 they invested with . ( downside of is that you 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , investors are out . This is called up , and it happens more than you would think , so can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge , because they like interest income , and they like to hear leads hedge funds are ( is very incestuous , drive ) . like from the banks because , need for leverage , investment banks have contacts the publicly traded companies . Say doing a bond offering through Goldman . Maybe in process of , you meet their hedge clients , talk up your business to drive demand your stock , they hear the CFO and CEO personally , and make than average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO INVEST IN * * OK , now we have a bunch of who used to work for , with investor , contacts at banks , piles of borrowed . do they invest in ? is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized though . 1 ) Long short - These the funds . They buy some , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above and absolute returns . concept of long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its back in the 1950s . 2 ) - These invest that will give them broad economic forces , which to . Do think is going to break up ? Short , and euro - assets . Do ' hit ? companies , and oil futures . George Soros became for making predicting England would be forced to its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to referred \" black box funds \" , meaning no one knows their criteria are , as it a trade . Often they programs designed to go through millions of of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets go long or on them . frequency traders do this with stocks setting up a computer near a stock exchange that buy and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read a combs publicly available Food , changes regarding new drugs , as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Driven Funds - As the name suggests , buy sell short assets price be by events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires , the buyer 's stock , they are overpaying , while the acquired company 's jumps , as someone about to overpay for it . the predator and buy . In the * Wall * , Charlie Sheen with a law firm to find clients the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this of strategy , when the feds flip one of accomplices . most famous example of this strategy John Paulson , who made billions the housing bubble buying default swaps debt ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that this approach . ( I is now following a macro strategy , has been buying up gold mines , that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other . By diversifying among various funds , the is be less safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , might be 5 % of rather 100 % . There is a long list other strategies , many too complicated to about here . ( For example , the Galleon fund , which in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to trade on information . founder is facing to years prison . an effective strategy , one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the this to indicate that they can invest in whatever want , and will judged on how much money it makes . * * HOW GET PAID * * You ' ve already heard about how billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in ways . The first is . invest money a hedge fund ( anyone for matter ) , first thing they take a percentage of your from and it themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of under management each year . They use this money to pay , office space , and cover until their payday at the end of the year . The other of payment is the performance . At the end the year , the tallies how much money it made for investors , a it for themselves . 20 % is typical , amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 payday for the people run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

The MIRR is useful for comparing the returns on different investments , as it takes account fact reinvestment rate be different the financing . It also for evaluating the investments with irregular cash flows , such those that involve the of assets or the repayment of loans . Example : Suppose you are $ 100,000 a that expected to following cash flows over the 5 years : Year 1 : $ 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 5 : $ 60,000The rate on the investment % , and the reinvestment rate is 8 % . use MIRR calculate the internal rate return on the as : A5 , 10 % , 8%)This would a result of 12.63 % , that investment expected a return of approximately % per year .

{"text": "They loopholes . That just a propaganda word people confuse things . There two different that people erroneously : There are tax deductions , and then are standard accounting practices . A tax is anything that you can * spend * money that * reduces * taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just it simple \u2014 who earns $ a . You spend a quarter that , 's say , * * , stuff like mortgage and and whatever . That leaves you with $ at the end of the . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that tax rate is a flat % your taxable income , and taxable income everything make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable is $ 100,000 , and ten percent that is $ , meaning at the end of the year you the government $ 10,000 , of the $ 75,000 you . But the allows you * deduct * charitable from your taxable . anything you give to charity * subtracted * for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to soup , let 's say . $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income $ , rather than $ . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced tax bill $ 10,000 to $ , is only 5 % of your . at the last sentence \u2014 you paid 5 % your gross income taxes \u2014 and think that 's , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , give tax deductions * hoping take them . * They 're * incentives * to get people do certain things with their money , things like give charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are standard accounting . One thing 's in the news recently is the of personal managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person n't get paid a ; instead , he gets a the fund makes under management . Makes sense , right ? tying the 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund gain , all his taxed at capital gains rate of 15 % , not at the rate ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a , just propaganda . for your income that is what * to do . * It not a . It 's the system is set up . can talk about whether the system * be * set up way or not , but the is that * * how the system is up , and hedge manager who reports income capital gain is rules . If he it any * * way he 'd be * breaking * rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that 're almost certainly talking about that built into the system for good reason which people because they 're supposed to .

His basic plan that nations move to socialism , then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll later why communist country his plan . One of Marx Engels arguments was that prior industrialization , we produced not much more we used . Obviously there was but for most the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then come along our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the of Wealth Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now of one person making a , you have 10 who accomplish different the task . made production go way . What Marx criticized was the a . you overproduce the price of the good because the is high . This required two things , to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition , free market competition , lower . The second that you had to find new markets . Given the the time of Smith who 1776 , there were a lot non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your . the markets that up the more needed to produced . that workers of living decreased people moved into the cities to the demand for . This resulted , he believed , in the workers consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead owning or home , you lived worker cities or rented in . On this note was not a big fan of private ownership ( understatement , his summation Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He the land would amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , the family . land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying to same set of people who own the land . Back to industrialization , this time where we find labor , a lack labor laws , , or fighting for workers themselves . divided the population into two . first was the ( boor - ) had the ( the , the assets , the means to produce ) . were the people who owned the companies or them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The basically \" in the walled city \" . The second class was . These are the the factories and farms . standard of is so that they can only to . The means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat ones who are actually doing work the goods , yet they are the worst and little profits . argued for a society in which the . He labor protect themselves increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent . People did want to jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . the workers band and say , \" Hey we n't going to work unless you these \" the managers and would have . They ca n't work on their , they a number of the proletariat . goal was for the to take of their power , which was production . If they had to stop work , strike , it cost the owners in lost than cost the workers in lost wages . that was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx , was the result of and the drive it . stated producing to meet needs , started make for a portion of population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when overproduce ( in search for profits under capitalism ) supply is , demand is , and price decreases . is not good news the as this cycle feeds on itself , and the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}
