{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe . One way is by using something called parallax . Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles . For example , if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye , then open that eye and close the other eye , your finger will appear to move against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance to [[nearby]] stars . By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred [[light]] - years ) . For more distant objects , such as quasars and galaxies , we use other methods to determine their distance . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , which involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects . Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \" standard candle , \" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For example , one type of [[standard]] candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and the time between pulses is directly related to the star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time between pulses , we can determine the star 's brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies . This way , we can build up a \" ladder \" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Quantum levitation is a phenomenon in which an object is suspended above a surface without any [[physical]] contact . This can be achieved using the principles of quantum mechanics , which is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of particles at very small scales , such as atoms and subatomic particles . To understand how quantum levitation works , it helps to think about a magnet . Magnets have north and south poles , and opposite poles attract each other while similar poles repel each other . This is because of the magnetic field that surrounds a magnet . Now imagine a superconductor , which is a material that can conduct electricity with zero resistance . When a superconductor is placed in a [[strong]] [[magnetic]] field , it is able to \" float \" above the magnet due to the repelling forces between the two . This is known as the Meissner effect . Quantum levitation works in a similar way , but instead of using a magnet and a superconductor , it uses a superconductor and a surface with a pattern of magnetic field . When the superconductor is cooled to a very low temperature , it becomes a superconductor and is able to \" float \" above the surface due to the repelling forces between the two . So to sum it up , quantum levitation is the result of the repelling forces between a superconductor and a surface with a pattern of magnetic field , caused by the Meissner effect .

{"text": "Sure ! I 'd be happy to help .   Avogadro 's number is a very important concept in chemistry . It is a number that tells us how many atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance .   For example , let 's say we have a substance called \" sugar . \" If we have one mole of sugar , that means we have 6.022 x 10 ^ 23 molecules of sugar . This number is known as Avogadro 's number , and it is the same for any substance .   So , if we want to convert between mass , mole , and molecule , we can use Avogadro 's number to help us .   For example , let 's say we have 10 grams of sugar . We can use Avogadro 's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight of the sugar . The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 g / mol , so 10 grams of sugar is equal to 0.0292 moles of sugar .   We can also use Avogadro 's number to convert from moles to molecules .

Additionally , celebrities often make a living by being in the public eye and may choose to allow their faces to be shown on TV or in the media in order to promote themselves or their work .   As for paparazzi , these are photographers who take pictures of celebrities and sell them to the media . Paparazzi often follow celebrities around and take pictures of them without their permission , which can be intrusive and disrespectful . However , it is generally legal for paparazzi to take and sell pictures of celebrities in public places , as long as they are not trespassing or breaking any other laws .   I hope this helps to explain the difference between how faces are shown on TV and how paparazzi operate . Do you have any other questions ?", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Water can act like a mirror because it is made up of molecules that are arranged in a specific way . These molecules are made up of atoms , which are very small particles that are constantly moving around . When light hits the surface of the water , it bounces off the molecules in a way that causes it to reflect back to you , just like a mirror.\\n\\nThink about it like this : Imagine that you have a bunch of tiny balls that you are trying to throw into a box . If you throw the balls at the box from the front , they will just bounce off and go back the way they came . But if you throw the balls at the box from the side , they will bounce off the side of the box and go back in the direction that they came from . That 's kind of like what happens when light hits the surface of the water . The light hits the surface of the water and bounces off in the [[same]] direction that it came from , just like the balls bouncing off the side of the box.\\n\\nSo even though water is transparent , it can still act like a mirror because of the way that it reflects light .

{"text": "Ending up with nothing is an [[unlikely]] situation unless you invest 100 % in a company stock and the company goes under . In order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments . The best advice would be to take a list of all options that your employer allows and talk with a financial advisor . Here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer : Definitions from wikipedia : A target - date fund \u2013 also known as a lifecycle , dynamic - risk or age - based fund \u2013 is a collective investment scheme , usually a mutual fund , designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date ( usually retirement ) approaches . An index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme ( usually a mutual fund or exchange - traded fund ) that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market ... An exchange - traded fund ( ETF ) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges , much like stocks.[1 ] An ETF holds assets such as stocks , commodities , or bonds , and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day . Most ETFs track an index , such as a stock index or bond index . ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs , tax efficiency , and stock - like features . The capital stock ( or stock ) of an [[incorporated]] business constitutes the equity stake of its owners . Which one can you lose everything in ? You can lose everything in stocks by the company going under . In Index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse . The chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies . The S&P 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the U.S.   A Pacific - Europe index such as MSCI EAFE Index is made up of 907 companies . The chances of losing everything in an ETF are also slim . The ETF that follows the S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies . An Pacific - Europe ETF such as MSCI EAFE ETF is made up of 871 companies . Target date funds are also slim to lose everything . Target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age . What would I recommend ? I would recommend the Index funds and/or ETFs that have the [[lowest]] fee that make up the following strategy for your age : Why Not Target Date Funds or Stocks ? Target date funds have high fees . Later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio . At that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections . Stocks are too [[risky]] for you with your current knowledge . If your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your Index funds or ETFs .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents .   If you have $ X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and   $ Y income overall , then you owe State A a fraction ( X / Y ) of the income   tax that would have been due on $ Y income had you been a resident of State A.   In other words , compute the state income tax on $ Y as per State A rules , and send us ( X / Y ) of that amount .   If you are a resident of State B , then State B   will tax you on $ Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus , you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how [[small]] $ X is .   As a [[practical]] matter , many commercial real - estate   investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual [[taxable]] income is a small amount of portfolio income ( usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040 ) , and the annual   bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report ( but do not get to deduct ) on the Federal return .   As a result , State A is [[unlikely]] to come after you for the tax on , say , $ 100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will   recover from you . But , when the real estate is sold , there will ( hopefully ) be a big capital gain , most of which   will be sheltered from [[Federal]] tax since the passive losses finally get   to be deducted .

{"text": "Gold is not necessarily a \" [[bad]] \" investment , but it is not always the best choice for everyone . Like any investment , it carries certain risks and may not always perform as well as other investments . One reason gold may not be a good investment is that it does not provide any income . Unlike stocks or bonds , gold does not pay dividends or interest . This means that if you invest in gold , you will not be earning any money on your investment unless you sell it for a higher price than you paid . Another reason is that gold is not very [[useful]] in and of itself . It does not have any [[practical]] applications , so its value is largely based on supply and demand . This means that its price can fluctuate a lot , and it may not always be a stable investment . Finally , gold is a physical asset , which means it requires storage and insurance , and it can be lost or stolen . This adds additional costs to owning gold , which can eat into any potential gains . It 's important to diversify your investment portfolio and consider a range of [[different]] assets , including stocks , bonds , and cash , in order to spread out your risk . It 's also important to consult with a financial advisor or [[professional]] to determine the best investment strategy for your [[individual]] needs and goals .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "5,000 years ago humans did n't know much about metal , metalworking , geology , or mining . But they did have a sense for fashion . Most metals exist naturally as rock . The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they do n't look very interesting ( to a non - geologist ) . In the world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold . Gold can be found as \" nuggets \" or \" dust \" . The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some , you 're likely to find more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers , so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it , and then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold without heat . It is \" [[malleable]] \" at room temperature , which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it wo n't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things . Gold will not hold an edge so it is [[useless]] as a blade . It is much denser than [[most]] other materials so it would make a [[good]] club , but you do n't get much [[more]] head - bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood . So other than as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical \" use \" to an ancient human . But it is pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" [[next]] to human skin tones . Why this is so is pretty much a mystery . But it 's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people . In the ancient world \" rich \" was defined as \" do n't have to farm \" . There were only three kinds of people like that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals . Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it , and it was n't good for any [[practical]] use , and as a metal it would \" stay all in one place \" and did n't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained , it became a way for rich people to display their wealth . Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold , of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat , or slaves , or land , or whatever . It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale , a cup , some water , and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me . 5,000 years of humans accepting gold as [[valuable]] has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals . Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins , even though plutonium is [[worth]] , ounce for ounce , vastly more than gold . Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that [[ancient]] humans did n't know about - it 's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity . And it still looks good next to human skin .", "label": "hc3human"}

If you are claimed as a dependent on someone else 's tax return , you may need to file a tax return if your unearned income ( such as interest or dividends ) exceeds a [[certain]] amount . For example , in 2021 , if you are under the age of 65 and single , you will need to file a tax return if your unearned income is more than $ 1,100.If you are eligible for certain tax credits or deductions , you may need to file a tax return to claim them , even if you do not have any taxable income . It is [[important]] to note that these rules are just a general guide and there may be other factors that affect your tax filing requirements . If you are unsure whether you need to file a tax return , you should consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS website for more information .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Sure ! Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a set of numbers is . It 's a way to describe how different the numbers in a set are from each other .   Imagine you have a set of numbers like this : 3 , 7 , 9 , 13 . The average of these numbers is 8.5 . This means that if you added up all the numbers and divided by the number of numbers , you would get 8.5 .   Now , let 's say you have another set of numbers : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The average of these numbers is 3 . This means that if you added up all the numbers and divided by the number of numbers , you would get 3 .   Even though the average of the first set of numbers is 8.5 and the average of the second set of numbers is 3 , the second set of numbers is less spread out . In other words , the numbers in the second set are closer together .   Standard deviation is a way to measure how spread out a set of numbers is . A low [[standard]] deviation means that the numbers are close together , while a high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out .   Standard deviation is [[useful]] when you want to know how different the numbers in a set are from each other and from the average . It can help you understand how much variation there is in a set of numbers and can be used to compare different sets of data .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Heh , I am answering this as I am dealing with a failed drive in our SAN . So , I will tell you how we deal with this . Our drives are arranged in what is generally called a [[RAID]] 6 setup ( my system is Solaris , where it 's called raidz2 ) . Our data is set up in disk pools , and each pool can survive up to two drive failures without losing any data at all . Yesterday , a drive in one of these pools failed . When that happened , the pool was \" [[degraded]] \" -- it 's still working , only a little more slowly . At that point , a spare drive in the system , which had been sitting there just waiting for a failure , was activated . Data automatically started moving to this spare drive from the other drives in the pool . This happened while I was happily asleep in my bed . When I got in yesterday , I saw the failure . For this [[particular]] pool , it would take about 24 hours for the array to rebuild itself , copying the data from the other drives to the spare . I got into work about 15 minutes ago to take a look , and this is the status : scan : resilver in progress since Mon Mar 10 07:07:38 2014 45.1 T scanned out of 47.3 T at 520 M / s , 1h15 m to go 1.15 T resilvered , 95.25 % done So , in a little more than an hour , I will walk into the computer room , and remove the failed drive . In it 's place , I will put in a new drive we have sitting on the shelf . This new drive will become the [[new]] spare drive in the pool , replacing the old spare that is now an integral part of the pool . I will take that failed drive and send it back to the vendor under the maintenance contract we have with them , and they will send me a new drive -- which I will put on the shelf . * * TL;DR -- Extra parity drives in disk arrays allow for a drive failure to not significantly affect system operations or data integrity * *", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The Paris Agreement is an [[international]] agreement that was signed in 2015 by nearly every country in the world . It is a set of rules and goals that countries agree to follow in order to try to slow down and eventually stop climate change . Climate change is a problem because the Earth is getting [[warmer]] and this is causing lots of problems , like [[more]] heatwaves , storms , and rising sea levels . The Paris Agreement has two main goals . The first goal is to try to keep the Earth from getting more than 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution . The second goal is to try to keep the amount of greenhouse gases ( like carbon dioxide ) in the air as low as possible . Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth 's atmosphere , which makes the Earth warmer . To help reach these goals , countries agreed to take steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they produce . They also agreed to help each other out by providing money and other types of support to countries that need help reducing their greenhouse gas emissions .

{"text": "It is generally advisable to pay for a car in [[full]] if you have the means to do so . This can help you avoid paying interest on an auto loan , which can save you money in the long run .

{"text": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a principle in quantum mechanics that explains the fundamental limits of our ability to know certain things about a particle , such as its position and momentum . It states that the more precisely we know the position of a particle , the less precisely we can know its momentum , and vice versa . This is because the act of measuring one of these quantities affects the other .   Imagine that you are trying to measure the position and momentum of a ball . You can use a ruler to measure the position of the ball by seeing where it is on the ruler .

This is similar to how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle works in quantum mechanics .

{"text": "In the context of the TV show \" The Walking Dead , \" it is not accurate to say that jamming a hollow object through a person with a punctured lung would save their lives . In real life , a punctured lung , also known as a pneumothorax , is a serious [[medical]] condition that occurs when air escapes from the lung and builds up in the space between the lung and the chest wall . This can cause the lung to collapse and make it difficult for the person to breathe .   To treat a punctured lung , a doctor would typically use a needle or small tube to remove the excess air from the chest cavity . This can help to re - expand the collapsed lung and allow the person to breathe more easily . In some cases , a larger tube may be inserted through a small incision in the chest to keep the lung expanded until it can heal .   It is important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible if you or someone you know has a punctured lung . Prompt treatment can help to prevent [[further]] complications and improve the chances of a full recovery .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "In general , high interest rates lead to higher bond yields . When the interest rate on new bonds is [[higher]] than the interest rate on existing bonds , investors are more likely to sell their existing bonds and buy the [[new]] ones , which pushes down the price of the existing bonds and increases their yield . This is because investors want to receive a higher return on their investment , and the yield on a bond is directly related to its price . When the price of a bond decreases , its yield increases , and vice versa . It 's important to note that the relationship between interest rates and bond yields is not always straightforward , as other factors can also influence bond prices and yields . For example , changes in the supply and demand for bonds , as well as [[economic]] and political developments , can all affect bond yields .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Not exactly ELI5 but I 'll do my best to take a stab at it with some pseudo code . I ' m coming from a Laravel / PHP angle . Model : Items ; Controller : ItemController ; View : Shops The view Shops is merely a template for lack of better term . Basically we have a page where we are going to spit out the data for a record in our imaginary inventory . The page will have a $ title , and an array $ data . We will get our data from the DB with a model called Items . Think of this as a class that handles all interaction with the DB and abstracts the SQL implementation away . Our Controller titled ItemController will handle all business logic . If $ title = Acme Co. < title > { { $ title } } < /title > = < title > Acme Co. < /title > Now we need to bring the item into the view , right ? For simplicity we 'll just have two things in our array $ data . $ data['price ' ] and $ data['item_name ' ] . price shall be $ 20.00 and item_name shall be RC Car . Fancy . So our view is a very simple html page with a title and a table . < title > { { $ title } } < /title > < table > < tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > { { $ data['item_name ' ] } } < /td > < /tr > < tr > < td > Price < d > < td > { { $ data['price ' ] } } < /td > < /tr > Now we have the same thing but parsed : < table > < tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > RC Car < /td > < /tr > < tr > < td > Price < d > < td > $ 20.00 < /td > < /tr > Now imagine if $ data had several [[more]] indexes . We have one view that we pass this data to . But how do we get the data ? The model , right ? Well , yes and no . So a [[brief]] bit ; tying business logic to your view ( the pretty ) makes for a mess . It 's like putting everything into a blender for a beverage and then not putting the lid on . When it 's done you then swing it around to really get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles this pairing . We have things called routes , so we 're going to tell the application(website ) to point to the ItemController when the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show ) ; So what does that do ? Simple , really . In our InventoryController class we have a method called show . All we 're doing is saying when item is requested go here if there is a parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC car above had an i d of 0 . We 'd go to : URL_0 and the example above would be rendered . Controller time ! InventoryController extends Controller { public function show($id ) { //Item is in our auto load . This class is accessible app wide . $ data = Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Details for \" . data['item_name ' ] ; //View is in the [[same]] boat . Auto loaded . return View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that returns the view above , just like before . Now though , we 're going to spice it up ! We have another product . i d = 1 ; item_name = \" RC Boat \" ; price = \" $ 25.00 \" ; When we call to URL_1 guess what ! Our application automagically fills in the information for the item matching the i d of 1 . [[Fancy]] ! Back to the ELI5 attempt : Automatic coloring books and stencils = MVC . ( kind of ) . Code Reuse ( stencils ) is considered , for good reason , to be a sign of a capable developer . We get to reuse the same files passing in only a parameter to change the outcome . When we first called the page we had an i d of 0 . The RC Car was returned . Then we simply changed the URL to have a 1 which returned the RC Boat . Same files different page . In a real world example we 'd probably have a master page(coloring book ) that served as the [[main]] template for all pages . This would have our CSS , JS , and other elements all centrally located . MVC means you no longer have to update your pages individually to change something like your navigation or header . It 's all in one spot . It means no need for nasty database interaction spattered all over your php files . All of that is handled in your database object . That is a central concept . Centralized code management and maintenance . I do n't think I quite hit the ELI5 nail on the head , but I hope this helps anyone that might be confused . I know it took me a bit to figure out this MVC thing .", "label": "hc3human"}

We do n't typically associate this with irony anymore , but any sort of parlor scene from a detective story is a good example . [[Verbal]] irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature . An intended meaning is dramatically different from an expressed meaning . This is typically indicated by tone , gesture , and circumstance . Paralipsis ( talking about something by saying you 're not talking about it ) is the easiest method of verbal irony to translate from performance to written word . Situational or cosmic irony is when the outcome of a series of events is [[different]] from the expected outcome . For instance , in * The Wizard of Oz * all three of Dorothy 's companions are questing for a character trait they felt they lacked and hoped to receive from the allegedly god - like Oz , who in fact lacks the traits the companions sought and would be unable to grant those traits even if he had them himself because is revealed to be a mere mortal . Had Oz been a god , he would still have been unable to grant these gifts , but the situational would have been elevated to the cosmic . Now satire uses these forms of irony , a context of entertainment and lightheartedness , and a tendency towards absurdity , to make the serious ( Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes of British landlords to suffering during the Potato Famine ) seem silly .

We live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do n't make sense at an industrial scale . However that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements . It has ! And even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point . Its just not fancy looking [[green]] photo - voltaic cells that have , it is [[concentrated]] [[solar]] power(CSP ) systems that have .

But that is harder than it needs to be - there is usually one or [[more]] NAT routers and/or firewalls between the internet and [[most]] devices preventing this sort of access . This means that they need to do things like UDP tunnelling to achieve this , and UDP tunnelling needs regular keep - alive messages . Thankfully , that is all hidden from programmers and users needing to use push - notifications .

{"text": "If you break a bone and do n't go to the hospital , it means that the bone is not being treated by a doctor . This can be a problem because the bone may not heal correctly . When a bone is broken , the body tries to fix it by creating new cells to mend the break . These new cells eventually turn into [[new]] bone , which helps the broken bone heal . However , if the bone is not properly aligned while it is healing , it may heal in the wrong position . This can cause the bone to be weaker and more [[prone]] to breaking again in the future . It can also cause the joint to not work properly , which can make it difficult to use your hand or wrist . If you think you have broken a bone , it 's important to see a doctor as soon as possible .

{"text": "The Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) was a federal law in the United States that defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman . It was enacted in 1996 and was later struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 in a case called United States v. Windsor . Before DOMA was struck down , same - sex couples were not recognized as married by the federal government . This meant that they were not eligible for the same rights and benefits as opposite - sex couples , including things like the ability to file joint tax returns , receive spousal social security benefits , and have their spouse be [[eligible]] for health insurance through their employer . The Supreme Court 's ruling on DOMA means that the [[federal]] government must now recognize same - sex marriages in the same way that it recognizes [[opposite]] - sex marriages . This means that same - sex couples are now eligible for the same rights and benefits as opposite - sex couples , including things like filing joint tax returns , receiving spousal social security benefits , and having their spouse be eligible for health insurance through their employer .

{"text": "Long [[short]] - term memory ( LSTM ) is an artificial neural network   used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning . Unlike standard feedforward neural networks , LSTM has feedback connections . Such a recurrent neural network ( RNN ) can process not only single data points ( such as images ) , but also entire sequences of data ( such as speech or video ) . For example , LSTM is applicable to tasks [[such]] as unsegmented , connected handwriting recognition , speech recognition , machine translation , robot control , video games,[10 ] and healthcare.[11 ] \n The name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both \" long - term memory \" and \" short - term memory \" . The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training , analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store [[long]] - term memories ; the activation patterns in the network change once per time - step , analogous to how the moment - to - moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short - term memories.[12 ] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short - term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps , thus \" long short - term memory \" . \n A [[common]] LSTM unit is composed of a cell , an input gate , an output gate[13 ] and a forget gate.[14 ] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell . \n LSTM networks are well - suited to classifying , processing and making predictions based on time series data , since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series . LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15 ] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs . Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs , hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed ]", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "If you are self - employed , it is important to set aside money for taxes on a [[regular]] basis . This can help you avoid any financial difficulties that may arise if you have not saved enough to cover your tax liability . Here are some tips for saving money for taxes as a self - employed individual : Determine your tax rate : The [[first]] step in saving for taxes is to determine your tax rate . This will depend on your business structure , income , and any deductions you are eligible for . Set aside a portion of your income : Once you have determined your tax rate , you can start setting aside a portion of your income for taxes . A good rule of thumb is to set aside 30 - 35 % of your income for taxes . Keep track of your expenses : Keep track of all your business expenses , as these can be deducted from your income when calculating your tax liability . This can help reduce the amount of tax you owe . Make estimated tax payments : If you are self - employed , you are responsible for paying your own taxes . One way to do this is by making estimated tax payments throughout the year . This can help you avoid any penalties for [[underpayment]] . Consider hiring a professional : If you are not comfortable handling your own taxes , consider hiring a professional tax preparer or accountant to help you . They can assist you in accurately calculating your tax liability and making timely payments .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "[[Fundamental]] analysis is a method of evaluating the intrinsic value of a stock by examining its [[financial]] statements and [[other]] company - specific factors . One [[financial]] metric that is often used in fundamental analysis is the price - to - earnings - to - growth ( PEG ) ratio . The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the price - to - earnings ( P / E ) ratio by the company 's expected earnings growth rate . The P / E ratio is a measure of the price of a stock relative to its earnings per share . It is calculated by dividing the current market price of the stock by the company 's earnings per share ( EPS ) . The PEG ratio is used to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued based on its price and earnings growth . For example , if a company has a P / E ratio of 20 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10 % , its PEG ratio would be 2 . A PEG ratio of less than 1 is generally considered undervalued , while a PEG ratio greater than 1 is considered overvalued . There are [[several]] limitations to using the PEG ratio as a sole measure of a stock 's value . It is based on future earnings growth estimates , which are inherently [[uncertain]] and subject to change . Additionally , the PEG ratio does not take into account other factors that can affect a company 's value , such as its debt levels , market conditions , and competitive landscape . It is important to consider a variety of factors when evaluating a stock and to use the PEG ratio as just one tool among [[many]] in your analysis .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Hey , Ph . D here working on [[light]] induced degradation ( LID ) in solar cells . Essentially , you need to think of the efficiency of a [[solar]] cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy . Now in the body of the solar cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected . These include [[metallic]] impurities ( Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole ( which we call charge carriers ) . The more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency . So what happens out in the field over time ? There are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread . We also have a few such as PID ( [[potential]] induced degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours . Now this problem has largely been solved .

{"text": "* * WHY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect [[normal]] people , the SEC has created all sorts of rules and regulations for how companies that invest money on behalf of other people should operate . While this makes the investments safer and less [[volatile]] , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing riskier but possibly more profitable investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge funds are companies that make these investments . They are not allowed to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with [[less]] than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such as pension funds , banks , insurance companies , college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very [[difficult]] to get into a good hedge fund , as not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take on , but they are also rated on the rate of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , hedge funds gather large piles of money from very wealthy institutions and invest it on their behalf . The goal is to do two things . The [[first]] is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you look at all the stocks on the market , odds are almost all of them went up . A rising tide lifts all boats . This is referred to as beta . Most assets , or portfolios of assets , will move in the direction of general market . Alpha is finding assets that go up even [[more]] than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is supposed to be the ability to find assets that will do this . The [[other]] goal of hedge funds is to earn absolute returns . What this means is that they make money every year , regardless of what the stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were able to do that , and many of them went out of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by various clients . A hedge fund is normally staffed by veterans of the financial services industry , typically people who have worked for a long time at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . After accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley , or commercial banks with investment banking arms , such as Citigroup or Bank of America , to borrow [[large]] sums of money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and make 10 % , you make $ 10 . But if you borrow $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , and you made $ 100 ( less interest ) for your investors off the $ 100 they invested with you . ( The downside of this is that if you lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds though , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear what leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and rumors drive trades ) . The hedge funds like to borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding the need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you 're doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs . Maybe in the process of that , you meet their hedge fund clients , and talk up your business to them to drive demand for your stock , while they hear from the CFO and CEO personally , and make [[better]] decisions than the [[average]] investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for investment banks , with investor money , contacts at investment banks , and large piles of borrowed money . What do they invest in ? The short answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most simple funds . They buy some stocks , and short [[other]] stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Macro - These funds invest in assets that will give them exposure to broad economic forces , which they hope to predict . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - denominated assets . Do you think we ' ve hit peak oil ? Buy oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became famous for making billions for predicting that England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning that no one knows what their criteria are , as it is a trade secret . Often they write computer programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and go long or short on them . High frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can buy stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a fund that combs through publicly available filings through the Food and Drug Administration , looking for any changes regarding [[new]] drugs , to use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , the buy or sell short assets whose price will be affected by [[future]] events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires another , usually the buyer 's stock goes down , as they are probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock jumps , as someone is about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy the prey . In the movie * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen uses contacts with a law firm to find clients of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort of strategy , and is arrested when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy is John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took this approach . ( I believe Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope is that returns will be less volatile and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a pretty [[long]] list of [[other]] recognized strategies , [[many]] too complicated to worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . The founder is now facing 15 to 19 years in prison . It was an [[effective]] strategy , but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point of this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they want , and will be judged solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You ' ve probably already heard about how [[many]] hedge funds make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the management fee . If you invest money with a hedge fund ( or anyone for that matter ) , the first thing they do is take a percentage of your money from you and keep it for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , rent office space , and cover overhead until their real payday arrives at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance fee . At the end of the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , and takes a chunk of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion payday for the people who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

Reduced consumer spending : High levels of household debt can also lead to reduced consumer spending , as households may be more cautious about taking on additional debt and may choose to save more in order to pay down their existing debt . This can have a negative impact on the economy as a whole , as consumer spending is a [[key]] driver of economic growth . Increased risk for financial institutions : High levels of household debt can also increase risk for financial institutions , as they may be more exposed to the risk of default if households are unable to make their debt payments .

Negative impact on the housing market : High levels of household debt can also affect the housing market , as many households may be less able to afford a home or may be more cautious about taking on a mortgage .

{"text": "This wo n't actually be for a 5 year old , but a 5 year old should be nowhere near this book nor the movie .

Specifically the effect that wealth and privilege can have on people . No one has friends only acquaintances . People are only as important as what they can do for you . Image is more [[important]] than substance . For simplicity I 'll only deal with what 's in the movie . In [[American]] Psycho the main character is pretending to be a human . He takes everything way too far because he is over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he is with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his whole shower procedure . He is pretending to work . His father owns a competing firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick as an employee simply because of his fathers name . He pretends to have a fiance , who of course is completely fake too , otherwise she would n't survive long around him . He pretends to have sexuality . He has no clue what it is to love someone let alone to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he feels cheated . He can see all around him what humanity is supposed to be and he just is n't \" that \" . He knows that it 's getting worse and worse , and is [[afraid]] that he will be caught . He is n't afraid of going to jail or dying , but rather he is afraid of being exposed as a fake person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your specific question regarding the scene where he calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so he calls his lawyer and admits everything he can think of . The lawyer thinks the caller is someone other than Patrick playing a joke . He never takes it seriously because to him Patrick is just some bland [[rich]] guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other [[bland]] rich guys . Later when Patrick sees the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about it the lawyer , not realizing he is talking TO Patrick , laughs about the ridiculousness of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are [[common]] themes in the movie and book . People constantly remark how normal Patrick is , people constantly mistake him and others for someone else . They all look and act alike . In my opinion the movie is about how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer to blend into society because of how uncaring and superficial we all are .

{"text": "It 's [[important]] to note that not all science fiction stories portray humans as foolish or weak in comparison to other [[intelligent]] beings . In fact , many science fiction stories feature humans as the main characters who are brave , [[intelligent]] , and [[capable]] of [[great]] feats . However , it is common in science fiction for humans to encounter [[other]] intelligent beings , such as aliens , who are more technologically advanced or have abilities that humans do n't possess . In these stories , the humans may seem foolish or weak in comparison to the other beings because they are less advanced and do n't have the same capabilities . This portrayal of humans in science fiction is often used as a way for the writer to explore what it means to be human , and to think about how humans might react to the discovery of other intelligent life forms . It can also be used to comment on themes such as power dynamics , cultural differences , and the nature of intelligence . Overall , the portrayal of humans in science fiction depends on the story and the message the writer wants to convey . Some stories portray humans as strong and capable , while others may portray them as less advanced or weaker in comparison to other intelligent beings .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

If it does n't know which port to send the data to ( e.g. it has n't seen that host yet ) , it acts as a hub and sends the data to all ports -- except the one it was received on .

What it tells you is three things : 1 ) How big of a pile of stuff do I own ? 2 ) How [[much]] money did I borrow to buy my big pile of stuff that I still have to pay back ? 3 ) If I removed everything from my pile of stuff that I still owe money on , how much is left ? This smaller pile of stuff that you have paid in full for and that you do n't owe another cent on is your \" equity \" . It can be broken down to the classic accounting equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities ( Stuff in your pile that the bank can take back because you have n't paid for it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff in the pile that is paid for and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out a mortgage and buy a $ 200,000 house , and promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I own half of a house . That is my equity . The bank owns the [[other]] $ 100,000 of the house , and that is my liability . Again , the equation tells us : Total Assets ( The Whole House , 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank 's half of the house 100k ) + Equity ( my half of the house that I plunked down 100k for ) . To answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is how is it [[important]] : Let us say that I owned an entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of rat control . I take the cat to the bank , and the bank lends the cat $ 995,000 as a business loan under the agreement that the bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't paid back with interest . The cat takes the bank 's 995k and I throw in 5k of my own money that the cat never has to pay me back for , and he buys 1 million dollars worth of rat control equipment . Now if I went on Craigslist and offered to sell the cat and his 1 million dollars worth of rat control supplies to the highest bidder , my cat might sell for close to 1 million dollars . However , once the potential buyer found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to the bank still , the potential buyer would realize the EQUITY in the cat is only $ 5,000 , and would n't pay much more than that . Now that begs the question , why would I give the feline $ 5,000 that he did n't have to pay me back for ? This relates to the second use of the phrase equity in finance , which is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 to become a partner in his business . Think of this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on things that will make his business better , and that he does n't have to worry about paying me interest on or ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives me 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock of a total 200 shares [[outstanding]] . He owns the other 100 , which he assigned to himself when incorporating his business . What 's in it for me ? As owner of 50 % of the EQUITY in the company ( I own 100 of 200 total shares ) , I am entitled to half of the profits ! Now if the cat is very successful and makes $ 200,000 in profits each year after paying interest on his loan to the bank , that is great for me ! Going back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Million Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Principle Still Owed to the Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs outright to me and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed from the bank does n't change . We still have 1 million dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so that 200k is pure profit for us ( me and my cat ) as business owners . Now this $ 200,000 can either be paid to use in the form of dividends , or reinvested in new equipment and services that can help the business grow .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "It is generally not recommended to wake a person who is sleepwalking because it can cause confusion and disorientation , which can be unsettling and potentially dangerous for both the sleepwalker and the person attempting to wake them . When a person is sleepwalking , their body is in a state of partial arousal , and they are not fully conscious or aware of their surroundings . As a result , they may not be able to understand or respond appropriately to being awakened , and they may become agitated or [[combative]] .   It is also possible that the sleepwalker could accidentally hurt themselves or someone else while sleepwalking , either by tripping or falling , or by accidentally bumping into or touching something that could cause injury . For these reasons , it is generally best to let a sleepwalker continue their sleepwalking episode and to try to guide them back to bed if necessary , rather than trying to wake them up .

{"text": "Have skimmed it , these are the most important parts as I can tell : The new temperature goal is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For anybody uninformed on what that means , 1.5 us the limit the average global temperature will have risen since pre - industrial times . This is friggin huge and I ' m super excited because the [[previous]] goal of 2 was n't all that great . So basically there 's limits on the global temperature rise ( which I 'll call GTR from now cause I ' m [[lazy]] ) . The GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before the industrial revolution . The last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C rise in temperature , which before was considered [[okay]] at best ( this goal was reached in the 90 's I believe ) . Since then new science and research has come out that tells us that 2 \u00b0 C could be bad . There 's also another thing you should know which is feedback loops : Under the arctic lies huge amounts of trapped methane . If the temperature becomes too high the ice that traps the methane gas melts and the methane enters the atmosphere . Methane is a greenhouse gas and is one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the atmosphere it reinforces [[global]] warming and the greenhouse effect further melting ice and further releasing methane until it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and in particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and absorbes heat . Ice is white and reflects it . As long as ice , particularly sea ice , melts , [[more]] sun and heat reflecting matter goes away the the things beneath the ice tend to absorbes that heat and sun and make everything hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is melted and the more Ocean there is to absorb heat which further melts ice ad infinitum until we all die . Now back to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered seriously pushing it for these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse of civilization . At the current rate we 're doing things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is pretty [[much]] death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't in the clear but we have a very good chance of living life comfortably on earth , with nearly all of the [[same]] luxuries we have today albeit operated differently . Before this agreement the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is a huge and a really big difference . Aside from that one of the big concerns is that developed countries have created climate change and gotten rich off it and now poor nations [[such]] as Pacific island nations and countries like Bangladesh now have to suffer because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says basically that developed nations have to help out financially to developing nations with protection against rising sea levels and other things and to help them convert their infrastructures to green energy while also helping them develop their economies and humanitarian situations . It also sets a goal for developed nations to try and cut all greenhouse emissions they emit . Lastly they will take stock of emissions and temperature rises and environmental impacts of climate change in 2023 and every five years after that . Also nations have to set goals for themselves every 5 years based on what they can accomplish and what they have accomplished . One worrying part is the fact that nations can back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without repercussions . I ' m also not sure how legally binding any of this is or if it even is . It would be awesome if it was but I ' m not sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

This means that a person can become a citizen of a country based on their parent 's citizenship.\\n\\nAs for whether a baby born on a ship in international waters is allowed to go on land with their parents when the ship makes port , it generally depends on the laws and policies of the country where the ship is docking .

{"text": "In the past , if you went to college in the US , you were pretty much promised an above - average job with a [[decent]] salary . There was also a strong stigma against manual labor jobs ( mainly because they become far [[worse]] as your body ages ) and a lot of praise for office jobs for how [[much]] money you could make in some fields . In the 90 's , the generation that grew up on these ideals had kids and wanted them all to go to college . All of them . So suddenly massive amounts of kids were being pushed into college . The colleges reacted by raising their prices . Sometimes this was justified : they had many more students so they needed more dorms , more food , more teachers . But ultimately , college prices went out of control . The parents still wanted to send their kids to college ( thinking it was how they 'd get a good job still ) and decided to take out loans to pay for their school . BUT these loans were taken out on behalf of the kids so the loans were in their kid 's names ( in most cases anyway ) . All at once , a lot of kids with college degrees flooded the job market . Employers now had millions of applicants with college degrees . In the past , they 'd have many applicants but one or two would be college educated . Now ... everyone had one . This meant that the college degrees lost a lot of value . Since everyone had one , it stopped being special . There * are * plenty of degrees that are still useful and that you needed in your field ( medical , legal , financial , computer science ) , but a lot of kids ( myself included ) were told that they 'd be fine no matter what degree they got . And many were misguided by the college system ( who wanted money more than for their student 's to be well - prepared for the ever - changing job market ) . And of course , it 's super easy to argue that a teenager , with no real world experience , should n't be making a decision that will cost them tens of thousands of dollars , that will also greatly impact the course their career . So now ... we 've got a lot of kids with degrees that may or may not be useful . They ca n't get a job in the field they studied for . Well , they can still get low paying jobs in another field just to make ends met . No big deal right ? WRONG ! Remember those loans ? That does n't go anywhere . These [[young]] adults suddenly have a lot of debt to pay off . If their degree / career did n't pan out , debt . If they have a great job and make decent money , debt . If they have a medical degree and become a doctor and start their own private practice and make great money , debt ( the average US doctor pays their loans off after 10 years ) . We now have a [[huge]] generation of young people saddled with [[massive]] debt with no way to get rid of it and [[few]] ways to improve their circumstances . There 's no real way they can afford bigger investments like a house / condo since they 're constantly paying towards debt . A missed payment does horrible things to your credit score , a lack of disposable income screws up your livelihood and social / [[romantic]] life , and without skills to get a job that can pay the debt off the debt just gets worse . Best case scenario is that the debt takes years and years to pay off with no missed payments and it 's still a massive source of stress in a person 's life .", "label": "hc3human"}

Better coordination of care : EHRs can help healthcare providers coordinate care by allowing them to easily share information with other members of the healthcare team , [[such]] as specialists or primary care doctors .     Increased efficiency : EHRs can save time by eliminating the need for manual charting and reducing the need for paper records .

{"text": "Poop is not exactly [[chronological]] , but the process of digestion does generally follow a certain order . When you eat something , your body breaks down the food using enzymes and [[other]] substances in your digestive system . The process of digestion starts in your mouth , where your teeth and saliva help to break down the food . The food then moves through your esophagus and into your stomach , where it is mixed with stomach acid to help break it down further . After the food has been broken down in the stomach , it moves into the small intestine . The small intestine is where most of the nutrients from the food are absorbed into the body . The remaining waste material moves into the large intestine , where water and electrolytes are absorbed . Finally , the waste material is eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus as poop . So , while the process of digestion does not happen in a strictly chronological order , the food you eat will generally be digested and eliminated in the order that you eat it .

Some times when you think that the news is good , like new record profits have been achieved , but the share price goes down instead of up . This may be [[due]] to the expectation of the record profits by analysts to be 20 % [[more]] than last year , but the company only achieves 10 % more than last year . So the news is actually seen as bad because , even though record profits , it has n't met expectations . The same can happen in the other direction , a company may make a loss and the share price goes up . This may be because it was expected to make a 50 % loss but only made a 20 % loss due to cost cutting , so this is seen as a good thing and the price can shoot up , especially if it had been beaten down for months . An other example is when the Federal Reserve in the USA put up interest rates earlier this month . Some may have seen this as [[bad]] news and expected share prices to fall , but instead prices rallied .

The algorithm is designed so that it is extremely [[difficult]] for any [[particular]] random string to meet the requirements to be considered a bitcoin ; only 1 in several hundred billion possible random strings will work . Bitcoins are stored in a wallet file on your computer . The wallet file contains a list of all the bitcoins you own .

You own a Bitcoin when your wallet ID is the [[last]] in the chain . You give it to someone else by adding their wallet ID to the end of the chain . All of these transactions are passed around the peer network , and each peer will check it for validity by running various cryptographic tests . If all the tests pass , the peer will agree that the transaction is valid . The [[more]] peers validate the transaction , the more certain you can be that the transaction is [[valid]] ( generally 6 - 10 validations are [[enough]] for a transaction to be \" [[valid]] \" enough for most people . ) * * Mining for Bitcoins * * Bitcoin mining involves testing millions and millions of random strings of the proper specification in order to find the strings that ' pass ' the algorithmic test to be a Bitcoin block .

Because of the [[sheer]] number of strings that must be tested , and the complexity of the algorithm , this process requires a [[significant]] amount of time and processing power .

Now what you do when you meditate is that you become aware of the moment : You do n't give a fuck about all those annoying thoughts about yesterday or tomorrow or whatever . So basically you do n't think , although thoughts may still go through your head . Of course there are different approaches , sometimes you focus immensely on something ( often the breath ) which will use up all focus and therefore reduce thoughts , or you try to not - focus , where you feel and observe everything in and around you . And there are still even more approaches , for example some have to do with feelings ( try to imagine a person you do n't like and imagine you hug him / like him ) for improving compassion . It 's easy to start meditation , but it takes a while until you notice and feel what it 's about and what it does . In the beginning you just sit there and afterwards you might be disappointed because you ' ve expected more of it . I can still highly recommend to do it , start with 10 minutes a day , just sit down , stop actively thinking about things ( but do n't try to suppress thoughts which will inevitably come up , just ignore them ) and keep focusing on your breath .

Layering is the act of separating the \" dirty money \" from its source by moving it through various transactions , often in different countries , to make it more [[difficult]] to trace . This can be done by transferring money between accounts , buying and selling assets , or using shell companies ( i.e. , companies that exist on paper but do n't have any real business activity ) . Integration is the final step , in which the \" clean money \" ( i.e. , the funds that have been laundered ) is integrated back into the economy and used for [[legitimate]] purposes .

{"text": "To calculate the ownership percentage for shared home ownership , you will need to determine the total value of the property and the contribution of each owner . Here is a step - by - step guide to help you calculate the ownership percentage : Determine the total value of the property : This can be done by getting an appraisal of the property or by looking up the value of similar properties in the area . Determine the contribution of each owner : Each owner should contribute a percentage of the total value of the property based on their ownership percentage . For example , if one owner contributes $ 100,000 towards the purchase of a $ 500,000 property , they would own 20 % of the property . Calculate the ownership percentage : To calculate the ownership percentage , divide the contribution of each owner by the total value of the property . For example , if one owner contributes $ 100,000 towards the purchase of a $ 500,000 property , their ownership percentage would be calculated as follows : $ 100,000 / $ 500,000 = 20%.It 's important to note that the ownership percentage can also be affected by any mortgage payments or other debts on the property . In cases where there are outstanding debts , the ownership percentage may be reduced by the amount of the debt [[relative]] to the total value of the property . I hope this helps !

This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are . Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation / speech muscles . Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other ( thinking a word , with the sound of the word , and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word ) . So if you are thinking internally , your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal . But as I mentioned , the internal monologue is extremely closely [[related]] to the production of speech ( this topic is known as \" embodiment \" ) . Studies show that when people read text silently , muscles used for speech are slightly activated . Also , speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally . This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways , and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking . Note : this is referring to clear - cut intended internal speech .

There are a number of technical and philosophical challenges associated with the concept of whole brain emulation , including the issue of how to accurately capture and replicate the [[complex]] structure and function of a biological brain , as well as the ethical and [[philosophical]] questions surrounding the nature of consciousness and the [[potential]] consequences of creating artificial intelligence . While some researchers and futurists have suggested that whole brain emulation could eventually be possible , it remains a highly [[speculative]] and controversial idea .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "There are a few things that can help protect your credit card information from being misused when you give it to a restaurant or any [[other]] business :   Encryption : Many businesses use encryption to protect your credit card information when it is being transmitted or stored . This means that the information is transformed into a code that is difficult for anyone to read without the right key .   Security measures : Businesses that handle credit card information are required to follow certain security measures to protect it . This can include things like having [[secure]] servers , using firewalls , and regularly updating their security software .   Payment processors : Many businesses use payment processors , such as PayPal or Stripe , to handle credit card transactions . These processors have their own security measures in place to protect your information .   Laws and regulations : There are also laws and regulations in place to help protect your credit card information . For example , the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ( PCI DSS ) sets guidelines for businesses to follow when handling credit card information .   Overall , there are many different ways that businesses can help protect your credit card information from being misused . While it 's always important to be cautious and protect your [[personal]] information , you can generally feel [[confident]] that businesses are doing their best to keep your information safe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Symbolic [[artificial]] intelligence ( AI ) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic - based methods to solve problems . It is also sometimes referred to as \" classical AI \" or \" good old - [[fashioned]] AI ( GOFAI ) . \"     In symbolic AI , problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules . The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain , and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities . For example , a [[symbolic]] AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution .     Symbolic AI systems are often based on [[first]] - order logic , which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them . This makes them well - suited for tasks that require [[logical]] reasoning and problem - solving , such as [[natural]] language processing , planning , and theorem proving .     However , symbolic AI systems have some limitations . They can be difficult to design and implement , and they may require a large amount of human - generated knowledge to be encoded into the system . In addition , they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input .     Today , symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques , [[such]] as machine learning and [[neural]] networks , in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "The different naming schemes are basically a way for Intel to distinguish how powerful each processor is . An i3 is the slowest , then an i5 , and i7 is the fastest . However , within the ' i ' series , there are now 4 ' generations ' of processors .. each year , Intel refreshes their processor lineup with new versions of the processors , so a [[4th]] - generation i5 will be faster than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and usually newer processors are more efficient , using less electricity and running cooler , as well ) . You can tell which generation a Core - i processor is from by the number after it - 4xxx is 4th - gen , 3xxx is 3rd - gen , etc . ( so i5 - 4670 is a 4th - gen , for example ) . Pretty much any Core - i processor will be faster than a Core2Duo and probably any Core2Quad as well . The best way to compare how fast processors are in relation to each other is to look at benchmarks for specific applications though ( a benchmark is just a measure of how well a specific piece of hardware performs ) . As for how [[many]] cores each one has , it depends on which [[specific]] processor you 're talking about .. you can easily Google a specific processor to find out how [[many]] cores it has . One other thing to note is that a quad - core processor is not necessarily twice as fast as a dual - core processor . All 4 cores usually do n't run at the same speed and at the [[same]] time .

{"text": "Lepton is a data compression algorithm developed by Dropbox , a company that provides [[online]] storage and file sharing services . Data compression is a technique used to reduce the size of a file or a piece of data , making it [[easier]] and more efficient to store , transmit , and process . The \" middle - out \" part of Lepton refers to the way the algorithm works : it first identifies and removes redundancies from the middle of the data , and then works its way outwards to compress the rest of the data . This approach is [[different]] from other data compression algorithms , which often start at the beginning or the end of the data and work their way towards the middle . To understand how Lepton works , let 's use a simple example . Imagine you have a list of words that you want to compress . Lepton would first look for repeating words or patterns in the middle of the list , and then represent those repetitions with a shorter code . For example , if the word \" the \" appears 10 times in the middle of the list , Lepton might replace all of those instances with a code like \" t10 \" . This would save some space , because the code \" t10 \" is shorter than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times . Once Lepton has compressed the middle of the list , it would then work its way outwards , looking for [[more]] opportunities to compress the data . For example , it might look for repeating words or patterns at the beginning and end of the list , and replace them with shorter codes as well . I hope this helps !

The host asks you to choose a door , and you choose door number 1 . Before the host reveals what is behind your chosen door , he opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat .

The answer might seem counterintuitive , but you should switch doors .

Now that the host has revealed one of the goats , you know that the car is not behind door 2 . That means that the car must be behind either door 1 or door 3 . Since you originally had a 1 in 3 chance of choosing the door with the car , and you now have a 50/50 chance of choosing the door with the car ( since it must be behind either door 1 or 3 ) , you should switch doors to increase your chances of winning the car .

Humans and [[many]] [[other]] animals , including cows , goats , and sheep , produce milk to feed their babies .   Cows , goats , and sheep are often used to produce milk for [[human]] consumption because they are able to produce a [[large]] amount of milk and their milk is considered to be high in quality and easy to process . These animals are also [[easy]] to care for and raise on a large scale , which makes it practical for people to use their milk as a food source .

{"text": "There are a few reasons why it 's currently not practical to build a 1 TB RAM module:\\n\\nSize : A 1 TB RAM module would be physically very large and would take up a lot of space on a motherboard . This would make it difficult to fit inside a typical computer case and would make the overall computer system much [[larger]] and less portable.\\n\\nCost : A 1 TB RAM module would be very [[expensive]] to produce . This would make the overall cost of the computer system much higher and would make it less affordable for most people.\\n\\nPower : A 1 TB RAM module would require a lot of power to operate . This would make the overall power consumption of the computer system much higher , which would lead to shorter battery life and higher energy bills.\\n\\nSpeed : Although having a large amount of RAM would certainly make a computer faster in some ways , it would not necessarily make it faster overall . This is because the speed of a computer is determined by a combination of factors , including the processor speed , the speed of the storage ( such as an SSD ) , and the speed of the RAM . So while adding more RAM might help in some cases , it 's not a magic solution that will make a computer faster in all cases.\\n\\nOverall , while it would certainly be nice to have a 1 TB RAM module , the [[current]] limitations of size , cost , power , and speed make it not practical at this time .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "\\nPower plants generate electricity by using heat to produce steam , which drives a turbine that generates electricity . The steam is produced by heating water in a boiler , which is fueled by coal , natural gas , or some other fuel.\\n\\nAfter the steam has been used to generate electricity , it needs to be cooled down before it can be used again . This is where the cooling tower comes in . The cooling tower is a large , [[open]] structure that uses evaporation to cool the steam . Water from the cooling tower is sprayed into the air , and as it falls back down , it absorbs heat from the steam , cooling it down.\\n\\nThe condenser is a device that is used to turn the steam back into water . It does this by using a system of tubes and a cooling agent , such as water , to cool the steam down until it condenses back into a liquid . This process is important because it allows the steam to be used over and over again , instead of just being released into the atmosphere.\\n\\nOverall , the cooling tower and the condenser are both important parts of a power plant because they help to conserve energy by allowing the steam to be used multiple times .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Personally , I think you are approaching this from the wrong angle .   You 're somewhat correct in assuming that what you 're reading is usually some kind of marketing material .   Systematic Investment Plan ( SIP ) is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world .   Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the US . On average , verified by [[many]] studies , individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners .   Say you decide to invest in a mutual fund , dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when you feel the market is low . As an example I 'll compare investing $ 50 per week on Wednesdays , versus 1 share per week on Wednesdays , or the full $ 850 on the first Wednesday .    I 'll use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example ( VLCAX ) .   I realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different , I just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle .   By investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a [[lower]] [[average]] share price while the share price climbs .   It also keeps your investment [[easy]] to budget . Vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds , rather than parsing out a lump sum in to [[smaller]] periodic investments , which is illustrated in the third column above ; and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing . Ultimately , all of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and [[unique]] .   If they all called dollar cost averaging , \" dollar cost averaging \" none of them would appear to be unique .   So they devise [[neat]] acronyms but it 's all pretty much the same idea .

Fodor was born in New York City in 1935 and received his bachelor 's degree from Columbia University in 1956 . He went on to earn his PhD from Princeton University in 1960 .     Fodor is best known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind , particularly his defense of the idea that the mind is a modular system . This view holds that the mind is composed of a number of independent systems or modules , each of which is specialized for processing a [[particular]] type of information . Fodor argued that these modules are innate and dedicated to specific tasks , such as perception , language , and reasoning . He also proposed that [[mental]] states are individuated by their causal roles , which he called \" functional roles . \"     Fodor was also a leading figure in the development of the theory of computationalism , which holds that the mind is a computational system and that mental processes can be understood in terms of computations . He argued that mental states can be explained in terms of the information that they carry and the operations that they perform on that information .     Fodor 's work has had a [[significant]] influence on the field of cognitive science and has been widely discussed and debated within the philosophy of mind .

{"text": "Selling put options can be a way for a retiree to generate income , but it is important to understand the risks and potential downsides of this strategy . When you sell a put option , you are agreeing to buy a certain asset ( such as a stock ) at a predetermined price ( the strike price ) at a later date ( the expiration date ) . In return , you receive a premium payment from the buyer of the option . If the market price of the asset falls below the strike price , the buyer of the option may choose to exercise their right to sell the asset to you at the strike price , and you will be required to purchase the asset at that price . One potential risk of selling put options is that you may end up having to buy the asset at a higher price than its market value , which could result in a loss . This is especially true if the market value of the asset falls significantly below the strike price . In addition , there is always the risk that the market value of the asset could rise above the strike price , in which case you would not receive the premium payment . Overall , selling put options can be a risky strategy , and it may not be suitable for everyone , especially those who are risk - [[averse]] or have limited investment capital . It is important to carefully consider your risk tolerance , financial goals , and other personal circumstances before deciding whether this strategy is right for you . As with any investment , it is always a good idea to consult with a financial professional before making any decisions .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

In the United States , the President and Congress have the power to decide whether or not to go to war .

For example , if another country were to attack the United States , the U.S. military might be sent to defend the country .   Other times , the decision to go to war might be made because the United States wants to help other countries that are in danger . For example , if a country is being invaded by another country and is unable to defend itself , the United States might decide to send troops to help protect that country .   It 's important to note that going to war is a very serious decision , and it should not be taken lightly . Wars can have [[many]] consequences , including loss of life and destruction of property .

The DJIA is a price - weighted index , which means that the level of the index is determined by the price of the component stocks rather than their market capitalization . The level of the index is calculated by taking the sum of the prices of the component stocks and dividing it by a divisor , which is adjusted periodically to take into account changes in the number and nature of the component stocks . The component stocks of the DJIA are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal based on a number of criteria , including market capitalization , liquidity , and industry representation . The component stocks are reviewed and updated periodically to ensure that the index remains [[representative]] of the [[overall]] market . Apple and Google are not included in the DJIA because they are not among the 30 companies that are currently included in the index . The component stocks of the DJIA are chosen to represent a diverse range of industries and sectors , and Apple and Google do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the index .

{"text": "A ranked voting system is a way of casting and counting votes in an election where voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference . Instead of just choosing one candidate , voters can indicate their top choice , [[second]] choice , third choice , and so on . In a ranked voting system , if a candidate wins a majority of first - choice votes , they are declared the winner just like in a [[normal]] election . If no candidate wins a majority of first - choice votes , then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the voters ' [[next]] choice . This process is repeated until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winner . One advantage of [[ranked]] voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters , rather than just a plurality of voters . In a [[normal]] election , it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50 % of the vote if there are more than two candidates running . In a [[ranked]] voting system , this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least [[popular]] candidate can be redistributed to the voters ' next choice . As for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the two - party system , it 's [[important]] to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity . However , ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third - party candidates or independent candidates to win elections . Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference , they can choose to support a third - party candidate as their [[first]] choice while still expressing a preference for one of the [[major]] party candidates as their second choice . This could make it more likely that a third - party candidate could win an election , or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Going public means that a company becomes a publicly traded company and starts selling shares of its stock to the public . There are a few reasons why a company might choose to go public : To raise money : Going [[public]] can be a way for a company to raise a lot of money quickly . When a company goes public , it sells shares of its stock to investors . The company can use the money it raises from the sale of these shares to fund its operations , pay off debt , or invest in new projects . To increase visibility : Being a publicly traded company can increase a company 's visibility and reputation . This can be especially [[important]] for smaller companies that are trying to gain recognition in their industry . To give shareholders a way to sell their shares : When a company is privately held , it can be difficult for shareholders to sell their shares . Going public gives shareholders a way to sell their shares on the stock market , which can be attractive to some shareholders who want to cash in their investment . To give employees a way to sell their shares : Some companies offer stock options to their employees as a form of compensation . Going public gives these employees a way to sell their shares and potentially make a profit .

{"text": "Fractional reserve banking is a type of banking system in which banks only hold a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves , while lending out the rest . This means that banks can create new money by lending out more than they have on deposit . Under a fractional reserve banking system , banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves , while the rest can be lent out to borrowers . The reserve requirement is set by the central bank , and it can vary depending on the type of deposits and the overall economic conditions . However , there is a risk of insolvency in a fractional reserve banking system if the demand for withdrawals exceeds the amount of reserves held by the bank . If this happens , the bank may not have [[enough]] cash on hand to meet the demand for withdrawals , and it may have to borrow from other banks or the central bank to cover the shortfall . This is known as a \" bank run , \" and it can lead to a financial crisis if it spreads to [[other]] banks .

{"text": "Sure thing ! Carbon dating is a way that scientists can determine the age of certain objects that are made out of organic materials , like wood or bone . Carbon is a type of [[chemical]] element that can be found in all living things . It is made up of small particles called atoms , which are [[tiny]] and hard to see . There are different types of carbon atoms , called isotopes , and one type called carbon-14 is radioactive . This means that it is unstable and over time , it will break down and change into other things . When an organism ( like a plant or animal ) is alive , it takes in carbon from the air , water , and food that it consumes . This carbon contains a balance of carbon-14 and [[other]] isotopes of carbon . When the organism dies , it stops taking in carbon and the carbon-14 in its body starts to break down and change into other things . Scientists can measure how much carbon-14 is left in the object and compare it to how much carbon-14 was in the environment when the organism was alive . Based on this comparison , they can figure out how long it has been since the organism died . I hope that helps ! Do you have any other questions about carbon dating ?", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Using credit cards online can be safe if you take certain precautions to protect yourself . Here are a few tips to help you stay [[safe]] when using your credit card online : Use a [[secure]] connection : Make sure that the website you are using is secure . Look for the \" https \" in the web address , which indicates that the website is using a secure connection . Use a secure payment gateway : [[Many]] online merchants use secure payment gateways to process credit card transactions . These gateways encrypt your credit card information , making it more difficult for hackers to access it . Use a credit card : Credit cards offer more protection than debit cards in the event of fraud . If your credit card is used fraudulently , you can dispute the charges with your credit card issuer and the money will be returned to your account . Debit cards do not offer this same level of protection . Use a [[virtual]] credit card : Some credit card issuers offer virtual credit cards , which are essentially one - time - use credit card numbers that can be used for [[online]] purchases . This can help protect your actual credit card number from being stolen . Keep your software up to date : Make sure that you have the latest versions of your web browser and any security software you use .

They 're \" Big Daddies \" . Andrew could n't have children so he had an embryo created . A [[super]] criminal stole this , programmed it to grow [[hyper]] - fast , leave rapture and grow up , come back , and kill Ryan . You 're the embryo .

{"text": "The International Space Station ( ISS ) orbits the Earth in a path that is shaped like a slightly [[squashed]] circle , or an oval . This is because the ISS is being pulled towards the Earth by the Earth 's gravity , but it is also moving very fast . When an object moves very fast , it is [[harder]] for gravity to pull it down , so it follows a curved path instead of falling straight down .   To stay in orbit , the ISS has to keep moving at a specific speed and altitude . If it slows down or drops too [[low]] , it will fall back to Earth . If it speeds up or climbs too [[high]] , it will fly off into space . To maintain its orbit , the ISS uses thrusters , which are small engines that produce a jet of gas to push against . By firing the thrusters , the ISS can adjust its speed and direction to stay in its desired orbit .   In the attached image , you can see a diagram of the ISS 's orbit around the Earth .

{"text": "Deductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking in which a conclusion is drawn based on the relationship between two or more premises . This type of reasoning starts with a general statement , or premise , and applies it to a specific situation to arrive at a logical conclusion .     For example , consider the following argument :     Premise 1 : All birds can fly .   Premise 2 : Eagles are birds .   Conclusion : Therefore , eagles can fly .     In this example , the conclusion that eagles can fly is drawn based on the relationship between the two premises : that all birds can fly and that eagles are birds . The conclusion follows logically from the premises .     Deductive reasoning is often contrasted with inductive reasoning , which involves drawing conclusions based on observations or specific examples . While deductive reasoning is a reliable method for arriving at conclusions when the premises are true , it is not always possible to determine the truth of the premises with certainty . In such cases , the conclusion may not necessarily be reliable .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

They are currently the most [[distant]] man - made objects from Earth , traveling through deep space . Both spacecraft are equipped with a number of scientific instruments and communication devices that allow them to send data back to Earth . These devices use radio waves , which are a type of electromagnetic radiation , to transmit the data . The radio waves are sent from the spacecraft to antennas on Earth , which are large structures that are designed to receive the radio waves and turn them into the data that scientists can use to study the spacecraft 's environment and the objects it is encountering . To reach Earth from such a long distance , the spacecraft use a special type of antenna called a high - gain antenna . This antenna is able to focus the radio waves into a very narrow beam , which allows the spacecraft to transmit the data with a very low power level . This is [[important]] because the spacecraft need to be as energy efficient as possible , since they have limited power available to them . Even with the use of the high - gain antenna , it still takes a long time for the data from the spacecraft to reach Earth , due to the vast distance that the radio waves have to travel .

{"text": "The caucuses in Iowa , New Hampshire , and [[other]] states are important events in the process of choosing a presidential candidate for the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States . During a caucus , party members in a specific state gather to discuss and vote on their preferred candidate . The states of Iowa and New Hampshire are traditionally the first two states to hold their caucuses , which is why they are often seen as particularly important . This is because the results of these caucuses can set the tone for the rest of the primary election season and can have a significant impact on which candidates gain momentum and support as the process continues . In addition to being the first two states to hold their caucuses , Iowa and New Hampshire are also small states with relatively homogenous populations , which makes them good places for candidates to test their campaign messages and strategies .

{"text": "Pluto was originally classified as a planet when it was discovered in 1930 because it was thought to be similar to the other planets in our [[solar]] system in size and composition . However , as we learned more about Pluto and discovered more objects in the outer reaches of our solar system , scientists realized that Pluto is actually quite different from the [[other]] planets .   One of the main reasons Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet is because it is much smaller than the other planets in our solar system .

In addition to its small size , Pluto also has a very [[different]] orbit around the Sun compared to the other planets .

The MIRR function calculates the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows , taking into account the fact that the investment 's cash flows may be reinvested at a [[different]] rate than the [[original]] cost of the investment . It does this by using the following formula : MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range of cells that contain the series of payments and investments associated with the investment . \"finance_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is the interest rate used to calculate the future value of the cash flows . The MIRR function is [[useful]] for comparing the returns on different investments , as it takes into account the fact that the reinvestment rate may be different from the financing rate . It is also useful for evaluating the profitability of investments with irregular cash flows , such as those that involve the sale of assets or the repayment of loans . Example : Suppose you are considering investing $ 100,000 in a project that is expected to generate the following cash flows over the [[next]] 5 years : Year 1 : $ 20,000Year 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 50,000Year 5 : $ 60,000The financing rate on the investment is 10 % , and the reinvestment rate is 8 % . You can use the MIRR function to calculate the internal rate of return on the investment as follows:=MIRR(A1 : A5 , 10 % , 8%)This would return a result of approximately 12.63 % , indicating that the investment is expected to generate a return of approximately 12.63 % per year . I hope this helps clarify Microsoft 's explanation of MIRR . Let me know if you have any other questions .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "The [[important]] thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't breathe through their mouths like us ; they do n't even have lungs . They have tiny holes in their exoskeleton which allows oxygen into system of tubes , which carry oxygen to their organs . With that in mind , let 's think about what happens when something increases in size . Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In other words , volume and surface area increase by different rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It has a volume of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides , 4 sq ft per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times * , but the surface area only increased by * four * . 3x3x3 ? Volume of 27 , surface area of 54 . The volume more than tripled , whereas the surface area roughly doubled . Now , the point here is that * volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That means that there 's more organs and whatnot , all of which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen available , though , depends on * surface area * . Insects get oxygen from their skin , so to increase their oxygen intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You ca n't add more holes in the exoskeleton to increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because that makes the exoskeleton [[weaker]] . The exoskeleton is * already * under extra strain trying to support the increased weight , so that wo n't work . This means that there 's essentially a point where an insect ca n't grow any bigger , because it does n't have [[enough]] surface area ( oxygen supply ) to make up for the increased volume / weight ( need for oxygen ) . For [[more]] evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be much [[bigger]] millions and millions of years ago during dinosaur times .

{"text": "What honey badger something said : \" It 's when electoral districts are redrawn in order to favor a specific party or candidate based on demographics . \" And check out [ the wikipedia article ] ( URL_2 ) . ------------------ Imagine a [[pretend]] [[51st]] state in the US . We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as [[possible]] ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 [[Representative]] spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts / Representatives and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A [[fair]] person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be [[Republican]] . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make [[sure]] that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be [[able]] to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet [[tall]] then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It is called \" Credit card installments \" or \" Equal pay installments \" , and I am not [[aware]] of them being widely used in the USA . While in other countries they are supported by banks directly ( right ? ) , in US you may find this option only in some big stores like home improvement stores , car dealerships , cell phone operators ( so that you can buy a new phone ) etc . Some stores allow 0 % financing for , say , 12 months which is not exactly the [[same]] as installments but close , if you have discipline to pay $ 250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end . Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well , and it adds risks of customer default , introduces debt collection possibility etc . That 's why it 's usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not care in this case , from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $ 250 every month . In other countries banks support this option directly , I think , taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants . This has not happened in US . There is a company SplitIt which automates installments if stores want to support it but again , it means stores need to agree to it . Here is a simple article describing how credit cards work : https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html In [[general]] , if you move to US , you are unlikely to be [[able]] to get a regular credit card because you will not have any \" credit history \" which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt . The easiest way to build the history - request \" secured credit card \" , which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount . It 's like a \" practice credit card \" . You use it for 6 - 12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus , establishing your \" credit score \" . After that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card . Credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that .

{"text": "This is actually an interesting question , and the root of your answer lies far back in history . The short version is that a highway was a road elevated above the surrounding terrain ( literally , the high way ) , and a freeway was the opposite of a toll road ( literally , the free way ) . Back in , say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most people walked from their hut to the fields and back , and perhaps once a season the duke 's tax collector came in a wagon or cart . This meant that most traffic was along footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations increased , and the cart paths began seeing [[more]] traffic , 2 big problems arose . First , the ruts got deeper , much deeper . This is a [[major]] problem in places with a high water table ( say , coastal areas or swamps ) , or during [[rainy]] seasons . Second , these low paths made it hard to see around , facilitating ambushes by bandits . By building up the path , these two problems were alleviated . The path was above the waterline , during rains the water would naturally run off the path , and someone on the path could more easily see bandits lying in wait . A [[high]] way was much safer . The downsides of the high way is that you could n't just get on it anywhere with your cart - the sides were too steep . You had to get on or off in specific locations that had lower grade ramps leading to the high way . This is still reflected in how our modern highways work . They have limited access , usually by on / off ramps . Modern highways are ( often ) elevated , limited access roads that can safely handle high volumes of traffic . However , the cost of building this highway has to be borne by someone . Hence , initially , most highways were toll roads ( aka turnpikes , because they had walls of pikes setup on the road , which was turned aside when the toll was paid . Again , literally , turn pike to pass ) . When bright , insightful people in government realized that safer traffic along those highways boosted the economy , and allowed them to collect more taxes , they decided to make the highways they build free , so that they could make more money off the increased traffic . The [[free]] way was born . Modern freeways are highways that are paid for by taxes . The meaning of highway and freeway is , literally , in the name . High way and [[free]] way .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Yes , it is true that twins can run in families . This is because the trait of having twins is partly determined by genetics . There are certain genetic factors that can increase a person 's chances of having twins , such as having a family history of twins or certain racial or ethnic backgrounds . Here 's a simple explanation of how this works : when a woman becomes pregnant , her body produces a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . This hormone helps the body maintain the pregnancy by preventing the woman 's body from ovulating ( releasing eggs ) again . Some women produce more hCG than others , and this can lead to the release of [[more]] than one egg during ovulation . When two eggs are fertilized at the same time , it can result in the birth of twins . So , if a woman has a family history of twins , it could be because someone in her family ( like her mother or grandmother ) produced [[more]] hCG , which led to the birth of twins . This [[genetic]] trait can be passed down from one generation to the next , which is why twins can run in families . I hope that helps to answer your question !

{"text": "Our company does a lot of research on the self - directed IRA industry . We also provide [[financial]] advice in this area . In [[short]] , we have seen a lot in this industry . You mentioned custodian fees . This can be a sore spot for many investors . However , not all custodians are [[expensive]] , you should do your research before choosing the [[best]] one . Here is a list of custodians to help with your research Here are some of the more common pros and cons that we see . Pros :   1 ) You can invest in virtually anything that is considered an investment . This is great if your expertise is in an area that can not be easily invested in with traditional securities , such as horses , private company stock , tax liens and more . 2 ) Control- you have greater control over your investments . If you invest in GE , it is likely that you will not have [[much]] say in the running of their business . However , if you invest in a rental property , you will have a lot of control over how the investment should operate . 3 ) Invest in what you know . Peter lynch was [[fond]] of saying this phrase . Not everyone wants to invest in the stock market . Many people wo n't touch it because they are not familiar with it . Self - directed IRAs allow you to invest in assets like real estate that you know well . Cons : 1 ) many [[alternative]] investments are [[illiquid]] . This can present a problem if you need to access your capital for withdrawals . 2 ) Prohibited transactions- This is a new area for [[many]] investors who are unfamiliar with how self - directed IRAs work 3 ) Higher fees- in many cases , the fees associated with self - directed IRA custodians and administrators can be higher . 4 ) questionable investment sponsors tend to target self - directed IRA owners for fraudulent investments . The SEC put out a [[good]] PDF about the risks of fraud with self - directed IRAs . Self Directed IRAs are not the right solution for everyone , but they can help certain investors focus on the areas they know well .", "label": "hc3human"}

Sarcasm is a type of irony that involves saying or writing something that is the opposite of what you really mean , usually in a mocking or sarcastic tone . Sarcasm is often used to make fun of something or someone , or to convey a sense of irony or absurdity . Parody is a type of humor that involves imitating or exaggerating the characteristics of something , often for the purpose of making fun of it .

{"text": "There are a few reasons why applications and operating systems may slow down the longer they are running :   1 . Resource exhaustion : As an application or operating system runs , it uses up resources such as memory and processing power . If the application or operating system continues to run for an extended period of time , it may eventually use up all of the available resources , causing it to slow down or even crash .   2 . Memory leaks : A memory leak is a type of bug that occurs when an application or operating system allocates memory for a task , but fails to properly release it when the task is finished . Over time , this can lead to the application or operating system using up more and more memory , causing it to slow down .   3 . Fragmentation : When an operating system writes data to a hard drive or solid - state drive , it tries to store the data in contiguous blocks to make it faster to access . However , as the operating system continues to write and [[delete]] data , the blocks of data on the drive can become [[fragmented]] , meaning that they are scattered around the drive in small pieces . This can make it slower for the operating system to access and read the data , which can cause the system to slow down .   4 . Background processes : [[Many]] applications and operating systems have processes that run in the background , even when the [[main]] application is not being used . These processes can use up resources and cause the system to slow down over time .   By regularly closing unnecessary applications and programs , and restarting the operating system on a regular basis , it can help to keep the system running smoothly and prevent it from slowing down .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Yes , there is a measure that combines the cost of living with income , and it is called the \" purchasing power parity \" ( PPP ) . PPP is an [[economic]] theory that compares the purchasing power of different currencies in different countries by taking into account the cost of living in those countries . It allows for a comparison of living standards between countries by taking into account the differences in prices for goods and services . For example , if the cost of living is higher in one country compared to another , the purchasing power of the currency in the first country will be lower , even if the nominal exchange rate between the two currencies is the same . PPP helps to adjust for these differences in prices and allows for a more accurate comparison of living standards between countries . There are [[several]] measures of PPP , including the \" Big Mac Index , \" which compares the price of a Big Mac burger in different countries as a way to compare the purchasing power of different currencies . Another measure is the \" PPP - adjusted [[gross]] national income per capita , \" which takes into account the cost of living in different countries and adjusts for it when comparing the income levels of different countries .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Digital compression is a way of reducing the size of a file by finding and removing redundancy , or repeating patterns , within the data . For example , if a file contains a lot of repeating numbers or characters , a compression algorithm can store those repetitions more efficiently , using [[fewer]] bits of information to represent them . Compression programs like WinRAR and 7zip use a variety of techniques to identify and eliminate redundancy in a file , such as looking for repeating patterns of data or identifying parts of the file that are not [[essential]] to its function . The program then creates a new , smaller version of the file that includes only the necessary information . When you want to use the file again , you can decompress it , which restores the [[original]] file using the compressed data as a guide . Overall , digital compression is a way of making large files more manageable by reducing their size without losing any important information .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

For example , you might divide a city into neighborhoods , and then select a sample of neighborhoods to be included in the study . This method is often used when it is difficult or impractical to sample from the entire population , or when the population is geographically dispersed and it is easier to sample from smaller groups.\\n\\nOverall , the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling is the way in which the population is divided into [[smaller]] units for sampling .

{"text": "Pinyin is actually a standardized system for writing Chinese using the Roman alphabet , and it is widely used in China for teaching Chinese as a second language , transcribing proper nouns and place names , and as a tool for inputting Chinese characters on computers and phones .   However , Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese . Chinese characters ( also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese ) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years . They are still used today because they are an important part of [[Chinese]] culture and history , and they are also very efficient for written communication .   One of the main reasons that Pinyin is not used as the [[primary]] written form of Chinese is that it can not fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words . [[Chinese]] characters , on the [[other]] hand , can convey the full meaning and pronunciation of a word in a single character .

{"text": "[[Logical]] consequence ( also entailment ) is a fundamental concept in logic , which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements . A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises , because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises . The [[philosophical]] analysis of logical consequence involves the questions : In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises ?   and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises ?   All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth . \n Logical consequence is [[necessary]] and formal , by way of examples that explain with [[formal]] proof and models of interpretation . A sentence is said to be a [[logical]] consequence of a set of sentences , for a given language , if and only if , using only logic ( i.e. , without regard to any [[personal]] interpretations of the sentences ) the sentence must be [[true]] if every sentence in the set is true . \n Logicians make precise accounts of [[logical]] consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\n L \n\n\n\n\n { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { L } } } \n\n , either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\n L \n\n\n\n\n { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { L } } } \n\n  or by [[formal]] intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\n L \n\n\n\n\n { \\displaystyle { \\mathcal { L } } } \n\n .

These fibers are extremely [[thin]] , about the diameter of a [[human]] hair , and are made of a special type of glass or plastic that is very [[good]] at transmitting light .   Light travels through the fiber optic cables by bouncing off the walls of the fibers .

The light reflects off the walls so many times that it travels a very long distance without losing much energy or intensity .   One reason that light can enter the fiber optic cable but not exit is because the walls of the fiber are made of a material that is very good at reflecting light . This means that when the light hits the walls , it bounces off them and continues traveling through the fiber . However , the walls of the fiber are also very [[smooth]] , which makes it difficult for the light to escape . This is why the light stays inside the fiber and is able to travel such a long distance without losing [[much]] intensity .   There are many practical applications of fiber optic technology .

One reason could be that the attackers were heavily armed and had taken control of a large area within the mall , making it [[difficult]] for the security forces to quickly and safely gain control of the situation . Additionally , the attackers may have had explosives or [[other]] [[dangerous]] materials that could have caused harm to the hostages or to the security forces if they had tried to enter the mall too quickly . It 's also possible that the security forces wanted to try to negotiate with the attackers or to find other ways to resolve the situation peacefully before resorting to more [[aggressive]] tactics . Finally , it 's important to note that ending a siege like this can be a complex and [[challenging]] task that requires careful planning and coordination to ensure the safety of everyone involved .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "When the stock market crashes , it means that the prices of stocks have suddenly dropped significantly . Some people might be tempted to buy a lot of stocks when the prices are low because they believe that the market will eventually recover and the prices will go back up . However , there are a few risks that can make people hesitant to buy stocks during a market crash . One risk is that the market might not recover as quickly as some people expect . If the market continues to decline and the prices of stocks do not go back up , then people who bought a lot of stocks when they were cheap could end up losing money . Another risk is that even if the market does recover , it could take a long time for the prices of the stocks to go back up to the levels they were at before the crash . In the meantime , the people who bought a lot of stocks could be stuck holding onto them and not making any money . Overall , the main reason that people might be hesitant to buy a lot of stocks during a market crash is because they are worried about the potential risks and uncertainties involved . It 's important to keep in mind that investing in the stock market always carries some level of risk , and it 's important to carefully consider all of the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "There are [[several]] reasons why people might choose to invest in a stock portfolio rather than simply earning interest on a bank account . Some of these reasons include : Potential for higher returns : While it is true that the interest rates on bank accounts are generally lower than the dividends paid by stocks , it is also possible to earn higher returns by investing in a well - diversified stock portfolio . Over the long term , the stock market has historically outperformed other asset classes , including cash and fixed income investments . Inflation protection : While the interest earned on a bank account may keep pace with inflation in the short term , over the long term , the purchasing power of cash can decline due to inflation . By investing in stocks , you can potentially earn returns that are higher than the rate of inflation , helping to preserve the purchasing power of your money . Diversification : A well - diversified stock portfolio can help to spread risk by investing in a variety of different companies and industries . This can help to mitigate the impact of any one company or sector performing poorly , reducing the overall volatility of your portfolio . [[Potential]] for [[passive]] income : Many stocks pay dividends , which are periodic payments made to shareholders out of the company 's profits . While the dividend yield on individual stocks may be lower than the interest earned on a bank account , a well - diversified stock portfolio can potentially provide a consistent stream of passive income . Ultimately , the decision to invest in a stock portfolio or earn interest on a bank account will depend on your financial goals , risk tolerance , and investment horizon . It is important to carefully consider these factors and seek the advice of a [[financial]] professional before making any investment decisions .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "What a lot of people seem not to realize is that there are * tiers * of government in the United States . Assuming you 're a civilian living in a typical place in the United States \u2014 that is , not American Samoa or whatever \u2014 you may be within the jurisdiction of as many as five [[separate]] democratically or [[semi]] - democratically elected governments : the municipality , the township , the county , the state and the union . Certain hard limits are placed on [[lower]] tiers by upper tiers , particularly regarding how those lower tiers must respect basic civil rights . For example , it would be unlawful for * any * tier of government in the United States to charge a poll tax during an election . It 's prohibited by law , and if attempted would be challenged in a court of appropriate jurisdiction and overturned . However , within those basic limits , each tier is more or less left at its own discretion to organize itself however it wants , and that includes setting the rules for local elections . As long as those rules do n't violate fundamental principles of law , the individual bodies politic can do * whatever . * If some municipal government somewhere wanted to change its method of electing its mayor from election by ballot to election by acclamation , and the laws of the locally relevant upper tiers of government \u2014 meaning the state constitution , basically \u2014 did n't expressly prohibit it , they could go right ahead . This even applies to a certain extent to locally run elections which are part of a higher - level process . For instance , each state 's senators are elected by the people of that state \u2014 this is set down in the 17th amendment to the US Constitution . But the precise method for holding that election is left to the states \u2026 and the states , in turn , may leave it to the lower tiers of government . So when you start talking about changing the fundamental method of election in the United States , you 're kind of talking about a lot . You 're talking about well upwards of 25,000 individual municipal governments , God knows how [[many]] civil townships , more than 3,000 counties or equivalent , fifty states and a smattering of [[non]] - state territories . Depending on * which of those * you 're talking about , the rules for changing the rules \u2014 if you know what I mean \u2014 are going to vary . If you 're talking about changing how the town of Hart 's Location , New Hampshire \u2014 population 41 ; they had three babies in 2010 \u2014 elects its selectmen , you need to convince about two dozen people to agree with you , then you 're done .

{"text": "A generalized linear model ( GLM ) is a [[flexible]] statistical model that can be used to analyze a [[wide]] range of data types . It is an extension of the linear regression model , which is used to model the relationship between a continuous response variable and one or more predictor variables .     The key difference between a linear regression model and a GLM is that in a GLM , the response variable is not necessarily continuous and may follow a different distribution , such as a binomial , poisson , or gamma distribution . The GLM allows for the modeling of this type of data by using a link function to relate the mean of the response variable to a [[linear]] combination of the predictor variables .     In a GLM , the response variable is assumed to follow a certain distribution , and the mean of this distribution is modeled as a [[linear]] combination of the predictor variables . The parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the data , which is the probability of observing the data given the model .     Examples of GLMs include logistic regression for modeling binary data , Poisson regression for modeling count data , and gamma regression for modeling continuous data with a positive skew .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Some common causes of gallbladder issues include gallstones , inflammation of the gallbladder ( cholecystitis ) , and inflammation of the bile ducts ( cholangitis ) .   If you have been experiencing symptoms that mimic gallbladder attacks for more than a year , it is important to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation and management . Your healthcare provider will likely ask about your symptoms , perform a [[physical]] examination , and order tests [[such]] as blood tests , imaging studies , or endoscopic procedures to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment .   Treatment for gallbladder issues may include medications to reduce inflammation , dissolve gallstones , or improve bile flow , as well as lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet and avoiding foods that may trigger symptoms . In some cases , surgery may be necessary to remove the gallbladder ( cholecystectomy ) if other treatments are not effective .

{"text": "Not in a fraternity , but a foreigner who spent time studying at a US college . Fraternities ( and sororities ) are basically structured [[social]] groups . When college students leave their hometown and arrive at college , they often know very few people and are not used to taking the initiative in meeting people . Fraternities provide a medium for students to socialise and bond . Since fraternities often have a reputation , students can join to meet likeminded peers who they might not otherwise meet . For example , some fraternities will have a charity focus , others will have people who grew up in a certain area , others will attract goofy guys or sporty guys . Fraternities also provide structured social situations to meet girls ( or sororities for meeting boys ) by holding parties , date nights and other functions . Finally , because the drinking age in America is 21 , most students ca n't go to bars for the first few years of college , so fraternities also function as [[social]] hubs in the same way that bars / clubs do once you reach the legal drinking age . Having said that , there are arguably a number of downsides to fraternities . They can perpetuate social stratification because current members of the fraternity pick the incoming members . Members will often only want to invite freshman students who are similar to them , and so the fraternity and sorority scene can appear quite insular . I have heard that people belong in a certain fraternity because they went to X high school , they have family money , or because they are a ' legacy ' ( i.e. their dad / mum was in the fraternity / sorority ) . Also , because [[only]] fraternities hold parties ( sororities have nice houses and do n't want them trashed ) , guys in the ' cool ' fraternities hold an imbalance of social power as other students ( particularly girls ) need to befriend them to get invited to the parties ( if they ca n't get into bars ) .

The goal of a [[mutual]] fund is to provide investors with a diversified investment that is professionally managed , with the aim of earning a profit . Mutual funds are often considered a good option for beginners or for people who do n't have a lot of money to invest , because they allow investors to spread their money across a wide range of different securities , which can help reduce risk .

A hedge fund is a type of investment vehicle that is typically only available to accredited investors ( people who meet certain income or [[net]] worth requirements ) . Hedge funds are usually more risky and more [[aggressive]] than mutual funds , and they often use more complex investment strategies , such as short selling and leverage , to try to generate higher returns . Hedge funds are known for being less regulated than mutual funds , and they often charge higher fees to investors . There are many other types of investment funds as well , such as exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , private equity funds , and venture capital funds .

The company that buys the debt is usually hoping to make a profit by collecting the debt from the person or company who owes it . They do this by contacting the debtor and trying to get them to pay the debt . If they are successful in getting the debtor to pay , then the company that bought the debt makes a profit .   Here 's an example :   Company A sells a product to Company B for $ 100 . Company B does n't pay Company A for the product . Company A decides it does n't want to try to collect the debt , so it sells the debt to Company C for $ 50 . Company C contacts Company B and tries to get them to pay the debt . If Company B agrees to pay the debt , then Company C will have made a profit of $ 50 ( $ 100 - $ 50 = $ 50 ) .

{"text": "The Tupac hologram that appeared at Coachella in 2012 was created using a technology called [[holographic]] projection . [[Holographic]] projection involves projecting a 3D image onto a transparent screen , creating the illusion of a 3D object or person being present in the room .   To create the Tupac hologram , the creators used a combination of computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) and live action footage of Tupac . They took existing recordings of Tupac 's voice and used CGI to create a 3D model of his body . They then used this 3D model to create a [[holographic]] projection of Tupac on stage .   The holographic projection was controlled by a computer , which was programmed to move the holographic Tupac in a way that made it appear as if he was performing on stage . The [[holographic]] Tupac was able to move and speak , creating the impression that he was actually present at the event .   Overall , the Tupac hologram was created using a combination of advanced technology and [[careful]] planning , and it was able to create the illusion of Tupac being present on stage at Coachella in 2012 .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "When a country goes into default , it means that it is unable to pay its debts . This can happen if the country has taken out loans from other countries or international organizations , or if it has issued bonds ( which are essentially IOUs ) to investors . If the country can not make the required payments on these debts , it is considered to be in default . There are [[different]] levels of default , ranging from a \" technical default , \" which is a minor missed payment , to a \" full - blown default , \" which is a complete failure to pay all of a country 's debts . If the US were to go into default , it could have serious consequences for the country 's economy and its reputation around the world . For example , the value of the US dollar could decline , leading to higher prices for imported goods and potentially causing inflation . Other countries and investors might also become [[hesitant]] to lend money to the US in the future , which could make it more difficult and expensive for the US to borrow money . In addition , the US 's credit rating , which is a measure of its ability to pay its debts , could be downgraded , making it harder for the US to borrow money in the future at favorable rates .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Water coming out of the tailpipe of a car or truck is usually a [[normal]] occurrence and is not usually a cause for concern . The water is created when the fuel in the vehicle 's engine is burned . This process creates hot gases , which are then cooled by the vehicle 's cooling system . When the hot gases cool , some of the water vapor in the gases condenses and turns back into a liquid , and this liquid water can be seen coming out of the tailpipe .   In some cases , [[excessive]] water coming out of the tailpipe can be a sign of a problem with the vehicle 's cooling system or with the engine itself .

{"text": "Sure ! A railgun is a type of gun that uses electricity to launch a projectile instead of gunpowder . It works by using two metal rails and a sliding armature to create a strong magnetic field .   First , a very strong electrical current is passed through the rails . This creates a magnetic field that pushes against the armature , which is a conductive metal bar or rod that is mounted between the rails . When the magnetic field is [[strong]] enough , it can overcome the force of gravity and friction , causing the armature to slide along the rails at high speed .   The armature is connected to the projectile , which is a small metal object that is meant to be launched from the gun . As the armature slides along the rails , it carries the projectile with it , propelling it out of the railgun and through the air .   That 's the basic idea , but there are a lot of technical details and engineering challenges involved in making a railgun work properly . Some railguns use additional components , such as a pulsed power supply or a plasma armature , to achieve even higher speeds and greater accuracy .   I hope that helps !

In general , people keep electing the same people as long as they run again . There are two main reasons for it . 1 . Redistricting - Every 10 years when a new census comes out lines have to be redrawn to accurately decide how much representation in congress each state gets . This is often used as an opportunity for the party that is in charge in each state to change the lines so that it favors them . Over time this means that * * [[most]] * * districts lean heavily one way or another . This means that if you 're a republican or democrat in the house of representatives , if you run again next term , the guy from the other party probably wo n't be able to beat you . There are laws to limit this effect , although it still happens . Redistricting is n't a factor in the senate . 2 . People like * * their representative * * even if they do n't like congress . While people say they do n't like congress , they still like the guy they voted for . This is partly because of # 1 above but it 's a common situation . This is because even though congress makes decisions a lot of people dislike , their representative will often vote how they prefer . The reason congress does n't agree is mostly because they 'll be replaced next election if they work with the other side . * * So [[most]] people are [[upset]] with congress , but when they have a chance to change a small part of it , they overwhelmingly will choose to not do so . * * A small majority are upset with the president , but he ca n't run again in 2016 anyway .

{"text": "A program is just a bunch of very simple instructions for doing something . A programming language lets you say how to do something complicated in terms of several simple steps \u2014 including steps that are repeated ( \" loops \" ) and steps where you might decide which of two or more things to do ( \" conditionals \" ) . For instance , suppose you are programming a little robot that can move around on a piece of paper . The robot has a pen in its belly , so it draws a line wherever it goes . You would like to get the robot to draw a square . But all it knows how to do is * go forward or back by some number of inches * , and * turn left or right by some number of degrees * . So you have to tell it how to make a square out of those moves . You might write a program like this : to draw_a_square forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 end If the robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and ended up back where it started . This is , in fact , a program in the language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which used to be very [[popular]] for teaching programming to grade school students . You can find the Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that you can use repeated steps ? You can use these to make a program shorter , like this : to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That 's a lot shorter than the earlier program , but it does the same thing . It 's shorter because instead of repeating instructions ourselves , we tell the robot to repeat doing them . Programs can also take inputs , for instance , telling how big the square should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward : size right 90 ] end Or , even , instead of a square , we could draw an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon : sides : size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 / : sides ) ] end So , programs can repeat themselves and they can do different things based on their inputs . They can also control [[different]] parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to the speakers or communicating with other programs over the network . But the basic steps of any program are based on making decisions and doing things repeatedly .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Index funds are a type of investment vehicle that tracks the performance of a specific financial market index , such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ Composite . They are designed to provide investors with broad exposure to the market and to track the performance of the underlying index as closely as [[possible]] . Index funds are generally considered to be a reliable investment option because they offer a [[low]] - cost way to diversify your portfolio and access a broad range of assets . However , there are a [[few]] circumstances in which index funds may become less reliable : Market disruptions : Like all investments , index funds are subject to market risk and can be affected by events that disrupt the financial markets . For example , a recession or market crash could result in significant declines in the value of the index and the corresponding index fund . Tracking error : Index funds are designed to track the performance of the underlying index as closely as possible , but they may not always do so perfectly . This difference in performance is known as tracking error . Tracking error can be caused by a variety of factors , such as transaction costs and differences in the way the fund and the index are weighted . Changes in the underlying index : Changes in the composition of the underlying index can also affect the performance of an index fund . For example , if a company is removed from the index , the fund may no longer have exposure to that company . Overall , index funds are a reliable investment option , but like any investment , they carry some level of risk and may not always perform as expected . It 's important to carefully consider your investment objectives and risk tolerance before deciding whether index funds are appropriate for your portfolio .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "[[Technical]] analysis is a method of evaluating securities by analyzing statistics generated by market activity , such as past prices and volume . Technical analysts use charts and other tools to identify patterns that can suggest buying or selling opportunities . There are many technical analysis indicators that are used to help make trading decisions , but some of the most commonly used indicators that are considered leading indicators include : Moving averages : These indicators smooth out price action by taking the average of prices over a certain time period , such as the last 50 days . Moving averages can help identify trends and can also be used to generate buy and sell signals . Relative strength index ( RSI ): This indicator measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine overbought or oversold conditions . When the RSI is above 70 , it may be overbought , and when it is below 30 , it may be oversold . Moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ): This indicator uses two moving averages to identify trend changes and can also generate buy and sell signals . Bollinger bands : These are bands plotted around a moving average that show the level of volatility in a security . When prices move outside of the bands , it may indicate that a trend is changing . It 's important to note that [[technical]] analysis indicators should not be used in isolation , and it is generally recommended to use a combination of indicators to make trading decisions . It 's also important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results and that technical analysis is just one method of evaluating securities .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

It would then perform the addition and store the result back in its memory .   The CPU can execute billions of instructions per second , which allows it to perform [[complex]] tasks quickly . It can also communicate with other parts of the computer , such as the memory , the hard drive , and the keyboard , to read and write information .   That 's a very [[simple]] explanation of how computers work , but there is a lot more to it than that . If you have any more questions , feel free to ask !", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Motion capture is a technology that allows game developers to record the movements of people and animals and use that data to create realistic animations in their games . It has been used in the game industry for many years , but it has become more popular and more advanced in recent years . Before motion capture , game developers had to create animations manually , which was a [[very]] time - consuming process . They would have to draw each frame of the animation by hand , or use computers to create the animations from scratch . This was not very [[efficient]] , and it was difficult to create realistic animations this way . To use motion capture , game developers set up a special studio with many cameras that are pointed at the person or animal whose movements they want to capture . The person or animal wears a [[special]] suit with markers on it , which the cameras can track . As the person or animal moves , the cameras record their movements and send the data to a computer . The computer then translates that data into an animation that the game can use . So motion capture makes it easier for game developers to create realistic animations , because they can just record the real movements of people and animals instead of having to create the animations by hand .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "They 're not loopholes . That 's just a propaganda word people use to confuse things . There are basically two different things that people sometimes erroneously call loopholes : There are tax deductions , and then there are standard accounting practices . A tax deduction is anything that you can * spend * money on that * reduces * your taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ 100,000 in a year . You spend a quarter of that , let 's say , on * stuff * , stuff like your mortgage and food and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 at the end of the year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your tax rate is a flat 10 % of your taxable income , and your taxable income is everything you make in a year . That means in this year , your [[taxable]] income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of that is $ 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe the government $ 10,000 , out of the $ 75,000 you have on hand . But the government allows you to * deduct * charitable contributions from your [[taxable]] income . Meaning anything you give to charity is * subtracted from * your taxable income for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to your local soup kitchen , let 's say . That $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income just $ 50,000 , rather than $ 100,000 . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced your tax bill from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 , which is only 5 % of your gross income . Some people just look at the [[last]] sentence \u2014 you only paid 5 % of your gross income in taxes \u2014 and think that 's [[unfair]] , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we give tax deductions * hoping people will take advantage of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people to do certain things with their money , things like give to charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are just standard accounting practices . One thing that 's been in the news kind of recently is the question of personal income from hedge fund managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does n't get paid a salary ; instead , he gets a percentage of the profits the hedge fund makes under his management . Makes sense , right ? You 're tying the manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's gain , all his income is taxed at the capital gains tax rate of 15 % , not at the income tax rate of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole , but that 's just propaganda . Accounting for your income that way is what you 're * supposed to do . * It 's not a cheat . It 's how the system is set up . We can talk about whether the system * should be * set up that way or not , but the fact is that * is * how the system is set up , and the hedge fund manager who reports his income as capital gain is following the rules . If he did it any * other [[*]] way he 'd be * breaking * the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they 're almost certainly talking about things that are built into the system for good reason and which people do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does * not * imply that people are cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so you can get [[mad]] at those dirty cheats \u2026 who are in reality just doing exactly and nothing other than what the tax code tells them they 're supposed to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'll attempt to be concise and simple in my response . Qualification : Senior at the University of Michigan double majoring in Psychology and Biological Sciences . First , let 's talk briefly about the nervous and endocrine system . As information in your surrounding environment is perceived with your senses , it 's transformed into neural signals . Depending on the importance of the information determines whether or not your autonomic nervous system ( automatic part of your nervous system ) activates your body 's fear response . Just because it 's labeled as a fear response does n't necessarily mean you 're afraid . Even happy emotions are products of your body 's nervous system response . The underlying theme here is your body becomes AROUSED . Next , your [[sympathetic]] [[nervous]] system ( a division of your autonomic nervous system responsible for arousal ) begins preparing your body by signaling other organs to release hormones through your bloodstream . For example , your adrenal glands located directly above your kidneys release epinephrine and norepinephrine . Furthermore , [[various]] organs release aid hormones . Your nervous system increases neural firing and dumps extra neurotransmitters in your brain to prepare for the potential stressor . As a result , your heart rate increases , you perspire at greater rates , you salivate less , and above all , blood from internal organs especially your stomach ( digestion becomes less important to your body 's needs ) moves away to aid your muscles . As a result , the lower blood delivery to your stomach is responsible for the subjective feeling of emotion in your stomach . The sense of being \" sick \" to your stomach after sad events , butterflies when you see a cute girl , or feeling [[nauseous]] thinking about an upcoming exam are all rooted in the body 's automatic fear response . Keep in mind the response is so sensitive that just thinking about something stressful can trigger it . Through years of evolution , humans were made to be as efficient as possible to increase survival . No wonder we 're not extinct ! :p", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The reason is that your urine is based on your blood filtering through your kidneys . This is a constant process , so you are always producing urine which needs to be emptied . Pretty much any time , day or night , if you said to yourself \" I am going to go pee , even though I do n't need to , \" you would manage to pee at least something . Your stool , unlike your urine , is based on the food that you eat . You eat food in short time segments , in between which are [[long]] periods of not - eating . The food you eat has a VERY long path to travel from your mouth to your bowel , so long that when you pass stool , it is probably from food you ate the day before . Since food passes through your digestive tract slowly , the [[individual]] food - remains stay separated , and the urge to pass each stool only arises when the fecal matter comes into the area of the anal sphincter , which your brain interprets as a need to use the toilet . The release of stool and the release of urine both require relaxing sphincters in your pelvic region . So when you need to poo , it is simply convenient also to pee ( as you are pretty much guaranteed to have urine waiting to be expelled ) . But since you will have to pee more often , it is not always urgent for you to poo .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history into this explanation which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts without learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on to the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very clear answers for addressing the faults . His basic plan was that industrialized nations should move to socialism , and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain later why no [[communist]] country actually followed his plan . One of Marx and Engels arguments was that prior to industrialization , we produced not much more than we used . Obviously there was trade but for the most part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines come along and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author of Wealth of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a product , you might have 10 who accomplish different portions of the task . This made production go way up . What Marx criticized was the effect of having such a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the [[good]] decreases because the supply is so high . This required two things , one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition who , through free market competition , lower prices . The second was that you had to find new markets . Given the world at the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods . So the more markets that opened up the more needed to be produced . Marx believed that workers standard of living decreased as people were moved into the cities to meet the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of owning your own land or home , you lived in worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private land ownership ( understatement , his summation of Communism was \" The abolition of [[private]] property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not by the family . If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the local land . Back to industrialization , this is the period of time where we find child labor , a lack of labor laws , unions , or anyone fighting for the workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . The [[first]] was the bourgeois ( boor - zhwa ) who had the capital ( the money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name basically means \" in the walled city \" . The [[second]] class was the proletariat . These are the workers in the factories and on the farms . Their standard of living is so low that they can only afford to survive . The name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the ones who are actually doing the work and producing the goods , yet they are treated the [[worst]] and receive little of the profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers ruled . He argued for labor unions to protect themselves from increasingly [[poor]] conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to lose their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these conditions \" well then the managers and owners would have to listen . They ca n't do the work on their own , they require a large number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , or strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than it cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx said , was the result of industrialization and the drive for profit it produced . He stated that we stopped producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is increased , demand is decreased , and the price decreases . This is not good news for the worker as this cycle feeds back on itself , and ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A 401(k ) plan is a type of employer - sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax - deferred basis . The contributions are made through payroll deductions and are invested in a selection of mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , or other investment options offered by the plan . Employers may also make matching contributions or offer other incentives to encourage participation in the plan . There are several strategies that you can consider when investing in a 401(k ) plan : Diversification : One of the key principles of investing is diversification , which means spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes , such as stocks , bonds , and cash , in order to reduce risk . By diversifying your 401(k ) investments , you can potentially reduce the impact of volatility on your portfolio . Contribute as much as you can : The more you contribute to your 401(k ) , the more you 'll have to save for retirement . Consider increasing your contributions over time , especially if your employer offers matching contributions . Consider your risk tolerance : Different investments carry different levels of risk , so it 's important to consider your risk tolerance when selecting your 401(k ) investments . If you 're younger and have a longer time horizon , you may be able to tolerate more risk in your portfolio . On the other hand , if you 're closer to retirement , you may want to focus on more conservative investments . Review your portfolio regularly : It 's important to review your 401(k ) investments periodically to ensure that they 're still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance . This may involve rebalancing your portfolio by selling some investments and buying others . Take advantage of employer matching contributions : If your employer offers matching contributions , be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit . Employer matching contributions can significantly increase the amount of money you 'll have saved for retirement . It 's also a [[good]] idea to consult with a financial professional or a 401(k ) plan representative for additional guidance on investing in a 401(k ) plan .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

But not everything that goes into your stomach is meant to stay there . Your body needs to get rid of waste products , like excess water and other substances that it does n't need or ca n't use . To do this , your body has a special system for filtering and eliminating waste .   Your kidneys are two bean - shaped organs located in your lower back .

So , even though everything in your stomach mixes together , your body has a way of separating the things it needs from the things it does n't need .

They had a [[large]] population and needed the land more than a few measly farmers . The farmers recognized they were greatly outnumbered and called in assistance from the Australian Government . They sent in military aid in the form of a handful of soldiers and automatic weapons . The Gods showed kindness to the Emus and sent rain , slowing the soldiers down for a bit . On November 2nd the Great Emu war began . Soldiers set up a firing line , but because the Emus are so cunning they recognized this and stayed outside of the effective firing range of the enemy soldiers weapons . Local farmers were sent out to try and lure the Emus into the ambush , but the Emus knew the trap and broke down into small herds / teams to make themselves more difficult to target . Unfortunately nearly a dozens Emus lost their lives that day . On November 4th the [[Australian]] soldiers were able to successfully set up a ambush near the [[local]] dam , a place where Emus went to refresh themselves with drink and bathe . The Gods once again smiled upon the Emus , no [[more]] than 12 fell that day before the [[coward]] Australian soldier guns jammed , stopping their assault and giving the Emus time to escape . Various mistakes on the soldiers part gave great help to the Emus being [[able]] to outlast their opponents . On November 8th the Emus were able to successfully push back the Australians after a battle of attrition . The Australians wasted numerous resources on this engagement for little results .

{"text": "Braces are used to straighten teeth and correct misalignment in the jaw . They work by applying pressure to the teeth over time , gradually moving them into the desired position . This process can take several months or even years , depending on the severity of the misalignment . To be effective , braces must apply a consistent and controlled amount of pressure to the teeth . If the braces were able to move too far back or forth , they might not apply enough pressure to the teeth to effectively move them into the desired position . Additionally , if the braces were able to move too freely , they might not be able to hold the teeth in place once they have been moved into the desired position . This could cause the teeth to shift back out of alignment , negating the effects of the braces .

{"text": "There is a belief among some people that there is a \" gay agenda \" , a movement to intentionally change ( American ) society . Some people think that homosexuality in any form is evil , particularly if you interpret the bible in a certain way that seems to indicate that God himself views homosexuality as a sin . So , to them , just as we should not glorify murder and rape , we should also not accept homosexuality as a [[common]] place way of life . People who believe this way see [[sinister]] motives in even people just wanting to make marriage between two men legal , abolishing laws banning sex in forms other than the missionary position , and granting them non - [[discriminatory]] rights , such as hospital visitation or fair employment and housing - you should n't be denied a job or a home just because you are [[gay]] . The gay agenda to them is any movement in society which alters society 's perception of homosexuality away from viewing them as subhuman evil people to [[normal]] human beings who just want to live like everyone else . Making them equal , making them normal , and making them accepted is a gay agenda , intended to brainwash the youth into thinking that this lifestyle is acceptable . Hidden within all of that is the premise that homosexuality is a choice . If it were n't then it would be cruel of God to make people that way without a way to change it , and it would make it harder to condemn people to hell if it was n't something that they willingly chose . I can feel morally [[superior]] to a woman who has sex outside of marriage and say she 's going to hell for her choice . It would be really difficult to condemn all women as being sinners , saying that they share the same gender as Eve and therefore , no women should be [[able]] to get into heaven . The more extremist may have paranoid delusions that go far beyond acceptance and think that there is a secret cabal of homosexuals who do n't want to just live their [[own]] lives without homophobic laws and moral condemnation of strangers , but rather that they actually want to make some straight people gay , particularly younger children . If you start from the premise that gay people are evil , condemn them , and shun anyone you know who is gay , then your [[little]] world will consist of people who are thoroughly [[straight]] while gay people will avoid you , hate you , and hide their sexuality from you . To these extremists , this justifies their thinking that [[gay]] people are very rare , only a perverted very small minority that wants to spread their condition , their thinking , their disease to innocent youth . Then , when some teenager comes out as being [[gay]] within their small , sheltered inner circle , they conclude it was the work of gays MAKING the child gay . They assume a default position of straight and choosing to be gay is like your child getting a haircut and dying it purple . Their ideal world on earth is where everyone is straight and God - fearing , and so any attempts to normalize homosexuals is seen as purely evil , the work of an agenda that wants to persecute their beliefs . It helps that if they feel like they are being persecuted for their belief that homosexuality is [[evil]] , they feel akin to Jesus , and while they are n't being literal martyrs , getting people opposing their beliefs makes them feel like they are [[metaphorical]] martyrs for God .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Single malt Scotch whisky is made from water , malted barley , and yeast . Here 's the general process for making single malt Scotch whisky:\\n\\nMalting : The barley is soaked in water and allowed to germinate , or sprout . During this process , enzymes are produced that will convert the starch in the barley into sugars . The [[germinated]] barley is then dried over a peat fire , which gives it a distinctive smoky flavor.\\n\\nMilling : The dried malt is ground into a coarse flour called grist.\\n\\nMashing : The grist is mixed with hot water in a large vessel called a mash tun . This process , called mashing , extracts the sugars from the malt and creates a liquid called wort.\\n\\nFermentation : The wort is transferred to a large vessel called a washback , where it is mixed with yeast . The yeast ferments the sugars in the wort , converting them into alcohol and producing a liquid called wash . The wash has an alcohol content of about 8 - 9%.\\n\\nDistillation : The wash is transferred to a still , where it is heated until the alcohol vaporizes . The vapor is then condensed back into a liquid , resulting in a [[clear]] , colorless liquid called low wine . The low wine is then distilled again , producing a liquid called spirit.\\n\\nAging : The spirit is placed in oak barrels to mature . The barrels are typically aged for at least three years , although some [[single]] malt Scotch whiskies are aged for much longer . During the aging process , the spirit takes on the color and flavor characteristics of the barrel.\\n\\nBlending and bottling : The aged spirit is typically blended with spirit from [[other]] barrels to create a [[consistent]] flavor profile . The blended spirit is then bottled and sold as single malt Scotch whisky.\\n\\nThere are many variables that can affect the flavor of single malt Scotch whisky , including the type of barley used , the water source , the type of yeast , the type of barrel used for aging , and the length of aging .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

For example , GPS is a military system run by the US Navy . They could , if they wanted to , shut it off or degrade it . The Russians were n't happy with relying on a US military system , given that there is a lot of disagreement between Russia and America , so they built their own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe , the EU government were concerned that they were relying on a foreign military system for a lot of commercial and government work . They were also annoyed that GPS only made a crude signal [[available]] for the public and law enforcement , but the military got a much [[higher]] precision signal . So , the EU government decided to build their own system ( Galileo ) which would give an improved accuracy free public signal , and a premium signal ( with paid subscription ) which would give the same accuracy as the GPS military signal . It would also be optimized for use in Europe . GPS satellites do n't really orbit over the Arctic region , so GPS reception in places like North Norway or Northern Sweden is not very reliable . The Galileo satellites are intended to go into orbits which go much further North , but the disadvantage is that you need more satellites to cover the increased amount of land . [[Same]] sort of thing with IRNSS ( India ) and BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all these systems you broadly the same technology but on slightly [[different]] frequencies . This means your [[receiver]] needs to have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the different systems . Dual system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been available for a while - they were n't terribly [[popular]] initially because the GLONASS system has been very unreliable with satellites dying or malfunctioning and not being replaced . However , the Russians have repaired and updated their GLONASS satellites , and it 's now a good quality [[modern]] system , so most latest generation GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS signal as well . One of the advantages of a receiver which supports both systems is that it is [[possible]] to get a more [[accurate]] position because you can combine the measurements from both systems when the receiver does the final position calculation . The Galileo system is n't [[complete]] , in fact , it is n't really functional , as it does n't have [[enough]] satellites to work 24/7 . However , many new GPS receivers are \" Galileo ready \" which means that they have the antenna and circuits in place , but the firmware to process the signals has n't been finalized . Once enough satellites are up and working , the manufacturer of the receiver will be able to test their firmware , and then once tested and working will be make it available for download .", "label": "hc3human"}

I would encourage you to use the $ 9k to finance directly without a lease , especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term . The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case , and worse , will likely expose you to risk of having to pay [[additional]] fees if you break certain terms in the lease ( mileage , wear and tear , etc ) [[Best]] option mathematically is to use the $ 9k to purchase a vehicle for cash . This provides the lowest [[total]] cost of ownership .   Even if you are afraid of purchasing a lemon , leasing a vehicle is awfully expensive insurance against that possibility . You would have to rack up some significant repairs to justify the cost of the lease vs cash over the term of operating the vehicle .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Private labels are products that are produced by one company and sold under another company 's brand name . Private labeling is a common practice in the [[retail]] industry , where a retailer will work with a manufacturer to produce a product that is [[exclusive]] to the retailer and carries the retailer 's brand . Private labels are often created to offer customers a lower - priced alternative to national brands , or to offer a unique product that is not available from other retailers . Private labeling can also help retailers differentiate themselves from their competitors by offering a unique product selection . Private labels are often referred to as \" store brands \" or \" generic brands . \"", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Sure ! A programming language is created by a team of developers who design the language to be used by programmers to write instructions for computers to follow . These instructions are called \" code . \" \r \r  To create a new programming language , the developers will first decide what the language will be used for and what features it will have . They will then write the code for the language using another programming language , such as C or Python . \r \r  Once the new programming language is finished , programmers can use it to write code by using special software called a \" code editor . \" The code that is written in the new programming language can then be run on a computer by using a \" compiler , \" which converts the code into a form that the computer can understand and execute . \r \r  Operating systems , which are the software that runs on a computer and manages its resources , can recognize [[new]] programming languages by using the compiler for that language .

{"text": "netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows ( e.g. debits / credits , payments / receipts , income / expense ) by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows , creating one transaction .    For example , if you make two trades in one day with your broker - one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 - rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 , the transactions are \" [[netted]] \" - meaning they will send you the \" net \" amount of $ 10 ( $ 110 inflow - $ 100 outflow ) . In a more general sense ( \" netting of instructions \" ) it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the \" [[net]] \" effect - e.g. one step forward , two steps back would combine to a \" net \" one step back .   Most likely it will apply to the exchange of money , but it could be applied more broadly . Note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows . You can also \" [[net]] \" multiple inflows ( or outflows ) into one transaction by just adding them all up , but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows .", "label": "hc3human"}
