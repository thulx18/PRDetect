{"text": "There There are are a few ways ways that that we we can can determine determine the the distance to to stars stars and and other objects in in the the universe universe . One One way is is by by using using something something called parallax parallax . Parallax Parallax is is the the apparent apparent shift in in the the position position of an an object object against against the the background background when when viewed viewed from from different different angles . For For example example , if you you hold hold your your finger finger up up in front front of of you you and and close close one eye eye , then then open open that eye eye and and close close the the other eye eye , your your finger finger will will appear appear to move move against against the background background . This This is because because you you are are looking at at it it from from two two different different angles angles . We We can can use use this this same same principle to to determine determine the the distance distance to to nearby stars . By By measuring measuring the the apparent shift in in the the position position of of a star star against against the the background background of of more more distant distant stars stars ( as as viewed viewed from from opposite opposite sides sides of Earth 's orbit orbit around around the the sun ) , we we can calculate calculate how how far far away away the the star star is is . This This method method is is most most accurate accurate for for stars stars that that are are relatively relatively close close to to us us ( within a few hundred hundred light - years years ) . For more distant distant objects , such such as as quasars quasars and galaxies , we use use other methods methods to determine determine their their distance distance . One One such method method is called called the the cosmic cosmic distance distance ladder ladder , which which involves using using a series series of of \" rungs rungs \" or steps to to measure measure the the distance distance to to increasingly increasingly distant distant objects . Each Each rung rung of the the ladder ladder relies relies on on a different different type type of of \" standard candle , \" which which is is an an object object that is is known known to have a certain intrinsic brightness brightness . By By measuring measuring the the brightness brightness of the the object object as as seen seen from from Earth Earth , we we can can determine determine its distance . For For example example , one one type type of of standard standard candle candle that that we we use use is is a type of star star called called a Cepheid Cepheid variable variable . These These stars stars have have a very very regular regular pulse pulse , and and the the time time between between pulses is is directly related related to to the the star star 's intrinsic intrinsic brightness brightness . By By measuring measuring the the time time between between pulses , we we can can determine the the star 's 's brightness brightness , and therefore therefore its its distance distance . Once we we have have determined determined the the distance to a Cepheid Cepheid variable variable , we we can can use use it it as as a \" rung rung \" on on the the cosmic cosmic distance distance ladder ladder to to measure measure the distance distance to to other other objects objects that that are farther farther away away . For For example , we we can can use Cepheid Cepheid variables variables to to measure measure the the distance to nearby nearby galaxies , and and then then use use those galaxies galaxies as as \" rungs \" to to measure measure the the distance to to even more more distant distant galaxies galaxies . This This way , we we can can build build up up a \" ladder ladder \" of of distances distances that reaches reaches all all the way way out out to the the most distant distant objects objects in the the universe universe .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Quantum Quantum levitation levitation is is a phenomenon phenomenon in which which an object object is suspended above above a surface surface without without any any physical contact contact . This This can can be be achieved achieved using using the the principles principles of of quantum quantum mechanics mechanics , which which is is a branch branch of of physics physics that that studies studies the the behavior behavior of of particles particles at at very small small scales scales , such such as as atoms atoms and and subatomic subatomic particles particles . To To understand understand how quantum quantum levitation works works , it it helps helps to to think think about about a magnet magnet . Magnets Magnets have north north and south south poles poles , and and opposite poles poles attract attract each other while while similar similar poles repel each other . This This is is because because of of the the magnetic magnetic field field that that surrounds surrounds a magnet magnet . Now Now imagine imagine a superconductor superconductor , which which is is a material material that that can can conduct conduct electricity electricity with zero zero resistance resistance . When When a superconductor superconductor is is placed placed in a strong strong magnetic field field , it is is able able to to \" float \" above above the the magnet due due to to the the repelling repelling forces between between the the two two . This This is is known known as as the the Meissner Meissner effect effect . Quantum levitation levitation works in in a similar way , but instead instead of of using using a magnet magnet and a superconductor superconductor , it it uses uses a superconductor and and a surface surface with with a pattern pattern of of magnetic field . When When the the superconductor superconductor is is cooled cooled to a very low low temperature temperature , it it becomes becomes a superconductor and is is able to \" float float \" above above the surface surface due due to the the repelling forces between between the the two two . So to sum it it up , quantum quantum levitation levitation is the the result result of of the the repelling repelling forces forces between between a superconductor superconductor and and a surface surface with with a pattern pattern of of magnetic field field , caused caused by by the the Meissner effect effect .

If If you you have have $ X income income in in State State A where where you you claim claim nonresident status and and $ Y income income overall overall , then then you you owe owe State State A a fraction ( X / Y ) of of the the income tax that that would would have have been been due due on on $ Y income income had had you been a resident resident of of State State A.

If If you you are are a resident resident of of State State B , then then State State B will tax tax you you on on $ Y but but give give you you some some credit credit for taxes taxes paid paid to to State State A.

As a practical practical matter matter , many many commercial real - estate estate investments investments are set set up as as limited limited partnerships partnerships in in which most most of of the the annual taxable taxable income income is a small small amount amount of of portfolio portfolio income income ( usually usually interest income income that that you you report report on on Schedule Schedule B of Form Form 1040 1040 ) , and and the annual annual bottom bottom line line is is lots lots of of passive losses losses which which the the limited partners partners report report ( but but do do not not get to to deduct deduct ) on the the Federal Federal return return . As As a result result , State State A is is unlikely unlikely to come come after after you for the tax tax on on , say say , $ 100 100 of interest interest income income each each year year because because it will will cost them more to to go go after after you you than than they will recover recover from from you . But But , when when the the real real estate estate is is sold , there there will will ( hopefully hopefully ) be be a big capital gain , most most of which which will will be be sheltered sheltered from from Federal Federal tax tax since the the passive passive losses losses finally finally get to to be deducted deducted . At At this this point point , State State A is not not only owed owed a lot lot of of money money ( it it knows knows nothing nothing of of your your passive losses losses etc ) but , after it processes processes the the income income tax return that that you filed for for that year year , it will will likely likely demand that that you you file file income tax tax returns returns for for previous years years as as well well .", "label": "hc3human"}

But they they did did have have a sense for for fashion fashion . Most metals metals exist exist naturally naturally as as rock rock . The The metal atoms are connected connected to to other other kinds of of elements elements like like silicon and and they do n't n't look look very very interesting interesting ( to to a non non - geologist ) . In the the world world before before the the Bronze Age Age , the only metals metals most most humans humans would would recognize recognize were were silver silver and and gold gold . Gold Gold can can be found found as as \" nuggets nuggets \" or or \" dust dust \" . The processes processes that that bring bring it it to to the the surface tends tends to to deposit deposit it it in in veins veins so that if if you you find find some some , you you 're 're likely to find find more more . Typically Typically it it is is exposed exposed by by weather weather and flushed flushed downhill into into rivers rivers , so so finding finding gold gold means means finding a river with some some gold gold or silver silver in in it it , and and then then looking looking for more more - you do do n't n't have have to to mine mine it it . You You can can work work gold gold without without heat heat . It It is \" malleable malleable \" at at room temperature temperature , which means means you you can can whack whack on on it it with with hammers to change change the the shape shape of of a lump lump of of gold gold and and bend bend it it with with tongs tongs - and and even even though though it it is is malleable it it wo wo n't n't lose its its new shape shape once you you finish finish working it it and that that means means you can can make useful useful things . Gold Gold will will not not hold an an edge so so it is is useless useless as as a blade blade . It It is much much denser denser than than most most other other materials materials so so it would would make a good club club , but but you you do n't n't get get much much more more head head - bashing bashing advantage with a gold gold cub cub than you would with with stone or even wood wood . So So other other than than as as jewelry and as as decoration , gold gold has has little practical practical \" use use \" to an an ancient human human . But But it is is pretty pretty . Aesthetically Aesthetically gold looks looks \" good \" next next to to human human skin skin tones tones . Why Why this this is so so is is pretty pretty much much a mystery . But But it it 's 's obvious obvious that people people found found gold gold attractive attractive very very very early in human human development development . Who gets gets jewelry jewelry ? Rich Rich people people . In the ancient ancient world world \" rich rich \" was was defined defined as \" do n't n't have have to to farm farm \" . There were only three three kinds kinds of people like like that that : royalty royalty , high priests priests , and successful generals generals . Since Since gold gold was was in in limited limited supply supply - but there there was enough enough of of it it that that people people would would recognize recognize it and and value value it it , and and it was was n't n't good good for for any any practical practical use use , and as as a metal metal it it would would \" stay stay all in in one one place place \" and and did did n't n't have have to be be kept kept in in jars or or otherwise contained contained , it it became became a way way for for rich people people to display display their their wealth wealth . Gold Gold is is pretty easy easy to to purify purify and and to to determine purity purity ( it it 's 's a simple simple weight / volume volume calculation ) . That That means means that that it it could could be be exchanged between people for for like value value - a fixed fixed amount of of gold gold , of of a certain certain purity , was was \" worth worth \" some some number of of sheep sheep or or sheaves sheaves of of wheat wheat , or or slaves slaves , or or land land , or or whatever . It It became became a unit unit of of currency currency due to to intrinsic properties properties convenient for for anyone anyone to to access access - all all I need is a scale scale , a cup cup , some some water water , and and a little little math math and and I can can figure figure out out how much your your gold is is worth worth to to me me . 5,000 5,000 years years of humans humans accepting gold as valuable valuable has has imbued imbued it it with with a certain certain advantage advantage vs. other other similar similar metals metals . Nobody wants wants to to exchange exchange plutonium plutonium coins coins , even though though plutonium plutonium is is worth worth , ounce for ounce ounce , vastly vastly more than gold gold . Gold Gold turns out out to to have have practical practical uses for for modern modern humans humans that that ancient humans humans did did n't know know about - it it 's 's an an extraordinarily extraordinarily good good conductor of of electricity .

Some engines engines are are also also made made with special special materials materials or designs that that make make them more more efficient efficient at at turning turning fuel fuel into into power power . To determine determine the the exact number number of horsepower horsepower for for an an engine engine , engineers engineers use use a machine machine called a dynamometer dynamometer . They They put the the engine engine on on the the dynamometer dynamometer and and run it it at at different speeds to to see see how how much power power it produces produces .

However However , if if I were were standing standing in a room room with with white white walls walls and and showed showed you you the the same same picture picture of a tomato , I might might describe its color color as as \" orange \" because because the the tomato tomato 's 's color color would would appear differently to to me me in the different different lighting lighting . So , while while we we may may both use use the the same same word word to to describe describe a color , we we might might be be perceiving perceiving that that color color differently differently based on on our our own own individual individual experiences experiences and and surroundings .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

( 1 ) Diamonds Diamonds that that are are sold for for anything anything less less than than , oh oh , let let 's 's say $ 5000 5000 at original original retail retail - are are indeed indeed utterly , totally totally , completely worthless worthless . It It is is simply simply \" one of of the the great great scams scams \" . Their real real \" price price \" is is maybe \" five five bucks bucks \" . End End of story story . There is is no no secondary secondary market market . Literally Literally - \" end end of of story story \" . If you you buy a \" diamond diamond \" lol lol for for \" $ 2000 2000 \" to impress impress your your loved one one , you can not not then \" sell sell it it \" for for any amount of money money . It It is : worthless . Once Once again again : simple simple , undeniable undeniable fact fact . the the diamond diamond you you bought bought for for 2 grand grand can not not be resold resold . Ir Ir 's 's worthless worthless . ( OK , maybe maybe you you can can get 100 100 bucks bucks for for it , something something like like that . Or , you you can scam scam someone clueless clueless , and and get 200 bucks bucks . ) ( 2 ) However However actual actual \" investment \" stones stones do do in in fact fact have have a value value - if somewhat fragile fragile . Example , a few years ago I sold sold a stone for 30 30 thousand . That was was a \" real real \" price and and it it was was quite quite liquid liquid - I was was within within days days able to to find find a buyer buyer . ( A dealer dealer - he would would have have then then sold sold it on on for 35 35 or or whatever whatever . ) I have have never dealt dealt in in stones stones over over six six figures , but I 'm 'm fairly fairly certain certain those are \" real real \" valuable objects objects : just just like like paintings paintings by by name name artists artists . ( However However : yes , the the line line between \" laughable laughable diamonds \" and actual investment stones stones , is is indeed moving moving ever upwards . ) ( Note Note - the the \" elephant elephant in the room room \" with diamonds is that that GE 's 's industrial industrial process process for for simply making making utterly flawless flawless diamonds , starting starting with with carbon carbon , is is getting getting better every decade decade . ) ( A second overwheleming overwheleming point point that that nobody nobody has has mentioned mentioned : diamonds diamonds get get beat beat - up up . Regarding Regarding \" engagement engagement ring ring diamonds diamonds \" , a used used one one is is exactly exactly as as useless useless as as a used used car car . It It 's 's crap crap . Just Just as as with $ 200,000 200,000 picassos picassos , this this concept concept does does not apply apply to \" actual investment stones \" . ) Note Note that many many of the the comments / arguments arguments on on this page page are are very very confused confused because : people people are not not distinguishing between between the the ( ROFL ) \" engagement engagement ring ring scam market \" and and the the rarefied rarefied \" investment investment gem gem market market \" . The two things things are are utterly utterly different . Yes Yes , \" engagement engagement ring ring diamonds \" are are an an utter utter scam scam , and and are are simply simply : \" worthless \" . The The fundamental fundamental , basic , overwhelming overwhelming scam scam in in today today 's 's business / social social universe universe is : \" engagement diamonds diamonds \" . Yes Yes , the the price is is only due due to marketing / monopolies monopolies etc . Elephant Elephant in in the the room A : GE GE 's 's technology technology can can - end end of of story story - manufacture manufacture diamonds . ( Starting with with \" pencil leads \" . ) End End of of story story . It It 's 's all over . Elephant Elephant in the the room room B : folks folks forget forget that diamonds diamonds get get beat beat - up , they they are are just like like used cars cars . Regarding Regarding \" engagement engagement - ring ring diamonds \" , nobody nobody has has ever ever , or or will ever ever , bought bought a used used one one . Simple , utterly undeniable undeniable fact fact : regarding regarding \" engagement engagement ring ring diamonds \" . they they have have : zero zero value value . You You can can not not resell resell them . End End of of story story . If If you you buy buy a house house , you can can resell resell it it . If If you you buy buy a car car , you can can resell resell it it ( at at a spectacular spectacular loss ) . If If you you buy buy a picasso picasso , you you can can resell resell it it ( almost almost always making a huge huge profit profit ) . If If you you buy an an \" engagement engagement ring ring diamond \" , it it is is worth worth : nothing nothing . Zero . Nada . strictly strictly regarding regarding investment stones stones , which which is is a distinctly distinctly utterly utterly different market market . This This market market has no no connection connection , in in any any way , at at all all , even even vaguely vaguely , it it is utterly utterly unrelated unrelated , to \" engagement engagement ring diamonds \" . You You can can in in fact fact buy buy and and sell sell these items items - very very much like like say say \" art art \" or or \" mid mid century century antiques \" , and and make make money money . This market market just just has utterly no connection connection to the the whole \" engagement engagement ring ring diamonds diamonds \" scam scam system system . Say you you buy wine wine at the the supermarket , for for 5 to 100 100 bucks a bottle bottle . If If you you think think that that the the \" wine \" thus bought bought , has has a secondary secondary market market , or or you you can invest in in it it or or something something : you you have lost lost your your mind mind . In In total total contrast contrast : Yes Yes , although totally totally flakey flakey , there there is is indeed indeed an an \" investment investment wine wine market market \" which is is real real and and reasonable reasonable . I for for example example have have made made some some money in that that . ( I have a great great anecdote anecdote even even - I had one one cellar of of wine in in burgundy burgundy , which which could have been been sold sold for for , say say , 30 grand grand - but but we we drank drank it it :) :) ) Again Again , the the ( somewhat somewhat bizarre ) actual actual market in in investment investment wine wine , just just has to \" buying buying wine wine in in the supermarket supermarket \" . To further further the the analogy analogy : wine wine prices prices in in the the supermarket supermarket / your your ( ROFL ROFL ) wine wine dealer dealer , from 5 to 100 100 bucks bucks , are are just just : utterly utterly laughable . Utterly . Laughable . Much as as folks folks sit sit around , and decide decide on \" label label designs designs \" , they they sit sit around , and and decide on \" price points \" . There is is , utterly utterly , no no difference difference between between $ 5 and and $ 100 100 grape grape juice juice rofl rofl \" wine \" . The The price price difference difference is simply simply a marketing marketing decision : at best best , you you can can think think of it it as as a Velbin Velbin good good . ... ... exactly exactly the the same same applies applies to \" engagement engagement ring diamonds diamonds \" .", "label": "hc3human"}

Imagine you you have have a set set of of numbers numbers like like this this : 3 , 7 , 9 , 13 13 . The The average average of these these numbers numbers is is 8.5 8.5 . This This means that that if you you added added up up all the the numbers numbers and and divided divided by by the the number number of numbers numbers , you would would get 8.5 8.5 . Now Now , let 's 's say say you you have have another another set set of of numbers numbers : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . The average average of of these these numbers numbers is is 3 .

{"text": "The Heisenberg Heisenberg uncertainty uncertainty principle principle is is a principle in in quantum mechanics mechanics that explains explains the fundamental fundamental limits of our our ability to to know know certain things things about about a particle particle , such as as its its position position and and momentum momentum . It It states states that that the more more precisely precisely we we know know the the position position of of a particle particle , the the less precisely precisely we we can can know know its momentum momentum , and vice versa versa . This This is is because because the the act act of measuring measuring one of of these these quantities quantities affects affects the the other other . Imagine Imagine that that you are trying trying to to measure measure the position and momentum momentum of a ball ball . You You can can use use a ruler ruler to measure the position of of the the ball ball by by seeing where where it it is is on on the the ruler ruler . But But if if you you want want to to measure measure the momentum momentum of of the the ball , you you might might need need to to push push it or or throw throw it it in in order order to to measure measure its its speed speed . However , the the act act of of pushing pushing or throwing throwing the the ball ball will will change change its its momentum momentum , so so you you ca n't n't get an an accurate accurate measurement measurement of of both both the the position position and and momentum momentum of of the the ball ball at at the same time time . This This is similar similar to how how the the Heisenberg Heisenberg uncertainty uncertainty principle principle works works in quantum quantum mechanics mechanics . When When we try to to measure measure the position position of of a particle particle , we have have to to interact interact with with it it in in some some way way , and this this interaction changes changes the the particle particle 's 's momentum momentum . This This means that that we ca ca n't n't know know both both the the position position and and momentum momentum of of the the particle with with complete complete accuracy accuracy at at the the same same time time . We We have to choose choose which which one one we want want to to measure measure more more accurately accurately , and and this means means that that there there will will always always be be some some uncertainty uncertainty in in our our knowledge knowledge of of the the other other quantity quantity .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "In general general , high high interest interest rates lead to to higher higher bond bond yields yields . When When the interest interest rate rate on on new bonds bonds is is higher higher than the the interest interest rate on on existing bonds bonds , investors are are more more likely likely to to sell sell their existing bonds bonds and and buy the the new new ones ones , which pushes down down the the price price of of the the existing existing bonds bonds and and increases their their yield yield . This This is is because because investors investors want want to to receive a higher higher return return on on their their investment investment , and and the the yield on on a bond bond is is directly directly related to to its price price . When When the price of of a bond decreases , its yield yield increases increases , and and vice versa versa . It 's 's important important to note note that that the relationship relationship between between interest interest rates rates and and bond yields yields is is not not always straightforward straightforward , as as other other factors factors can also also influence bond prices prices and and yields yields .

What What , for for example example , is is infinity plus plus 1 ?

{"text": "Not Not exactly exactly ELI5 ELI5 but but I 'll 'll do do my best to to take a stab stab at at it it with with some some pseudo pseudo code code . I ' m coming coming from from a Laravel Laravel / PHP PHP angle angle . Model : Items Items ; Controller Controller : ItemController ItemController ; View View : Shops Shops The view view Shops Shops is is merely a template template for for lack lack of of better better term term . Basically Basically we we have have a page page where where we we are are going to to spit spit out the data for for a record in in our imaginary imaginary inventory inventory . The The page page will have have a $ title , and an array array $ data data . We We will will get get our data data from from the DB DB with with a model model called called Items Items . Think Think of of this as as a class that that handles handles all all interaction interaction with with the the DB DB and and abstracts abstracts the the SQL SQL implementation implementation away away . Our Controller Controller titled titled ItemController ItemController will handle handle all all business business logic . If If $ title = Acme Acme Co. Co. < title title > { { $ title title } } < /title /title > = < title > Acme Acme Co. < /title /title > Now Now we we need need to to bring bring the the item item into into the the view view , right right ? For simplicity simplicity we 'll 'll just just have two two things in our our array $ data . $ data['price data['price ' ] and and $ data['item_name ' ] . price price shall shall be be $ 20.00 and item_name item_name shall shall be RC RC Car Car . Fancy Fancy . So So our our view view is is a very simple simple html page page with with a title title and and a table table . < title title > { { $ title title } } < /title > < table table > < tr tr > < td td > Product Product Name Name < /td /td > < td td > { { $ data['item_name data['item_name ' ] } } < /td /td > < /tr /tr > < tr tr > < td > Price < d > < td td > { { $ data['price data['price ' ] } } < /td /td > < /tr /tr > Now Now we we have the the same thing thing but but parsed : < table table > < tr tr > < td > Product Product Name Name < /td /td > < td td > RC RC Car < /td > < /tr /tr > < tr tr > < td > Price Price < d > < td td > $ 20.00 20.00 < /td /td > < /tr /tr > Now Now imagine imagine if if $ data had several more more indexes indexes . We We have one one view view that we we pass pass this data data to . But But how how do do we we get get the data data ? The The model model , right right ? Well Well , yes and and no no . So So a brief brief bit bit ; tying business business logic logic to to your your view view ( the the pretty pretty ) makes makes for a mess . It It 's like like putting putting everything everything into into a blender blender for for a beverage and and then then not not putting putting the the lid on on . When When it it 's 's done done you you then then swing swing it it around around to to really get get everything everywhere . Now then . The The controller controller handles handles this this pairing pairing . We have have things things called routes routes , so so we we 're going going to to tell the the application(website application(website ) to to point point to the the ItemController ItemController when when the the page is is requested . For For instance , Route::get('item/{id Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show InventoryController@show ) ; So what what does does that that do ? Simple Simple , really really . In In our our InventoryController InventoryController class class we we have a method method called show show . All All we we 're 're doing doing is saying saying when when item item is is requested requested go go here if there there is is a parameter parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC RC car above had had an an i d of 0 . We We 'd 'd go to to : URL_0 URL_0 and and the the example above above would would be rendered rendered . Controller Controller time time ! InventoryController InventoryController extends extends Controller Controller { public function function show($id show($id ) { //Item //Item is is in in our our auto auto load load . This This class is is accessible accessible app app wide wide . $ data = Item::where('id Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Viewing Details Details for for \" . data['item_name data['item_name ' ] ; //View is is in in the the same same boat boat . Auto Auto loaded loaded . return return View::make('itempage.view.php View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that that returns returns the the view view above above , just just like like before before . Now Now though though , we we 're 're going going to to spice spice it it up up ! We We have another another product product . i d = 1 ; item_name item_name = \" RC RC Boat Boat \" ; price price = \" $ 25.00 25.00 \" ; When When we we call call to to URL_1 URL_1 guess guess what what ! Our Our application application automagically fills fills in the the information for for the the item item matching the the i d of of 1 . Fancy Fancy ! Back Back to to the the ELI5 ELI5 attempt attempt : Automatic Automatic coloring books books and and stencils stencils = MVC MVC . ( kind kind of of ) . Code Code Reuse Reuse ( stencils stencils ) is is considered considered , for good good reason reason , to to be be a sign sign of of a capable capable developer developer . We get get to to reuse reuse the the same same files files passing passing in in only only a parameter parameter to to change change the the outcome outcome . When When we first first called called the the page page we we had an an i d of of 0 . The The RC RC Car was was returned returned . Then Then we we simply simply changed changed the the URL URL to to have have a 1 which which returned returned the the RC RC Boat . Same files different different page page . In In a real real world example we we 'd probably probably have have a master master page(coloring page(coloring book book ) that that served as the the main template template for for all all pages pages . This This would would have have our CSS CSS , JS JS , and and other other elements elements all all centrally centrally located . MVC MVC means means you you no no longer longer have have to to update update your pages individually individually to to change change something something like like your your navigation navigation or header header . It It 's all all in in one one spot . It means means no no need need for for nasty nasty database database interaction interaction spattered spattered all all over over your your php php files files . All of of that that is is handled handled in in your your database database object . That That is is a central concept concept . Centralized Centralized code code management management and and maintenance maintenance . I do do n't think I quite quite hit hit the ELI5 ELI5 nail nail on on the the head head , but but I hope hope this this helps anyone that that might might be confused . I know know it took took me me a bit bit to to figure figure out out this this MVC thing thing .", "label": "hc3human"}

While While it it is is certainly certainly possible to to create objects objects that that emit emit light and and can can be be used for for cutting cutting , it it is is not not currently currently possible possible to to create create a lightsaber lightsaber as as it it is is depicted depicted in in the the Star Star Wars Wars movies movies . There There are are several several reasons reasons for for this this . One reason reason is is that the technology technology needed needed to create create a lightsaber lightsaber does does not not yet yet exist exist . In In the the Star Star Wars Wars universe universe , lightsabers lightsabers are are powered by something called called a \" kyber kyber crystal crystal , \" which which is is a special special type of crystal crystal that that is is able able to to store and and release release vast vast amounts amounts of energy energy . We We do not have any materials materials that are are capable capable of of doing this this in in the real real world world . Another Another reason reason is is that even even if if we we were were able able to to create create a lightsaber - like weapon , it it would not not work work the the way way it it does does in in the the movies movies . In In the Star Star Wars Wars universe universe , lightsabers lightsabers are able able to to cut through virtually virtually any any material material with with ease ease . However However , in in the the real world world , no no matter matter how how powerful powerful the the energy energy source source of a lightsaber lightsaber - like like weapon weapon might might be be , it it would still still be limited limited by by the laws laws of physics physics . This This means means that that it it would would not be be able able to cut cut through through all materials with with the the same same ease as as it it does does in in the movies movies . In In short short , while while it it would would be be really really cool cool to to have a real real - life life lightsaber lightsaber , it it is not not currently possible possible due due to a combination combination of technological limitations limitations and and the laws laws of of physics physics .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

This This is is because because the stock stock market market can can be volatile volatile , and and the value value of of your your investments investments can can fluctuate fluctuate significantly over over a short short period period of of time time . If If you you need need to to use use your your emergency emergency fund in a time of of market market turmoil turmoil , you you could end end up up selling selling your your investments investments at a loss . On On the the other other hand hand , high - yield savings accounts accounts and short short - term government bonds bonds tend tend to be be much much more more stable stable , so the the value value of your your money is is less likely likely to to fluctuate fluctuate . That being said said , the potential potential for for higher returns returns is also also a consideration . If If you are comfortable comfortable with with the the risk risk and and have have a long time time horizon until until you need need to to use use your your emergency fund , investing investing in in stocks stocks may may potentially potentially offer offer higher higher returns compared compared to more more conservative conservative options . Ultimately Ultimately , the decision of of where where to keep keep your emergency emergency fund fund will will depend on on your your personal personal risk risk tolerance and and financial financial situation situation .

However However , there there have been been some some regulatory challenges challenges and controversies in in certain states states related to to Tesla Tesla 's 's direct direct - to to - consumer consumer sales model model . Traditionally Traditionally , car car manufacturers manufacturers have have used used a franchise franchise model model for for selling selling their their vehicles vehicles , where where independent independent dealerships dealerships are are granted granted the right right to to sell sell the the manufacturer 's 's vehicles in in a specific specific geographic area area . These These dealerships handle handle all all aspects aspects of of the the sales process process , including including marketing marketing , financing financing , and servicing servicing the the vehicles . Tesla Tesla , on the the other other hand , has has chosen chosen to to bypass bypass the the traditional franchise model model and sell sell its its vehicles vehicles directly directly to to consumers consumers through through its its own own company company - owned owned stores stores and and online online . This direct direct - to to - consumer consumer model model has has caused caused some tension tension with with traditional traditional auto auto dealerships dealerships , which have have sought sought to to protect protect their their own own interests interests and and maintain the the traditional franchise franchise model model .

( Juliet is is n't n't really dead dead . Romeo does does n't know know that that . ) This is typically typically used used to to add add to to the tension tension of a situation situation . Classical irony irony is is the the triumph of wit wit over over hubris hubris . We We do do n't typically associate associate this this with irony irony anymore anymore , but but any sort sort of of parlor scene scene from from a detective detective story story is is a good good example example . Verbal Verbal irony irony is sarcasm sarcasm and is is mostly mostly performative performative in in nature . An An intended intended meaning meaning is is dramatically different different from from an an expressed expressed meaning meaning . This This is is typically typically indicated by tone tone , gesture gesture , and and circumstance circumstance . Paralipsis Paralipsis ( talking talking about about something something by saying saying you you 're not talking talking about about it it ) is is the the easiest easiest method of verbal verbal irony irony to to translate translate from from performance performance to written written word word . Situational or or cosmic cosmic irony irony is is when when the the outcome outcome of of a series series of events events is is different different from from the the expected expected outcome outcome . For For instance instance , in in * The The Wizard Wizard of of Oz Oz * all all three of Dorothy Dorothy 's companions companions are are questing for a character character trait they they felt felt they they lacked lacked and hoped to to receive receive from the the allegedly allegedly god god - like like Oz , who in in fact lacks the the traits traits the the companions companions sought and would be be unable to to grant grant those traits traits even even if if he had had them them himself because because is is revealed revealed to to be a mere mere mortal mortal . Had Had Oz been been a god , he he would still still have have been been unable to to grant grant these these gifts gifts , but but the the situational situational would would have been been elevated elevated to to the cosmic cosmic . Now Now satire satire uses uses these forms forms of of irony irony , a context context of of entertainment entertainment and lightheartedness lightheartedness , and a tendency tendency towards towards absurdity absurdity , to to make make the the serious serious ( Bill Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes attitudes of of British British landlords landlords to to suffering suffering during during the the Potato Potato Famine ) seem seem silly silly .

Maybe Maybe the the background background service service maintains maintains an an open TCP TCP connection to to the the server server , sending sending and and receiving receiving data often enough enough to prevent the the connection connection being being closed closed . ( this this seems seems to to be be the the Google Cloud Messaging Messaging method method ) The The best option option is is for the the remote remote server server to to know know the the IP IP address address of of the the client client , and send send messages messages to to that that address address .

The The issue issue is is that in in most most states states ( with with Maine Maine and and Nebraska Nebraska being being the the exceptions exceptions ) all all the the electoral college votes votes go go to to the the popular vote vote winner . So So for for instance instance , if 51 51 % of of the the people people in in a state state vote vote for for Candidate Candidate A , he he gets gets 100 100 % of of the the electoral electoral college college votes votes from that that state state , rather than than getting getting 51 51 % of the electoral electoral college college votes votes . So So in in that respect respect , your vote vote is is actually actually MORE important important . Because winning winning a state state by by 51 51 % usually gets you MORE than than 51 51 % of the electoral electoral college college votes . The reason reason you you can can win win the the election election while while losing losing the the popular popular vote vote is because because anything MORE MORE than than 51 51 % in in a state state does n't get get you you any closer closer to to victory victory , since since you you already already get get all all those electoral college votes votes . If If you you 're 're wildly popular popular in in a state state and get get 90 90 % of of the the popular vote vote , it it does n't help you you any more more than in if if you you just barely won won . Barely Barely winning winning a bunch bunch of of states states is far far better than than having having massive massive landslide landslide victories victories in in just just a few few states states . So if if I win win massive landslide landslide victories victories in in some states and and just barely barely lose lose in other other states states , I can can end end up up losing losing the the election election despite despite winning winning more more than than 50 50 % of the the popular vote vote .", "label": "hc3human"}

One One financial financial metric metric that that is is often often used used in fundamental analysis is is the the price - to to - earnings earnings - to to - growth growth ( PEG ) ratio ratio . The The PEG PEG ratio ratio is is calculated by by dividing dividing the the price price - to to - earnings ( P / E ) ratio ratio by by the the company company 's 's expected expected earnings earnings growth growth rate rate . The P / E ratio ratio is is a measure measure of of the the price price of of a stock stock relative relative to to its its earnings earnings per share share . It It is is calculated calculated by by dividing the current current market market price price of of the the stock stock by by the company company 's 's earnings per per share share ( EPS EPS ) . The The PEG ratio ratio is is used used to evaluate whether a stock stock is is overvalued overvalued or or undervalued undervalued based based on on its its price price and and earnings earnings growth growth . For For example , if a company company has a P / E ratio ratio of 20 20 and and an an expected expected earnings growth rate of of 10 10 % , its its PEG ratio ratio would be 2 . A PEG PEG ratio ratio of of less than than 1 is is generally generally considered considered undervalued undervalued , while a PEG PEG ratio ratio greater than 1 is considered considered overvalued overvalued . There There are are several several limitations limitations to to using using the PEG PEG ratio ratio as as a sole measure of a stock 's 's value value . It It is based based on on future future earnings earnings growth growth estimates estimates , which which are are inherently inherently uncertain uncertain and subject subject to to change change . Additionally , the PEG ratio ratio does does not not take into into account other other factors factors that can can affect affect a company company 's 's value value , such such as its its debt levels levels , market market conditions conditions , and and competitive competitive landscape landscape . It It is is important important to consider a variety of of factors factors when when evaluating evaluating a stock and and to to use use the the PEG PEG ratio as just just one one tool tool among among many many in in your your analysis .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "The The Coriolis Coriolis effect effect is is a force force that that appears appears to to deflect moving moving objects objects to to the the right right in in the the Northern Northern Hemisphere and and to the the left in the Southern Southern Hemisphere Hemisphere . This This is is due due to the Earth Earth 's 's rotation rotation on on its its axis axis . Imagine Imagine you are are standing standing on on a spinning spinning turntable turntable . If If you you try try to to walk straight straight ahead ahead , you you will will actually end up up walking walking in in a curve curve because the the turntable turntable is is moving moving underneath underneath you . The same same thing happens happens with the the Earth Earth . As As the the Earth Earth spins , it causes causes moving moving objects objects to to appear appear to to curve curve . The direction direction in which which the moving moving object object appears appears to to curve curve depends on which which direction the Earth Earth is is spinning spinning . In In the the Northern Northern Hemisphere Hemisphere , the the Earth Earth is is spinning spinning towards towards the the east east , so so moving objects objects appear to curve curve to to the the right right . In the Southern Southern Hemisphere Hemisphere , the the Earth Earth is spinning towards towards the the west , so so moving objects objects appear appear to to curve curve to the the left left . Does that that make sense ? Do Do you you have have any any more more questions about about the the Coriolis Coriolis effect ?", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "* * WHY WHY THEY THEY EXIST * * In In order order to to protect protect normal people people , the the SEC SEC has has created created all sorts sorts of of rules rules and and regulations regulations for for how how companies that that invest money money on on behalf behalf of of other people people should operate operate . While this this makes the the investments investments safer and and less less volatile volatile , it it prevents the the firm firm making making investments investments from from chasing chasing riskier riskier but possibly possibly more more profitable investments investments . * * WHAT WHAT ARE THEY THEY * * Hedge Hedge funds funds are are companies companies that that make these these investments investments . They They are are not not allowed allowed to to have have more more than 100 100 investors investors , and and they they are are not not allowed allowed to to take take on on any any investors investors with with less less than than $ 5 million million in in wealth . Many Many of their their clients clients are either either very very wealthy wealthy people people or or institutional institutional investors investors , such such as as pension pension funds funds , banks banks , insurance insurance companies , college college endowments , or or sovereign wealth funds . It It 's 's also also very very difficult to to get get into a good good hedge fund , as as not not only only are are they they limited limited by by the the number number of of investors investors they they can take take on on , but but they are are also also rated rated on on the rate rate of return return they they earn earn on assets , and and the more more money you you have have to to invest , the the more more opportunities opportunities you you need to to find find . If someone someone offers offers to to let let you invest in their their hedge fund fund , remember remember the the Groucho Groucho Marx Marx joke joke about about not not wanting wanting to to join join a country country club club that would have him as a member member . * * GOALS GOALS * * So in in short short , hedge hedge funds funds gather large piles piles of money money from from very very wealthy wealthy institutions institutions and and invest it it on on their their behalf behalf . The The goal goal is is to to do do two two things things . The The first first is is to demonstrate alpha . To To explain explain this this concept concept , think think of of it this this way way . If you you hear hear that that the the stock market market went up up by by 10 10 % , and and you you look look at all the the stocks stocks on on the the market market , odds odds are are almost almost all all of of them them went went up up . A rising rising tide tide lifts lifts all boats boats . This is referred referred to to as beta . Most Most assets , or or portfolios portfolios of of assets assets , will will move move in the the direction direction of general general market market . Alpha Alpha is is finding finding assets assets that go go up even even more more than than the the general general market market . Anybody Anybody can just just buy buy into a fund fund through through say say Vanguard , and own own the broad broad market market index index , and get get the the above above mentioned mentioned 10 10 % . People People invest in in hedge hedge funds funds to to earn earn an an amount amount above above and and beyond beyond that that 10 10 % . Alpha Alpha is is supposed supposed to to be be the ability ability to to find find assets that that will do do this this . The The other other goal goal of of hedge hedge funds funds is is to to earn earn absolute absolute returns returns . What What this this means means is is that that they they make money money every every year , regardless regardless of of what what the the stock market market does does . A few funds funds have have done done this this , but but 2008 2008 demonstrated demonstrated that most funds were bluffing bluffing in in saying saying they they were were able able to to do do that , and many many of of them them went went out out of business business . * * HOW HOW DO DO THEY THEY SET SET IT UP UP * * So So based based on on the the above , the the hedge hedge fund fund has a large large pile pile of of money , millions millions or sometimes sometimes even even billions billions of of dollars dollars , invested invested with with it it by by various various clients clients . A hedge fund fund is is normally normally staffed staffed by veterans of the financial services services industry , typically typically people people who who have have worked worked for for a long long time time at at investment investment banks banks and have have contacts contacts within within the the industry industry . After After accumulating accumulating their their investment investment capital , their their frequently turn to to investment investment banks banks , such such as as Goldman Goldman Sachs Sachs , Merrill Merrill Lynch Lynch , or or Morgan Stanley Stanley , or commercial commercial banks banks with with investment investment banking arms arms , such such as as Citigroup or or Bank of America America , to borrow borrow large sums sums of of money money to to leverage this this return return . What What this this means if if that that if you you invest invest $ 100 and make make 10 10 % , you you make make $ 10 10 . But But if if you you borrow borrow $ 900 900 , and and invest invest the the full full $ 1,000 1,000 and and make 10 % , you you make make $ 100 , then then pay pay back back the the bank $ 900 900 ( plus interest interest ) , and and you you made made $ 100 100 ( less less interest interest ) for for your investors investors off off the the $ 100 100 they invested with with you you . ( The The downside downside of of this this is that that if if you you lose lose 10 10 % on on your your $ 1,000 1,000 investment investment , you 're down down to to $ 900 900 , and and your your investors investors are are wiped wiped out out . This This is called called blowing blowing up up in in the the jargon jargon , and and it it happens more more than than you would would think think , so so leverage leverage can can be be * very very dangerous * ) . The The banks banks like like to to lend to to hedge hedge funds funds though though , because because they they like the the interest income income , and they they like like to hear what what leads leads the the hedge hedge funds are are following following ( financial financial services services is is very incestuous incestuous , and and rumors rumors drive drive trades trades ) . The The hedge hedge funds funds like like to to borrow borrow from from the banks banks because , notwithstanding notwithstanding the the need need for for leverage , the the investment investment banks banks have contacts within within the the publicly publicly traded companies companies . Say Say you you 're 're doing doing a bond offering through through Goldman Goldman Sachs Sachs . Maybe Maybe in in the the process process of that that , you you meet meet their their hedge fund fund clients clients , and and talk talk up your your business to to them them to drive drive demand demand for for your stock , while while they hear from from the CFO CFO and and CEO personally , and and make better better decisions decisions than than the the average investor pouring over over financial financial statements statements . * * WHAT WHAT DO THEY THEY INVEST INVEST IN IN * * OK OK , so so now we we have have a bunch bunch of guys guys who who used to to work for investment investment banks banks , with investor investor money money , contacts contacts at investment investment banks banks , and and large large piles piles of of borrowed money money . What What do they they invest invest in in ? The The short short answer answer is is whatever whatever they they want . There are are a number number of of recognized recognized investing investing styles styles though though . 1 ) Long Long short - These are are the most most simple simple funds funds . They They buy some some stocks stocks , and and short short other other stocks stocks . The desire is is to assemble assemble a portfolio portfolio that that will will earn earn both both above above average average and and absolute absolute returns . The The concept of going going long long and and short short , done done to to hedge risks risks , is is how how the industry industry got got its its name name back back in in the 1950s 1950s . 2 ) Global Global Macro Macro - These These funds funds invest invest in in assets assets that that will will give give them them exposure exposure to to broad economic economic forces forces , which which they they hope hope to to predict predict . Do Do you you think the the euro euro is going going to break up up ? Short Short it it , and euro euro - denominated denominated assets assets . Do you you think think we we ' ve ve hit hit peak peak oil oil ? Buy Buy oil oil companies companies , and and oil oil futures futures . George Soros Soros became became famous famous for for making making billions billions for for predicting that that England would be be forced to devalue devalue its its currency in the the 1980s 1980s . 3 ) Directional Directional - These These tend tend to to be be referred to to as as \" black box box funds \" , meaning meaning that that no no one one knows knows what what their their criteria are are , as as it it is is a trade trade secret secret . Often Often they they write write computer computer programs programs designed designed to go through through millions of pages pages of data data , and and analyze all all kinds of data data to to find find mispriced mispriced assets and and go long long or short short on on them them . High High frequency frequency traders do do this this with with stocks stocks by by setting up a computer computer near a stock stock exchange that that can can buy stocks stocks and and sell sell them them again within within nanoseconds nanoseconds . I also also read about about a fund fund that that combs through through publicly publicly available filings filings through through the the Food Food and and Drug Drug Administration Administration , looking looking for for any any changes regarding regarding new new drugs drugs , to to use use as as information information on on pharmaceutical stocks stocks . 4 ) Event Event Driven Driven Funds Funds - As the name suggests suggests , the the buy buy or or sell short short assets whose whose price price will will be affected affected by future future events . Merger Merger arbitrage is a common common form of of this this . When When one one company company acquires another another , usually usually the buyer buyer 's stock goes goes down down , as as they are are probably probably overpaying overpaying , while the the acquired acquired company company 's 's stock stock jumps jumps , as as someone someone is is about to to overpay overpay for for it . Short Short the predator and and buy the the prey prey . In In the movie movie * Wall Wall Street Street * , Charlie Sheen uses uses contacts contacts with with a law law firm firm to find find clients of of the the firm firm who who are are planning planning mergers mergers to to conduct conduct this this sort sort of of strategy , and and is is arrested arrested when when the the feds flip flip one one of his his accomplices accomplices . The The most famous example of of this this strategy strategy is is John John Paulson Paulson , who who made billions billions off off the the housing bubble bubble buying credit credit default swaps on on collateralized collateralized debt obligations obligations ( CDOs CDOs ) . * The The Big Big Short Short * by by Michael Michael Lewis Lewis also also analyzes analyzes funds that took took this this approach . ( I believe believe Paulson Paulson is is now now following following a macro macro strategy strategy , and and has been been buying up up gold gold mines mines , evidence evidence that that funds funds can change change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund Fund of funds funds - This This is is a hedge fund fund that that invests invests its its money money in in other hedge hedge funds funds . By diversifying among among various various funds funds , the hope hope is that that returns returns will will be be less less volatile volatile and and safer safer . If one one fund fund blows up up and and loses loses all all its money money , that that might be be 5 % of of your your investment investment rather rather than than 100 100 % . There There is a pretty pretty long list list of of other other recognized recognized strategies strategies , many too too complicated complicated to to worry worry about about here here . ( For For example , the the Galleon hedge hedge fund , which was was in the the news recently , was was using using contacts in in consulting consulting firms firms and other other places places to to obtain obtain and and trade trade on on inside inside information information . The The founder is now now facing facing 15 15 to to 19 19 years in in prison prison . It It was was an an effective effective strategy , but but one that that obviously obviously had severe consequences . ) But But the point point of of this this is is to indicate that that they can can invest invest in in whatever they they want , and will will be be judged solely solely on on how much money money it it makes makes . * * HOW HOW DO DO THEY THEY GET PAID PAID * * You ' ve ve probably probably already already heard heard about about how many many hedge hedge funds funds make make billions in profits profits . Hedge Hedge funds funds get paid in in two two ways ways . The first first is is the the management management fee fee . If If you you invest invest money money with with a hedge fund fund ( or or anyone for that that matter matter ) , the the first first thing thing they they do do is is take take a percentage percentage of of your money money from from you you and and keep keep it for for themselves . Hedge Hedge funds funds typically typically charge charge 2 % of of assets assets under under management management each each year year . They use use this this money money to pay employees employees , rent rent office space space , and and cover overhead overhead until their their real real payday arrives arrives at at the end end of of the year . The The other other means means of of payment payment is is the performance performance fee fee . At At the the end of of the year year , the the fund fund tallies tallies how much much money it made made for investors investors , and and takes takes a chunk chunk of of it it for themselves themselves . 20 20 % is is typical , but but amounts amounts have varied varied . So if the fund fund makes makes $ 5 billion billion for its its investors , it it is is a $ 1 billion billion payday for the people people who who run run the the fund fund . If If you have have a lot of of money under under management management , and earn high rates rates of return , you you an an become become fantastically fantastically wealthy very very quickly quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

One way she could could apply apply for a loan loan in in her her name name without without her her parents parents is is if if she she is not not currently living with with them she she should should n't n't need need them them to to cosign cosign if she does does n't n't have have bad bad credit credit . But But if if she she is is n't n't living living with with them and and they are n't n't financing financing her her room and and board board they ca ca n't n't claim claim her her as a dependent dependent so so if if she she really really wants wants to to stick it to to them them she she can can go go and and try try to to politely politely explain explain how how the loans work work and and tell tell them them if if they do do n't cosign cosign for for her her then she will will apply apply on her own own ( which which she she can can only only do do while not not living living with them them I believe believe but but not sure sure ) and and they will will HAVE HAVE to STOP STOP claiming claiming her as as a dependent dependent on their their taxes taxes . If If they do do n't n't agree agree she she can put put her her foot foot down down and and force force them them to stop claiming her her and and tell them them she she will will file her her own application application anyway and and if if they they continue continue claiming her her and and get in trouble trouble for for it it it it 's their own own fault fault cause cause she she warned warned them them to to stop stop first first . They They may may agree agree to to cosign cosign rather than than lose lose her her as as a dependent dependent if if it it makes that that big of of a difference difference on on their their taxes taxes , if they they do n't n't then she she can forcefully forcefully punish punish them them financially and and their taxes will will go go up .

{"text": "NASA retired the the Space Space Shuttle program program in 2011 2011 because it it had accomplished its goals and and was was becoming too too expensive expensive to to maintain . The The Space Space Shuttle Shuttle was a reusable reusable spacecraft that that was used for many many different different missions missions , including including transporting transporting astronauts to and and from the the International International Space Space Station Station ( ISS ISS ) . It It was a very advanced and and complex complex vehicle vehicle , but it it also also had had some some limitations limitations . One of of the the reasons reasons NASA NASA decided decided to to use rockets rockets instead instead of a new new upgraded upgraded type of of Space Shuttle Shuttle for for the the Orion Orion spacecraft spacecraft is is that that rockets rockets are are generally generally more more powerful powerful and and can can reach reach higher altitudes altitudes and and faster faster speeds speeds than the the Space Space Shuttle . This This is is important for for deep deep space space missions missions , such such as as going going to to the the Moon Moon or or Mars , because because these these destinations destinations are much much farther farther away from Earth Earth than the the ISS ISS . Another Another reason reason is that the the Space Shuttle required a lot lot of of maintenance maintenance and and preparation preparation between between flights flights , which made it it less less flexible flexible and efficient efficient than rockets rockets . Rockets Rockets can can be be launched launched more more quickly quickly and and can be be used used for a wider wider range of of missions missions . Finally , NASA is is always looking looking for for ways to to improve improve and and advance advance its its technology , and and developing developing a new type type of of Space Space Shuttle would would have been been a very expensive expensive and time time - consuming project . Instead Instead , NASA NASA chose chose to to focus focus on on developing developing new rockets rockets and and spacecraft spacecraft that that are are more suited to to deep space exploration exploration .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Simply Simply put put , they they are are about about the the detachment prevalent prevalent in in modern modern society society . Specifically Specifically the effect effect that that wealth and and privilege privilege can have on on people people . No No one one has has friends friends only only acquaintances acquaintances . People People are are only only as as important important as as what what they they can can do do for for you you . Image is is more important important than than substance substance . For simplicity simplicity I 'll 'll only only deal deal with with what 's in in the the movie movie . In In American American Psycho Psycho the the main main character character is is pretending to to be be a human human . He takes takes everything everything way way too too far because because he is is over over acting acting . From From the the opening you you see see how how obsessed obsessed he he is with with appearance appearance and and the massive massive overkill regarding regarding his his whole whole shower procedure procedure . He is is pretending pretending to to work work . His father owns owns a competing competing firm firm and and it it 's 's alluded alluded that that they have Patrick Patrick as as an an employee employee simply simply because because of of his his fathers fathers name name . He He pretends pretends to to have have a fiance , who who of of course course is is completely completely fake fake too too , otherwise otherwise she she would would n't n't survive survive long long around him him . He He pretends to have have sexuality sexuality . He has has no no clue clue what what it it is is to love someone someone let let alone alone to to even like someone someone . Patrick is is filled filled with rage because he he feels feels cheated cheated . He He can can see see all around around him what what humanity is is supposed to be and and he he just just is is n't n't \" that that \" . He knows knows that that it it 's 's getting getting worse and and worse worse , and and is is afraid afraid that that he will be be caught . He He is is n't afraid of of going going to to jail jail or or dying , but but rather he he is afraid afraid of of being being exposed exposed as as a fake fake person person , as a \" phoney phoney \" . To To answer your your specific specific question question regarding the scene scene where where he calls calls his lawyer . He He thinks thinks he he 's 's about to to be caught caught , so so he he calls calls his lawyer and admits admits everything everything he he can can think think of of . The The lawyer lawyer thinks the the caller is is someone other other than than Patrick Patrick playing a joke . He He never never takes takes it it seriously seriously because because to to him him Patrick Patrick is is just just some bland bland rich rich guy guy who who looks looks and and acts acts just just like like 10,000 10,000 other bland bland rich rich guys guys . Later Later when when Patrick sees sees the the lawyer lawyer at at a party he he begins begins to freak freak out out . When When he he asks asks the the lawyer lawyer about about it it the the lawyer lawyer , not realizing he he is is talking TO Patrick Patrick , laughs about about the the ridiculousness ridiculousness of of it . Because Because Patrick is so normal normal . Both Both of these types of of things are are common common themes in the the movie movie and and book book . People constantly constantly remark how how normal normal Patrick is , people people constantly constantly mistake mistake him him and and others others for someone else . They They all all look look and and act act alike alike . In In my my opinion the the movie movie is about about how how easy easy it it is for a passionless sociopath sociopath killer killer to to blend blend into into society society because because of of how how uncaring uncaring and superficial we we all all are are . If you you likes likes the the movie movie of of course read read the the book book . If If books are n't n't your your thing thing then at at least least watch Less Than Zero and maybe maybe The The Rules Rules Of Of Attraction Attraction .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The The balance balance sheet is a deceptively deceptively easy easy item in in accounting accounting . What What it tells tells you you is is three three things : 1 ) How big big of of a pile pile of of stuff stuff do do I own own ? 2 ) How much money money did did I borrow borrow to to buy buy my my big pile pile of of stuff stuff that that I still still have have to to pay pay back ? 3 ) If If I removed removed everything everything from my my pile pile of of stuff stuff that that I still owe owe money money on , how how much much is is left left ? This smaller smaller pile of of stuff that that you have have paid paid in in full full for and that that you do do n't n't owe another cent on is is your \" equity equity \" . It It can be be broken down down to to the the classic classic accounting accounting equation equation of of : ASSETS ASSETS ( Total Pile Pile of of Stuff Stuff ) = Liabilities Liabilities ( Stuff Stuff in in your your pile pile that the the bank bank can can take back because because you you have have n't paid for for it it yet yet ) + Equity Equity ( Stuff Stuff in in the the pile pile that is is paid for for and and yours forever forever ) Or Or , in terms terms of a home home , if I take out out a mortgage mortgage and and buy buy a $ 200,000 200,000 house house , and promptly promptly pay $ 100,000 100,000 as a down down payment payment , I own own half half of a house house . That That is is my my equity . The bank owns owns the the other $ 100,000 of of the the house house , and that is is my my liability . Again Again , the equation equation tells tells us : Total Assets Assets ( The The Whole Whole House House , 200k 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank Bank 's 's half half of of the the house house 100k 100k ) + Equity Equity ( my my half of of the the house house that that I plunked down down 100k for for ) . To answer answer the the question about what what equity equity is in finance finance , this this is is how how is is it important important : Let Let us us say say that that I owned owned an an entrepreneurial entrepreneurial cat cat . The cat decides decides to to get get into into the the business business of of rat rat control control . I take take the the cat cat to to the the bank bank , and and the the bank lends lends the the cat cat $ 995,000 995,000 as a business business loan loan under under the the agreement agreement that that the the bank bank can can repossesses repossesses everything everything if if the loan is is n't n't paid paid back with with interest interest . The The cat takes the bank bank 's 's 995k 995k and and I throw throw in in 5k 5k of my my own own money money that that the cat never never has has to to pay me me back for for , and and he he buys buys 1 million dollars dollars worth worth of of rat rat control control equipment equipment . Now Now if if I went went on Craigslist Craigslist and and offered offered to to sell sell the the cat cat and and his his 1 million million dollars worth of of rat control supplies to to the the highest bidder bidder , my my cat cat might might sell for close close to to 1 million million dollars dollars . However However , once once the potential buyer buyer found found out out that that the the 1 million million dollar dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to to the the bank bank still , the the potential buyer buyer would would realize realize the the EQUITY EQUITY in in the the cat cat is is only only $ 5,000 , and and would n't n't pay much much more more than than that that . Now Now that that begs begs the the question question , why would would I give give the feline feline $ 5,000 5,000 that that he he did did n't n't have have to to pay pay me me back back for ? This This relates relates to the the second second use use of of the the phrase phrase equity equity in in finance finance , which which is is ownership . I gave gave the the cat cat $ 5,000 5,000 to to become become a partner partner in his his business business . Think Think of of this this as \" seed seed money money \" that the the cat cat can can spend spend on on things things that will will make his his business business better better , and and that that he does does n't n't have have to to worry worry about about paying paying me me interest interest on on or ever ever repaying repaying directly . Instead Instead , he he gives gives me me 100 100 shares shares of Rat Rat Cat Cat Stock Stock of of a total total 200 shares outstanding outstanding . He He owns owns the the other other 100 100 , which he he assigned assigned to to himself when when incorporating incorporating his his business business . What What 's 's in in it for for me ? As owner of of 50 % of of the the EQUITY EQUITY in in the the company company ( I own 100 100 of of 200 200 total total shares shares ) , I am am entitled entitled to half half of of the the profits profits ! Now Now if the the cat is is very successful successful and and makes makes $ 200,000 200,000 in in profits profits each each year year after after paying paying interest on on his his loan loan to the the bank , that that is is great great for me me ! Going back back to to our our general general accounting equation equation : Assets Assets $ 1.2 1.2 Million Million Dollars ( 1 Million Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit profit ) = Liabilities Liabilities ( 1 Million Million Principle Principle Still Owed Owed to to the the Bank Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money money that that belongs belongs outright outright to to me me and and the the cat cat ! ) . The The amount amount of of money money we we borrowed borrowed from from the the bank bank does does n't n't change change . We We still still have have 1 million million dollars dollars worth of equipment equipment that that could could be be liquidated liquidated and sold sold to to pay pay back back the the bank bank , so so that that 200k 200k is is pure pure profit profit for for us us ( me me and my my cat cat ) as as business business owners owners . Now Now this this $ 200,000 200,000 can either either be be paid paid to to use use in in the the form form of of dividends dividends , or or reinvested reinvested in in new new equipment and and services services that that can can help help the the business grow grow .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Sure Sure ! The The circle constant constant is is a number number that that helps helps us us understand and and measure measure circles circles . The The most common common circle circle constant constant is pi pi , which which is is represented by by the the Greek Greek letter letter \u03c0 . Pi Pi is is a number number that that is is a little bit more more than than 3 , and and it is is important important because because it it helps helps us us understand understand the the relationship relationship between between the circumference ( the the distance distance around around the the circle circle ) and and the the diameter ( the distance distance across across the the circle circle through the the center ) . The The Tau Tau Manifesto is is a document document that that suggests suggests that that we should should use use a different circle circle constant constant called tau , which is is represented represented by by the the Greek Greek letter letter \u03c4 . Tau Tau is equal equal to to 2\u03c0 2\u03c0 , or or about about 6.28 6.28 . The The idea idea behind behind the the Tau Tau Manifesto Manifesto is is that that tau tau is is a more natural and and intuitive intuitive circle circle constant constant to to use use , especially especially when it it comes to understanding understanding radians radians . Radians Radians are a way way of of measuring measuring angles . If you you think of of a circle circle as a clock clock , with with the the 12 o'clock o'clock position at at the the top top , then then one one radian radian is is equal to 1/6 of of the way way around around the circle . Using Using tau tau as as the the circle circle constant constant makes it it easier easier to to understand understand radians radians , because because one one radian radian is is equal to 1/3 1/3 of of tau , rather rather than than 1/2 1/2 of of pi pi . This This makes makes it it easier easier to see that that radians radians are a measure measure of of how far far around around the the circle an angle angle is is , rather rather than how how wide the angle angle is . So So , in in summary , both pi pi and and tau tau are are important numbers numbers that help help us us understand and measure measure circles circles , but some some people people believe believe that that tau tau is is a better circle circle constant constant to to use use because it it makes makes it it easier easier to understand understand radians radians .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Finally Finally , it it 's 's important important to remember remember that sellers sellers on on eBay eBay are are free free to to set set their their own own prices prices and and shipping shipping policies policies , so so it it 's possible possible that that a seller may may choose to to offer offer an an item item for for a low price price and and include include the cost cost of of shipping shipping in in that that price , even even if it means means that that they they are are not making making a large large profit profit on on the sale sale .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "But But what what if I am getting getting paid paid salary salary from from a source source in India India ? In In other words words , it may be be that that in India India a research assistant assistant at at a college college on on average average earns a third third of of what what a research assistant assistant like like me me earns earns here here in US US . In In that that case case , even if if my cost cost of of living living there there is is much less less , so so is is my my salary salary . There There are are sites sites that that provide provide a good good guidance guidance for for what what the the average average salary salary for for an an profession profession with with x years of of experience experience would be be . Of Of course course some some would would get paid paid more more than than average average . So So you you can can try try and and make make a logic logic , if if in US US say say you you are being paid paid more than than average , you you would would be paid paid more more than than average average elsewhere elsewhere . Plus Plus If If moving moving from from Developed Developed to to Developing Developing country country , one has has the the Advantage Advantage of of positive positive pedigree pedigree bias . There There are are also also websites websites that that would would give give the the Purchasing Power Power Parity for for quite a few few currency currency pairs . The The Real Real difficulty difficulty to to find is is whether whether the the Lifestyle Lifestyle you you have have in in a specific specific country would would be be similar similar in in other country country . If you you compare compare like like for like like it it becomes becomes slightly skewed skewed . If If you you compare equivalence equivalence , then can you you adjust adjust . A relevant example my my friend friend in in US US had had a Independent Independent Bungalow Bungalow in in US . It It was was with Basement Basement and and attic attic , 2 levels levels of living living space space with with 4 bedroom bedroom . He shifted to to India India and and got got a great great salary compared compared to to normal normal Indian Indian salary salary . However this this kind of house house in in India India in in Bangalore Bangalore would would be affordable only only to CEO CEO 's 's of of top top companies companies . So So is is living living in a 3 room room apartment apartment fine fine ? There There are are multiple such such aspects aspects . Drinking Drinking a Starbucks coffee coffee couple couple of of times a day is routine for quite a few in in US US . In In India India this this would would be be considered considered luxury luxury . A like for for equivalent equivalent comparison is is \" One One drinks drinks 3 - 4 mugs of of Coffee Coffee \" in in US US , and and average average Indian Indian drinks drinks \" Tea Tea / Coffee 3 - 4 mugs mugs \" . In In India the the local local Tea Tea / Coffee Coffee would would be be Rs 10 10 - Rs 20 20 . A Starbucks Starbucks would come come with with starting starting price price of Rs Rs 150 . The The same same applies to food . A McBurger McBurger in India would be be around around Rs Rs 100 . The Indian Indian equivalent equivalent Wada Wada Pav Pav is is for for Rs Rs 10 10 . A Sub Way Way would would be Rs 150 150 . A Equivalent Equivalent Mumbai Mumbai Sandwich Sandwich around around Rs Rs 25 25 . I personally personally am am picky picky about about food food , so so it it does n't n't matter matter where where I go go , I can only only eat specific things , which means I spend spend a huge huge amount amount of money money if if I am outside outside of of India India . When When I was in US , I could could n't n't afford afford a maid , driver driver or or any any help help . In In India India I have 2 maids maids , a cooking cooking maid maid and and a driver . Plus Plus I get get plumber plumber , electrician , window cleaner cleaner , and and all the the help help without without costing me me much much . Things Things that that I absolutely absolutely ca ca n't n't dream in US US . My My colleague colleague in in UK UK preferred to to stay stay in a specific specific locality locality as as it has has a very good good Church Church . So So if if its its important important , one one may find few few good good ones ones in in India India if if one one is is Roman Roman Catholic Catholic , if if one follows follows Lutheran Lutheran , Greek Greek Orthodox , tough tough luck luck . Citizenship Citizenship : Does Does it matter matter ... ... A foreign foreign national national may never never get get an Indian Indian citizenship citizenship . Children Children do do n't n't qualify qualify either either unless both both parents parents are are Indian . Health Care : Again is is quite quite different different . One One may may feel feel Health Health care care in in US US is not not good good or very very expensive expensive ... ... but but there there are multiple multiple aspects aspects of of this this . So in in essence essence its its very very broad there there is traffic , cleanliness cleanliness , climate climate , culture culture , etc ... PS PS : A research research assistant assistant in in India is is poorly poorly paid paid , because because colleges colleges do do n't n't have have funds funds . Research Research in in fundamental fundamental science science is is quite low low . Industry Industry to to university university linkages linkages are are primitive primitive and and now where where close to to what what we we have in in US US .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Have skimmed skimmed it it , these these are the the most most important important parts parts as as I can can tell tell : The new new temperature goal goal is is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For For anybody anybody uninformed uninformed on on what what that that means means , 1.5 1.5 us us the the limit limit the the average global temperature temperature will will have risen since since pre - industrial industrial times . This This is friggin huge huge and I ' m super super excited excited because the the previous previous goal goal of of 2 was was n't n't all all that great great . So So basically basically there there 's 's limits on the the global global temperature temperature rise rise ( which which I 'll 'll call call GTR from from now cause cause I ' m lazy ) . The The GTC GTC 's 's basepoint is whatever the the GTR was before before the the industrial revolution . The The last last goal for for the GTR was was a 2 \u00b0 C rise rise in in temperature temperature , which before before was was considered okay okay at at best best ( this this goal goal was was reached reached in the the 90 90 's 's I believe believe ) . Since Since then then new science science and and research research has has come come out out that that tells us us that that 2 \u00b0 C could could be be bad bad . There There 's also another another thing thing you you should should know which is is feedback feedback loops loops : Under Under the arctic arctic lies lies huge huge amounts amounts of of trapped methane . If If the the temperature temperature becomes becomes too too high the the ice that traps the the methane methane gas gas melts melts and and the methane methane enters enters the atmosphere atmosphere . Methane Methane is is a greenhouse greenhouse gas gas and and is one one of the the stronger greenhouse greenhouse gases gases . When When it gets into into the the atmosphere atmosphere it it reinforces reinforces global global warming warming and and the the greenhouse greenhouse effect further further melting melting ice ice and further further releasing releasing methane methane until it it kills all all life life on on earth because because of huge amounts amounts of of heat heat . There There 's 's also also another important important feedback feedback loop , that that of of ice and and in in particular particular sea sea ice : Ocean Ocean is dark and and absorbes heat heat . Ice is white white and and reflects reflects it it . As As long long as as ice , particularly particularly sea sea ice ice , melts melts , more more sun and and heat reflecting reflecting matter goes goes away away the the the things things beneath beneath the the ice ice tend tend to to absorbes absorbes that that heat heat and and sun sun and and make make everything everything hotter hotter . The The hotter it becomes becomes the the more more ice ice is melted melted and and the more more Ocean Ocean there there is to to absorb absorb heat which which further further melts melts ice ice ad ad infinitum infinitum until until we we all die die . Now back back to to the the GTR GTR goal goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays nowadays is generally generally considered considered seriously seriously pushing pushing it it for for these feedback loops loops . 3 is is almost gaurunteed gaurunteed collapse collapse of of civilization civilization . At At the the current current rate rate we 're doing doing things things were were pushing pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is is pretty much much death . If If we we can can limit the GTR to 1.5 1.5 \u00b0 C we are are n't n't in in the the clear clear but but we we have have a very very good chance chance of of living living life life comfortably comfortably on on earth earth , with with nearly nearly all of of the the same luxuries luxuries we we have today albeit operated operated differently differently . Before Before this this agreement agreement the goal goal was was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed changed it it to to 1.5 \u00b0 C which which is is a huge huge and and a really really big difference difference . Aside Aside from from that one one of of the the big big concerns concerns is that that developed developed countries countries have have created created climate change change and and gotten gotten rich off off it and and now now poor nations such such as Pacific Pacific island nations nations and and countries countries like Bangladesh Bangladesh now have have to to suffer suffer because because of of the the west west 's 's mistakes . The The agreement says says basically basically that that developed developed nations nations have to help help out out financially to to developing developing nations with with protection protection against against rising sea sea levels levels and and other other things and and to to help them them convert convert their their infrastructures to to green green energy while while also also helping helping them them develop develop their economies and and humanitarian humanitarian situations situations . It It also also sets sets a goal for for developed developed nations nations to try and cut cut all all greenhouse greenhouse emissions emissions they they emit . Lastly Lastly they they will will take take stock stock of emissions emissions and temperature temperature rises rises and and environmental environmental impacts impacts of of climate climate change change in in 2023 2023 and and every every five five years years after after that that . Also nations have have to to set set goals goals for themselves themselves every every 5 years years based on on what what they can accomplish accomplish and and what what they they have have accomplished accomplished . One One worrying worrying part part is the fact fact that that nations nations can can back back out out 3 years years after after they signed the agreement without without repercussions repercussions . I ' m also not not sure sure how how legally legally binding binding any any of of this is is or if if it it even even is is . It It would would be be awesome awesome if if it was was but I ' m not sure sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the 90 90 's 's , the the generation that grew grew up up on on these these ideals ideals had kids kids and and wanted wanted them all all to to go to to college college . All All of them them .

Sometimes Sometimes this this was justified justified : they they had many many more students students so so they they needed needed more dorms dorms , more more food food , more more teachers . But But ultimately ultimately , college college prices prices went out out of of control . The The parents parents still still wanted wanted to to send send their their kids kids to to college college ( thinking thinking it was was how how they they 'd 'd get get a good good job job still ) and and decided decided to to take take out out loans loans to pay pay for for their school . BUT BUT these these loans loans were were taken out out on on behalf behalf of the the kids kids so the the loans were were in in their their kid kid 's 's names names ( in in most most cases cases anyway anyway ) .

In In the past , they they 'd have have many many applicants applicants but but one one or or two two would would be be college college educated . Now ... everyone everyone had one .

There There * are are * plenty plenty of of degrees degrees that that are are still useful useful and and that that you needed needed in your your field field ( medical , legal , financial , computer computer science science ) , but a lot of of kids kids ( myself myself included ) were were told told that that they they 'd 'd be fine fine no no matter matter what what degree degree they they got . And And many were were misguided by by the the college college system system ( who who wanted money money more more than than for for their their student student 's 's to to be be well well - prepared prepared for the the ever ever - changing job job market ) .

Other Other times times as as soon as as the the news is is released released the the price price will will gap gap up up or down down in in response response to the the news news . Some Some times times when when you you think think that that the the news news is is good good , like like new new record profits profits have have been achieved achieved , but but the the share price price goes goes down down instead of of up up . This This may be be due to the the expectation of the record record profits by by analysts analysts to be 20 20 % more than last year , but but the the company company only achieves achieves 10 % more more than than last year year . So So the news news is is actually actually seen as as bad bad because because , even even though though record profits , it it has has n't n't met met expectations . The The same same can can happen in the other direction direction , a company may may make make a loss and and the share share price goes goes up up . This may be because it it was expected expected to to make make a 50 50 % loss loss but only only made a 20 20 % loss loss due due to to cost cost cutting cutting , so so this this is is seen seen as as a good good thing thing and and the the price price can can shoot up up , especially especially if if it it had been beaten beaten down down for for months months . An An other example example is is when the the Federal Federal Reserve Reserve in in the the USA USA put put up interest interest rates earlier earlier this this month month .

It It is generally generally a good good idea idea for both both partners partners to to seek seek legal legal advice advice before before entering entering into a co co - ownership or co co - borrowing borrowing arrangement for for a home home . A lawyer lawyer can can help to ensure ensure that that the the couple couple 's rights and and interests are are protected and and that that any any agreements agreements are are clearly clearly documented documented and and understood understood by by both both parties .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

All of these these transactions transactions are are passed passed around around the the peer network network , and each each peer peer will check check it it for validity validity by by running running various various cryptographic cryptographic tests tests . If If all all the tests pass pass , the the peer peer will will agree agree that that the transaction transaction is is valid valid . The The more peers peers validate validate the the transaction transaction , the the more certain you can can be be that the transaction is is valid valid ( generally generally 6 - 10 10 validations validations are are enough enough for a transaction transaction to to be \" valid valid \" enough enough for for most most people people . ) * * Mining Mining for Bitcoins * * Bitcoin Bitcoin mining mining involves involves testing testing millions and millions millions of of random random strings strings of the the proper proper specification specification in order order to to find find the the strings strings that that ' pass pass ' the the algorithmic algorithmic test test to to be be a Bitcoin Bitcoin block block .

So basically basically you you do do n't n't think think , although although thoughts may may still still go go through through your your head head . Of Of course course there there are different different approaches approaches , sometimes sometimes you focus focus immensely immensely on something something ( often often the breath breath ) which which will will use use up up all focus focus and and therefore reduce reduce thoughts thoughts , or you you try try to not not - focus focus , where where you feel and and observe everything everything in in and and around around you .

In In the the beginning you just sit sit there there and afterwards afterwards you you might be disappointed because because you you ' ve ve expected expected more more of it it .

Why Why does does a C on a guitar guitar sound sound differently differently than than a C on on a piano piano or or a flute flute ? It It 's 's because next next to the the C played played there there are are a whole whole crap crap of other notes notes present present in in the sound created created , and and that notes notes are are what what make make the the unique unique sound .

Also Also , speech speech production areas areas of of the brain brain are are activated activated when when people speak internally internally .

This This means means that that a corporation corporation can enter enter into into contracts contracts , own property property , and be be sued in in its its own own name , just like like an an individual individual person person . However However , some some people people argue argue that that corporations corporations should should not have the same legal legal rights as individuals because because they they are are not living living beings beings and and do not not have have the the same same moral moral or or ethical ethical responsibilities . They They believe that that corporations should should be more more strictly strictly regulated regulated and and held held accountable for for their their actions actions , and that they they should should not not be be able able to use use their financial financial resources to influence influence political political decisions or or shape shape public public policy in in ways ways that that may may not not be be in in the the best best interests interests of of society society as as a whole whole .

Position Position and and momentum momentum literally literally are are not not defined defined precisely precisely in in the universe . Next Next consider consider that that certain quantum quantum principles principles are inherently inherently random . Before Before you you measure measure the the state of of a particle particle , it it 's 's impossible impossible to predict predict whether whether it it will will be spin up up or or spin spin down . The The presence of of such such randomness randomness also also messes with with the the idea idea of of a mechanical mechanical universe . Even Even if if the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and and randomness randomness were eliminated eliminated , you you would would never never be able able to to make perfect perfect predictions predictions within within our our universe universe .

An i3 is is the the slowest slowest , then then an an i5 , and and i7 i7 is is the the fastest fastest . However However , within within the the ' i ' series series , there there are are now 4 ' generations ' of of processors processors .. .. each year year , Intel Intel refreshes refreshes their their processor processor lineup lineup with new new versions versions of of the the processors processors , so so a 4th 4th - generation generation i5 i5 will will be faster faster than than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and and usually usually newer processors processors are more more efficient efficient , using using less less electricity electricity and running running cooler , as well well ) . You can can tell tell which which generation a Core Core - i processor processor is is from from by by the number after after it it - 4xxx 4xxx is 4th 4th - gen gen , 3xxx 3xxx is is 3rd 3rd - gen gen , etc etc .

This This would save save some space , because because the the code \" t10 t10 \" is is shorter than than the word \" the \" repeated 10 times times . Once Lepton Lepton has compressed compressed the the middle middle of the the list list , it it would then then work work its its way way outwards outwards , looking looking for for more more opportunities opportunities to compress compress the the data data .

This This would would make make the the overall power consumption of of the the computer system much much higher higher , which would would lead lead to to shorter shorter battery battery life life and and higher higher energy energy bills.\\n\\nSpeed : Although having having a large amount amount of of RAM RAM would would certainly certainly make make a computer computer faster faster in some some ways , it it would would not not necessarily make make it it faster faster overall . This This is is because because the the speed speed of a computer computer is is determined determined by a combination combination of factors factors , including including the processor processor speed , the speed speed of of the storage storage ( such such as as an SSD SSD ) , and and the the speed of of the RAM RAM . So So while while adding adding more more RAM RAM might might help help in some some cases cases , it it 's 's not not a magic magic solution solution that that will will make make a computer faster faster in in all all cases.\\n\\nOverall cases.\\n\\nOverall , while while it it would certainly certainly be be nice nice to to have have a 1 TB TB RAM RAM module , the the current current limitations of of size size , cost cost , power power , and speed speed make make it it not not practical practical at at this this time .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

You You 're 're somewhat somewhat correct in in assuming assuming that that what you you 're 're reading reading is is usually usually some some kind kind of of marketing marketing material . Systematic Systematic Investment Investment Plan Plan ( SIP SIP ) is is not not a universal piece piece of of jargon jargon in the the financial financial world . Dollar Dollar cost averaging is is a pretty pretty universal piece piece of jargon jargon in in the the financial financial world world and and is is a common topic topic taught taught in in finance finance classes classes in in the the US US . On average , verified verified by by many many studies studies , individuals will will generate generate better better investment investment returns returns when they they proactively avoid avoid timing the the market market or or attempting attempting to pick pick specific specific winners . Say Say you you decide decide to to invest in in a mutual fund fund , dollar cost cost averaging averaging means means you you invest the the same same dollar dollar amount in in consistent consistent intervals intervals rather rather than than buying buying a number of of shares shares or buying buying sporadically when when you feel feel the the market market is is low low . As As an an example example I 'll 'll compare compare investing $ 50 50 per per week on on Wednesdays Wednesdays , versus versus 1 share per week week on on Wednesdays Wednesdays , or or the the full full $ 850 850 on on the the first first Wednesday . I 'll use use the Vanguard Vanguard Large Large cap cap fund fund as an example ( VLCAX VLCAX ) . I realize this is not not really really an an apples apples to to apples apples comparison as as the the invested invested amounts amounts are are different , I just wanted wanted to show show how how your your rate of of return return can can change change depending depending on on how how your your money money goes goes in in to to the the market market even even if the the difference difference is subtle subtle . By By investing investing a common common dollar dollar amount amount rather rather than than a common common share amount amount you ultimately ultimately maintain maintain a lower lower average average share share price price while while the the share share price price climbs climbs . It It also also keeps keeps your your investment investment easy easy to to budget budget . Vanguard published an an excellent paper paper discussing discussing dollar dollar cost averaging averaging versus versus lump lump sum investing investing which which concluded concluded that that you you should should invest as as soon as as you you have have funds , rather rather than parsing parsing out out a lump sum sum in in to to smaller smaller periodic periodic investments investments , which which is is illustrated in in the the third third column above ; and obviously obviously worked worked out out well well as as the the market has been been increasing increasing . Ultimately Ultimately , all all of of these these companies are vying to to customers so so they they all have marketing marketing teams teams trying trying to to figure figure out out how how to to make make their their services services sound sound interesting interesting and and unique unique . If If they they all all called called dollar dollar cost cost averaging averaging , \" dollar dollar cost cost averaging averaging \" none none of them them would appear appear to to be be unique unique .

As you you can can see , each each time time you you increase increase the power power by 1 , you you multiply multiply by by A again again . In other other words words : A^n+1 A^n+1 = A^n A^n * A. A. divide divide both sides sides by by A & you you get get A^n = A^n+1 A^n+1 / A. A. If If you you let n=0 n=0 , you you get get A^0 A^0 = A^0 + 1 / A , which which is is A^0 A^0 = A^1 A^1 / A , which is is A^0 = A / A , which which is is A^0 A^0 = 1 . So So therefore therefore , A^0 A^0 = 1 . * * * * * Edit Edit : Bonus Bonus round round for for negative powers powers , if you you 're 're interested interested . Now Now that that we we know know A^0 A^0 = 1 we can can do do this this : Using Using A^n A^n = A^n+1 A^n+1 / A again again . let let n=-1 n=-1 . A^-1 A^-1 = A^-1 A^-1 + 1 / A , which which is is A^-1 A^-1 = A^0 / A , which which is is A^-1 A^-1 = 1 / A. let n=-2 n=-2 . A^-2 A^-2 = A^-2 + 1 / A , which which is is A^-2 A^-2 = A^-1 A^-1 / A , which which is is A^-2 A^-2 = ( 1 / A ) / A , which which is is A^-2 A^-2 = 1 / A^2 This This can can be be generalised to to A^-n A^-n = 1 / A^n A^n .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A ranked voting voting system system is is a way of of casting casting and and counting votes votes in an an election election where where voters voters are are able able to to rank rank the the candidates in in order order of preference preference . Instead of of just just choosing choosing one one candidate candidate , voters can can indicate indicate their their top top choice choice , second second choice choice , third third choice choice , and so so on . In In a ranked ranked voting voting system system , if if a candidate candidate wins wins a majority majority of of first first - choice choice votes votes , they they are declared declared the the winner winner just just like like in in a normal normal election election . If If no no candidate candidate wins wins a majority majority of of first first - choice votes votes , then then the the candidate with with the the fewest fewest votes votes is is eliminated and their votes are are redistributed to the the voters ' next next choice . This This process process is is repeated repeated until until one candidate has has a majority majority of of votes votes and and is is declared the the winner winner . One advantage of of ranked ranked voting voting is that it it can can help ensure ensure that that the winner winner of of an election election has has the the support support of a majority majority of of voters voters , rather rather than than just just a plurality plurality of of voters voters . In In a normal normal election election , it it is possible for for a candidate candidate to win with less than than 50 50 % of of the the vote vote if if there there are are more than than two candidates candidates running running . In a ranked ranked voting voting system , this this is less less likely likely to to happen happen because the the votes votes of the least popular popular candidate candidate can can be be redistributed to the the voters voters ' next next choice choice . As As for for how how a ranked ranked voting system could help help eliminate the the two two - party system system , it 's 's important important to to note note that that ranked voting voting is is just just one one of of many potential potential reforms reforms that could could help help encourage encourage more more political diversity . However However , ranked ranked voting voting could could potentially help by by making making it it easier easier for for third - party party candidates candidates or or independent independent candidates candidates to to win win elections elections . Since Since voters voters are are able able to to rank rank multiple candidates candidates in in order order of preference preference , they they can can choose choose to to support a third third - party party candidate candidate as as their their first first choice while still expressing expressing a preference preference for for one one of the the major major party candidates candidates as as their their second choice . This could could make it it more more likely likely that that a third third - party party candidate could win an an election election , or or at at least have have a stronger stronger influence on on the the outcome outcome .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

When When an an object moves very fast fast , it it is is harder harder for for gravity gravity to pull pull it it down down , so so it it follows follows a curved curved path path instead of of falling falling straight straight down down . To To stay in in orbit , the the ISS ISS has has to to keep keep moving moving at at a specific specific speed speed and and altitude altitude . If If it slows slows down down or drops drops too too low , it will fall fall back back to to Earth Earth .

{"text": "Pluto Pluto was was originally originally classified classified as a planet planet when it it was discovered in in 1930 1930 because because it it was thought thought to to be similar to the the other other planets planets in in our our solar solar system system in in size size and and composition composition . However However , as as we learned learned more more about Pluto Pluto and and discovered discovered more objects objects in in the the outer reaches of of our solar solar system system , scientists scientists realized realized that that Pluto Pluto is actually actually quite quite different different from from the the other other planets planets . One of the main main reasons reasons Pluto was was reclassified reclassified as as a dwarf planet planet is is because because it it is is much much smaller smaller than than the other other planets planets in in our our solar solar system system . While While planets planets like like Earth Earth and and Mars are are thousands of kilometers kilometers in in diameter diameter , Pluto Pluto is is only about about 2,377 2,377 kilometers kilometers ( 1,475 1,475 miles miles ) across across . In In addition addition to to its its small size size , Pluto also also has has a very very different orbit orbit around around the the Sun Sun compared compared to to the the other planets planets . While the other other planets planets have have relatively relatively circular circular orbits , Pluto Pluto 's 's orbit orbit is much more more elongated elongated and and tilted tilted . This This means means that that Pluto Pluto is often often much much farther farther from from the the Sun Sun than than the the other planets planets , and and it it takes a much much longer time time to to orbit orbit the the Sun than the the other other planets planets do . Because Because of of its its small small size size and and unique orbit orbit , scientists decided to reclassify Pluto as as a dwarf dwarf planet planet in in 2006 . This This means means that that it is is still still a celestial celestial object object that orbits orbits the the Sun Sun , but it it is not not considered considered to to be be a full full - fledged fledged planet planet like the the other other eight eight planets planets in our our solar solar system system .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

The The MIRR MIRR function calculates the the internal internal rate rate of of return return on on an an investment investment with with multiple multiple cash cash flows flows , taking taking into into account account the fact fact that that the investment investment 's 's cash flows may may be be reinvested reinvested at at a different different rate rate than the the original original cost cost of of the investment investment . It It does this this by by using the the following following formula : MIRR(values MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range range of of cells that that contain contain the the series series of of payments and and investments investments associated associated with the investment investment . \"finance_rate \"finance_rate \" is is the interest rate rate used to calculate calculate the the present value value of of the the cash cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is is the the interest interest rate rate used used to to calculate calculate the the future future value value of of the cash flows flows . The MIRR MIRR function function is is useful useful for for comparing the the returns returns on different investments investments , as as it it takes takes into into account account the the fact fact that that the the reinvestment reinvestment rate rate may may be different different from from the the financing rate rate . It It is is also also useful useful for for evaluating evaluating the profitability profitability of of investments investments with with irregular cash cash flows flows , such as as those that that involve involve the the sale sale of of assets assets or or the repayment of loans loans . Example Example : Suppose Suppose you you are are considering considering investing investing $ 100,000 in in a project project that that is is expected expected to to generate generate the the following following cash cash flows flows over over the next next 5 years : Year Year 1 : $ 20,000Year 20,000Year 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 40,000Year 4 : $ 50,000Year 50,000Year 5 : $ 60,000The financing financing rate rate on on the the investment investment is is 10 10 % , and and the the reinvestment reinvestment rate is is 8 % . You You can can use the the MIRR function function to to calculate calculate the internal rate rate of of return return on the investment investment as follows:=MIRR(A1 follows:=MIRR(A1 : A5 A5 , 10 10 % , 8%)This 8%)This would would return return a result of of approximately approximately 12.63 12.63 % , indicating indicating that the the investment investment is is expected expected to to generate generate a return return of of approximately approximately 12.63 12.63 % per per year year .

{"text": "The The important thing to to know is is how how insects insects breathe breathe . Insects Insects do do n't n't breathe breathe through through their their mouths mouths like like us us ; they do do n't n't even even have lungs lungs . They They have have tiny holes holes in in their their exoskeleton exoskeleton which which allows allows oxygen oxygen into system system of tubes tubes , which which carry carry oxygen oxygen to their their organs . With With that that in in mind mind , let let 's 's think think about about what happens when something increases increases in in size size . Two Two things things increase : volume , and and surface surface area area . The The dependence between between the the two two is is not not linear linear , though . In In other other words words , volume and and surface surface area area increase increase by by different different rates rates . Think Think of of a 1x1x1 1x1x1 foot foot cube . It It has has a volume volume of 1 , and a surface surface area area of of 6 . Now Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It It has has a volume volume of of 8 , and and a surface area area of 24 ( six six sides sides , 4 sq ft ft per per side side ) . The volume volume increased by * eight eight times times * , but but the the surface surface area only only increased increased by by * four four * . 3x3x3 3x3x3 ? Volume Volume of of 27 27 , surface surface area area of 54 54 . The The volume volume more more than than tripled tripled , whereas the surface area area roughly roughly doubled doubled . Now Now , the the point point here is is that that * volume volume * is is what what matters matters for for the weight weight of of an an animal . That That means means that that there there 's 's more more organs organs and and whatnot , all all of of which which need need oxygen oxygen . The amount amount of of oxygen oxygen available available , though , depends depends on on * surface surface area area * . Insects Insects get get oxygen oxygen from from their their skin skin , so to to increase increase their their oxygen oxygen intake intake , they they need to to increase the the surface surface area area of of their their skin . You You ca ca n't add add more more holes holes in in the the exoskeleton exoskeleton to increase increase the the oxygen oxygen flow to to compensate , because because that that makes makes the the exoskeleton exoskeleton weaker . The The exoskeleton is * already already * under extra extra strain strain trying to support the the increased increased weight weight , so so that that wo wo n't n't work . This This means means that there there 's 's essentially a point point where an insect insect ca ca n't n't grow grow any any bigger , because because it it does does n't have enough enough surface area area ( oxygen oxygen supply supply ) to to make up up for for the the increased increased volume volume / weight ( need need for for oxygen oxygen ) . For For more more evidence evidence of this this being being why why insects insects ca n't increase increase in in size , they they used used to to be be much much bigger bigger millions millions and and millions millions of of years ago ago during dinosaur dinosaur times times . The The atmosphere atmosphere was was richer richer in in oxygen back back then then , so it it makes makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What What honey honey badger badger something something said said : \" It It 's 's when when electoral districts districts are are redrawn in in order order to to favor favor a specific specific party party or or candidate candidate based based on on demographics demographics . \" And And check out out [ the the wikipedia article article ] ( URL_2 URL_2 ) . ------------------ ------------------ Imagine Imagine a pretend pretend 51st 51st state state in the US . We We 'll 'll call it the the State State of of Calville . Calville Calville gets gets 10 10 Representatives Representatives to to send send to the the US US House House of Representatives . If If you you 're a Democrat Democrat you you would would like as as many many Democrats Democrats as as possible possible ; if if you you 're 're a Republican you you would would like like as as many Republicans as as possible . Because Calville Calville gets gets 10 10 Representatives Representatives it it needs needs 10 10 districts districts . Each Each district = 1 Representative . How How do do you you draw draw the the borders borders to to make make these these districts districts ? One One way way is to to draw draw the the borders to to make make sure sure that your your party party gets gets as as many of of those those 10 10 Representative Representative spots spots as possible . There There are are 2 basic basic ways ways to to do do that that . 1 . Put ( groups groups of of ) voters voters together together . 2 . Put Put ( groups groups of of ) voters voters apart apart . 1 . Let 's 's pretend pretend a group group of people people always always vote for for Republicans Republicans : people people over over 6 feet feet tall tall . And And you you 're a Democrat and and you you 're in charge charge of of drawing drawing the the borders borders of the the 10 districts districts . You You can can draw it so so that every person person over 6 feet feet tall is is in in one , and and only one one , district . It It could look look [ something like like this this ] ( URL_0 ) or or [ like this this ] ( URL_1 ) . You You 're 're basically basically giving up up that one one district district . You know that that Democrats Democrats will will never never be able able to to win win it . But But you you also know know that that Democrats will have have a * * much much better better * * chance chance in the other 9 because all all the the Republican Republican voters are are in in 1 district . So you you 're 're drawing drawing the the borders so you you get get 9 districts districts / Representatives Representatives and and Republicans Republicans get get 1 district district / Representative Representative . You You 're 're basically basically using using the ability to to make make borders borders to to get get the the electoral electoral outcome outcome you you want want and and not the the electoral electoral outcome outcome the the people people / voters voters want want . 2 . Let 's keep keep going going with with our our hypothetical hypothetical . You You 're 're a Democrat Democrat writing the the rules and and you you only only care care about about getting as many many Democrats Democrats elected elected as as possible possible . Let Let 's 's also also say say 20 % of of people people in in Calville Calville are are over over 6 feet feet tall tall . They will vote vote Republican no no matter what . A fair fair person might might say something something like like : at at least least 20 20 % of of the the population wants wants Republican Representatives , therefore it it 's 's fair fair that that * at least * 2/10 2/10 Representatives Representatives should should be Republican . But But you you , you do do n't n't care care about about fair fair or or what what voters voters want want . You only only want want to to win win . ( Bastard Bastard ! ) So you you take take that that 20 20 % and and you you spread spread them them around . You You make make sure sure that that each district district has has 20 % , but but no no more more , of of people people over over 6 feet tall tall . That That way you you might might be be able able to to win all all 10 districts districts / Representatives Representatives ! So So even even though a fair fair outcome would would be be at least least 2 Republicans , you you ' ve ve abused your your power power to make make sure sure you you get the the result you you want want and and not not what what the people / voters voters want want . If If a Republican Republican is from from a district district which which is is 90 % people over over 6 feet tall tall then then they do do n't really really have have to to worry worry about about being re - elected . If If a Democrat Democrat is is from a district where where they they know know that that only only 20 20 % of of people people are are over over 6 feet feet tall tall then then they they may may not not have have to to worry worry about being being re re - elected elected . -------------------------- -------------------------- It 's 's a real real problem problem and and it it ( basically basically ) disenfranchises real real people people .", "label": "hc3human"}

While While in other countries countries they they are supported supported by banks directly directly ( right right ? ) , in in US US you you may may find find this this option option only only in some big big stores stores like like home home improvement improvement stores stores , car car dealerships dealerships , cell cell phone phone operators operators ( so so that that you can can buy buy a new new phone ) etc etc . Some Some stores stores allow allow 0 % financing for for , say say , 12 12 months months which which is not exactly exactly the the same same as as installments installments but but close , if if you have have discipline discipline to to pay pay $ 250 each each month month and and not not wait wait for for 12 12 months months to to end end . Splitting Splitting the the big big payment payment in in parts parts means means that that the seller seller gets gets money money in in parts parts as as well well , and and it adds risks risks of of customer customer default default , introduces introduces debt debt collection possibility possibility etc etc . That That 's 's why why it it 's 's usually usually up to to the the merchants merchants to to support support it it - bank bank does does not care care in in this this case case , from the the bank bank point point of of view view the the store store just just charges charges the the same same card card another another $ 250 every every month month . In In other countries banks support support this this option option directly directly , I think think , taking taking over over or or dividing dividing the the risk risk with with the the merchants . This This has has not happened in in US US .

The The easiest easiest way way to to build build the the history history - request request \" secured secured credit credit card card \" , which which means means you you have have to to give the the bank bank money money up front and and then then they they will will give you you a credit credit card card with with a credit limit limit equal equal to that that amount amount . It It 's 's like like a \" practice practice credit card card \" . You You use use it it for 6 - 12 12 months months and and the the bank bank will will report report your your usage usage to to credit credit bureaus bureaus , establishing your your \" credit score score \" . After After that you you should should be able able to to get your your money money back and convert convert your secured secured card card into into a regular credit credit card card . Credit Credit history history can can be also also built built by by paying paying rent rent and and utilities utilities but that that requires requires companies companies who who collect collect money money to to report report the the payments payments to to credit credit bureaus bureaus and very very few few do do that that .

{"text": "This is is actually actually an an interesting interesting question question , and the the root root of of your your answer answer lies lies far far back back in in history history . The The short version version is is that a highway highway was was a road road elevated elevated above the surrounding surrounding terrain terrain ( literally , the the high high way way ) , and and a freeway freeway was the the opposite opposite of of a toll road road ( literally literally , the the free free way way ) . Back in in , say say , the the dark ages ages , travel was was n't very common . Most Most people people walked walked from from their hut to the the fields fields and and back , and and perhaps perhaps once once a season season the the duke duke 's 's tax tax collector collector came came in in a wagon or or cart . This This meant meant that that most traffic traffic was was along footpaths footpaths or rutted rutted cart paths . As As populations populations increased , and the the cart cart paths began began seeing seeing more traffic traffic , 2 big problems problems arose arose . First First , the the ruts ruts got deeper deeper , much much deeper deeper . This This is is a major problem in in places places with with a high high water water table table ( say , coastal coastal areas areas or or swamps swamps ) , or or during rainy rainy seasons seasons . Second Second , these low low paths paths made made it it hard hard to see see around around , facilitating ambushes ambushes by by bandits bandits . By By building building up up the the path path , these these two two problems problems were alleviated . The The path path was was above the the waterline , during during rains rains the water would naturally naturally run run off the the path , and and someone someone on the the path path could more more easily easily see see bandits lying lying in in wait . A high high way way was was much much safer safer . The The downsides downsides of of the the high way way is is that that you you could n't n't just get get on it it anywhere anywhere with your your cart - the the sides sides were were too too steep steep . You You had had to to get get on on or or off off in in specific specific locations locations that that had had lower lower grade grade ramps leading leading to to the the high high way way . This This is still still reflected reflected in how our our modern modern highways work work . They They have limited limited access access , usually usually by on on / off off ramps ramps . Modern Modern highways are are ( often often ) elevated elevated , limited limited access access roads roads that that can safely safely handle handle high high volumes of of traffic traffic . However However , the the cost of of building building this this highway highway has has to to be be borne borne by by someone someone . Hence Hence , initially initially , most most highways were were toll roads roads ( aka aka turnpikes turnpikes , because because they had walls walls of of pikes pikes setup setup on the the road , which which was was turned turned aside aside when when the toll was was paid paid . Again Again , literally , turn pike pike to to pass pass ) . When When bright bright , insightful insightful people people in government realized realized that that safer safer traffic traffic along along those those highways highways boosted the the economy economy , and and allowed allowed them them to to collect collect more more taxes taxes , they they decided decided to to make make the the highways highways they they build build free , so so that that they they could could make make more money money off off the the increased increased traffic . The The free free way was was born born . Modern Modern freeways freeways are are highways highways that that are paid paid for for by by taxes taxes . The meaning meaning of highway and freeway freeway is , literally literally , in in the the name . High High way and and free free way way .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Bayesian Bayesian inference inference is is a method method of of statistical statistical inference inference in in which which Bayes Bayes ' theorem theorem is is used used to to update the the probability probability for for a hypothesis hypothesis as more more evidence evidence becomes becomes available . Bayes Bayes ' theorem is is a mathematical mathematical formula formula that that describes how how to to compute compute the probability probability of an an event event based based on prior prior knowledge knowledge of conditions conditions that that might be be related related to to the the event event . In Bayesian Bayesian inference inference , the the probability of of a hypothesis hypothesis is is updated updated as as new new evidence evidence becomes becomes available . This This is in in contrast contrast to to classical classical ( frequentist ) statistical statistical inference , in in which the the probability probability of of a hypothesis is is not not updated updated based based on on the the data , but but rather rather is fixed fixed and and the data data are used used to to test test the the hypothesis hypothesis . The The key key idea idea behind behind Bayesian Bayesian inference is that the the data and and the the hypothesis hypothesis can can be be treated treated as as random random variables variables and and that the the relationship relationship between between them them can be described using probability probability theory theory . This This allows allows us us to to make make probabilistic probabilistic predictions about about the the hypothesis hypothesis based based on the the data data , and and to update update those those predictions predictions as new new data data becomes becomes available available . Bayesian Bayesian inference inference is is often used used in machine machine learning learning and data data analysis , where it it can be used used to to make predictions predictions about about complex complex systems systems based based on on limited data .

{"text": "Yes Yes , it it is is true true that that twins twins can can run in in families . This This is is because because the trait of of having having twins twins is is partly partly determined by by genetics genetics . There There are are certain genetic genetic factors factors that can can increase a person person 's chances chances of of having having twins twins , such as as having having a family history history of twins twins or or certain certain racial racial or or ethnic ethnic backgrounds backgrounds . Here Here 's 's a simple simple explanation of of how how this works works : when a woman becomes becomes pregnant pregnant , her her body body produces produces a hormone hormone called called human human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG hCG ) . This This hormone hormone helps helps the the body maintain maintain the pregnancy pregnancy by by preventing preventing the woman woman 's 's body body from from ovulating ovulating ( releasing eggs eggs ) again . Some Some women women produce produce more more hCG than than others others , and and this this can can lead lead to to the release of of more more than than one egg during during ovulation ovulation . When When two two eggs eggs are are fertilized at at the the same same time time , it it can can result result in in the birth of of twins twins . So , if if a woman woman has has a family history history of twins , it it could could be because because someone someone in in her family family ( like like her mother mother or or grandmother grandmother ) produced produced more hCG , which led led to to the birth birth of of twins . This This genetic genetic trait can can be be passed down down from from one one generation generation to the the next next , which which is is why why twins twins can can run in families .

The other other thing thing they they could could mean mean is is that that the dollar dollar could decrease in in value value relative relative to to other other currencies currencies . Currencies Currencies are typically typically measured measured against against each each other other . An An American American Dollar Dollar might might get get you you $ 1.10 1.10 Canadian Canadian today today and and in in a year year , it it might might get get you you $ 1.20 or or only only 90 cents cents . That That matters matters because because countries countries trade trade with with each each other other and and it it makes makes the the cost cost of imported good more more / less expensive expensive ( so so if if you you 're buying apples apples from from Canada Canada and the the Canadian Canadian Dollar Dollar is more more valuable valuable , those those apples apples will cost more more ) and it it will make make your your exports exports more more / less less expensive expensive ( if if the the American American dollar dollar increases increases in in value value , then then Canadians Canadians might might be be less less inclined inclined to to buy buy American apples apples ) .

This This is is called called \" pseudorandomness . \"\\n\\nThere are are a few few different algorithms that that we we use use to generate generate pseudorandom pseudorandom numbers . One One way way is is to to use something something called a \" random number generator generator , \" which is a piece of of code code that that produces a sequence sequence of of numbers numbers that that looks random random . These These numbers numbers are are usually usually generated generated using using a mathematical mathematical formula formula , and and the the sequence sequence of numbers numbers that that is produced produced will will be be different different each each time time the the code code is is run.\\n\\nAnother way to generate generate pseudorandom numbers numbers is is to to use something something called called a \" random seed seed . \" A random random seed is is a starting starting number that that is is used used to to generate generate a sequence of pseudorandom pseudorandom numbers numbers . If If you you use the the same same random seed seed every every time time , you you 'll 'll get get the the same same sequence sequence of pseudorandom pseudorandom numbers numbers . But But if you you use use a different different random random seed seed each time time , you you 'll 'll get get a different sequence sequence of numbers.\\n\\nSo numbers.\\n\\nSo , to to sum sum it it up up , programmers programmers use use algorithms algorithms and formulas formulas to generate generate numbers numbers that look random random , even even though though they they 're 're not not truly truly random .

Memory leaks : A memory memory leak leak is is a type type of bug that that occurs when when an an application application or or operating system system allocates allocates memory memory for for a task task , but but fails fails to to properly properly release it it when the the task task is is finished finished . Over Over time time , this this can can lead to to the the application application or or operating operating system system using using up more more and and more memory , causing causing it to to slow slow down down . 3 . Fragmentation : When When an operating system system writes writes data data to a hard hard drive drive or or solid - state state drive drive , it tries to to store store the the data in in contiguous blocks blocks to make make it it faster faster to to access . However However , as as the operating system system continues continues to to write and and delete delete data data , the blocks blocks of data data on the the drive drive can can become become fragmented fragmented , meaning that that they they are are scattered scattered around around the the drive drive in in small small pieces . This This can can make make it it slower for the the operating operating system system to access access and read read the the data data , which which can can cause cause the system system to to slow down down . 4 . Background Background processes processes : Many Many applications and and operating operating systems systems have have processes processes that that run run in in the the background background , even when when the the main main application application is is not not being being used used . These These processes processes can can use up up resources and cause cause the the system system to to slow slow down down over over time time . By By regularly closing closing unnecessary unnecessary applications applications and and programs programs , and and restarting restarting the the operating operating system system on on a regular regular basis basis , it can can help help to to keep keep the the system system running running smoothly and and prevent prevent it it from from slowing slowing down down .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Yes Yes , there there is is a measure that that combines combines the the cost of living living with with income , and and it it is is called called the the \" purchasing purchasing power power parity parity \" ( PPP PPP ) . PPP PPP is is an an economic theory theory that compares compares the purchasing purchasing power power of of different different currencies currencies in different different countries countries by by taking taking into into account account the cost cost of of living living in those those countries countries . It It allows allows for for a comparison comparison of of living living standards standards between countries countries by by taking taking into account account the differences differences in in prices prices for for goods and and services . For For example example , if if the the cost cost of of living living is higher higher in in one country country compared compared to another , the the purchasing purchasing power power of of the the currency currency in in the first first country country will will be be lower lower , even even if if the the nominal exchange exchange rate rate between between the two two currencies currencies is is the the same same . PPP PPP helps helps to adjust for for these these differences in in prices and and allows for for a more more accurate comparison comparison of living living standards standards between countries countries . There There are are several several measures of of PPP PPP , including including the the \" Big Big Mac Mac Index Index , \" which which compares compares the price price of of a Big Mac Mac burger burger in in different countries countries as as a way way to to compare the the purchasing purchasing power of different different currencies . Another Another measure measure is is the the \" PPP PPP - adjusted gross gross national national income income per per capita capita , \" which takes into into account the cost of of living living in in different different countries countries and and adjusts for for it it when when comparing comparing the the income income levels levels of of different different countries .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

Each playgroup playgroup has has their their own part part of the the playset , and and they they still still play with with other other kids outside outside of of the the playset playset and other other playgroups playgroups , but but at at the the end of of the the day day , they always always go go back back to to their playgroups playgroups . Now Now imagine imagine each playgroup playgroup has a babysitter , and and that that babysitter babysitter oversees oversees several several playgroups playgroups at other other playsets playsets and she reports reports to to a mom . The babysitter babysitter is is like like a regional regional coordinator coordinator or or a house house mom or or what have have you . The Mom Mom is is like the the national national / international international president president . Each Each playset playset is is like like greek life life on on another another campus campus .

A girl girl on my my lacrosse lacrosse team always always bashes sororities , but she she 's 's closest with with all all the girls girls in in Greek Greek life on on our our team team . It It 's amazing amazing if if you you find find the the right right house house with with the the right right girls girls . Every Every house house at at every every campus campus during different different generations generations are are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT .

In In Greek Greek life , you you get get to to meet meet a lot lot of of people people ( especially especially if if you you go go to to a big big school school like like me ) and and it it makes makes a big big campus campus feel smaller smaller because because you you meet meet people from from mixers mixers / raids raids / invites invites whatever whatever you you want want to call call them them . I ' ve ve gotten gotten so many many connections connections for professors professors , classes , and and any help help I ' ve ve needed . A lot lot of my my best best friends friends are are in in Greek Greek life life , but but I also also have friends friends who who refuse refuse to be in in Greek Greek life life and and friends who who dropped dropped out out of of Greek Greek life life . It It 's 's not not like like some some elite elite club club where where you you ignore everyone everyone else else .

Because fewer fewer healthy healthy people are are signing signing up up ( people people who who would would be be cheaper cheaper for for the the insurance company company ) and and the the sick ones ones are are still able able to to ( expensive expensive ) , the the average average expenditures the the insurance company company has has to make make for for each person person goes goes up up .

More More healthy people people drop drop out out sinc sinc , forgoing forgoing the the more more expensive expensive insurance insurance since since they do do n't n't need need it and and can can buy it it later later . And And costs go go up again again , so so prices prices go go up up again again , so so more more healthy healthy people drop out out again again .

So So you you 're more likely likely to to buy the the insurance before before you you get get sick sick , lowering lowering average costs and and making a true true insurance insurance system system more more tenable tenable .

When When we we say say that a sound sound is is twice as loud loud as as another another sound , we we mean that that the the first first sound sound has twice twice the the intensity intensity of of the the second second sound . Intensity Intensity is is a measure measure of of the the amount of of energy energy that that a sound sound wave wave carries carries . When When we increase increase the the volume volume of a sound sound on on a computer computer or other other device , we we are are increasing the the intensity intensity of of the sound wave .

For example example , if if you you increase the volume volume of of a sound sound from from 1 % to to 2 % , the the intensity of the the sound sound wave may may not not double double . This is is because because the volume volume control control on on a device often often uses a logarithmic logarithmic scale scale , rather rather than than a linear linear scale scale . This This means means that each increase increase in in volume volume by by a certain percentage percentage represents a much much smaller smaller increase increase in in intensity intensity than than the the previous previous increase . So So , even even though you may may think think that that increasing increasing the the volume volume from from 1 % to 2 % should should make make the the sound sound twice twice as as loud loud , it it may may not seem seem that way way because because the intensity of the the sound sound wave is is not not actually actually doubling doubling .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

However , Pinyin Pinyin is is not not used used as as the primary primary written form form of of Chinese . Chinese Chinese characters characters ( also also known known as as Hanzi Hanzi or Kanji Kanji in in Japanese ) are are the the primary primary written written form form of of Chinese and have a long history history dating dating back back over over 3,000 3,000 years years . They are still used today because because they they are are an important important part part of of Chinese Chinese culture culture and and history , and and they they are are also very very efficient efficient for for written written communication . One One of of the the main main reasons reasons that that Pinyin Pinyin is is not not used used as the the primary written written form form of Chinese Chinese is is that it it can can not not fully represent represent the the sounds sounds and and meanings meanings of of Chinese words words . Chinese Chinese characters , on on the the other hand hand , can convey convey the the full meaning meaning and and pronunciation pronunciation of of a word in in a single single character character . For For example , the the Chinese Chinese character character for for \" water \" is is \u6c34 , which which is pronounced pronounced \" shui shui \" in Mandarin Mandarin . Pinyin Pinyin can can not not represent represent the the meaning meaning of of the the character character , only the pronunciation . Additionally Additionally , replacing replacing Chinese Chinese characters with with Pinyin as as the the primary primary written written form of of Chinese would would be be a massive massive undertaking undertaking that would would involve involve changing changing the the way way that Chinese Chinese is taught taught in in schools schools , updating dictionaries dictionaries and and other reference reference materials , and potentially potentially requiring requiring people people to to learn a new new writing writing system system . It would also also be be difficult difficult to to determine determine a standard standard way way to to represent the the many many different different regional regional accents and dialects dialects of of Chinese Chinese using using the the Roman Roman alphabet alphabet . In In summary summary , while while Pinyin Pinyin is is a useful useful tool tool for for learning learning Chinese Chinese and and transcribing transcribing proper nouns , it is is not not used as as the the primary written written form of of Chinese because it it can can not not fully fully represent represent the the sounds sounds and and meanings meanings of of Chinese words words , and and replacing Chinese Chinese characters with Pinyin would be be a major undertaking undertaking .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

{"text": "Fiber Fiber optics optics is is a technology that uses uses thin thin strands of of glass glass or or plastic plastic called optical fibers fibers to transmit transmit information , such such as as data data or voice , over long distances distances . These fibers fibers are are extremely extremely thin thin , about the the diameter diameter of a human hair hair , and and are are made made of of a special special type type of glass glass or or plastic plastic that that is is very very good good at at transmitting transmitting light light . Light travels through the the fiber fiber optic optic cables cables by by bouncing bouncing off the the walls walls of the fibers fibers . This happens happens because because the the walls walls of of the the fibers fibers are are very very smooth smooth and and the the light reflects reflects off off them them in in a way way that that keeps keeps it it moving forward . The The light light reflects off off the the walls walls so so many times times that that it travels a very long long distance distance without without losing losing much much energy or or intensity . One reason reason that that light light can can enter enter the the fiber fiber optic cable cable but but not not exit exit is is because the the walls walls of of the fiber fiber are are made made of a material material that is is very very good good at at reflecting reflecting light . This This means means that when when the the light hits hits the walls walls , it it bounces bounces off them and and continues traveling traveling through through the the fiber fiber . However However , the the walls walls of the the fiber fiber are are also also very very smooth smooth , which which makes makes it it difficult difficult for for the the light to to escape escape . This This is why why the the light light stays stays inside inside the the fiber and and is is able able to to travel travel such a long long distance distance without without losing much much intensity intensity . There are are many many practical practical applications applications of of fiber fiber optic technology .

Anyone Anyone ' reacting ' in in their their videos videos is is now now part part of of The The Fine Fine Bros. Bros. ' React React World'(tm World'(tm ) . Two Two massive problems problems come from from this this situation situation : * * 1 . The ' React React format ' is too too broad broad , and and actually actually unknown , and and yet yet The The Fine Fine Bros Bros look as as though though they they might might succeed in in getting getting the the rights to to this this undefinable undefinable ... thing thing :* :* * Imagine Imagine if if tomorrow tomorrow , Warner Warner Bros. Bros. were to to create create the the ' Rock World World ' project project , announcing announcing that that they they own own the the concept of of ' rock rock ' - such such a massive massive genre genre that that it it is is impossible to truly truly define define . Therefore Therefore , Warner Warner Bros. Bros. would be able to to take take action action on just just about anything anything with with a guitar in it it , because because it it is is ' too too rock rock - like like ' , making making up up the rules rules as as they they go go along along . Subsequently Subsequently , many , many many musicians musicians will will be under under the the label label 's 's watchful eyes eyes , in in danger danger of of legal legal action action . The The ' React React format format ' is is so so unspecified to to the point that The The Fine Fine Bros. Bros. could could have have the the right right to to take take legal legal action action against against anyone discussing discussing a video video , or or even dares dares have someone someone else else 's video video playing in in the the corner corner at at the the same same time . In In spite spite of of the fact fact that they they have have spent spent the the last few few days days posting comments and and even even an ' Update Update ' video video in their own own defence defence , they they still still have have n't n't stated stated what what they they are truly truly claiming claiming , meaning meaning it it seems seems more more and and more more as as though though they they are are claiming claiming more than they they deserve deserve . * * 2 . Reaction Reaction videos videos existed existed before before The Fine Fine Bros. Bros. did did it it . * * : If If the definition definition is is so so broad broad , they can can also lay claim claim to videos videos that that existed before before theirs theirs did . This was was what what their their original original ' React React World World ' announcement announcement video video was about about - announcing announcing that that if if you you made made a ' React video ' , that that you were were part part of of their community community . The The reason reason that that announcement announcement clip clip was was so so stupid stupid was was that that it treated treated the announcement as as though it it were were good good news news . Good Good news news everyone everyone . You ' ve ve just just been employed employed by by The The Fine Bros. Bros. , although although if if you you do do n't n't want want our our name on on your your video video , that that 's 's OK OK . Just Just give give us us some some money money for for a license license and and you you are safe . Going Going back back to to the music comparison comparison , that is is similar to to Warner Warner Bros. Bros. hoping that that all all guitarists would suddenly suddenly be be happy happy about about that that ' Rock Rock World World ' project project , because because they they had been signed signed by by Warner Bros. Bros. ! Unfortunately Unfortunately , not not all all guitarists guitarists , nor nor video video makers makers are that that stupid stupid , leading leading to to the big big backlash .", "label": "hc3human"}

Assuming you 're a civilian civilian living living in in a typical place place in in the the United United States States \u2014 that that is , not not American American Samoa Samoa or or whatever \u2014 you you may may be within within the the jurisdiction of of as as many many as as five five separate separate democratically or or semi semi - democratically elected elected governments governments : the municipality municipality , the the township township , the county county , the state state and the the union union . Certain Certain hard limits are are placed placed on on lower tiers by upper upper tiers tiers , particularly particularly regarding how how those those lower tiers must must respect respect basic basic civil rights rights . For For example example , it would would be be unlawful unlawful for * any * tier tier of of government government in in the United United States States to to charge charge a poll poll tax during an election . It It 's prohibited prohibited by by law , and and if if attempted attempted would would be be challenged challenged in in a court court of of appropriate appropriate jurisdiction jurisdiction and and overturned overturned . However However , within within those those basic basic limits , each each tier tier is is more more or or less less left left at its its own own discretion discretion to to organize organize itself itself however however it it wants wants , and that that includes includes setting setting the rules rules for for local local elections elections . As long long as those rules rules do do n't n't violate fundamental fundamental principles principles of of law , the the individual individual bodies bodies politic politic can can do do * whatever whatever . * If If some some municipal municipal government government somewhere somewhere wanted to to change change its its method of of electing electing its its mayor mayor from from election election by by ballot ballot to to election election by by acclamation acclamation , and the laws of of the the locally locally relevant relevant upper upper tiers tiers of of government \u2014 meaning meaning the the state constitution , basically basically \u2014 did did n't n't expressly prohibit prohibit it it , they they could could go go right ahead ahead . This even even applies applies to to a certain certain extent extent to to locally run elections elections which are are part of of a higher - level level process process . For For instance instance , each each state state 's 's senators senators are elected elected by the the people of that that state state \u2014 this this is is set down in in the 17th 17th amendment amendment to to the the US Constitution Constitution . But the the precise precise method method for for holding holding that that election is is left left to to the states states \u2026 and and the the states , in in turn turn , may may leave leave it it to to the the lower lower tiers of of government government . So So when when you you start talking talking about about changing changing the fundamental fundamental method of of election election in the the United States States , you 're 're kind kind of talking talking about about a lot lot . You You 're 're talking talking about about well well upwards of 25,000 25,000 individual individual municipal municipal governments governments , God God knows knows how how many many civil townships townships , more more than than 3,000 3,000 counties counties or or equivalent equivalent , fifty fifty states states and and a smattering smattering of of non non - state state territories territories . Depending on on * which which of of those those * you 're talking talking about about , the the rules rules for changing the the rules rules \u2014 if if you you know know what I mean mean \u2014 are are going going to to vary vary . If If you you 're 're talking talking about about changing changing how how the the town town of of Hart Hart 's 's Location , New Hampshire Hampshire \u2014 population 41 41 ; they had three three babies babies in in 2010 2010 \u2014 elects its its selectmen selectmen , you you need need to to convince convince about about two two dozen people people to to agree agree with with you you , then then you 're 're done done .

The The key key difference difference between a linear linear regression regression model model and a GLM GLM is is that that in a GLM GLM , the the response response variable variable is is not not necessarily necessarily continuous and and may may follow follow a different different distribution distribution , such such as as a binomial , poisson poisson , or gamma distribution distribution . The The GLM allows for for the the modeling modeling of of this this type type of of data by by using using a link link function function to to relate relate the mean mean of of the the response response variable variable to to a linear linear combination of of the the predictor variables variables . In In a GLM GLM , the the response response variable variable is assumed assumed to to follow follow a certain distribution distribution , and and the the mean mean of of this this distribution distribution is modeled modeled as as a linear linear combination combination of the predictor predictor variables variables .

Fraternities ( and sororities sororities ) are are basically basically structured structured social social groups groups . When When college students students leave leave their their hometown hometown and and arrive at at college college , they they often often know very very few few people people and and are are not used used to to taking taking the the initiative initiative in in meeting meeting people people . Fraternities Fraternities provide provide a medium for for students students to to socialise and and bond bond . Since Since fraternities fraternities often often have a reputation reputation , students students can can join join to to meet likeminded likeminded peers who who they they might might not not otherwise otherwise meet . For example , some some fraternities fraternities will will have have a charity charity focus focus , others others will will have people people who who grew grew up in in a certain certain area area , others others will will attract goofy goofy guys or or sporty guys guys . Fraternities also also provide provide structured structured social social situations situations to to meet meet girls girls ( or or sororities for for meeting meeting boys boys ) by by holding parties parties , date date nights nights and and other other functions functions . Finally Finally , because because the drinking age in America America is is 21 21 , most students students ca ca n't n't go go to to bars bars for for the the first first few few years years of of college college , so so fraternities also function as social hubs hubs in in the the same same way that that bars / clubs do do once once you you reach reach the the legal legal drinking drinking age . Having Having said said that that , there there are are arguably arguably a number of of downsides downsides to to fraternities fraternities . They They can can perpetuate social social stratification stratification because because current members members of of the the fraternity fraternity pick pick the the incoming incoming members members . Members Members will will often only only want want to to invite invite freshman freshman students who who are are similar similar to to them them , and so so the the fraternity and and sorority sorority scene scene can can appear appear quite insular insular . I have have heard heard that that people people belong in in a certain certain fraternity fraternity because they went went to to X high school school , they they have have family family money money , or or because because they they are are a ' legacy legacy ' ( i.e. i.e. their dad / mum was was in in the the fraternity / sorority sorority ) . Also , because because only only fraternities fraternities hold hold parties parties ( sororities sororities have have nice nice houses and and do do n't n't want want them them trashed ) , guys guys in in the the ' cool ' fraternities fraternities hold an an imbalance of social social power as as other other students students ( particularly particularly girls ) need to befriend them them to to get get invited invited to to the the parties ( if if they ca ca n't get get into into bars ) .

{"text": "Sure Sure ! Converting Converting a number number from from binary binary to to decimal is is actually actually pretty pretty easy easy . Here Here 's 's how how to to do do it : 1 . Write Write down the the binary binary number . 2 . Starting Starting from from the the rightmost rightmost digit , assign assign the the value of of 0 to to the rightmost rightmost digit digit , 1 to the the second rightmost digit digit , 2 to the the third third rightmost digit digit , and and so so on on . 3 . For For each digit , multiply multiply the value value of that digit digit by the corresponding corresponding power power of of 2 . For For example example , the the value value of of the the rightmost digit digit ( which which is 0 or or 1 ) should should be be multiplied multiplied by by 2 to to the the power power of of 0 , the the value value of of the the second second rightmost rightmost digit digit should should be multiplied by by 2 to to the the power power of of 1 , and and so on on . 4 . Add Add up up all all of of the the products products from step step 3 to to get get the the decimal decimal equivalent equivalent of of the binary binary number number . Here Here 's 's an an example example : let let 's 's convert convert the the binary number 1011 1011 ( which which is is 11 11 in in decimal decimal ) to to decimal decimal . 1 . Write Write down down the the binary binary number number : 1011 1011 2 . Assign Assign values values to to each each digit : 1 * 2 ^ 3 + 0 * 2 ^ 2 + 1 * 2 ^ 1 + 1 * 2 ^ 0 3 . Calculate Calculate the the products products : 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 11 4 . Add Add up up the the products : 11 11 So So the the decimal decimal equivalent equivalent of of 1011 1011 is is 11 11 .

{"text": "There There is is change change , we have have elections elections every every two years years ( four for president president ) Every Every two two years years we vote on on the the entire entire house house of of representatives ( half of of congress congress , the legislative legislative - lawmaking lawmaking branch of of government government ) , and and 1/3 1/3 of of the senate senate ( the other other half half of of congress ) . In In general , people people keep keep electing electing the the same same people people as long long as they run run again again . There are are two two main main reasons reasons for for it it . 1 . Redistricting Redistricting - Every Every 10 10 years years when when a new new census census comes out lines have have to to be be redrawn redrawn to to accurately accurately decide decide how how much much representation in in congress congress each state state gets gets . This This is often often used used as an an opportunity opportunity for the party party that that is is in in charge in in each state state to change the the lines lines so so that that it it favors them . Over Over time time this this means means that that * * most most * * districts lean heavily one one way way or another . This This means that that if if you 're 're a republican republican or democrat democrat in in the the house house of of representatives , if you run run again again next next term term , the the guy from from the the other other party probably wo wo n't n't be be able able to to beat beat you you . There There are are laws laws to limit limit this this effect effect , although although it it still still happens happens . Redistricting Redistricting is n't n't a factor in the senate senate . 2 . People People like like * * their representative representative * * even even if if they do do n't n't like like congress congress . While While people people say say they they do do n't n't like like congress , they they still like like the the guy guy they they voted voted for for . This is is partly partly because because of of # 1 above but it it 's 's a common situation situation . This is is because because even though though congress congress makes makes decisions a lot lot of of people dislike dislike , their their representative will will often often vote vote how how they they prefer prefer . The The reason reason congress congress does does n't n't agree agree is is mostly mostly because they they 'll 'll be be replaced replaced next next election election if they they work work with with the other other side side . * * So So most people people are upset with with congress , but but when when they they have have a chance chance to change change a small small part part of it , they they overwhelmingly overwhelmingly will will choose choose to to not not do do so . * * A small small majority majority are are upset upset with with the the president , but he ca n't n't run run again again in in 2016 2016 anyway . The The US US may replace replace him him with with a republican republican ( switching switching is is common after after two terms terms of of the the other party party ) or they they might replace replace him with a different different democrat democrat . People People do n't take any any real real action outside outside of elections because because even even though though people people are are upset with with government right now now * * things things are are also pretty pretty good good for most most americans americans and and are are getting getting better all all the the time time * * , and something something along along the lines of of a revolution revolution ( like like Ukraine , or or Syria Syria / Libya Libya ) is * * way way * * too too much much risk risk for the the average average american , who who would would basically basically be sacrificing a good good life life for for the the chance chance to disrupt disrupt the the biggest economy economy in the world world , almost certainly certainly making making their their lives lives , and and the the lives lives of everyone everyone else else in in the world world , much much worse worse .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A program program is is just a bunch of of very very simple instructions instructions for for doing doing something something . A programming programming language language lets lets you you say say how how to to do do something something complicated in in terms terms of of several several simple simple steps steps \u2014 including including steps steps that that are are repeated repeated ( \" loops loops \" ) and steps where where you you might might decide decide which which of of two two or or more more things to to do do ( \" conditionals conditionals \" ) . For instance instance , suppose you are are programming programming a little little robot robot that can can move around around on on a piece piece of of paper . The The robot robot has has a pen pen in its its belly , so so it it draws draws a line line wherever wherever it it goes goes . You You would like like to get get the robot robot to draw draw a square square . But all all it it knows how how to to do is is * go go forward forward or back back by by some some number number of inches inches * , and * turn turn left left or or right right by by some number number of of degrees degrees * . So you have have to to tell tell it it how how to to make make a square out out of those those moves moves . You might write write a program program like like this this : to to draw_a_square draw_a_square forward forward 2 right right 90 90 forward forward 2 right 90 90 forward forward 2 right right 90 90 forward forward 2 right right 90 90 end end If If the the robot robot runs that that program , it will have drawn drawn a square square , and and ended ended up up back back where it it started . This This is is , in in fact fact , a program in the the language language [ Logo Logo ] ( URL_1 URL_1 ) , which which used to to be be very very popular popular for for teaching teaching programming programming to to grade grade school school students . You can find find the Logo Logo programming programming language [ here here ] ( URL_0 URL_0 ) for for Mac Mac , Windows Windows , Linux Linux , and and other other systems systems . Remember how I said that that you you can can use use repeated steps steps ? You You can can use use these these to to make a program program shorter shorter , like this this : to to draw_a_square draw_a_square repeat repeat 4 [ forward forward 2 right right 90 90 ] end end That That 's 's a lot lot shorter shorter than than the earlier earlier program , but but it it does does the the same thing thing . It 's 's shorter shorter because instead instead of of repeating repeating instructions instructions ourselves ourselves , we we tell tell the the robot robot to to repeat repeat doing doing them them . Programs Programs can can also also take take inputs inputs , for for instance instance , telling how how big big the square square should should be : to to draw_square draw_square : size size repeat repeat 4 [ forward forward : size size right right 90 90 ] end Or , even , instead instead of of a square , we we could could draw draw an an arbitrary arbitrary regular regular polygon polygon : to to draw_polygon draw_polygon : sides : size size repeat repeat : sides sides [ forward forward : size size right right ( 360 360 / : sides sides ) ] end end So So , programs programs can repeat themselves themselves and they they can can do do different different things things based based on their their inputs inputs . They They can can also also control control different different parts parts of of the the computer computer , for for instance instance sending sounds to to the the speakers or or communicating communicating with with other other programs programs over over the the network network . But But the the basic basic steps of any program program are are based on making making decisions decisions and doing doing things things repeatedly repeatedly .", "label": "hc3human"}

It has been been used in the the game game industry industry for for many many years , but but it it has become become more more popular and and more more advanced advanced in recent years years . Before motion motion capture capture , game developers had to to create create animations animations manually manually , which was was a very very time time - consuming process process . They They would would have have to to draw draw each each frame frame of the animation animation by by hand hand , or or use computers computers to create create the the animations from from scratch scratch . This This was was not very very efficient efficient , and and it it was difficult to to create create realistic animations animations this this way way . To use use motion capture capture , game game developers developers set set up up a special studio studio with with many many cameras cameras that that are are pointed pointed at the the person or or animal animal whose movements movements they want want to to capture capture . The The person person or or animal wears a special special suit suit with with markers markers on on it , which the cameras can can track track .

{"text": "They They 're 're not not loopholes loopholes . That 's 's just a propaganda word people people use use to to confuse confuse things things . There There are are basically basically two two different things things that that people people sometimes sometimes erroneously erroneously call call loopholes loopholes : There are are tax tax deductions deductions , and then then there there are are standard standard accounting accounting practices . A tax tax deduction deduction is is anything anything that you you can can * spend spend * money money on on that that * reduces reduces * your your taxable taxable income income . So So say you 're 're an an individual individual \u2014 this this applies equally equally well well to to corporations corporations ; we we 're just just keeping keeping it it simple simple \u2014 who who earns earns $ 100,000 100,000 in in a year year . You spend spend a quarter of of that that , let let 's 's say say , on on * stuff stuff * , stuff like like your your mortgage and and food food and and whatever . That That leaves leaves you you with with $ 75,000 75,000 at the the end end of of the year year . Let Let 's * pretend pretend * \u2014 this is is not not how it it works , but but this this is is just just an an example example \u2014 that that your your tax tax rate rate is is a flat 10 10 % of of your your taxable income , and your your taxable taxable income is is everything everything you you make make in in a year year . That means means in in this this year year , your your taxable income income is $ 100,000 , and ten ten percent percent of of that that is $ 10,000 10,000 , meaning at the end of of the the year year you you owe owe the government $ 10,000 , out out of the the $ 75,000 75,000 you you have have on on hand hand . But the the government government allows allows you you to to * deduct deduct * charitable charitable contributions contributions from from your taxable income income . Meaning Meaning anything anything you you give give to to charity charity is is * subtracted from from * your your taxable taxable income income for the year . Since Since you have have $ 75,000 75,000 left left over at the the end end of the year , you can can write a $ 50,000 50,000 check check to to your your local local soup kitchen kitchen , let let 's 's say . That That $ 50,000 50,000 gets gets * subtracted subtracted * from from your taxable taxable income , making your your taxable taxable income just just $ 50,000 50,000 , rather rather than than $ 100,000 100,000 . Since Since your your tax is is 10 % of of your your taxable taxable income , you you just reduced reduced your your tax tax bill bill from from $ 10,000 10,000 to $ 5,000 5,000 , which which is is only 5 % of of your your gross gross income income . Some Some people people just just look look at at the last last sentence sentence \u2014 you only only paid paid 5 % of of your your gross income income in in taxes \u2014 and and think that that 's unfair unfair , so they they call call deductions deductions a loophole loophole . In truth , we we give give tax tax deductions * hoping hoping people people will will take take advantage advantage of of them them . * They They 're 're * incentives incentives * to to get get people people to to do do certain certain things things with with their their money money , things things like give to to charity , or save for their retirement retirement or or future future health - care care needs needs , or put a kid kid through college . The other thing thing people people sometimes sometimes mistakenly mistakenly call call \" loopholes loopholes \" are are just just standard standard accounting accounting practices practices . One One thing thing that that 's been been in in the the news news kind kind of of recently is is the question question of of personal personal income income from from hedge hedge fund fund managers . A hedge fund fund is is a type type of investment that 's 's managed managed by by a person . That That person person does does n't n't get paid paid a salary salary ; instead instead , he gets a percentage percentage of of the the profits profits the the hedge hedge fund makes makes under his his management management . Makes sense sense , right right ? You You 're 're tying tying the the manager manager 's 's compensation compensation directly to his job job performance performance . Well , since since the hedge fund fund manager draws draws no salary salary and and instead takes takes a percentage percentage from from the the fund 's 's gain , all all his his income income is is taxed at the the capital capital gains gains tax tax rate rate of of 15 15 % , not not at at the income income tax tax rate of of ( up up to to ) 35 35 % . Some Some people people call this this a loophole loophole , but but that that 's 's just just propaganda . Accounting Accounting for for your your income income that that way way is is what what you you 're 're * supposed supposed to to do do . * It 's 's not not a cheat cheat . It It 's 's how how the the system system is is set up . We We can can talk talk about about whether whether the system system * should should be be * set set up up that that way or not not , but the fact fact is is that that * is is * how how the the system is is set set up up , and the the hedge hedge fund fund manager who who reports reports his his income income as as capital gain is is following following the the rules rules . If If he he did did it it any any * other other * way he he 'd 'd be be * breaking * the the rules rules , and and he he 'd 'd get get in trouble trouble for it it . So So basically basically , whenever whenever you you hear hear somebody somebody say \" tax tax loophole \" , understand understand that that they they 're almost certainly certainly talking talking about things things that are are built built into into the the system for for good good reason reason and and which people people do do because because they they 're 're supposed to . The phrase phrase does does * not not * imply that that people people are are cheating cheating the system system and getting getting away away with with it it ; it 's 's just supposed make make you * think * it it implies implies that that , so so you you can can get get mad at at those those dirty dirty cheats \u2026 who who are are in in reality reality just just doing doing exactly exactly and and nothing nothing other other than than what what the the tax tax code code tells tells them them they 're supposed supposed to to do do .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The The long long version , someone else else can can provide the the short . I interject interject a lot of of history history into into this this explanation explanation which which severely severely lengthens lengthens it it , though though I do n't n't think think you you can can understand understand these these concepts concepts without without learning learning about how how they they were were applied applied . I did did not not discuss fascism here but but will add add it it on to to the the end . The The Communist Manifesto makes makes excellent excellent critiques critiques of of capitalism . If If you you read read it it today today , which which i did did last week week , you 'll be be amazed amazed at how much much of what what he he said said applies applies to to us us now now . The The main main problem problem is is that that Marx Marx does does n't n't give give very clear clear answers answers for addressing addressing the the faults faults . His His basic plan was was that industrialized industrialized nations should should move move to socialism , and and then after after a period of of adjustment move move into into communism communism . I 'll 'll explain explain later why no no communist communist country actually actually followed followed his plan plan . One One of Marx Marx and and Engels Engels arguments arguments was was that prior prior to to industrialization , we we produced not not much much more more than than we used used . Obviously Obviously there there was was trade trade but but for the the most most part part the lack lack of of machinery kept production levels levels low low . Then Then machines machines come along along and and our our ability to to produce produce greatly greatly increased increased . Adam Adam Smith Smith , the the author author of of Wealth Wealth of of Nations Nations showed how how division division of labour labour increased increased production production for for manufacturers manufacturers . Now Now instead instead of one one person person making a product product , you you might might have have 10 who who accomplish accomplish different different portions portions of of the the task . This This made made production production go go way up up . What What Marx criticized criticized was was the effect effect of of having having such such a surplus surplus . When When you overproduce overproduce the price price of of the the good decreases decreases because the the supply supply is so so high high . This This required required two two things things , one one to to reduce reduce the the cost of manufacturing to keep keep up up with with competition competition who who , through through free free market market competition , lower prices prices . The The second was was that that you you had had to find new markets . Given Given the world world at at the the time of Smith Smith who published published in in 1776 , there there were were a lot of of non non - industrialized industrialized nations nations that that you you could could introduce introduce to to your goods goods . So So the the more more markets markets that that opened opened up up the more more needed to be be produced . Marx Marx believed believed that that workers workers standard standard of of living living decreased decreased as as people were were moved moved into the the cities cities to to meet meet the the demand for for work work . This resulted , he he believed , in the the workers workers and and consumers consumers becoming becoming less less self self sufficient sufficient . Cheap goods goods require require cheap labor labor . Instead of of owning owning your your own own land land or or home home , you you lived in in worker cities cities or or rented in in town town . On On this this note note Marx Marx was not not a big fan fan of of private land land ownership ownership ( understatement , his his summation summation of of Communism Communism was was \" The The abolition of of private property property \" ) . He He argued argued that that the land land would would be be consolidated consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately ultimately they they would would own own the land land / homes homes . We can can see see this today . Most people people 's homes homes are are owned owned by by the the bank bank , not not by by the the family . If If land was more communal communal you you would n't n't having having everyone everyone paying paying rent rent to to the the same same set of of people who who own own the local local land . Back Back to to industrialization industrialization , this this is is the the period period of of time time where where we we find find child child labor , a lack of of labor laws laws , unions unions , or or anyone anyone fighting for for the the workers workers themselves . Marx Marx divided divided the the population into two two classes classes . The The first first was was the bourgeois bourgeois ( boor - zhwa zhwa ) who who had had the capital capital ( the the money money , the assets assets , the the means means to to produce produce ) . These These were were the people people who owned owned the companies or managed managed them them . They They did did not not produce produce directly directly , but but the received received the most most profit profit from from the production . The The name name basically basically means means \" in the walled walled city city \" . The The second second class class was was the the proletariat proletariat . These are the the workers workers in in the factories and on on the the farms farms . Their Their standard standard of of living living is so so low low that that they they can only only afford afford to to survive survive . The The name name means means \" those who who produce produce offspring offspring \" . They had enough to to survive survive and and reproduce . Now the the proletariat proletariat the the ones ones who who are are actually actually doing doing the the work work and and producing producing the goods goods , yet yet they they are are treated treated the the worst worst and and receive receive little little of of the the profits profits . Marx Marx argued argued for a society society in which which the workers workers ruled ruled . He He argued argued for for labor labor unions unions to to protect protect themselves from from increasingly increasingly poor poor conditions conditions . Before unions unions , if if a something something happened happened to to a worker worker , there there was was no no one one to to represent them them . People People did did n't n't want to to lose lose their their jobs jobs defending defending them them and and there there was n't much much point point to to it . But But if if the the workers workers band band together together and and say say , \" Hey we we are are n't n't going going to to work work unless unless you improve improve these conditions conditions \" well well then then the managers managers and owners owners would would have have to to listen listen . They ca n't n't do do the the work work on their own own , they require require a large large number number of of the the proletariat . The The goal was for for the the workers workers to to take take advantage advantage of of their their power power , which which was in in production production . If If they they had had to to stop work work completely completely , or or strike strike , it cost cost the the owners owners more more in in lost lost production production than than it it cost the workers workers in in lost wages wages . Not Not that that it it was was easy easy to to go without without work or or that that these people people had had savings but but it was a way way to be heard . All All of of this this Marx Marx said said , was was the the result result of of industrialization industrialization and and the the drive drive for for profit profit it it produced produced . He He stated stated that that we we stopped stopped producing producing to to meet meet needs needs , and and started started producing producing to to make make profits profits for a small small portion portion of of the the population population . He He argued argued that the the class class struggle struggle between the the bourgeois bourgeois and and proletariat proletariat would would continue continue to to grow until until a revolution revolution occurs which which will will establish establish a state run run by by the the workers workers . As As an example example , we we can can see see today today that that about 3 % of of the the population owns owns ~40 ~40 % of of the the wealth ( in America America ) . Basically Marx Marx said when you you overproduce overproduce ( in in the the search search for profits profits under under capitalism ) supply is is increased increased , demand demand is is decreased decreased , and and the the price decreases decreases . This This is is not good good news for for the worker worker as this this cycle feeds back back on itself , and and ultimately ultimately the the workers pay pay the the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There There is is a belief belief among among some some people people that that there is is a \" gay gay agenda agenda \" , a movement movement to to intentionally intentionally change change ( American ) society society . Some Some people think think that that homosexuality in any any form is is evil evil , particularly particularly if if you you interpret the the bible bible in in a certain certain way way that seems seems to to indicate indicate that that God God himself views views homosexuality homosexuality as as a sin . So So , to them , just just as we we should not not glorify glorify murder murder and and rape , we should should also also not not accept homosexuality homosexuality as a common common place way way of of life life . People People who who believe believe this this way way see see sinister sinister motives motives in even even people people just just wanting wanting to to make make marriage marriage between between two two men men legal , abolishing laws laws banning banning sex in in forms other other than than the the missionary position position , and and granting granting them them non non - discriminatory discriminatory rights rights , such as hospital visitation visitation or fair fair employment and housing housing - you you should should n't be be denied a job job or or a home just because because you you are gay . The The gay gay agenda agenda to to them is is any any movement in in society society which alters alters society society 's 's perception perception of of homosexuality homosexuality away away from viewing viewing them them as as subhuman subhuman evil evil people to normal normal human human beings beings who who just just want want to to live live like like everyone everyone else else . Making them them equal equal , making making them them normal , and and making them them accepted accepted is is a gay gay agenda agenda , intended intended to to brainwash brainwash the the youth youth into into thinking thinking that that this this lifestyle is is acceptable acceptable . Hidden Hidden within within all all of of that that is the premise premise that that homosexuality homosexuality is is a choice . If it were were n't n't then then it would would be be cruel cruel of of God to to make people that that way without without a way to to change change it it , and and it would would make make it it harder to to condemn condemn people to hell if it it was was n't n't something something that that they willingly willingly chose chose . I can can feel feel morally morally superior superior to to a woman woman who who has has sex sex outside of of marriage and and say say she she 's 's going going to hell hell for her her choice choice . It It would would be be really really difficult difficult to to condemn condemn all all women women as being being sinners sinners , saying saying that that they they share share the the same gender gender as as Eve and therefore therefore , no no women women should should be be able able to to get get into into heaven heaven . The The more more extremist may may have have paranoid paranoid delusions that that go go far beyond beyond acceptance acceptance and and think think that that there is is a secret secret cabal cabal of of homosexuals homosexuals who who do do n't n't want want to to just just live live their their own lives lives without without homophobic laws and and moral moral condemnation condemnation of strangers strangers , but but rather rather that that they they actually actually want want to to make some some straight people gay gay , particularly younger younger children children . If you start start from from the the premise premise that gay gay people people are are evil evil , condemn condemn them them , and shun anyone anyone you know know who is is gay , then then your your little world will will consist consist of of people people who who are are thoroughly thoroughly straight straight while while gay gay people people will will avoid you you , hate you you , and and hide hide their sexuality sexuality from you you . To To these these extremists extremists , this this justifies their their thinking thinking that that gay gay people people are very very rare , only only a perverted perverted very very small small minority that that wants wants to to spread spread their condition condition , their their thinking , their their disease to innocent innocent youth youth . Then Then , when some some teenager teenager comes out out as as being gay gay within within their their small small , sheltered inner inner circle circle , they they conclude it it was was the work work of of gays MAKING MAKING the child child gay gay . They They assume assume a default default position of of straight straight and and choosing choosing to to be be gay gay is like like your child getting a haircut and and dying dying it it purple purple . Their ideal world world on on earth earth is is where where everyone is is straight straight and God - fearing fearing , and and so so any attempts attempts to to normalize normalize homosexuals homosexuals is seen as purely evil evil , the the work of of an an agenda that wants wants to to persecute persecute their their beliefs . It It helps helps that that if they feel like like they they are are being being persecuted for for their their belief that that homosexuality is is evil , they they feel feel akin akin to to Jesus Jesus , and and while while they they are are n't being being literal literal martyrs , getting getting people people opposing opposing their their beliefs makes makes them them feel like like they are are metaphorical metaphorical martyrs martyrs for God God .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "These These systems systems are are so so useful , that that many many governments governments do do n't n't want want to to be restricted restricted to to something something that that is is controlled controlled by by a foreign government government . For For example example , GPS is is a military military system system run run by by the the US Navy . They They could , if if they they wanted to to , shut shut it it off off or or degrade degrade it it . The Russians Russians were were n't n't happy happy with with relying on on a US US military military system system , given that that there there is is a lot lot of of disagreement disagreement between between Russia Russia and and America America , so so they they built their their own own ( GLONASS GLONASS ) . In In Europe Europe , the the EU EU government government were were concerned concerned that they they were were relying relying on on a foreign foreign military military system for for a lot lot of of commercial and and government government work . They They were were also also annoyed annoyed that that GPS GPS only only made a crude crude signal signal available for for the the public public and law law enforcement , but but the the military military got got a much much higher higher precision precision signal signal . So So , the EU EU government government decided decided to to build their their own own system system ( Galileo Galileo ) which which would would give give an an improved accuracy free free public public signal signal , and a premium premium signal signal ( with with paid subscription subscription ) which which would would give the the same same accuracy as as the the GPS GPS military military signal . It It would would also also be be optimized for for use in in Europe Europe . GPS GPS satellites do n't n't really really orbit orbit over over the Arctic region , so so GPS reception reception in in places places like like North Norway or or Northern Northern Sweden is is not not very very reliable reliable . The The Galileo Galileo satellites satellites are intended to to go go into into orbits orbits which which go go much much further further North North , but the the disadvantage disadvantage is that that you you need more more satellites satellites to cover the the increased amount of of land . Same Same sort of of thing thing with with IRNSS ( India India ) and and BeiDou BeiDou ( China ) . In In general , all all these these systems systems you you broadly broadly the the same technology but but on on slightly slightly different different frequencies frequencies . This This means means your your receiver receiver needs to to have have an an antenna antenna and and circuits circuits capable capable of receiving receiving all all the the different different systems . Dual Dual system system GPS GPS / GLONASS GLONASS receivers receivers have been been available available for for a while while - they they were were n't n't terribly terribly popular popular initially initially because because the the GLONASS GLONASS system system has has been very very unreliable with with satellites satellites dying or or malfunctioning malfunctioning and not not being replaced replaced . However However , the Russians Russians have repaired repaired and and updated updated their their GLONASS GLONASS satellites satellites , and and it 's 's now now a good good quality quality modern system , so so most latest latest generation generation GPS GPS receivers receivers do actually receive receive the the GLONASS GLONASS signal signal as as well well . One One of of the the advantages advantages of of a receiver receiver which supports supports both both systems is is that that it is possible possible to get get a more more accurate accurate position position because because you you can can combine combine the the measurements measurements from from both systems systems when when the the receiver receiver does does the the final final position position calculation . The Galileo Galileo system system is is n't n't complete complete , in fact , it it is is n't n't really functional functional , as as it does does n't n't have enough satellites satellites to to work work 24/7 24/7 . However However , many many new new GPS receivers receivers are are \" Galileo Galileo ready ready \" which which means that they they have have the the antenna and and circuits circuits in place place , but but the the firmware firmware to process process the the signals signals has has n't n't been been finalized . Once Once enough satellites satellites are are up up and and working , the the manufacturer of the receiver receiver will will be be able able to to test test their firmware , and and then once tested and working will be make make it available available for for download download .", "label": "hc3human"}

For For example example , if if you make two two trades trades in one one day with with your your broker - one one to buy buy a security security for $ 100 100 and one to sell sell it it for for $ 110 110 - rather rather then you you sending sending your your broker $ 100 100 and and them them sending sending you you $ 110 , the the transactions transactions are are \" netted netted \" - meaning meaning they they will will send send you you the \" net \" amount amount of of $ 10 10 ( $ 110 110 inflow - $ 100 100 outflow outflow ) .
