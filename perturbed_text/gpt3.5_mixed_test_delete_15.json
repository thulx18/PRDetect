One the best examples of this the minimum . four decades , trickle - downers on the right and the left repeated the claim that wages for workers kills jobs \u2014 despite the fact that evidence collected far back as David and Alan Kreuger 's 1994 minimum - wage study showed no indication that the decreases . Card won the Nobel Prize his work debunking those claims , but like Senator Joe Manchin still repeat the classic trickle - down argument that wage kills business as an excuse for rejecting a bill to raise federal minimum wage to $ 15 . But it 's not just the : Economists and politicians promote unfounded and debunked economic claims all the time , with zero . Bergin , an investigative financial journalist for Reuters , recently published a titled \" Free Lunch Thinking : How Economics the Economy \" cataloging eight of the most frequently parroted wrong assumptions . In the episode of \" Pitchfork Economics , \" Bergin those erroneous but popular claims , ranging from the minimum wage job - killing myth to the that regulations and taxes thwart growth to the bipartisan belief that sin taxes discourage like smoking . These assumptions benefit the wealthiest members of society and disadvantage everyday people For example , Bergin says the concept that the rewards corporate executives by paying them what they 're worth for value bring company \" has illustrated some of the failings of for ordinary people over the past 20 or 30 years . \" Apologists love to claim that high CEO and executive pay , including huge bonuses and stock options , encourage a quality of management . But in terms of measurable impact , the only real payout we 've seen is over the last few decades , \" average have pretty stagnated real terms , but the pay for the people at the peak the corporate pyramid has just exploded , \" Bergin said . That 's not an overstatement . A 2021 study that CEO compensation has risen 1,322 % since 1978 , while worker over that same time only increased by 18 % . The average American CEO now more than times what the typical American worker makes . explanation that big business used for increasing CEO executive pay was something \" agency theory , \" which Bergin said is the idea that \" if you could managers and them like shareholders , then would more represent the of said shareholders . \" The with CEOs behaving as shareholders The Bureau Economic Research that 1980 , stock options were rarely included in CEO compensation . When they were a part of the compensation package , average stock options rarely even 20 % of the total direct pay for CEOs . But , according to Lawrence Mischel the Institute , \" Stock - compensation comprises around 85 % of compensation . \" The problem with directing CEOs to behave shareholders , of course , that they 're motivated to drive up share value above all else , of ensuring a sustainable future for the company . That 's why we a record - breaking $ 850 billion in buybacks last year , turning the better part of a trillion dollars in corporate profit over shareholders ( including and executives ) with no strings attached . And it 's why many corporate boards do see a problem with price - gouging during a pandemic , using as an excuse to jack up prices on consumers in order to plump up the bottom line . So , no \u2014 compensating CEOs with stock n't increase their efficiency by making them self - actors the way the classical economic models . Instead , encourages the looting corporate stability and the satisfaction in exchange for a quick buck . Even though fallacies like these have been debunked a growing mountain to the contrary , they continue to spread it 's in the economists to stay the good graces of the wealthy Americans sign their paychecks , endow their universities , and their studies and academic . And because the experts continue to them , these harmful ideas continue to shape every of our economy , the paychecks of millions of - earning Americans and the paychecks of the highest . But as we 've seen the Fight for $ 15 , it 's for a good idea to break these truisms and win popular .

You also have to be a people - person \u2014 I spend most of my time interacting with guests , helping find their way around the city , or them safe at all - night pub . But , despite the challenges , I would n't trade it for any other job world . I arrived at a party , I was a bit nervous . The hostel was located in a - heavy city , so I n't sure if I 'd fit in . But once I settled in and talking to the other staff members , I felt at home . Everyone was really friendly and welcoming , made the transition to my new job much easier . The daily tasks in a hostel can vary , but one of my primary jobs is keeping the rooms clean . I constantly changing beds , laundry , and scrubbing . It 's a never - ending battle against dirt grime , but it 's a battle that I 'm winning ! Once the rooms are cleaned , I move on to organizing activities and events . I 'm often in charge of booking excursions , planning pub crawls , and creating promotional materials . It 's a lot of work , I always feel rewarded when I see guests enjoying themselves . Most of the people who work in party hostels are between the ages 18 and 30 , so all tend to get along really well . We 're all , passionate people who have chosen to do something different with our lives . We each have our unique stories and experiences , which makes the workplace so interesting and dynamic . And , of course , we love having a good time ! Working in a party hostel means that I 'm always surrounded by people are fun , adventurous , want to make of every day . The difficult part of working in a hostel is trying to manage difficult guests . Because the hostel is designed to cater to a younger , more party - focused crowd , there can some challenging . We 've had to deal people who are intoxicated , unruly , or disrespectful . But , the majority of the time , our guests are wonderful people who we 've had some great conversations with . In the end , my experience working in a party hostel has been overwhelmingly positive . I 've met some amazing , created some lasting memories , had the privilege of staying in some incredible places . And , I 'm also earning some money my travels and saving a lot on accommodation . I would n't trade my experience for anything , and I to keep exploring and growing through this incredible journey .", "label": "machine"}

Crowds fill the gyms , the stakes are , pressure moments crop up and brand of basketball Christmas time evolves into something different than in the weeks leading up to it . Here \u2019s a look back at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament . Biggest story : Robert Smith goodbye with a title relationship between Simeon and Pontiac has been well documented . So it was only fitting that coach Robert Smith , the figure in keeping Simeon Pontiac all these , even through the Derrick Rose and Jabari , was given a warm and sendoff from the Pontiac . More for Smith , his Wolverines impress and look like the No . 1 team the state . a calming influence the in his hands , while Miles and Wesley Rubin continue provide a presence at both of the , and Sam , the transfer , is settling in and becoming more and more impactful . Simeon took business and won yet another Pontiac title in Smith \u2019s final year on bench . Biggest surprise : Pontiac advances to quarterfinals This n\u2019t resonate much with the majority of Chicago high school basketball fans , especially ones not connected the Holiday Tournament whatsoever . But Pontiac winning a game in its own tournament , particularly in a winner \u2019s bracket game , is a big deal . Plain and simple : it \u2019s rare . Pontiac knocked off West Aurora - 55 the opening night getting throttled both Simeon and New . that first - round win was a feel - good story for the fans of Pontiac something those players will remember forever . over West Aurora was the first time Pontiac advanced on in championship bracket since . [[ ]] Simeon \u2019s acknowledges the crowd the Wolverines Benet win the Pontiac Holiday Tournament . Cunningham / For Sun - Times Player of the tournament : Benet \u2019s Brayden Fagbemi [[ ]] There were bigger names and higher profile players in this \u2013 \u2013 even on his own \u2013 \u2013 . But was n\u2019t a player who grabbed attention of fans or who more to his team \u2019s success than this steady , - for - the - moment guard . While Fagbemi was as of the City / Suburban Hoops Report \u2019s projected \u201c \u201d in preseason , no one knew the Johns Hopkins recruit . He was a little - point guard off the bench a year ago . But he blossomed in the offseason and was brilliant in Pontiac . Fagbemi for 15 points , seven seven rebounds in win over Oak Park . He handled the relentless pressure and traps thrown his against Bloom and Joliet West , turning the ball over just four times while playing all 32 minutes in each game . Along with Abusara , he spearheaded the comeback against Simeon before the Redwings fell the . Fagbemi was as poised as they come against relentless pressure , a floor general . He handed out 20 while averaging 12 a four - - one - to - turnover ratio . Best prospect : Joliet West \u2019s Jeremiah Fears [[ ]] an evaluation standpoint , there just was n\u2019t a better prospect in the gym Pontiac than the sophomore from Joliet West . He made sophomore mistakes . He still has to mature physically and learn how to pick his moments . But Fears , the younger brother of star Jeremy Fears , Jr. , the Michigan State recruit , has an easy , natural smoothness that screams next level . When you in his shooting capabilities \u2013 \u2013 Fears 9 of 17 from the arc \u2013 \u2013 you a young offensive force who you just high of a level will go over the next two . What we learned \u27a4 When Kaiden Space is healthy \u2013 \u2013 senior guard is currently out with an injury \u2013 \u2013 there are signed Division I prospects Simeon \u2019s starting five . But the starter , point guard Jalen Griffith , is proving to be the key cog in Robert Smith \u2019s No . 1 ranked team . Griffith , who was named the A.C. Award winner for , leadership , was instrumental in delivering key moments . Griffith Simeon in scoring 15 points a game while playing with efficiency . These numbers eye - opening when you consider Griffith is a 5 - 9 point guard : 16 24 ( % ) from inside arc and 8 of 12 ( 67 % ) beyond . \u27a4 They n\u2019t the finish in the top . But the team that \u2019s than I thought it would be after watching play at Pontiac is Bloom . Coach Dante Maddox has so much rangy and length disruptive with , and that starts with the backcourt Raeshom Harris and Brown . Bloom , which three games and finished fifth at Pontiac , has lost to three teams this season ranked in the top 10 and who are a combined 46 - 4 on the . And lost to those teams \u2013 \u2013 Benet , Hillcrest and Brother Rice \u2013 \u2013 by a combined 13 . \u27a4 Trier continues be a resilient , physical team that \u2019s going to be an awfully tough out state time . That grit starts with senior Feigen , a known shooter averaged 22 points in games Pontiac . \u27a4 Will straight wins and a consolation championship into an Oak Park team came into Pontiac ? The Huskies had lost four straight . But after falling to Benet for its fifth - loss in the first round , Oak Park went on beat Plainfield North , Peoria succession to leave Pontiac on a positive note . \u27a4 The Tournament , by all accounts , the measuring stick for holiday tournaments across the state . This \u2019s tournament did n\u2019t disappoint . But it had less depth than previous . shot The sendoff was n\u2019t the only one at Pontiac . The tournament also said farewell longtime tournament manager Jim Drengwitz , who has led this tournament for the past 23 years . Although always behind the scenes , Drengwitz has been an instrumental part of what has continued to make Pontiac a special place to be for three days each December . He \u2019s such omnipresent voice for a long time at Pontiac that will undoubtedly be missed .

What does likely Apple release augmented - reality / - reality glasses , rumored be coming in 2023 an OS called xrOS . While I 'm always excited see innovations companies like Apple have in store , I have some serious concerns about betting on AR / VR glasses as a market . We 've already seen some attempts in this space , including Microsoft and Magic Leap . They have not exactly taken world by storm . When was the last time you anyone you know saw someone using those devices at places of work or out in the wild ? Glass from , I think it 's safe to say , was a failure . And Snapchat Spectacles even for sale to the general public , the company 's website says , only developers . Then there are VR products like Oculus from Meta and competitors from Valve , Sony , and HP . These made inroads with gamers , but years after were introduced , they still a small fraction of the enormous video - gaming market . [[ ]] As for other uses ? have , far , seen none , despite Mark Zuckerberg 's die - hard belief metaverse is the future of our lives work meetings and whatnot . There is a belief , however , that \u2014 which n't first market \u2014 can enter a space and succeed no one has before . When it comes to this market , I 'm more than a little skeptical . First and foremost , the battery life of an AR device is a major . AR , Google Glass and Spectacles envisioned it , is meant to be worn long periods of time and digital imagery and functions the world . While Apple has not released this front ( or any ) , it seems that device in this category will work for extended periods without recharging . Plus , despite all ways that Apple is a leader in elegant hardware design , life not really its strong point . ( In the world of , for example , some devices last as long as two weeks , reviewers found , while an Apple Watch , in experience , gives a user two or three days . ) There also question of comfort . Glasses are the most comfortable to wear for extended of time . when you add the weight and bulk for AR and VR , eyewear like this become more uncomfortable to wear . This is not to mention the fact that many people simply do like wearing glasses all , which will limit the market these products . Price is another issue . Microsoft 's HoloLens costs between $ 3,500 $ 5,200 . Apple 's device is expected to be in the $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 price range , even though Apple is known for selling premium devices premium price tags . even on low end , that 's a significant investment for a product that will do far less than a comparably priced MacBook or iPad . Beyond the practical concerns battery life , comfort , and price , there 's the fundamental issue of lack of a compelling AR or VR glasses .

All that is to say , Apple 's AR / VR project may be interesting to die - hard Apple fans tech enthusiasts who buy into Apple 's marketing machine and wait lines to products on day one , I do n't believe it 's company 's next big thing . Until Apple , or any other company , can demonstrate a compelling reason large numbers of people to want to wear AR around , or add VR to quiver of home - entertainment options , I fear that the tech will struggle gain widespread adoption .

{"text": "You do n't need to know about people 's disabilities to your meetings more accessible to . An estimated one in four adults in the US lives with a disability(Opens in a new window ) , according to the CDC , and many of those disabilities are invisible . , people have temporary or situational disabilities . Being in a noisy environment can situationally affect a person 's hearing , for example , so that they need closed captioning to follow in a meeting . , you 'll have more inclusive and more productive meetings you increase people 's comfort ability to participate , even if they do n't have a disability . There are ways to make meetings more comfortable for , people who do n't speak English as a language , others . While having the right video software and goes a long way to making meetings more accessible , they 're only things you need to consider . Your organizational plays a role . So does way which participants speak , act , and interact . With that in mind , 's some guidance for making meetings accessible . I focus more on virtual meetings than in - person because they are by their very nature more and more easily accessible , as you 'll see . 1 . Create a Culture of Speaking Up The most important step you your can do to make more accessible is to create a culture where people feel comfortable speaking up . No matter how hard you try to make meetings inclusive and accessible , it 's to all the time . But if meetings are safe spaces people can ask for what they when they need , you 'll be in ideal position to adjustments and provide access to people as needed . If a participant feels comfortable saying or typing into the chat , \" I ca n't see your screen - share clearly . zoom in please ? \" or \" Your ceiling in the video is causing me problems . Would you please your camera angle or blur your background ? \" then everyone is in a better position to succeed . 2 . Provide an Agenda and Materials in Advance Every meeting needs to have a clear agenda . For recurring meetings , the agenda may be baked into name of the meeting ( weekly check - in , for example ) but really , it helps if they know advance what the is going cover . an agenda makes everything clear , and it helps know what they need to do to . If someone with a disability thinks they are going to a passive attendee in a meeting and then called on the spot participate , they may not be adequately set to do . Similarly , provide a of any materials , such as presentations , before meetings \u2014 or least hand them out right at the start . When you give people a copy of your presentation , they can use screen readers on them , zoom in as needed , follow along at their own , make notes on a local copy , not their place or get if a technological glitch interrupts the real - presentation . 3 . Add Alt Text to Images in Before you circulate meeting materials ( which you 'll do before the meeting now ) , make sure alt text for all important images . Alt text allows people who ca see the image , whether because of disability or technical problems , to get a brief description of what they 're missing . For , if you include a financial chart , the alt text should briefly summarize what 're trying to highlight , \" Chart showing 50 % from to June 2022 . \" ( Credit : PCMag ) In meeting software , you may be able to add text some , like those chat . In those cases the presenter can give a brief verbal description if the image is important to the meeting , or someone can type into the chat a short description : \" Alt text : a room on fire and a dog sitting a chair saying , ' This fine . ' \" 4 . Make Some of the Meeting Asynchronous Sending slides or meeting materials before a meeting is one way to make of the meeting asynchronous ( meaning people are not interacting in real time ) . When meetings have an asynchronous , you significantly in meetings and give an opportunity to process information , , and brainstorm discussing it live . People who are introverted , do n't have a firm command the language , have speech impediments , and others find it helpful to come to meetings having already done some the work that the meeting seeks accomplish . 5 . Record the Call For important meetings , large meetings , and webinars , record the call make the video available to afterward . Having a video means your meeting is now accessible anyone could n't attend . It also lets people important parts of the meeting , take notes , and clarify anything they did n't understand the first time . People video also slow down or speed up the playback , turn closed captioning ( many video tools include them \u2014 more that in a moment ) , and sometimes even download a of . 6 . Enable Closed Captioning biggest players in video conferencing \u2014 including Zoom Meetings , Google Meet , Microsoft Teams \u2014 all have an option to enable , machine - generated closed captioning during a meeting . , it 's Live Captions(Opens in a new window ) , and it includes a setting for participants to have their into one of 34 languages ( counting several dialects of English among them ) . Live Captions is part of Windows 's accessibility - first approach . Meet likewise transcribe a variety of languages and between them . ( Credit : PCMag ) Auto - generated always fall short , however , so Teams now has an for you to a professional stenographer to transcribe meetings in real time and have the more accurate captioning appear to \u2014 's called CART captions(Opens in a new window ) , you have to provide your stenographer . 7 . Make Accessibility Features Opt - Out , Not Opt - In A step that many people overlook virtual meetings is getting to know the software they use . ( It was a prime reason so many Zoom bombings happened early in pandemic ; few people knew what options they had make secure . Zoom was culpable , too and should have made more prominent . ) As you explore your software and learn what accessibility features exist , see ones can enable permanently so that they 're on by default . This way , accessibility become opt - out for in meetings , not - in . 8 . Brush Best for Before presenting materials in a virtual meeting , review best practices for creating and presenting slideshows(Opens in a new window ) because they improve accessibility , too . For example , one best practice for slideshows is to set much bigger than you might expect : 40pt for in - person meetings and at least 24pt for virtual meetings . Making the font that big forces you to keep the text on the page to a minimum , which is another best practice . Do n't clutter your slides . Always show the written name of important , places , and people ( including their titles ) that you . Not everyone knows who Gary is , some people might hear \" Cary . \" Write it down . If you Microsoft Teams , look using the feature PowerPoint , allows activate a screen on PowerPoint presentations ; screen readers do n't work on presentations shown screen sharing . You should still make a copy of the presentation available to meeting participants either the meeting or at the very start of it , using PowerPoint Live is helpful if someone did n't receive it . 9 . Presenters : Enable Center Your Face [[ ]] are during a meeting , enable video and center your face . Make sure your is up the majority of screen . That way , people can see your lips as you talk and your facial expressions , both of which can help people understand what 're saying . The exception is if you 're sign language while presenting , in which case back away from the camera enough to show yourself from at least the torso up . [[ ]] ( Credit : Getty ) Presenters should have cameras on while speaking . As to whether other enable their cameras , I believe it a personal choice . Presenters and meeting hosts typically find it useful see the audience 's faces during a meeting because it gives them feedback \u2014 not only if the meeting is engaging and people are understanding the material , also if something goes awry . If a presenter 's suddenly cuts out , for example , the muted may cup a hand around their ear or wave to there 's a problem . [[ ]] 10 . Speak , Slow Down , and Repeat Important Information Speak clearly and remind yourself to from time to time during meetings . People will able to hear you better and closed be more . Also , important information in case people it first time . This advice is applicable in any kind of business situation , and it 's especially relevant in virtual meetings where technology hiccups and other can impede the flow conversation . 11 . Use Headphones a Mic a headset and microphone is a standard tip for video calls , but also matters for accessibility . headphones eliminate any chance of feedback , and the microphone makes it easier to your voice . A microphone into a headset is , an inexpensive set of headphones with an inline is better than nothing . Bluetooth devices are usually fine , but when they get old and start to , they may create static or sounds for other meeting participants , so be sure to ask for a thumbs - up if everyone can hear you clearly . 12 . or Neutralize Your Background ( Credit : ) A and chaotic background make it difficult people to focus . When you 're , make sure you either uncluttered and neutral space behind you , or enable a filter that blurs or blocks out your background . All major video conferencing software has this setting . 13 . Passive Participants : Mute Yourself Not muting microphone when you a passive participant in a meeting is but bad accessibility . Accidental coming from your can interrupt 's hearing and the quality of any captioning being . . Put Your Full Name and Pronouns in Profile Most meeting software lets you your name to your profile so that meeting can know you are . Make you fill out with your full name as you are known by your colleagues and your pronouns . Meeting has a separate field for adding pronouns . Your helps people identify you and including your pronouns helps refer to you . Clarifying pronouns also normalizes doing it , which can help other sharing their and a more environment . , you speak in a large meeting or in a meeting where not everyone knows you , your full clearly and slowly so people can hear it and know how to pronounce it . 15 . Breaks for Long Whenever a meeting is scheduled to run longer than 45 minutes or so , schedule breaks . Everyone appreciate them , but it especially for who are or were recently , pain , or are in a situation where sitting still for long periods of time is difficult therefore distracting . on meetings and remote , see our tips for working home and 5 for more productive meetings .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Laura : Right . Alex : Now you tell us . Gil : My prediction is that she will be Chesa Boudin , and \u2019ll realize this is the situation you have . Because , I mean , I \u2019ve been on campaigns \u2014 you promise all stuff , then you get in the office , like , holy crap , there are problems , obstacles , rules , things you can do , things you ca n\u2019t do , it \u2019s not as as giving a speech . I think the legacy of it will be that the D.A. get a lot more scrutiny going forward . But I some things have turned up in the polls that have been conducted here over the past few months , which is that people are conflating homelessness and disorder and mental illness on the streets with . The fact that we are statistically much safer from violent crime we \u2019ve ever been in recent history does matter as . I think the real that Democrats in California are responsible for and have to face is , why do so many people live on our streets ? To me , that \u2019s not a problem you solve with jails , that is what some people are proposing . It \u2019s a you have to with with care and . When you do the research here and look at what people Brooke Jenkins are proposing , it \u2019s really infuriating because it stuff does n\u2019t work . Most voters fell for this , and I think gon na be sorely disappointed . the question is gon na be what do we really do , and , again , there path forward that n\u2019t lead you to the very reforms that got Boudin crucified San Francisco . By the way , he did n\u2019t even do reforms . That was Jerry . That was Gavin Newsom . People act like Boudin did those reforms . I was a of . I had more do with them than Boudin did . was Venezuela or somewhere . And the voters voted for things . We supported these things . So what was scary to is you could really channel kind of public anger at somebody who had nothing to do with it . But again , he was n\u2019t a great politician . He was honest . Another of Chesa Boudin \u2019s recall : Do n\u2019t be too honest . Kind of lie . It \u2019s working for Jenkins . She lying her way victory today . Alex : All right . , . If you \u2019re listening , great advice for any politicians listening home . Gil : They already know . Alex : Gil , thank you so for that edifying conversation . Gil : Thank you . Laura : After the break , we \u2019ll look into who was behind Boudin \u2019s recall . backers of the recall campaign wanted him out . But they may have had a bigger project too . Laura : We \u2019ve been talking about the way crime in San Francisco appeared the media and how stories played with voters and with other Democrats . this also a about a few individuals who invested heavily in removing Boudin from his position . recall campaign $ 7 million , more double the amount \u2019s supporters raised . One Boudin \u2019s earliest and most vocal opponents was the Silicon Valley investor David O. Sacks . He called Boudin \u201c the killer D.A. \u201d and told The Kelly Show he thought Boudin was to blame for \u201c chaos and lawlessness \u201d San Francisco . At one point in the campaign , nearly one - third of all donations against Boudin came from him . We with Jacob Silverman about David O. Sacks in the recall and his larger political agenda . Jacob , thanks for joining us . Jacob Silverman : Thanks having me . Glad to be here . [[ ]] Laura : David Sacks is a figure . He \u2019s connected to a lot of other powerful figures in Valley who are also increasingly politically active . Can you tell us a bit about ? Jacob : Sure . now I you \u2019d call him a member PayPal Mafia , as \u2019s pretty widely known . Laura : OK , and remind us : What the PayPal Mafia ? : \u2019s basically the core early employees of \u2014 were all \u2014 and most well known of whom Elon Musk , Peter , and , as I argue , David Sacks . And \u2019ve like YouTube and others that came out there and the whole and Thiel empires . They all gone on mostly to huge amounts of wealth and a lot of influence in the Valley . But Sacks \u2019s association with these folks goes back to Stanford the early \u2019 90s , where he Thiel , Keith Rabois , and some other folks who be PayPal employees at . A lot of them wrote for on Stanford Review , which was the conservative publication Thiel founded . Basically it was an era where they were doing a lot of same culture warring that we see today , at the time , what they were about was issues of multiculturalism \u2014 that was the big bogeyman , that word specifically \u2014 and diversity in general . If you look at their writings then and battles they having then compared to now , \u2019s a lot the same issues , with a of same crude . Laura : Right . way I knew of Sacks from that was that was actually the co - author a book with Peter Thiel called The Diversity . And just for our listeners , were n\u2019t advocating for diversity . This was n\u2019t like a group of people who were to like , \u201c Oh , there \u2019s like rape on campus . This is something we should something . \u201d They were backlash to people who were making arguments . : much so . They were of conservative counterreaction or backlash at Stanford that was , in part , were sick of hearing about the \u2019 60s their professors . It was early \u2019 90s , Clinton era . It was just its turn , I suppose , for counterrevolution , and they doing things like testing the bounds of free speech yelling at people with bigoted slurs stuff like that . There was an issue of the Stanford Review called \u201c The Rape Issue . \u201d in general there was this disgust with what they saw around them which was lots efforts diversity inclusion . There would be ethnic affinity halls on campus , a lot of cultural - based campus organizations , things that . They thought everything was divided among racial lines and it was sort like , \u201c Oh , anti - racists have become the racists \u201d thing that you hear now . Laura : It \u2019s funny because the that we know of these figures now is that they are investors , CEOs . several successful companies , most notably PayPal . David O. Sacks was the CEO of Zenefits , which kind of blew up in a crazy way a few years ago . They \u2019re as business figures , but they were from the beginning , and they continue politically active . There \u2019s of a straight line between those campus cultural war and what David Sacks has been doing in San Francisco . Jacob : some of the comments , especially about rape Diversity Myth appeared , they disavowed them . They said , \u201c Oh , those just impetuous thoughts of my youth . \u201d But look , we could argue about whether they still believe these things , but they political animals from the beginning and they were very preternaturally aware of how to operate within political milieus . And so Sacks were - writers from an early age in college . They wrote pieces for Wall Journal and National Review and other political publications . Their sponsored by the Independent Institute , which was a libertarian think tank . They were well connected from the beginning , and I \u2019d say that the business has been pretty good for both of them . And of course PayPal was the core . But the politics have always been there . I think what you see more in recent years is that the ideology probably has been pretty , but in terms of inserting himself into the public sphere having a more perhaps coherent though still murky , I \u2019d say , political program , and being to donate money and be loud about it \u2014 that \u2019s where Sacks is at now and where things have changed . Thiel is a little bit of a figure , but he \u2019s certainly been a force years politically . Alex : the one hand , anytime you look into the history of reaction and the history of the in this country , it \u2019s dispiriting how reliably it can traced back to the hangups of on elite college campuses . We just ca get away from that . [[ ]] Jacob : It \u2019s . From Buckley to Thiel . Alex : It \u2019s a story that itself over and over again . But from what you \u2019re describing , it seems like there was this little bit these guys making their money and then now in environment , for a variety of reasons , deciding to let the mask slip , and being apolitical for a while , reverting back to the reactionary politics were forged in being much open about pursuing them . Jacob : Yeah . I think you certainly saw that earlier with Thiel and his support of Trump his writings basically against democracy and women \u2019s suffrage . Someone like Sacks to Hilary Clinton and some mainstream Democrats , what basically has happened in last few , that they \u2019ve given up on , I \u2019d argue , democratic governance , probably with a big D and small d. Francisco the core of that \u2014 the emblem of everything that \u2019s failed in governments America . do n\u2019t necessarily have a positive economic or policy program , but they are willing to spend a lot of money on recalls and on reactionary figures . So that \u2019s what us to today is that Sacks and him in particular : Every major recall that \u2019s happened either in Bay Area or recall attempt , or statewide , \u2019s put money into all of those . Alex : much money are we talking for Sacks this one recall Boudin ? Jacob : It \u2019s mid - to - high five figures . There are other like William Oberndorf , who is a billionaire , who in more . But I would argue two things . , you know , as actually said an interview , you do n\u2019t always know where the money is going with some of these . Sacks certainly was in terms of the sheer dollar - to - dollar also the role he of tech people into this and being a propagandizer against Boudin . Laura : Why do you think he focused on Boudin so much ? I mean , he wrote this piece calling him \u201c killer \u201d on Medium . Why Boudin ? Why pick that fight ? Jacob : I think he cares about San Francisco because he lives there and one of his at least three mansions is . He \u2019s been there a long time . I think he is just draconian law and , , his politics , does n\u2019t like what he sees from the justice reform movement . I \u2019ve seen interviews where he \u2019s barely paid lip service to , like , \u201c Oh , people should n\u2019t be arrested for smoking weed , \u201d or something like that . But he is part of this trend , I say , legally and , to criminalize and to see homelessness as synonymous with , even though a lot of homeless people are crime victims . So Boudin was a ripe target . They had some success with the board recall , which put money into . The Newsom recall did not work , but put money into too . He \u2019s willing to take his , I think Boudin was a good target this alliance of billionaire developers people disgusted with what they saw . his own , he thinks that Boudin was basically sympathetic to criminals than to victims . He \u2019s pretty unequivocal about . Alex : Something I find interesting this political moment \u2014 I have feeling that they are meddling in San Francisco because they think of it as their fiefdom to an extent and they be able to what \u2019s going on there \u2014 but these the sorts of people , with these backgrounds , who for much of my adult life we would have described as being libertarian . They would have been promoting anti - government , John Galt - y , Randian libertarianism \u2014 that was the of Silicon giving for so many . But it the new style pretty straight law - - order authoritarianism . I would say that seems like a shift , I do n\u2019t know how much of a it actually turned out to be . Jacob : Yeah , I think there a couple things going on . One just day - to - day , what they see \u2014 like , \u201c Look , there are a lot of homeless people around Twitter and open - air drug use . \u201d But I think of these people have realized it does n\u2019t take necessarily a lot of money to buy an election . Like himself , he gave $ 1 million to J.D. , to his , but he can afford . The stuff in San Francisco , he has probably donated in hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively , I would think , you can get something for your money there , and yeah , I think in the end they also just not interested in noncarceral to stuff . Alex : You enough , your attitude just becomes , \u201c I can pay to make this thing that I do n\u2019t like go away . \u201d Jacob : Yeah . Laura : A lot of his contributions have been focused in California . Do that the recall of Boudin and the success that that campaign had heralds more like this a national level ? What do you think is for Sacks and the group like - activists ? : I do . I a couple things are to happen . One , I ended article with a quote him saying , \u201c This model needs to be replicated across the . \u201d Laura : \u2019s a direct quote . Jacob : Yeah . I think [ it ] somewhat depends on their commitment . Thiel has recently said \u201c \u2019re a little too negative . We do n\u2019t a positive program . \u201d Big surprise , they need that . They need some positive program . But they seem to like DeSantis more respectable alternative to Trumpism . During the elections or as being counted , basically posted some stuff about DeSantis , \u201c Proud of reelection . It \u2019s time for DeSantis in . \u201d I think \u2026 what you na see is both an attempt to roll back criminal reform , recall who they just by using their money , and then [ ] their crew . I mean , some of them , like Oz , who they \u2019ve raised money for , Masters \u2014 Laura : Another Thiel co - author . Jacob : Yeah , another Thiel .

Instead , Monday Night Football ended in a maelstrom , frustration and - yard . We watched as two teams locked arms in a cocoon humanity around Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin , was receiving CPR compressions colliding with Cincinnati Bengals wideout Higgins and then falling unconscious in front of a national television audience . Nearby , players and staffers cried and held each other . Others pulled at their jerseys clothing , or simply put their face their hands and melted . In a that has come to stretch the boundaries of what we accept as part of gladiator sport , this moment was something different anything we seen the social age the NFL . The veneer of facade way , exposing limitless vulnerability and a reality that has stalked league forever : There is a line . A brutal , awful line . And of it was every bit as horrific as we presumed it would be . As witnesses , that \u2019s what Monday night represented to us . Something different . A significant inflection point for the NFL , when all the talk about players putting their lives on the suddenly coalesced into a collective that wo soon be forgotten . One that underscored we \u2019ve learned in so many many decades : That this vicious form of entertainment , every hit carries an inherent danger of changing someone \u2019s life forever . Or ending it altogether . We absorbed that Monday night . The brutal , awful line that finally so clear that someone involved \u2014 nearly everyone \u2014 understood no game should be unstoppable . Not for our entertainment . Not ratings and commercial sponsors . Not for the trivialities of sports betting and fantasy football . even for the long - tradeoff that we been long , that risking limb is simply an extension a football . Story The ' Siran Neal ( 33 ) and Nyheim as medical attend to teammate Hamlin Monday night . ( AP Photo / Jeff Dean ) We \u2019ve always known there is such a thing as , even in the NFL . What we did n\u2019t know what it would look like how it would make us feel . When we wake up , we n\u2019t be to say that . Instead , know that it feels like losing a sense of invincibility , resilience and control . Fans will know it feels like staring at an image and begging for a player to move , anything that returns the moment back to the warped relief of the phrase \u201c he has feeling in his extremities . \u201d Perhaps most important , the NFL will know what \u2019s like to have every of the simply refuse to respond in face of a nightmare . The league got a good look at players who were never going to again that night . Coaches who were never going to coach . Fans and journalists who \u2014 for the most part \u2014 refused to engage rationalizations about what a cancellation could mean for logistics or playoff implications . For , maybe first time since the NFL shut down briefly the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , something else had to be more important the product . That something was safety Damar and the well - of everyone around him . If that was n\u2019t more important than finishing a prime - time football game , it would the criticism of everyone framed the as a money machine . This is why we scoffed when ESPN broadcast suggested play would go on after a 5 - minute warmup . Nothing about that made sense . The grief and backlash after hearing it \u2014 everything about that made sense . The NFL has knowing that suggestion came from , but it did n\u2019t end up the from nowhere . a league reputation dogged by skeptics and conspiracy theorists , the moment will never truly be settled .

Cooper ) As former Steelers safety Ryan Clark framed it ESPN on Monday night , \u201c For over grown adult men , their lives have on pads understood the risk you take every time you do it , to be , be tears , be gathered in prayer , that tells you how significant this moment was . \u2026 \" In , if the NFL cares about the players , this the time I believe the NFL truly had to care about the \u2019 emotional and mental as well . This is first time we got to watch those emotions , we to watch that type of thought process right in of us . \u201d The unfolding of this long seemed . as we , the cost to learn it was as awful as it was .

{"text": "OpenAI logo screen with ChatGPT website on mobile seen in illustration in , , on , 2022 . Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images You may have heard the recent buzz around ChatGPT , an artificial intelligence chatbot that was released to the public at the end of November . I 've about people using the service write their school essays I as to how could help me in my life . The technology was developed OpenAI , a research backed Microsoft and others . ChatGPT automatically generates based on in creative way . It can even out a conversation that feels pretty close you 'd have with a human being . ChatGPT homepage . This got me wondering is ChatGPT smart enough to how we find information online ? Could it someday replace and other search engines ? Some Google employees are certainly about the possibility , a company all - last week , CNBC 's Elias reported , employees recently execs if an AI - chatbot like ChatGPT a \" missed opportunity \" for the company . Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Jeff Dean , the long - time head Google 's AI division , responded by saying that the company similar capabilities , but that the cost if something goes wrong would greater because people to trust the answers they get from Google . Morgan published a report on the topic Monday , Dec. 12 examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google . Brian Nowak , the bank 's lead analyst on , wrote could take market \" disrupt Google 's position as the entry point for people on the Internet . \" However , Nowak said the firm is still in Google 's position because the is continuing to improve search , and creating behavioral change a huge hurdle -- a lot of internet users use Google a habit . , is \" building similar natural models such as LaMDA \" could find their way into new products . For now , OpenAI 's creators are cautious about making any big claims . Generally speaking , the more users employ ChatGPT , the it gets . But it has a lot to learn . OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a tweet on Dec. 10 that ChatGPT is \" incredibly limited \" and \" it 's a mistake to be relying on it for anything now . \" Either way , I wanted to how well the chatbot would as an alternative to Google 's engine . Instead of my questions throughout the day , I asked ChatGPT . Here are some of the I asked and how ChatGPT responded compared with Google . ChatGPT vs. It 's easy to sign for ChatGPT \u2014 all you need is an email address . Once 've registered , the webpage is very simple to navigate . There 's an area where your results populate and a text box where you 'll type your inquiries . OpenAI says to put in a statement for the best possible result . I recently purchased second Fiddle Leaf Fern plant for my because the first one died . Now the one is dying just a few . I normally would asked Google what to do . Instead , I asked ChatGPT . \" How I keep my Fiddle Leaf Fern plant ? \" Zoom Icon Arrows pointing The results lined up with the I received from the plant company , Easy Plant , which is where I new Fiddle Leaf Fern . I liked that I did n't have to to various different websites like I would have if I 'd Googled this . When I Googled the same question , the top result me detailed instructions in an article that included pop - up and a information than I , like links to buy new soil . Winner : ChatGPT . Next , I tried something where more shopping links would actually been beneficial . I still trying to find a all 8 nights for , I decided to ask ChatGPT for some . Icon Arrows outwards [[ ]] I did n't give it any information about my , besides the fact the gifts were for Hanukkah . The chatbot assumed that my husband is kosher and that he 's into tech and watches . The latter is n't wrong , but it 's not the answers I was for . When I Googled this question I got access to of articles with different gift ideas and links to websites . For I got ads to Lululemon and Bombas , which are both companies I 've used to buy before . in this case , Google used personalized knowledge of me to find more results from around the web . Winner : Google , I to ask ChatGPT a question with higher . \" Is it safe to Benadryl while pregnant ? \" I am currently expecting my first child , and I know that taking Benadryl is safe in on information I received from my doctor . Still , I to see what the chatbot would say . Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards I appreciated gave me the correct answer , while also noting the importance of consulting a doctor taking any medications pregnancy . When I Googled same medical question , the results were the . At quick glance , one article from TheBump.com quoted a saying \" Generally , it 's safe to take Benadryl in the first . \" While other results said similar information to what I on ChatGPT , without explicit warning to discuss with my healthcare provider ( unless clicking into a specific link ) . Winner : ChatGPT Could it replace me ? One of the claims ( or concerns ) around ChatGPT \u2014 and artificial intelligence in general \u2014 is it will replace human workers . I to see if ChatGPT write this article for me . The results were pretty astonishing . Here 's what the chatbot said after I told it to \" write an article about whether or not ChatGPT is a good to Google as a search engine . \" a large language model trained by , I am not capable of research or browsing internet to gather on ChatGPT or other search engines . I am only able to information based on what I have been trained on , which limited to the knowledge was available up until my training cutoff date 2021 . With that being said , it is worth considering the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT as a search engine compared other options , such as Google . One potential advantage using ChatGPT as a search is that it is able provide more and conversational results . Because ChatGPT is a language model , it is able to understand and to natural language queries , allowing users ask questions in a intuitive and human - like way . This can make the search more and interactive , and may especially useful for users have specific or complex information needs . On the hand , there are also limitations to using ChatGPT as a search engine . Because it is a large language model and not a traditional search engine , ChatGPT may not have to the same breadth and depth of information as other search engines . This means that it may not be able to provide as comprehensive - to - date results , and may not as effective for certain types of searches , such as those that require a large amount of data or real - time information . In conclusion , whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google as a engine will depend on the specific and preferences of the user . It may be a useful option for who value a more and conversational search , but it may not be comprehensive or effective for certain types searches . , the decision to use ChatGPT or another will depend on the individual user 's and preferences . What impressed me most about ChatGPT 's is that it was subjective and explained limitations . The verdict ChatGPT 's value really lies in its ability to explain complicated as if you were to a human , and to do simple writing . example , I asked ChatGPT to explain concepts like market and internet me , the responses were as if I was talking to an expert on matter . Unlike the on , I did n't to filter through unnecessary . I also asked it to a letter to my landlord asking for an end to my lease , and I be happy sending results to my , almost word for word . On the other hand , Google knows about us and the results to our interests . Google also as a gateway to internet , leading to a plethora different websites with more information one possibly digest . That 's helpful if you want a range of voices , or if there 's no simple answer to your question -- you 're looking for gift suggestions . Google is great for certain of questions where it scours web to provide a brief but right line . For instance , if you \" Apple stock ticker \" or \" Cheap flights to Aruba , \" it will show you a ticker chart with - to - the - minute price , or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly a dialog box that connects to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on chosen date . ChatGPT does not scan the internet for real - time information , and only been trained on data through , so 's totally useless on these kinds of . And sometimes , ChatGPT is strangely close yet totally wrong . My asked the lyrics to \" The Ballad of Dwight Fry \" by Alice Cooper . It somehow knew the song about a having a mental breakdown , but then returned invented lyrics about that subject , than the actual lyrics . Google nailed it . Google also incredibly reliable , thanks company 's and years of expertise . ChatGPT is in testing and goes down from time to . I definitely continue using Google for most my search queries now . But I 'm not happy with the , now I have a useful . And I ever need dash off an angry letter , ChatGPT could be a huge .", "label": "human"}

The ruling came because \u2014 stop me if you \u2019ve heard this one before \u2014 publishers Activision Blizzard opposed the , saying that a larger group of 88 should be included in the . It a textbook piece of union - busting that has also been tried at other Activision studios going through process unionisation . this case it has n\u2019t worked ; the NLRB \u2019s ruling today clears the path for the workers vote on a , disagreeing ( a detailed breakdown explaining work differs between each of departments , and how underpaid testers ) with Activision \u2019s claims that , \u201c we believe employee in Albany who works on Diablo should have a say this decision . \u201d The ruling concludes : on the above , I conclude the employees in the petitioned - for unit a community of interest . I have also considered the that exist among developers and compared to testers . Developers are organized in separate , but departments that ultimately report the head of the Diablo franchise . Developers have a diverse set skills , training , and duties , use these skills a complementary in a production process that significant amount contact and a high degree of functional . Compensation varies , but many terms and of do have overlap among the developers . Comparing the developers \u2019 community of interest to that of the testers I find that interests of the testers outweigh the similarities exist with the developers . As noted , the testers participate in the same game development process includes significant contact and functional integration . However , testers are separately organized in their own department and their supervisory hierarchy is entirely separate the Diablo franchise . Testers also have a set of skills and duties different the . Finally , testers paid less than developers . , the of interchange between testers and developers is extremely limited . For reasons I find any shared interests between testers and do not outweigh the separate interests make the petitioned - for unit an appropriate unit . The ruling instantly clears the path for an election , which will begin soon . Ballots will sent out on October 27 , with votes counted on 18 . A current employee the , though not one of the testers involved in the , told the Washington Post , \u201c It \u2019s about time . Our QA testers are some of most talented and skilled people our company and they are critically undervalued by corporate . I think that all games workers need a union , but QA is in need . \u201d Advertisement Update 10:00pm ET : Lulu Cheng Meservey , Activision \u2019s \u2018 executive vice president , corporate affairs and chief communications \u2019 , has responded to the on internal , writing : Hey all , heads up on something . It \u2019s a long one but wanna be thorough so for bearing me . afternoon the NLRB ( labor relations board ) that -20 QA ( quality assurance ) testers working Diablo in Albany will be eligible to form a union and the union wins be included in the bargaining unit . Where the company stands on that : respects the NLRB process , and fully supports the employees \u2019 right to choose how they want to be . Also has the view that people who closely together should be to decisions like that collectively - ie , we disagree that a handful of employees should get to decide for everyone else on the future of the entire - based Diablo team . We think a direct dialogue between company and employees is the most productive route . Examples : through direct dialogue we \u2019ve already converted contingent QA staff to full time , pay , , opened up access to the bonus program , and offered more opportunities for professional advancement ( which would also result pay ) . We feel collective is comparatively slow- once is in place takes over a year on average according to a Bloomberg analysis . During the contract negotiation , companies are forbidden from giving pay / bonus / benefi t increases without a special arrangement the union , and the of Labor Statistics has reported that non - union employees generally larger pay raises than union - represented . \u2019s consistent with what we saw with Raven , there have only been three bargaining sessions since the union was certified there almost 6 months ago , due partly to the union cancelling pre - planned bargaining sessions for a month . I \u2019m sharing all of that because having a streamlined process a reason why the company prefers direct discussions - ultimately it \u2019s to employees and everyone should get to vote their own preference in a fair election . What happens with this is that ballots be mailed to eligible Albany - based employees on Oct. 27 , need to be returned by 17 , and will get counted by the NLRB on Nov. 18 . More to come as the process continues wanted share asap . Thanks so for reading . Advertisement Update 11/2/22 12:33 p.m. ET : Activision now the decision with the NLRB and calling on it to stop the vote in meantime . Specifically , the wants the votes that were sent employees \u2019 homes to be \u201c impounded \u201d until the appeal is completed , lest any preliminary results \u201c prejudice \u201d a in the event Activision the appeal . The company argues that video game development is unique and unprecedented compared to other industries NLRB has dealt with , and for that reason its was flawed and based on several misunderstandings . As one example , Activision that development of Diablo is much more complex than Call of Duty , and teams Blizzard Albany are much more integrated those at Raven , where Activision \u2019s legal arguments previously failed .

{"text": "The price - to - earnings multiples say recession . But the multiples things in 2022 . So how long can the stay this ? We have all read of articles about what 2023 will bring us . I think most are sincere . Their only drawback , as usual , is that do n't on stocks themselves . They might say that the S & P 500 , at 18 - earnings , could down to 16 - times earnings even if earnings stay relatively steady . Or , they could that if the terminal rate is 5 % on the Federal 's Reserve fed funds , we get to 14 - times earnings . But these analyses do n't tell you how they to S & P target . So , I want to the S & P target thesis by looking at a few stocks the uselessness of . Let 's start with two stocks : Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Nucor ( ) . Pharmaceuticals giant J & J , one my favorites in the portfolio , trades at 18 - times forward earnings for . And I reflects a recession is coming , given that its earnings not be hurt by a slowdown . If we get a recession , then the stock will trade higher , not lower , as a recession would likely signal the end of the Fed interest hikes . Now let 's take Nucor , the world finest steel maker . It is projected $ 28 a share year and then drop to $ 12 a share year , as a likely recession hold . I have a hard with the 4 - times earnings it trades at , but 's obvious that the stock market setting up for a serious recession would cause Nucor to have its earnings more than halved . But where do those earnings come from ? The largest earnings sector will infrastructure which , rather than take a hit , should go higher given federal government spending kicks in next year . That infrastructure spending includes everything from and tunnels to buildings , which Nucor dominates . Then also has oil - and - gas through its pipeline and heavy - equipment businesses . At the time , industrial ( CAT ) sells at 18 - earnings because of demand . That mocks 's 4 - times . With those end - markets and with CAT 's higher multiple , something has to give . Something is wrong . I think 's Nucor 's earnings estimates 2023 \u2014 they are too low . My point being is that you have the most stocks trading as if are falling apart , but the heavier equipment cyclicals trading not just , but much . My conclusion is that JNJ is \" right \" in what it at , Caterpillar and like likely slightly wrong \u2014 too high , but still in the \u2014 and Nucor and the like are just dead wrong . So why are n't we buying Nucor ? Because I it can go lower . Meanwhile , the automobile sector looms large , and auto is considered be something that will plunge next year as demand abates . I think the market is making a serious on that thesis . People have held off buying because trucks are unnaturally too high , due to supply and higher interest rates . Ultimately , I think autos stay strong in a recession . Therefore , the compromise is Ford ( F ) , which , barring still one more supply shock from China , make the most sense . added to our position Ford on Thursday . Still , all things considered me make one more point : If a Caterpillar or a Deere ( DE ) to come down lower levels , it would make a great of sense to buy . One more quandary : Aerospace . A should dry up airplane demand , but replacement is critical . Club holding ( HON ) , which makes cockpits and airplane engines , sells at 24 - , while Raytheon Technologies ( RTX ) clocks in at 21 - times earnings . The latter is most likely undervalued as a result of Russia 's war in Ukraine . Are these justifiable ? They are the highest multiples in the market , including Club holdings Apple ( APPL ) ( GOOGL ) . It could all meet in middle . I see some shrinking of the large caps . are a , albeit diminishing , with the exception of outlier Nvdia ( NVDA ) at 44 - times , which now a small Club position because of its vulnerability . All but the fastest - growing could trade at around 16 - 17 - times earnings . That 's going be our assumption for next year \u2014 a mix of soft goods with higher multiples and cyclicals with lower ones .

But here \u2019s the thing : If aware of your mediocrity comes to the markets , it can actually help you be a better investor . Based on decades of leading behavioral research , Crosby said investors easily fall prey to four inherent . you \u2019re mindful of them you can take to either their effect , or harness them to your financial advantage . 1 . Ego bias Everyone has an ego . It protects us in many ways , in part by a sense of confidence \u2013 and overconfidence \u2013 in our own abilities and . \u201c Ego gets us out of bed in the morning , \u201d Crosby said . who sure of themselves are more likely to be resilient and professional . \u201c People who are overconfident are often happier and likely to be business people and politicians . And [ a strong ] ego can buffer us against setbacks , disappointment and loss , \u201d he said . when it comes to investing , self - can cost you real money . example , said , most of us would rather find that confirms what we already believe rather than information that challenges our beliefs . He cited research showing that even when with facts directly contradict what we believe , thanks to our , we may become even more entrenched those faulty beliefs . One way this might play out when you \u2019re investing is you may feel sure that a company or new asset \u2013 crypto \u2013 will win the future . So throw a disproportionately large amount of money your - lose - . research suggests cherry - picking what you to be winners in place investing in the broader market may hurt your returns the long run . Crosby cited showing how fund management less well than passive indexing more 80 % of the time over and - year periods . And \u2019s before accounting for the higher fees an investor pays for actively managed funds . 2 . Conservatism bias [[ ]] Investing always involves risk . But people \u2019s desire stick with familiar or the adage \u201c invest in what you know \u201d too far actually increase that risk . [[ ]] Crosby used an who works in the industry , buys a home in a tech hub San Francisco and invests primarily in tech stocks . The upshot : Her prospects will be dependent on the health of the tech sector because she is devoting most her time and to it through her job , her property and her . When the tech takes a , she could get clobbered financially . Another way investors often default the familiar to primarily invest in US stocks in the belief that non - US stocks are too risky . 3 . Attention bias Humans tend to pay disproportionate attention to bad news or high - drama , low - probability events ( e.g. , shark attacks or planes flying into buildings ) . Both can our of . What \u2019s more , information overload \u2013 whether from data or research or news \u2013 can misguided decisions because much information makes it hard to see the forest for the trees , Crosby noted . [[ ]] 4 . Our and intuition can protect us some difficult situations , or they can help guide us . For instance , finally pick a good of dating others who were never right you . they can also cause us rashly in the moment , and override what we normally know we should do . Think donuts , Crosby suggested . You may have gotten all the nutritional counseling in the world , but peak stress invariably reach for the powdered donuts , not the asparagus . How emotion plays out in the markets can costly . If your fear is activated , you panic and sell at the wrong time . Or you \u2019re elated , your optimism may distort your sense of how much risk you really taking on with an investment . Strategies to back our biases Investors can seek override their inherent biases in many ways , Crosby said . Among his suggested strategies : out the . Do n\u2019t check investment daily . Do n\u2019t fixate on every gyration in the market . Do n\u2019t drown yourself in . And do n\u2019t let negative disproportionately drive your investment . Have . You ca n\u2019t predict the future . And will never have perfect information to make a sure bet on a single stock or sector . [[ ]] Diversify your . Crosby put it this way in his book : \u201c Diversification is \u2026 the embodiment of managing ego risk . [ It ] \u2019s a concrete nod to the luck and uncertainty inherent in money management an admission that the future is . \u201d [[ ]] For example , to counter so - called home bias in your , Crosby suggested should n\u2019t invest in domestic stocks than their percentage of the world market . Depending on how \u2019re measured , US equities represent anywhere from 45 % to 60 % of the global equity market . But average US typically have a much larger share their equity holdings in US , and little in foreign stocks . a system in . Automating your savings and investing across a portfolio regardless market conditions often works well . The same goes for automatically putting a certain amount savings for near - and emergencies . \u201c \u2019s about perfect process more about having a process , \u201d said . One is the idea of \u201c set it and forget it \u201d with retirement savings . Employees who choose the option in their ) plan to automatically increase savings they get a raise do better than if they have to make decisions every month about much to save . Use emotions to your financial advantage : One study Crosby cited showed that low - income were likely to save twice as much when had an envelope earmarked for savings that has a picture of their children on it . Realize no is . people get to market through their 401(k)s , specifically through target funds that their offer as the default investment .

The two braid each other \u2019s hair . talk and and talk for , trying to reach a decision before the men who hurt them return the next day . Often , the women nitpick another \u2019s \u2014 why \u2019re , how they \u2019re used , and what they . Is \u201c fleeing \u201d community the same as \u201c \u201d it ? Would forcing themselves to forgive their violators equal true forgiveness ? some , may sound like the kind of verbose material more fit for a stage play than a . But Women Talking , adapted by - director Sarah Polley from Miriam Toews \u2019s 2018 novel , is vibrant cinema . Polley lends the central conversation a visual gravitas reserved for epics : She shot the movie on widest canvas possible using the same kind of equipment that captured Star Wars landscapes , and applied a muted color grading to every frame . She told last year that she wanted the ensemble to look like \u201c a faded postcard , \u201d an artifact that the women ( played by actors including Rooney Mara , Jessie Buckley , and Claire Foy ) are abandoning their circumstances . \u201c I did n\u2019t to shy how tremendous were them in having this conversation , \u201d Polley said . \u201c They \u2019re literally about a world and creating a new one . \u201d Read : A # MeToo movie devoid of sensationalism Not that Polley ever shows how their world ends what it becomes . Women Talking is by - life incidents that occurred a Mennonite in Bolivia : colony \u2019s members were repeatedly drugged and raped in middle of the night , then made to believe they had dreamed the attacks . Like the novel , film begins after the perpetrators have been and the remaining men have to post and retrieve them . But resists the impulse to depict the most obviously dramatic scenes . She n\u2019t show , for instance , the men crash the meeting , or the two boys who threaten to expose women \u2019s . Instead , her film focuses squarely on the \u2019s discussion over whether they stay and fight , or up leave the only home they \u2019ve known . \u201c I was really curious about making a film in which people have their minds changed , \u201d she told me . \u201c Even when they \u2019re at odds with each other , they \u2019re hearing each positions can shift and change and get to a place where they \u2019re all going the same . \u201d Despite its heavy setup , film moves with unexpected buoyancy . these women , worst has already happened . Imagining a forward , through compromise and commitment , is the more , and perhaps more exciting , task at . Each woman harbors different belief and ideas . To come to anything to an agreement , they must pay to one another \u2019s thoughts , absorb contrasting opinions in good faith , and allow space for every observation \u2014 even the most tangential monologue about one woman . And so , they argue . They tease . They cry . They console . They sing . Every scene , as a result , tracks the discussion \u2019s evolution . Minute shifts tone and . To even embark on this meeting , the movie suggests , is a courageous act . \u201c Black - and - is a much easier place to live than the middle of a bunch of messy questions , \u201d Polley said . But that \u201c is sadly where life resides . \u201d as a war can encourage its to appreciate heroism and sacrifice , Talking reminds us of the value of language \u2014 capacity for context , for constructive , and , in the , for . In Toews \u2019s novel , a man named August attends the meeting . \u2019s to transcribe the session \u2014 the women illiterate , having never been allowed education \u2014 but also serves as a guide for the reader , the arguments and background . thoughts are n\u2019t but essential analyses of each \u2019s . As she worked on the adaptation \u2019s script , Polley assumed \u2019s task . She rewrote the screenplay more than a dozen times , poring over it from every character perspective at twice to \u201c titrate each moment so that nobody . \u201d In one pass , example , she wrote as if the lead character Ona ( played by ) , the group \u2019s levelheaded peacemaker ; in another , took on the perspective of Mariche ( Buckley ) , the most member . \u201c if they behaving that really difficult and obstructionist , I could at least feel from the inside out of how they were arriving there , \u201d Polley said . \u201c I think it was really important to keep everybody in balance , that no was more than the other . \u201d The exercise paid off : Women Talking feels energizing watch , because it \u2019s interested in parsing every opinion rather exhausted by the \u2019 . , \u2019s picky about projects \u2014 this is the first she \u2019s directed in a decade \u2014 told that the chance to immerse herself in mindset helped draw her to the story . Toews \u2019s novel , she , examined a reckoning in an way : moved beyond the immediate , outrage - fueled aftermath and evaluated argument \u2019s merits and flaws . That \u2019s the opposite of how today \u2019s discourse tends pan out , especially on social , indecision seems . \u201c To a fence - sitter is treacherous territory , \u201d Polley said of being online . the , , that not the case . The women \u2019s meeting can be as a loud declarations into quieter reflections for thorniest real - life discussions \u2014 such as ongoing over sexual harassment in the \u2014 to progress . \u201c At the beginning of the [ # MeToo ] movement , were conversations about , like , \u2018 I want to all of men who have done these things to an island , I do n\u2019t ever hear from them again , \u2019 \u201d Polley explained . \u201c Unfortunately , there is no , know ? \u2026 I think forgiveness is a very , very thing that can be misinterpreted in a thousand ways , [ but ] I curious about it looks like to create corridors for people to and change and redeem \u2026 Yes , we need to tear things down in the process , but we \u2019re building much as want tear . \u201d Looking ahead without forgetting the learned and asking What do we truly want ? rather merely can do?\u2014these are the that animated Polley of Women Talking . Months into editing , she cut some of her favorite she \u2019s ever shot and the original narration adapted from the book . Instead of having ( Ben Whishaw ) as the , Polley wrote a fresh passage from the perspective of the hayloft \u2019s youngest member , , rather than addressing audience , speaks directly to Ona \u2019s baby , born after the conclusion . The new voice - over suggests that the women did arrive at a better future ; at the same time , it treats their summit as a sacred event that to be remembered . In other words , Women casts eye the future even as the past . In a conversation , time collapses , and what emerges is hope . What could more epic than that ?", "label": "human"}

Ford major surgery on the F-150 's dash two years ago in to swallow is essentially a television in top trim levels . The result is an awfully monolithic stack that 's less visually appealing than what you 'd get Ram 1500 and radically revised Chevy and GMC Sierra . That 's especially true when talking the upper trim levels , but least those Platinum ( pictured top ) make up for it with buttery leather , open - pore wood trim nicely textured metal - look trim . said , even lower XLT trim high - quality materials and the novel of a piece embossed with a map of Detroit ( pictured , bottom left ) As that big 12 - inch screen , we ca it adds to the Sync 4 interface simply being bigger than the 8 - inch standard unit .

It 's also a further reach than what you 'll find in the Ram , regardless of screen size . On the other hand , the all - digital instrument panel is colorful and crisp , and there 's no faulting ample infotainment feature . We reviewed six - cabin of a F-250 whose seating is essentially with the ' 22 F-150 , including its front middle seat and fold - down console .

In general , though , every version of the 2023 F-150 is impressively efficient for a full - size truck . Well , except R. See Full Image Gallery > > What 's the F-150 like to drive ? There are many of the F-150 , especially in regard to engine choice , that how it drives very much depends . All share one common element : they are shockingly smooth , refined even responsive to drive . A Platinum test and its adaptive steering system almost SUV - like in way it moved the road : the steering was quicker and more responsive than before , the ride smoother , and there was the general feeling of the truck being smaller than it was . The refinement drop to a much XLT test truck was n't that big , . For those who need a pickup that can also accommodate the whole family on a road trip , the F-150 is no the compromise it once was . The Ram 1500 off a similar , and indeed , the gap the two trucks has narrowed substantially \u2013 has possibly . As for those powertrains , we wo n't mince : F-150 is the most impressive pickup everyday duty we 've . Its massive output , refined power delivery superior make it the most powertrain . It also hides its hybridness well \u2013 's fussy CVT , awkward brake feel weird electric noises . It feels totally . It also makes the otherwise 5.0 - liter feel like an old dog , especially its responsiveness around . The two EcoBoost turbocharged V6 are better in regard , and continue to with buttery smooth power delivery . The bigger 3.5 - liter 's substantial output is even impressive in light how relatively fuel it remains . Note that we review the F-150 Lightning separately .

The 20 anti - McCarthy Republicans who so far derailed his bid to become represent 10 % of the House GOP . They are n\u2019t the entirety of the Freedom Caucus .

Victoria Spartz of Indiana became the Republican member - elect to not support McCarthy on Wednesday , although voted \u201c present \u201d than voting for anyone . The hardliners also do n\u2019t speak with one voice . \u201c I think you need to break the 20 down , \u201d the conservative Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado said on CNN on Wednesday . Buck had been viewed as a possible defector before week , and made clear patience with these votes is waning . He McCarthy \u2019s deputy , Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana , as a possible could speak to of the 20 - Republicans . For some , it \u2019s . \u201c are a few of 20 that just n\u2019t going to vote for McCarthy but would vote for somebody else , \u201d said . The key question is that block of \u201c - McCarthy \u201d Republicans is larger than the four votes McCarthy can afford to lose . want specific changes . \u201c are some of the others \u2026 who changes in the and are some others who care policy , \u201d Buck said . \u201c So I think if ( Scalise ) meets those three needs , he will be able to move forward take the speakership . \u201d [[ ]] Some want to things down . Ralph South Carolina has said a non - negotiable for is if is \u201c willing to shut the government down rather than raising the debt ceiling . \u201d That suggests the of precarious future funding fights will to economy . [[ ]] These lawmakers painful cuts now to end deficit spending . If the was to default its debt , it could send the US into a tailspin , according to most economists . A government shutdown be less severe , but they have been when lawmakers forced them in recent years . Here of the stated reasons and accepted of why these lawmakers are unwilling support McCarthy . This public fight the House floor is part of what wanted \u201c We showing the American people that this works , \u201d said the Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry in rising to nominate Rep. Donalds of Florida as an alternative to McCarthy . That it \u2019s 100 years was such a floor fight is a feature of the moment , argued . \u201c We have said we not going to take any more of Washington being broken . \u201d That was echoed another - Republican who appeared on , Rep. Bishop of North Carolina . \u201c I really think this is democracy in action , \u201d Bishop said . \u201c If you \u2019re as it is , then you ca n\u2019t be satisfied with doing the same thing as we start this Congress , I \u2019m convinced . \u201d Some just n\u2019t like McCarthy Rep. Matt Gaetz Florida issued a personal screed against on Tuesday . \u201c Maybe the right person for the speaker of the is n\u2019t someone who has sold shares himself for a decade to , \u201d Gaetz said , just in front of his . Bishop was on CNN when he the problem with McCarthy \u2019s specific leadership . \u201c The fact is you see a specific agenda that you know Kevin McCarthy \u2019s going to to the mat for , as opposed to pablum poll - tested language , indicates the problem , \u201d Bishop said . \u201c And it \u2019s been way all 14 he been in leadership , with all respect to . \u201d \u2019re not going to follow Donald Trump on this After McCarthy amnesia about the January 6 , 2021 , and repeatedly paid Donald Trump , the former president has been to help out . But the not helped , to Lauren Boebert , the Colorado Republican . \u201c Let \u2019s stop with the campaign smears tactics to people to turn against us \u2013 having my favorite president call us and tell us need to knock this off , \u201d Boebert said on the floor on . \u201c I think it needs to be . president needs tell Kevin McCarthy that , sir , you do not have the votes and it \u2019s time to withdraw . \u201d [[ ]] It \u2019s much about the perceived swamp you watch enough Tucker Carlson Fox or Steve Bannon \u2019s podcast , you \u2019ll hear argument that Republicans and Democrats are n\u2019t that different . Carlson often uses the term \u201c uni - \u201d blast the funding bills that are signed into . There \u2019s some of that the to , who has part of leadership years . \u201c Right now I \u2019m holding the line because I think we need place to differently , and that a statement . It \u2019s something I believe , \u201d Chip Roy of Texas told CNN on Tuesday . Roy said he \u2019s among fiscal conservatives who want \u201c stop the train of , \u201d which he said is made up of and Democrats , \u201c power brokers and defense industrial complex . \u201d He argued that the interests come together to government bills like the $ 1.7 trillion version passed last fund government through most of 2023 . want more for individual members Roy and Perry also talked about the need for open amendments on House floor , and Donalds has the others who a single member to be able to force a vote on whether to remove a sitting . Spartz has n\u2019t opposed McCarthy , but she did n\u2019t any favors when she voted \u201c present \u201d and ate away at support . said on CNN on Wednesday that the hardliners have a point about open debate the amendment process and she wants the House function differently . \u201c We have uncontrolled spending , and we can do nothing about it , \u201d Spartz complained , noting the appropriations process does allow for open . \u201c I think that needs to stop , \u201d said . They may never be satisfied McCarthy offer numerous concessions to the like Roy , including a pledge \u2013 which given the slapdash way legislation comes together \u2013 to give lawmakers 72 hours to a bill before it goes to the floor for a vote . He also agreed to just five Republicans to force a to remove the speaker instead of the current requirement a majority of join the call . One complication with finding a McCarthy replacement is that someone like Scalise might realize how much more difficult McCarthy \u2019s concessions make the job . When CNN \u2019s Manu and Veronica Stracqualursi asked Donalds , who has been getting votes from the Wednesday , he wanted the job , he said , \u201c Nah , not really . \u201d [[ ]] There context to these demands It \u2019s not entirely true that zero read these spending bills or that no one influence what goes into them . Congressional rely on committees to hash out the vast majority of what goes spending bills . request individual spending items . It \u2019s a complicated process and pretty everyone agrees is flawed . On the other hand , want open amendments bills would almost surely use them poison the process . [[ ]] In other words , once this small lawmakers the power they crave to blow up spending , they would . \u201c This is a prelude of what \u2019s going to come and the coming attraction when we get up to any big budget matter or the debt ceiling or anything else , \u201d Rep. David Joyce of Ohio , a McCarthy - backer , on CNN on Wednesday . \u201c There will be a crowd and they \u2019re going to to push and shove what they think is the agenda , and they \u2019re 10 % of our whole . \u201d Doing the larger math , 10 % of GOP conference is a much smaller minority of will of voters .", "label": "human"}

Danielle Kurtzleben : Let 's start with I suppose a pretty question \u2014 I 'm going to ask you for your resume . Tell us your in Republican . What were you doing up Trump 's election , and what doing now ? Tim Miller : I grew up Colorado , and I started as a young high school kid being a nerd . And I just had privilege and the luck to have a neighbor that was friends with a that was for governor \u2014 his name was Bill . And so in the summer , when other kids had to or , I and interned on his campaign . He ends up a , really close race that just kind got hooked on politics . I end up getting to go to the 's office , and my task is to sift through all the crazy letters that get sent to the governor 's office . I [ began ] working on campaigns in a bunch of , leading up to a spokesperson on John McCain Iowa presidential campaign . From there , I worked on a bunch would now be extinct , RINO presidential campaigns . [ I was ] a spokesperson for Jon in 2012 . then after he , I my into representing [ Romney ] at the RNC during the general election . in 2016 , I was communications director for Jeb Bush campaign speaking for the first kind of Republicans against Trump PAC , which was called Our Principles PAC . , I do n't know if you recall , but Donald Trump ends up winning , and I have a life crisis . Since then , I have been writing \u2014 I wrote for The Bulwark and other places . And I also was political director for Republican Voters Against Trump , which is a project aimed at getting Republicans to for Joe Biden 2020 . DK : You write early on that you knew this book would be cathartic for some liberals \u2014 to read a dunkfest on top officials . were you hoping people would get from this book , if not just the of dunks ?

An agent to me and said , \" I think 'd really good at this book . \" You know , \" Write ' ten grifters in Republican Washington ' or whatever , and we 'll sell a million copies . \" n't feel like that was going to be satisfying for me on the writing side of things . And so there is a little bit for sure , what I really wanted to do focus more on the gray . I jumped over a couple of things , going over resume , that I 'm less proud of : as a gay Republican , how I worked for candidates that opposed the most important thing my life right now \u2014 my husband and child . [ I wanted to ] write about the people who saw the danger and went along with it anyway and tried to explore why they , and I tried to explore why I as far down that path as I , even though I peeled off . DK : Well , let 's get into that \u2014 you were on the Trump payroll for a bit . You at one point advised Pruitt in bid to become EPA administrator . So in terms of the question of \" Why We Did It , \" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. insiders and of yourself at the time ?

There are a of people that like to wield power in Washington , but power comes with responsibility . Power has downsides . Being around power great [ insiders ] .

You get into a career , you 're mid - level , and then all of a sudden you start feel kind icky it . And then it 's like , well , what do I do now ? The Scott Pruitt situation was for me . Trump had won . This had been my whole life , being a Republican spokesperson or researcher . And I knew [ Pruitt ] . I did n't know that , but he called me and he 's like , \" Hey , will you prep for this job ? \" And I took just because I in a \u2014 I was like , \" I do n't what I 'm going . Am I going to have a job ? \" And then I also think that there is the identity element about this , which is \u2014 particularly in Washington , increasingly , in a concerning fashion , everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 becomes of 's identity . In Washington , you people that \u2014 Republican is who they are . The that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives . The bar they go to is the Republican bar . Their poker night is Republican poker night . They a kids ' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives . It 's then to say , \" I this anymore . \" The thing that surprised me in a bad was just how resentment and interpersonal drove this . DK : Oh , yeah . The animosity among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is just huge . you 're saying that that partisanship among the Republican ruling class . TM : For sure . I say this not a compliment to , by the way \u2014 this is a self - criticism \u2014 but I saw this as a little bit of kayfabe , which this wrestling term performative anger . Like , Hulk Hogan was really mad at Andre the Giant \u2014 I 'm showing my age with that reference . But it was fake . [[ ]] I was the RNC as the spokesperson , my job was basically to criticize campaign . The Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 LaBolt and Liz Smith \u2014 friends of mine . , 'd go out and drink trash - talk each other . me , it was performative , and so that 's how I was processing things . I was assuming that everyone was on level . And what I came to find out is that they really were n't , and that this bitterness Obama , [ there was ] an element of to it for sure . But more that , I think that for a of the people in political class , it was this that he got treated , that he was the golden child in media and everyone loved him that did n't get treated as well . [[ ]] And then in the Trump years , this gets on steroids . What I thought was performative fighting between the parties , among many , , many my colleagues became a driving , motivating force . [[ ]] guy said to directly , \" Tim , I 'm a white guy , all of woke nonsense and with my wife 's friends calling for for Republicans and all this criticism , all this heat I have to take , I 'm not up for jobs . it just leaves me no choice but to just think about the one or two I agree with [ the Trump administration ] on and just focus on that . \" [[ ]] What I to find out is that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans . DK : 's another motivation that I to drill . There are two categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs . And these are people who told themselves and others that they took Trump administration jobs because they afraid of who it otherwise \u2014 that , hey , at least I can be the adult in the room . do not buy this argument . Why not ? : I do n't . I think it 's the toughest category , because some level , are we lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn ? Clearly . So hard to of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand . [[ ]] other hand , their actions after they took the job \u2014 all of those who that they into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 their actions kind of that they really other motivations . I say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just felt like they had this duty to country and that it was better them in public service than else , then they would have supported Biden in 2020 . But none them really came out , \" no , need to stop person . \" that would have been the logical next of somebody that was going in really to save the country . [[ ]] DK : Throughout book , it feels like voters are right at the edge of the picture . I 'm thinking Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher on immigration . Or you the formerly moderate York , Elise Stefanik , who justified becoming Trumpier by saying , \" well , I 'm doing what voters want . \" So my question is , you blame a lot of Republican elites for falling in with Trump \u2014 do similarly towards voters ? [[ ]] I do n't . I 'm two minds about the voters . One is that I do think are ones that are driving this . And my book about the cowardice of the collaborators . The Republican ruling would have been happy to along with a more benevolent person just continue their access to power , they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route , because 's voters wanted . And OK , are voters that ? That a different book . I that the voters have a lot of reasons why they were upset . I mean , some people bigots for sure . I think the Republican ruling class did n't to [ voters ' ] concerns . I write about the autopsy , which I worked on in 2012 . I , a lot of Iraq , were mad about the hollowing - out of their communities . n't do anything try to address that . We did challenge Republican orthodoxies on any , Trump did . So I think it makes sense that those voters were attracted to . He was them different . And one the chapters the book is [ about ] the class \u2014 media in . It should n't that surprising that someone is every getting a text message or email a tweet or a Facebook about how their country being stolen from them , that they would want support radical ends to fix that . I to have grace towards and people in my life that have swept up in this . And I think that we have , in a representative democracy , an obligation of the people at of funnel to resist people 's impulses . did that . And is why those folks are the characters in my book . [[ ]] : You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report RNC released after Mitt Romney lost in 2012 , telling the party to have longer - term success . A lot of it working harder to to nonwhite and voters . did not fit that bill ... and listener Rachel Gershman was in our Facebook group , \" Does the autopsy have any now ? \" TM : Not really . It has relevance as an what the Republican political class , left devices , actually wanted . So I think that it interesting in regard . I think there a lot of reasons to think maybe an vision Republican Party might have worked . Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate , partially because of that conservative complex \u2014 the hyperbole that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself . a candidate that was more moderate on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 someone with Elise Stefanik 's 2014 platform of believing we should deal with climate change and supporting gay marriage , could that person have ? I think maybe , , probably . But because Trump won , that this mindset within the Republican Party , after McCain and Romney , that this kind of , nativist , working class path is the way for Republicans to win national elections again . [[ ]] DK : One other thing I to ask about is a gay Republican . You about the tap you did support a that just did n't people like you . I 'm wondering if you could tell us how that experience affected how you saw fellow Republicans do their own sort of tap dancing tried justify their allegiance to Trump . : I spent a of time thinking this because there are obviously limits to any parallel . But I think there are a lot parallels . I look back with regrets on not being more vocal on gay rights , on not drawing a red line types of candidates that I for . the reason why I did it when I think back about my own rationalizations , I felt like the arc of the history was towards justice , to steal a phrase \u2014 I felt like we already on this trajectory , and so why should I ruin my career over it ? [[ ]] I also used these same kind of rationalizations of , Oh , the other side 's not perfect , too . I mean , in 2008 , wo n't say he 's for gay marriage and everybody he privately is . You talk yourself into the fact that , you know , \" the other side is not perfect on either . so should I worry about it ? \" of these happened , and the benefit some distance and with kind of shaking me out of this kind of mindset , I looked back on and thought , \" , I do n't think I was seeing myself . \" So when Trump came around , I saw those same machinations happening in my colleagues . I think the happened is that whole identity question that I talked about earlier . I was probably visible gay Republican spokesperson for a while . So I had been through this \u2014 people seeing in a different way and having to deal with that kind identity change . And so , I think it made it less hard for me do it when Trump came around . I had those mistakes that I could look back on and say , \" I 'm not to make this mistake again . \"", "label": "human"}

Lightfoot brought in Dunn last July to help in her effort to keep Bears in . He said he \u2019s unpaid for the role , that he has the plans at Landmark \u2019s expense .

Team officials have they they are sticking to a contractual obligation and talking only with Arlington Heights officials what they can on the former site of Arlington Park racetrack . The a contract to buy the 326 acres for $ 197.2 million but back out of the deal . The administration has estimated that a Field redevelopment , dome all , could cost $ 2.2 billion . Dunn \u2019s plan includes a north wall he could be opened depending on the weather . Stadium capacity be in the \u201c , \u201d said , compared with current 61,500 seats . officials promised a feasibility study of public financing options last year but have no updates . Funding would surely be controversial because of the likely hit and the amount debt from Soldier Field \u2019s 2003 renovation . The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority , which handles the debt , said the owed is $ million on notes due by 2032 . End Zone Club under a for a revamped Soldier Field . Landmark Development Dunn said the city \u2019s $ billion cost estimate was but that and rising interest inevitably would the project . He n\u2019t discuss taxpayer funding . He predicted that Arlington Heights would cost far more and deliver less for the team and taxpayers . Soldier draws a central area that gets 50 visitors a year , with 100 vehicles a year zipping on Du Sable Lake Shore Drive . \u201c Those are Disney - like numbers , \u201d Dunn said . Arlington Heights , he said , to 12 million annual visitors . Dunn the city and the Bears could strike new revenue - sharing deals covering parking , concessions , corporate sponsorships and income sources . \u201c have to have a revenue mix , \u201d said . \u201c It can be solved .

Dunn said concern planning , not politics . \u201c We have to have a vision here for of Soldier Field \u201d whether Bears move or not , he said . \u201c I think any administration would at this very favorably . \u201d Scott Hagel , senior vice president of marketing and communications the Bears , stuck with the tenor of the club \u2019s statements about stadium , , \u201c The only exploring is in Arlington Heights . \u201d In Dunn \u2019s outline , Soldier Field would keep its name and its tradition of honoring veterans , a memorial to armed forces within the building . Its colonnades would stay in place , but the space around them would become active with shops and maybe a food hall . His calls a concert stage north of the arena near the Field Museum . A view concert stage that could be Field \u2019s neighbor . Development The dome would be supported by columns the end zones , prime opportunities for corporate sponsors , Dunn said . Building into what \u2019s now dead space the stands , he said , would put an to the current cramped concourses . [[ ]] The project could three to four years to complete , he said . The proposal two main assumptions . One that costs could be down by % of the existing stadium structure , including the bowls , which Dunn said provide an intimate view of games . The assumption that he can change how fans get to Soldier Field . Most drive now , but Dunn said that , with a transit connection next to the stadium , 40 % of the crowd could arrive by rail , comparing game - day commuting patterns to Wrigley Field .

{"text": "Kevin McCarthy \u2019s humiliation , and that of Donald alongside him , offers a tall draft of schadenfreude . At the that , though , the nation is left with an empty glass and a bitter taste . For reasons , McCarthy is unfit for the speakership : He undermined the 2020 election , he dishonest , he is ( as we see ) unable to marshal his caucus . But his are n\u2019t really interested in a speaker who is able to keep functional . Their ability Congress hostage is a flashing red light for the country . One can draw some very general conclusions about the anti - McCarthy : Its members are mostly far to the , and they are mostly very pro - , notwithstanding their disagreement issue Trump , who supports McCarthy . All two of them are election , The Washington noted . David A.

If it were , Marjorie Taylor Greene one McCarthy \u2019s most fiery defenders in this battle . Rather , the is about whether the House should be able to accomplish anything at all , and whether the GOP caucus be by political reality . \u2019s presence on the side that has a more realistic theory of governance and power , which says a lot about her here . Today , in nominating McCarthy on the fourth round balloting , Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin said , \u201c There are things I want that I know are impossible to get done in this Congress , \u201d but that McCarthy was best - positioned to achieve what possible . But the rebels start from a premise that nothing impossible if they simply enough to the cause . They believe they wrestle the Senate and White House into through force of will . The they might effectively prevent the from doing anything , but they do n\u2019t see that as a problem ; and are tools of hard - core conservatism in their hands . McCarthy is not an ideologue . He is , at heart , a politician who thrives on relationships . When rebels rise in the and that their disagreement with not personal , they be both sincere and at the same time spurning him in personal terms , because that is he is . has tried to win them over by offering on some demands , including number of representatives needed for a motion to vacate , which could force a vote ejecting speaker any time . ( It would also gut ethics investigations . ) These would make a weak if he were to win the chair , which appears he can not . Watching McCarthy try to bargain with them has been darkly humorous , because dealing is in McCarthy \u2019s blood but are anti - deal , whether with Democrats or with him . That , in fact , their core precept . The overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus sided with McCarthy , at least at the start of this process . this to say that rest of GOP is innocent of the rebels \u2019 kind of . Since 2011 , congressional Republicans as a whole have slumped toward the belief that simply sticking to their guns is enough . Much like Donald Trump , the rebels both continuous with recent trends in the Republican Party but also a break them , in terms of their zealotry . : The humiliation of Kevin McCarthy No example is more clear than the debt , an odd , limit on the nation \u2019s borrowing power . It n\u2019t actually affect ; Congress decides what to spend and then to for that ( or ) , regardless the debt limit is set . Refusing to borrow to pay debt would simply put the nation default . But Republicans \u2014 McCarthy \u2014 repeatedly voted against raising the debt ceiling anyway , claiming that that somehow constrain , or tried use it as a backdoor method to enact massive spending cuts . The debt ceiling is reason outcome of this speaker vote matters : The new have to raise the debt limit or else produce a default sometime in the next few months . has to the rebels , who want no surrender , or his , who no part of economic catastrophe . \u201c Is he willing to shut the government down rather than raise the debt ceiling ? \u201d Representative Ralph Norman South Carolina , one rebel , today . \u201c \u2019s a . \u201d But whatever McCarthy \u2019s particular weaknesses , any speaker will face the same quandary . That might be even of with better conservative bona , such as current House Majority Whip Scalise ; one McCarthy dissident said he would n\u2019t vote for anyone who \u2019d been in for past decade .

The sudden collapse of Crypto - related ad , an industry bright spot , dragged down ad . believes the 2023 ad market growth forecasts from major ad buyers like GroupM ( 5.9 % ) , Magna ( 5 % growth to $ 822 ) are too optimistic . \" In a period of mega - high inflation , price promotion ( ) on goods may be a more useful marketing tactic for some companies rather than mainstream advertising , \" he said .

But while the tech platforms flailed , advertising holding companies - performed . Agencies did n't enjoy the anomalous growth the tech giants the pandemic , so they 're impacted as much current course correction , according to the Enders note . That being said , the Enders note cautions agencies ' reprieve will end in 2023 : \" The story for advertising as a whole is that is objectively weakening , and even agencies are now mostly seeing slowing growth after the post-2021 recovery . \" and every other streaming service ads \u2014 but that might not advertisers Netflix had been so publicly opposed to advertising that industry was taken aback when it changed this year , partnering Microsoft 's Xandr unit to expedite the launch of an ad business .

Retail media providers are hoping snatch budget from advertisers who are having trouble finding consumers due to 's privacy and the loss of - cookies .

{"text": "After months and months of - CoV-2 subvariant soup , one ingredient has emerged in the United States with a flavor pungent enough to overwhelm the rest : XBB.1.5 , an Omicron offshoot that now accounts for an estimated percent of in . A crafty antibodies that is to grip extra tightly onto the surface of our cells , XBB.1.5 is now officially the country \u2019s fastest - spreading coronavirus subvariant . In last week of December alone , zoomed percent of infections nationwide to 40 percent ; soon , \u2019s expected to all that \u2019s left , at least very close . \u201c That the big thing everybody looks for \u2014 quickly takes over from existing variants , \u201d says Shaun , an infectious - modeler at Johns Hopkins University . \u201c And that a really rise . \u201d All of this raises familiar worries : more illness , COVID , more hospitalizations , more health - care system strain . With chilly temperatures crowding people indoors , and the uptake of vaccines an abysmal low , a winter wave already brewing The of an especially , immune - variant , Truelove told me , could ratchet that swell . But the public has heard that warning many , many , many times before \u2014 and , situation has not . The has come a long since early 2020 , when lacked vaccines and drugs to the coronavirus ; now , with immunity shots and past infections slathered across the planet \u2014 and uneven though layer be \u2014 the population no longer nearly so vulnerable to COVID \u2019s worst effects . Nor is XBB.1.5 a doomsday - caliber threat . So far , no evidence suggests that the subvariant is inherently more severe than its predecessors . When its close sibling , XBB , swamped Singapore a few months ago , pushing case up , hospitalizations did n\u2019t a disproportionately massive spike ( though is transmissible , and the is less vaccinated ) . Compared Omicron surge that pummeled the this time last year , \u201c I think \u2019s less to be worried about , \u201d especially for people who are up to date on their vaccines , says Mehul Suthar , a viral immunologist Emory University who \u2019s been how the immune system reacts to new . \u201c My exposures are going to help against any infection I have . \u201d SARS - CoV-2 \u2019s evolution is still worth through surveillance \u2014 which is only getting as testing efforts continue to be pared back . But \u201c variants mean something a different now for most of the world than they did in the pandemic , \u201d says Emma Hodcroft , a epidemiologist at the University of Bern , in Switzerland , who \u2019s been tracking the proportions - Cov-2 variants around the . Versions of virus elude a subset of our defenses are , after all , going to on coming , for as long as SARS - CoV-2 is with us \u2014 likely forever , as my colleague Sarah has written . It classic host - pathogen race : Viruses infect us ; our bodies , hoping to a severe reinfection , up defenses , goading the into its features so it can infiltrate us . Read : How long can the coronavirus keep infecting us ? But the virus is evolving toward the point where it \u2019s ; it \u2019s only switching up its fencing stance to sidestep our latest as we do the same for . A version of the virus that succeeds in one place flop in another , on the context : local and infection , for instance , how many elderly and immunocompromised individuals are around , and the degree to which everyone trading public air . With world \u2019s landscape now so uneven , \u201c it \u2019s getting harder for the to do that synchronized wave that Omicron this time last year , \u201d says Verity Hill , an evolutionary virologist at Yale . It will keep trying to creep around our defenses , says Roychoudhury , \u2019s monitoring SARS - variants at the University of Washington , but \u201c I do n\u2019t think we need to have alarm - bell emojis for every variant that comes . \u201d Read : The coronavirus \u2019s next Some particularly worrying variants and subvariants will to arise , with telltale signs , told me : a steep increase in wastewater surveillance , by a catastrophic climb in hospitalizations ; a superfast takeover that other coronavirus strains off the stage in a of days or . Omens such as these hint at a variant that probably so good at circumventing existing defenses that it will sicken just about everyone again \u2014 and cause enough illness overall that a number of cases turn . Also possible is a future variant that is more , adding risk to every new case . In extreme versions these scenarios , tests , treatments , and might need to come into mass use ; researchers may need to concoct a vaccine recipe at an accelerated pace . But that \u2019s a threshold that most variations of SARS - CoV-2 will not clear \u2014 including , seems far , XBB.1.5 . Right now , Hodcroft told me , \u201c it \u2019s hard to imagine that anything we \u2019ve seeing in the few months would really cause a rush to do a vaccine update , \u201d or anything else similarly extreme . \u201c We do n\u2019t make a new every time a new variant , we see those all through the year . \u201d Our current crop BA.5 - focused shots is not a great match for XBB.1.5 , as Suthar and his have found , least on antibody . But antibodies n't the only defenses play \u2014 and Suthar told me it better to have the new vaccine than not . In the , wastewater counts and hospitalizations are upward , and XBB.1.5 is elbowing out its peers . But the estimated rise n\u2019t seem as steep as ascension of original Omicron variant , ( though our tracking is now poorer ) . XBB.1.5 also is n\u2019t dominating equally in different the country \u2014 and Truelove points out that does n\u2019t yet seem tightly linked hospitalizations the places where it \u2019s gained traction far . As tempting as it may be to blame any rise in cases and hospitalizations on latest subvariant , our own behaviors at least important . Drop - offs in vaccine uptake or big jumps in mitigation - free mingling can drive spikes in illness on their own . \u201c We were a , this time of year , \u201d Hill told me . is up , masking is down . just 15 percent of Americans over the age of 5 have received a bivalent . The pace at which new SARS - CoV-2 variants subvariants take over could eventually slow , but the experts I spoke with were n\u2019t sure would happen . Immunity across the remains patchy ; only a subset of countries have access to updated bivalent vaccines , while some countries are still struggling to doses into of . And with nearly all COVID - dampening \u201c pretty much gone \u201d on a global scale , Hodcroft told me , \u2019s gotten awfully easy the coronavirus to keep experimenting new ways to stump our immune . XBB.1.5 is both product and catalyst of unfettered spread \u2014 and that continue , the virus take again .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Humans last set foot on the moon ago . we going back , but the way we explore space gone through some big changes . In December of 1972 , the astronaut Eugene Cernan left his footprints and daughter \u2019s initials in the lunar dust . doing so , he became the last man to set foot on the . Now , after years , humanity is going . in half century since Apollo 17 , a lot has changed in how we explore space \u2014 and how we our place in it . those early missions were all run by governments , much of is the domain of billionaires and companies . Commercial space travel has brought a new of thinking trips outside Earth \u2019s gravity , with tourism turning space into a vacation and something of a status . It \u2019s also widened the range of people go to space from the clean - cut white male astronauts of the Apollo era . [[ ]] New visitors bring perspectives to space , and diversity well change our to it . A ago , at 90 years old , the William Shatner rode one Jeff Bezos \u2019s Blue Origin spacecraft . But as told staff writer Koren , his time in space did n\u2019t line up with the optimism Star Trek \u2019s Captain Kirk . Koren and fellow writer Adam Harris discuss our changing relationship with space on an episode of the podcast Radio Atlantic . They also listen to some of Koren interview with Shatner . can hear their conversation here : The following is a transcript of the episode : Adam Harris : This is Radio Atlantic . I Adam . Marina Koren : And I \u2019m Marina Koren . Harris : This week on the show , we about space . We just heard some of colleagues \u2019 kids talking about . As a parent myself , it feels like the images of space are . One of the first T - shirts I remember buying for my daughter was a NASA T - shirt . We blankets in our house and rocket ships on them . Is that recollection of childhood ? Koren : Definitely . I had those glow - in - the - stars on my ceiling . Occasionally one would fall off and spook me , I recently got a set for my 3 - year nephew . is a go - to of wonder excitement for kids , for sure . [[ ]] Harris : And I should say that we are writers , but you are the one on space beat . : Yes , I am Atlantic \u2019s space bureau chief . Harris : ( . ) And it \u2019s been a big year to be a reporter , right ? Koren : It has , yeah ! are definitely in this strange era of exploration . It \u2019s been 50 years since the last time human beings have set foot on the moon . 1972 was Apollo 17 , final landing . I think the universe is a lot more familiar to us now , because we \u2019ve come such a long way . But something that \u2019s really different now is that you commercial companies that doing the that was traditionally done by governments . There SpaceX , Elon \u2019s , and Origin , Jeff Bezos \u2019s venture . And 10 ago , if you told someone that SpaceX will be launching people the International Space Station , they might have you . It seemed ridiculous , but this is the now . It feels like we \u2019re in this strange sci - fi where space travel is something you can buy . It \u2019s a type of vacation . And it \u2019s become a symbol a way . But now people can go space and come and tell : \u201c Well , I \u2019ve been to space . I \u2019ve done something that only about 600 or so people have done in the history of humankind . \u201d Harris : Before private space travel , [ you think of people going to space , ] you think of folks like John or Buzz . \u2019s someone with military who has studied to be an astronaut their entire life . does it that that \u2019s no longer the type of person that \u2019s going into space ? Koren : I think that spaceflight is about to get , really because the stories that we \u2019ve heard from spacefarers have come from a specific group of people . These were , often not , white men military , trained in a certain workplace culture that values \u201c the Right . \u201d values being stoic unafraid in the face of something dangerous . But in this new era of commercial spaceflight , you \u2019re gon na be seeing a wide range of participants . There will hopefully be more women , more people color , people from underrepresented groups , from different educational and socioeconomic backgrounds , and people with just a wide range of experiences . [[ ]] Harris : what are the stories that we \u2019ve already about the in space , right ? These professional astronauts , when come back , what do they say space was like ? Koren : Yeah , there are a few common themes . So , when astronauts have gone to space and they \u2019ve seen Earth from that perspective , they have been overcome with emotion at the beauty of Earth . And it suddenly becomes very clear how thin our is . And that is the only thing that protects planet from everything else . They \u2019re struck by the fragility of the planet . And then something else also happens to a lot of astronauts they go to space \u2014 they feel a sense connectedness with their fellow human beings down below . Because from space , you ca n\u2019t see any national borders . \u2019s just continents and seas and clouds . And so , many astronauts have come home and described these feelings . And stories are indicative of a cognitive shift , almost , is known \u201c the overview effect . \u201d And I \u2019ve talked to astronauts who say they were taken aback by the borderless world and how beautiful is , how it made them feel like : Why are we at war ? Why is there conflict ? \u2019re one planet . made feel whole . I also talked to one academic who did an extensive study of \u2014 and she could n\u2019t reveal this astronaut \u2019s name to me \u2014 but she said that this , when he into space , he took look out window and was convinced that was going to destroy itself in some - number years . And so experience could be profound and inspiring to one person , but it could also actually make another feel despair . what happening now with space tourism and private spaceflight the people going into space now have heard these stories of the overview effect . It \u2019s a thing . And so they \u2019re to feel a certain way when to space . They \u2019re expecting to have a profound change on their perspective of the world , and even maybe on their personalities . And so I we \u2019re kind of over - that . And I have talked to a few professional NASA astronauts who agree . They worry that these companies and their pitches customers are overselling the effects the overview effect . It not a guarantee . It not a from the universe . It \u2019s something that a person and individually . And your mileage vary . Harris : Yeah . And you said these flights are like a couple of minutes . Is that enough time to you ? Koren : That is a great question . So I talked to Frank White , the author who the term \u201c the overview effect . \u201d He came up with it when he was flying on a \u2014 so , not in space , but he had a pretty \u2014 and he got to : Future generations of humans who might be living and working in space would have this distant view of Earth all the time . And they have these insights that regular earthbound people lack . he was surprised that people who flying on Blue Origin and having a few of weightlessness were coming home and talking as if they had had profound experience . They were saying it changed them . And he was he thought that order to really get the full hit of the effect , you had to spend some time in space . Weeks to months in around Earth , or even all way on the moon . So , kind of the literature that we with here . And I \u2019s what \u2019s going to in this era of commercial spaceflight , you are going to have people who not the Apollo astronauts . And they going to be coming with different stories and really widening the overview effect we become as a public . And the future participants wo n\u2019t be restricted by some of the constraints that the professional were . If you were a professional astronaut you went to space and you did n\u2019t have a great time , I do n\u2019t think could say that once you came back from space , because that could potentially your future flight assignments . You had to a certain response on your way home . And so I think we \u2019re to hear some of the most honest stories of spaceflight that \u2019ve ever heard before . Harris : Is the effect real ? If we only have this limited pool of stories pull from , is that theory a thing ? Have all of folks who have gone up shared that ? [[ ]] Koren : That a great question . And I think the way we talk overview effect , it becomes like this mystical , magical . Astronauts revered people . Even when I \u2019ve astronauts , when they into the room in their flight suits their patches on fabric , you ca n\u2019t help but feel intimidated . Because you think : Wow , this has seen something that I \u2019ve never seen . [[ ]] And so think the overview effect and the that people should have in space as something that the universe gives us . But it actually a phenomenon . has shaped by a certain group of working under a certain set of pressures who wanted to make sure that they could fly again . they could n\u2019t say anything outrageous . And the overview effect came out of a certain time and place . Many of these stories come from the midst of the race , in the middle of the Cold War . That definitely shapes a person perspective . So I would say that seeing Earth from is not a one - size - fits - reaction . Harris : What are some the interviews that stuck because they may have differed this idea an overview effect ? : So I with William Shatner about his space flight . He was 90 years old he took that trip . I recorded my with Shatner . And he said it was a really transformational , but not for the reasons that \u2019re used to hearing . Harris : So you got talk to Captain Kirk ? Koren : I did , yes ! I will admit : I have never seen Star before . Harris : So have a space reporter who \u2019s never seen Star Trek ? Koren : ( Laughs . ) I have n\u2019t . you \u2019ve seen it , right ? Harris : I have seen Trek . playing pretty frequently on our TVs I was a kid . My rarely missed episodes or reruns . [ But ] for people like Marina do n\u2019t know who Captain Kirk is : He \u2019s the captain of the starship Enterprise on Star Trek the 1960s . The original captain . And he was this really optimistic figure \u2014 this really of classical hero . [ But ] what Shatner have to say about going to space ? Actually being there ? Koren : When I to him , it was about a year after his experience , and the flight was still really fresh in his mind . I asked him how he was a year out , and he dove right into a Shatner - esque monologue about going to . William Shatner : We emerged from the film of that surrounds the , and we weightless . I got out of my - point harness and made my way to the window . I saw a wake air . Like a submarine might leave in the . And then I looked to , which was facing . I looked up there , I saw nothing but blank , space . The blackness was overwhelming . immediate thought was : God , \u2019s death . And then I looked , and I could see with great clarity the of the circumference line of the Earth . of the desert that I had just left , which was beige . The whiteness of the clouds . blueness of the air . And those three colors in deference to the blackness \u2014 I was overwhelmed by the sense of death and overwhelmed by the sense - nurturing by the Earth . Koren : When came back from quick to space , he \u2019s standing outside the capsule ; there \u2019s other people . Jeff Bezos is there . Bezos is popping champagne a frat boy . And Shatner just there , super still . [[ ]] Shatner : I did n\u2019t know what I was feeling , but I was weeping , I n\u2019t know why . Everybody else was celebrating . It took me a couple of hours sitting by myself to understand that what I feeling was grief . And the Earth . Koren : He is overcome with emotion . He is weeping , and then he starts saying how he was just taken aback by blackness of space , the ugliness of space , how it looked like . So Shatner was super , super honest about his experience . when I talked to him , he said that that grief was still with . Earth was beautiful and gleaming and delicate from that perspective , but it reminded him of that \u2019s wrong on the ground particularly made him think about how unstoppable climate change feels . And so for , this in many ways a negative experience . And Shatner was cry when we about it , because the experience is so fresh in his about change and the really changed in the last year he went space . So that grief was still with him . : was his experience from what he may that he would feel after going up space ? Koren : He me that he expected to see Earth and just be reminded of beautiful and wonderful this planet is . I to be reaffirming a positive way . And it \u2019s interesting to think of this man who a character was really big space in real life going to , and his initial emotional reaction that is grief sadness and all kinds of negative emotion . I think what Shatner shares other astronauts is : When have gone space , they have felt an overwhelming desire to care the planet . You see that this is all there is . This is all we know , at least . And if this is our one home on this floating of in the void , then should care of it . And so , you know , there a case be that the people go up into space , feeling will trickle down and lead to some type of meaningful improvement Earth . Harris : If somebody gives a ticket on a $ 20 flight , you \u2019re not na be able say , \u201c Well , that was n\u2019t exactly what I expected to . \u201d But Shatner able to something different . Why was his different from others who have up to space and came back down just , \u201c , was great . , Jeff Bezos , for putting this \u201d ? Koren : I mean , William Shatner is William Shatner , right ? He years his space flight . He \u2019s Captain Kirk . I think he does owe Jeff Bezos anything . Yes , Bezos his ticket , and that \u2019s . But someone like William going into space can come and say what they want , because the public looks at them in a different way . If a very wealthy person decides to comp the tickets for an electrician [ or ] for a , and they go up and come down , they speak their very freely ? I do n\u2019t . Harris : Say a billionaire called you and was : \u201c Hey , Marina , love your stories . You wanna go to space ? \u201d Would you go if you got the opportunity ? : Oh , well , there would some about journalistic . But would I ever go to space ? I \u2019m gon na say no . Harris : Really ? [[ ]] Koren : Because is risky . You never what might happen , what could happen . I n\u2019t wanna die the job not having my story . Like , if something happens \u2014 if I somehow incapacitated , I come back and I ca n\u2019t write the story \u2014 will haunt me . ( Laughs . ) Planes freak me . I ca n\u2019t believe that we can get off ground land back in one piece . And , you know , space is not at that yet , but maybe someday it will be . And that \u2019s pretty wild to think about . Harris : Actually , to point , people at high altitudes day . Do think that there a future where spaceflight is going to feel sort of commonplace as taking a to ? Koren : I think that future is possible . I think what we have be careful is making too many promises . If you listen to Elon Musk or Jeff about spaceflight right now , they \u2019re that this future is happening , , next week . And I do n\u2019t think that future will happen that . It \u2019s true that more people than are going have the opportunity to go to space now . I \u2019m sure if in my lifetime there are going be spaceships full going to the moon . I , there might be . SpaceX and Elon Musk are working , really hard to make that future reality . SpaceX \u2019s next - generation moon rocket reach orbit as early as next year . SpaceX has already sold tickets to people to go on a trip around moon . These things are happening . quickly they become reality , I do know . 50 years from when we a years from the - program anniversary , maybe it will feel a bit more mundane , like a plane ride . : Is some of the fading from space , or space travel ? Are we sort of becoming desensitized to space travel ? Those first couple commercial flights , was all 24 - hour cycle . They broadcast all of . But that sort of slowed down . Are we sort of becoming desensitized to the awe and wonder of space travel ? Koren : I that \u2019s possible . I think of the Earthrise picture taken by the Apollo 8 crew in 1968 . That picture was mind - blowing to people . \u2019d never seen Earth like this . Fifty , I think our are so spoiled by special effects that I do if the of Earth from space is to that shocking . Especially when you have so people going orbit and coming back and posting on Instagram like : \u201c Here \u2019s what looks like . \u201d I do wonder if we seen so much incredible CGI , if our might be less impressed by view maybe people were in the 1960s . But I also do know if that just some dumb Millennial take .

The risk is particularly low the fact that 95 of China \u2019s locally cases being caused by two lineages \u2014 BA.5.2 and \u2014 that are old news elsewhere . \u201c The most dangerous new variant at the moment from New York \u2014 XBB.1.5 \u2014 which the is now busy exporting to rest of the world , \u201d Christina , a mathematician who studies health care at London , told me . \u201c I \u2019m sorry , but is ridiculous . \u201d By now , \u2019s well known that travel restrictions ca n\u2019t stop COVID from crossing borders . At best , they slow entry . When Omicron was first detected , in South Africa in late November 2021 , America blocked travel from southern - African countries in an to prevent the variant spreading ; by mid - December , Omicron dominated the United . Restrictions can delay the spread of a variant only if they implemented while cases are low before travelers have had a chance to spread it . policies were effective early in pandemic : A BMJ Health concluded that the initial ban on all travel into or out of Wuhan , China , in January 2020 significantly reduced the number to delayed outbreaks elsewhere \u201c up to a few . \u201d Later on , such restrictions lost value . The COVID Border Accountability Project , which tracks restrictions around the world , has found that closures did not reduce COVID spread , at least through April 2021 , Mary Shiraef , the project \u2019s principal investigator and a political scientist at Notre University , told me . ( According to the , domestic lockdowns did slow transmission . ) At this stage of the , make sense only two , Pagel said : The deploying them must have low levels of spread and good control policies , and the restrictions must be to all other nations , as opposed to just one . Neither of these is being met right now by any deploying travel measures against China . Even if a single - point ban did serve some useful , the rules in China do n\u2019t add up . Predeparture testing likely wo n\u2019t most infected travelers China , Kucharski , a of infectious - disease epidemiology at the London Hygiene and Tropical , me . A person could test negative one day and then positive a days later . If the point of restrictions is to slow local transmission , Kucharski said , calculations based on his research suggest that travelers should be tested twice : once they arrive , then three or four days afterward . Doing so would catch infected who initially negative while limiting their window spreading disease .

In scenario , time might to intensify mitigation and assess the degree which current vaccines are expected up . Historically , though , the time saved by travel bans wasted . After countries restricted travel South Africa keep Omicron at bay , governments responded by \u201c not doing much at all domestically , \u201d Kucharski said . , as colleague Katherine J. Wu has pointed out , the virus is able to spread easily China right now without any further changes to its genome . Population immunity there is modest , owing to the country \u2019s low natural - infection rate and less effective vaccines , so the virus can infect people perfectly as is . The travel restrictions on China will have little impact on the spread COVID , but they do send a forceful political . The measures are meant pressure , by slowing its economic , into being transparent about its situation , Stephen Morrison , the director of the Global Health Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington , think tank , told me .

When measure fails to keep COVID spread at bay , faith in public - health institutions could decline , which Pagel is the \u201c danger \u201d for next . It the - fear people are more likely to carry disease anyone else , whether foreign or American . \u201c are watching this policy so carefully to if it will again invite a racial backlash , \u201d Manjusha Kulkarni , a co - founder of Stop AAPI , me .

We \u2019ve accepted the fact racism still present in society and we more resilient to its effects . We also have an incredible support system in the UK , with friends and family who have embraced us and are of our marriage .

{"text": "The semiconductor , or chip , industry is perhaps one of the important sectors the stock market to understand . are everything from our smartphones to cars and to all facets computing , massive data centers used for the cloud . Put , they are the bricks and mortar of the digital . We n't see , but we know magically make stuff . companies are also in the news a lot lately , whether 's the U.S. government cracking down on chip exports to China or innovations connected cars and artificial intelligence . But that does n't make the industry easier understand , even for those familiar with the well - known players . Making things trickier : market tends to anything chip - related into broad - based investment vehicles , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) and mutual funds . companies , however , are specialized . the industry being out - of - favor right now \u2013 and our ongoing effort to scale back once over - weighted chip \u2013 we believe investors ' portfolios should have at least some exposure to the industry . For starters , they crucial to nearly all secular growth trends today and into the future . And trying to time the booms and busts of the cycle is incredibly difficult if not do consistently . our portfolio , we have positions remaining in Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) , Nvidia ( NVDA ) , Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) \u2014 all of which design chips for varying uses . ( We 'll get into the specifics later ) . Here then is guide to all . Our goal is to help you better understand where different chip - related sit in the supply , to these companies by their end , to gain more insight on how money flows through the industry . After , one company 's expenditure is company 's revenue . What is a foundry model ? The term is industry jargon , referring to the factory where chips made . There are four main categories the supply chain under this model : Capital makers , pure - play foundries fabs , fabless designers , and integrated device makers . Capital equipment companies \u2014 as Applied Materials ( AMAT ) , Lam Research ( LRCX ) , Holdings ( ASML ) and KLA Corporation ( KLAC ) \u2014 the machines used in the of semiconductors . Pure - foundries , or fabs , are companies with factories that fabricate ( manufacture ) chips designed by other firms ( some designers have their but will touch that below ) . In monstrous facilities , you will find the capital equipment by the capital equipment . That alone should provide some insight into the money flow , because when a foundry is or built from scratch , a good deal of spending is going go into buying equipment from the capital equipment makers . When you hear commentary on a call from a capital expenditure , that what 're hearing is commentary on demand and revenue for capital equipment makers . Players in the foundry space include companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Company ( TSM ) , often referred to as just TSMC , GlobalFoundries ( GFS ) . Fabless designers generally outsource the chips they draw up to foundries . Again , can start to see flow of , as strong guidance from a designer high demand \u2014 and therefore , a need for a greater number chips . course , the more chips a company needs , the greater the order value it will place a foundry player such as . Fabless designers include our holdings Nvidia , , Marvell Qualcomm . Since these companies n't need to expensive fabrication facilities , they run a agile asset - light business . They do n't have concern themselves with the need lay out significant capital in to ensure their ability manufacture the most cutting - edge chips . Finally , integrated device companies design and manufacture own chips in - house , essentially designers with their own foundries . Players in this include Intel ( INTC ) , Micron Technology ( ) , ON ( ON ) and Texas Instruments ( TXN ) . Semiconductor supply chain Understanding the structure of the semiconductor sector can help to better understand how money flows through the industry \u2014 and therefore , help members and corporate updates to make informed decisions when investing the industry . Here some examples . If we know that capital is in foundries , what we really know from a financial perspective is that the capital ( capex ) made the level are directly tied capital maker . So , when TSMC discusses capex on its conference call , it our jobs as investors to read those comments to demand for Materials and Lam . Nvidia discusses supply and demand dynamics , it provides insight into what will need from a - type manufacturing facility . there is an inventory , the last thing Nvidia wants is more chips ; that means fewer orders with TSMC and vice versa . Of course , in that same of thinking , when cloud providers such as Club holdings ( ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Alphabet ( GOOGL ) discuss investments , it means they need chips . companies ' capex is linked revenue at designers . We saw this at when Meta ( META ) announced that 2023 capex spending would increase 2022 due to data center investments . The tanked stock due to Wall Street believes to be undisciplined spending . However , it provided a to the semiconductor stocks that would Meta spending as revenue . If you hear the economy is and the cloud providers say they want \" digest past investments , \" they are really saying that they spent a lot of money and going to pump the breaks on additional investments in capacity . In head , you need to say , \" OK , cloud providers are slowing spending , which means less demand for Nvidia . If is going to see less for next quarters it may need to reduce orders TSMC . And if TSMC is to receive fewer orders , it may capex \u2014 and as a result , for Lam Research 's equipment decline the near - term . \" Of course , there are a of moving timing the flow is incredibly . But that is how needs to think at a high level . Remaining on cutting edge requires always looking ahead , and companies must balance spending slowdowns with continued investment in the term , which is why gauging stages of semiconductor investment cycle is so difficult . Nvidia may be seeing a glut of 30 - series chips , but the company stills need to work on ramping production of its 40 - series to be ready once the inventory is worked through . not be as much demand for 7 - nanometer chips , but it needs to be in a position to start producing 5 - nanometer and 3 - nanometer chips after that . The company ca n't stop spending entirely . Without going into it too deeply , the smaller chip size , the more densely packed . This results in more speed , less power consumption , and less , which would also effort / power consumption / cost to control levels . Types semiconductor chips because two may be lumped together based on their places within the foundry business model does not mean should be viewed peers or even competitors . Despite both being fabless designers , , which focuses heavily on connectivity solutions , should not be likened to fellow fabless designer Nvidia , whose main focus is on graphics processing units ( ) . Here is a high - level overview of the different kinds chips that should members better understand some of the terms around discussing this industry and a - off point for those that want to research on their own . Memory : The main categories memory chips are NAND and DRAM . Both markets essentially oligopolies \u2014 meaning a few players the supply . Samsung , Micron SK pretty own the DRAM . In the NAND , Samsung Micron also players , in addition to Kioxia ( formerly Toshiba ) , Western Digital ( WDC ) , and . NAND generally refers to a type of memory whereas DRAM stands for dynamic random memory . As you can tell , this industry can get very technical , confusing , and frustrating very fast for those not familiar the terms . Flash ( again , NAND ) refers to a type non - volatile storage medium . - volatile means that your data wo be lost once the power goes off . The most common use for that you may have seen the last you purchased a computer is in solid - state drives ( SSD ) , where all the files are stored on your computer . To really simplify , when you hear NAND or flash memory , just think of the solid - state drive storage on a PC . ( Now you might asking an is . Basically , it 's the storage device is hard drives ( HDDs ) seen older computers . HDDs have a spinning disc on which data written , have no moving parts , them faster and more secure \u2014 though you will pay up for that of course . is what known as a volatile memory , meaning it will data only so long as there is power . Oftentimes when you hear the RAM or see memory listed your PC specs , this what is being referred to . Unlike flash , which stores data and files over long periods even when the power is off , DRAM is \" working \" that is upon only when needed a computer processor to perform a given function . The more intense the , the more DRAM you might need , which is why a computer used for intense video editing or gaming require more than one used to simply surf the web check emails . Microprocessors : The three main processors to know are the central processing unit ( CPU ) , the graphics unit ( GPU ) , and the data processing unit ( DPU ) . The CPU like those made and AMD , which essentially have a duopoly \u2014 two players control the \u2014 is the brains of a . It is responsible for retrieving instructions / inputs , decoding those instructions , and sending them along in order have an operation carried out to deliver the desired . As Nvidia put in a past post , the is , then the GPU is the soul . GPUs more specialized than CPUs and good taking on many tasks once . Whereas a CPU will process data sequentially , a GPU will break down a complex into many small tasks and perform at . This is why we seeing their prevalence in . While the remains essential , adding a GPU allows for acceleration in data processing . With more data being transmitted , stored , processed ever before \u2014 as cloud computing adopted and work on deep learning and artificial advances \u2014 speed crucial . The GPU is essentially a duopoly by and AMD . A DPU like those made by Marvell and Nvidia is a newer type processor that is as data centers become more complex . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a blog post , \" This is going to represent one of the three pillars of computing forward . CPU is for general - purpose computing , the GPU is for accelerated computing , and the DPU , which moves data around the data center , data processing . \" Everything else : To be sure , there are many different types of chips that outside of the memory or microprocessor classifications . Examples include those used for 5 G , WiFi , Bluetooth , radiofrequency chips , near field communication chips ( ) , application - specific integrated chips ( ASICs ) , and so on . These chips are made by Qualcomm , Marvell Technology , Broadcom ( ) , Semiconductor , NXP Semiconductor ( NXPI ) , and others . Rather than a dive each one \u2014 beyond the scope of this foundry industry analysis \u2014 we simply want to highlight that the term semiconductor applies to a broad array of chips designed for different purposes and to different end markets that each have their own demand drivers . Bottom line When in the chip , it is crucial to understand a target company 's exposure . do necessarily need an engineering level of understanding of how the work or are , but you need to have an idea of what end market the sells into who the customers are . From there , you can begin to study the end markets to better understand demand trends . Remember , at the end of the day , your primary question and the goal of your research to understand where the is flowing . That 's true for all investments but especially so when comes to semiconductors . Because they are everywhere but almost never seen , it 's not as easy as saying , \" Apple is going to sell a lot of iPhones this quarter . \" Chances are nobody will be sitting around the Thanksgiving table talking about excited they are for the next - generation memory and microprocessors . , when you do about that new gadget everyone ca n't wait get their hands on , ask yourself , \" What semiconductors are sitting inside it ? \" Despite being a boom / bust industry , sales do tend to increase over the years , and demand throughout the cycle increases thanks to the growing prevalence of semiconductors in our daily lives , more chips into each device smaller and smaller form factors . The iPhone , for example , did n't always have light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) , it does now support new and that means another chip packed in the handset . While do see secular growth on longer , the suffers from brutal boom and bust dynamics . Supply and demand drives all industries , but the semiconductor industry in particular is incredibly sensitive to it . Chipmakers have significant pricing power when demand outstrips , as we 've seen recent ; new cars will sit in the lot collecting dust manufacturers wait for a key chip . But we see that pricing power turn on a dime once demand , leading to less pricing power gluts that must be addressed before the next cycle can kick off .

Over years , American have retired a handful of and tactics that , due to some combination of cost and , outlived their usefulness . in some cases , they have resurfaced to take on new enemies , and have proven themselves more than capable in the . most recent example comes courtesy of the US Air Force . After being retired in late 1980s , the Warthog attack was off for service the Middle East other theaters of operation around the world in response to the global war on terror . And despite its age and lack of some the more sophisticated technologies found on jets , it \u2019s a workhorse for the Air , racking up one of longest kill lists in American military . [[ ]] The is n\u2019t the only , however . Going more than a century , military has found multiple uses the same old gear . Here are three occasions the US brought back \u201c obsolete \u201d and tactics to take on . Gatling The Gatling gun was one of first truly successful machine guns . Designed by American inventor Richard Gatling 1861 , the weapon used a barrel with chambers that could fire off multiple rounds in a short amount of time . It became important weapon in the Civil War , it continued to service during the Indian Wars and later conflicts such as the - American War . It also experienced a resurrection in the early years of the Vietnam War . by this the Gatling gun had been replaced by more weapons like M2 Browning machine gun , the US military its value providing fire and decided to resurrect it . Initially fitted with a shield protect the , it was later replaced by an open - top mount that offered greater visibility . The Colt 1911 The Colt 1911 one of the most iconic handguns ever made . It was designed firearms inventor John Moses Browning in 1911 and was the standard - issue of the US military until was replaced by the Beretta 92 in 1985 . Though the 1911 was phased out of military service , it never left the US arsenal . The pistol saw a resurgence during the war in Afghanistan when Special Operations realized it still a reliable and powerful weapon . The 1911 was dusted off and equipped with modern features such as extended beavertail grip safeties and other modifications , allowing the to remain in service for the better part of 21st century . The Dogs War Military dogs have been used for centuries in a of roles , from sentry duty to search and rescue . But perhaps the famous example of a military dog in action is German shepherd Rin Tin , who first during War I before on to star in numerous films . Dogs have remained important part of US armed forces , and they saw a new resurgence during in Afghanistan . One particularly notable example is Cairo , a Belgian Malinois military working dog who in raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin in 2011 . Dogs like Cairo have proven invaluable to US forces in the East , aiding in , tracking , and other operations . In Conclusion The US military is one of the most capable forces in the world , and it has itself and time again to be able to adapt to the changing needs of modern warfare . Weapons such as the Gatling gun , the Colt 1911 , military working dogs all seen a resurgence in years and have proven to be more than capable of taking on new enemies . As long as the US remains an active participant in the world \u2019s military conflicts , is certain that more of these \u201c obsolete \u201d weapons and tactics will called back into service .", "label": "machine"}

Establishing Ukraine as allies The historian Doris Kearns compared Zelensky \u2019s address to given by Churchill on Boxing Day in 1941 after the attack on Harbor . \u201c He \u2019s already established in the American \u2019s we \u2019re in this together , but then pointing that \u2019ll the fighting for us \u2013 \u2018 just give us tools and we will finish the job . \u2019 That what Churchill said , \u201d Goodwin told CNN \u2019s Anderson Cooper Wednesday evening . \u2019s important perception for the US since Ukraine , importantly , is not an official member of NATO , the treaty Putin fears . One major reason the US has not provided more direct aid to Ukraine is concern that Putin would be provoked against NATO . Giving Zelensky a singular platform An address Congress is the ultimate platform for a foreign US and around world . It \u2019s in contrast Vladimir Putin , who his year - end press conference .

As the company proceeds through , legal filings paint a picture of FTX 's inability to control the most aspects of its business . The company failed keep track of what assets it held , or whom it employed . James Bromley , a lawyer for company , said in court that was \" run effectively as a personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman - Fried . \" The man many regulators and lawmakers viewed crypto 's foremost expert is now investigation some the same committees as crypto 's biggest con man . - Fried was hardly the first to hand of cultivating political power . But what surprised veteran observers was the skill and determination with which he went about it \u2014 and how swiftly he succeeded . \" A lot of this is the playbook , \" Niki Christoff , a political consultant in Washington . \" it was at sort of an accelerated speed \u2014 and in a way that was a little . \" any Silicon Valley engineer knows , a little is the you pay for speed . What matters , in the early going , is producing a viable product . And in the wake of Bankman - Fried 's spectacular downfall , there are signs he may have accomplished enduring . While the legislation he helped to bring into being , the Digital Commodities Consumer , is given almost no chance passing this year , some on Capitol Hill continue to it , even in the wake FTX 's spectacular collapse . Rostin Behnam , backed measure as chair of the CFTC , told Congress last that lawmakers should simply \" pause look at the bill and make there are gaps or no holes . \" And the bill sponsors \u2014 Sens .

As you 'll soon see , some it is confusing , if not outright contradictory . 's what need to know about web opening an account . 1 . There 's a Big Difference Hosting Types If you 've spent any amount of time on a web host website , you 've probably seen terms shared , VPS , dedicated , , WordPress , and reseller . They the different web hosting , but every web host offers them all . Plus , hosting types differ from one another in significant ways . Nearly web offers shared hosting , the cheapest form web hosting . With shared hosting , your a server and with sites . If want to keep web hosting budget small , do n't expect much traffic , shared hosting is the way to go . You should expect to pay less than $ 10 month for this web hosting type . level of hosting is really best suited for sites that do n't need a huge amount of , however . Since you sharing resources with other sites , you should be prepared for the occasional slowdown should one your site - mates start a lot of visitors . Free web hosting is available if you 're on a budget , but it comes its caveats ( typically ads and extremely low server specs ) . Larger businesses that expect big traffic to their sites should pick VPS or dedicated hosting , each of which increasingly powerful server specs . VPS hosting is a high - powered version of shared hosting , except that far fewer websites share a server 's resources , which are also a bit more segregated . VPS hosting costs more shared , you should pay less than $ per month . [[ ]] Dedicated hosting places your site a all by itself , so it can leverage a server full power . This is the most expensive type hosting ; you may end up paying $ 100 per month or more for raw power . hosting lets start your own branded web hosting business worrying about building the infrastructure from scratch .

That \u2019s rise has been by many , including many members of own , is unsurprising .

This worry is understandable , of course , and McCarthy \u2019s have a point : His approach to politics seem to more about tactical maneuvering than grand ideological . it \u2019s also considering the possibility that McCarthy \u2019s detractors a flawed understanding of both him and what it means a successful speaker of the House . The \u2019s role is organize and lead the House , and to be the public face of the institution . As such , it \u2019s often necessary to compromise and to make to get things done . It also necessary to be able to build and maintain with different factions within the House and to find solutions to political problems . This is not to say that detractors are wrong in their criticisms \u2014 it \u2019s understandable , given record , some would find ascension to the Speaker \u2019s role troubling .

McCarthy \u2019s critics may also missing something else : a realistic alternative .

But his detractors think carefully about of they want and how best to achieve it .

History is complex multi - dimensional , of lessons and vivid examples . The more nuanced interpretation of idea is that history can provide us with insight and perspective , but there is often no \u201c \u201d answer . Moreover , some moments in history are better sources of than others , as some lessons may be more applicable to contemporary concerns than others . [[ ]] 2 . \u201c It Was Different Back Then \u201d This phrase is used to explain away uncomfortable aspects of the past . example , the of slavery , some might say slavery in the 19th century a different kind of institution than is today . the institution of slavery has changed over the years , it is to that the atrocities of the past remain no less relevant or severe today . Whether era of history \u201c \u201d is of secondary importance to the wrongs that were inflicted . 3 . \u201c It \u2019s Just the Way Things Are \u201d This phrase is used to significance of current , suggesting that the conflicts of today are nothing new .

While \u2019s true that people the past did not know what we know now , they did some things \u2014 there were certainly people in the past who could have had broader , more enlightened views . We should always be cautious in our retrospective judgments , there is no excuse for exonerating those who committed awful acts . 5 . \u201c History Repeats Itself \u201d [[ ]] This implies events in the past are static , that do n\u2019t change or over time . While it is true that some patterns in history have time , \u2019s important to recognize that history does not have to repeat itself \u2014 it is us to learn our mistakes and shape the future . best way to prevent history from itself is to actively work to break these cycles forge a new path forward . History is an incredibly useful and necessary tool for understanding the and the future , but it is easy to fall into the of reductionism and . The five phrases outlined just a few examples of how historians can sometimes struggle to provide meaningful into contemporary events .
