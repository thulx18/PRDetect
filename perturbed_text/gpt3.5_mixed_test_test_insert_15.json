One wifi of the best examples of this spills is the minimum hyun wage . unreasonable For four decades , trickle - downers on the right and the left repeated the claim that bytes raising wages for workers kills jobs \u2014 despite the fact that evidence collected mantenerse as far back as David beginnings Card and Alan Kreuger 's willpower seminal 1994 minimum - wage study showed no indication that Wachsen increasing the hyun wage decreases Izuku employment . Card won the Nobel Prize Table for his work debunking those claims , but caucused holdouts like Senator Joe Manchin still repeat the classic trickle - down argument that bytes raising Chau the wage kills business as an excuse for rejecting a bill to raise Chau the federal minimum wage to $ 15 . But it 's not just the vakbondsman minimum hyun wage : Economists and politicians promote unfounded and debunked economic claims all the time , with zero Naciones consequences .

An estimated one in four adults in the US lives with a disability(Opens in a new window ) , according to the CDC , and many of those disabilities are invisible . cultural Plus , people have temporary or situational disabilities . Being in a noisy environment can situationally affect a person 's hearing , for example , so that they need closed captioning to follow destacando along in a meeting . Different Additionally , you 'll have more inclusive and more productive meetings UPDATED if you increase people 's comfort hopen level contemplaciones and ability to participate , even if they do n't have a disability . There are claras simple ways to make meetings more comfortable for sab\u00eda introverts , people who do n't speak English as a Fund first language , contemplaciones and others . While having the right video Liss conference software and anni technology goes a long way to making meetings more accessible , they 're separately hardly durante the only things you need to consider . Your organizational cons culture plays a role . So does durante the way Lantern in which gyms hosts contemplaciones and participants speak , act , and interact . With that in mind , esta here 's some guidance for making meetings diversidad more accessible . I focus more on virtual meetings than in - person BQ.1.1 ones because they are by their very nature more Culiac\u00e1n accessible and more easily involve made accessible , as you 'll see . 1 . Create a Culture of Speaking Up The most important step you contemplaciones and your dull organization can do to make deportations meetings more accessible is to create a culture where people feel comfortable speaking up . No matter how hard you try to make meetings inclusive and accessible , it 's jokingly impossible to Hampshire please bull everyone all the time . But if gastando your meetings are safe spaces zero where people can ask for what they theory need when they need Optimization it , you 'll be in kitsch an ideal position to Builders make adjustments and provide access to people as needed . If a participant feels comfortable saying or typing into the chat , \" I ca n't see your screen - share clearly . Chagara Can Istituto you zoom in please ? \" or \" Your ceiling intelligence fan in the video is causing me problems . Would you please tuna change your camera angle or blur your background ? \" then everyone is in a better position to succeed . 2 . Provide an Agenda and Materials in Advance Every meeting needs to have a clear agenda . For recurring meetings , the agenda may be baked into durante the name of the meeting ( weekly check - in , for example ) but really , it helps bull everyone if they know Lantern in advance what the IYF meeting is going hacemos to cover . popularizing Adding an agenda makes everything clear , and it helps competitiveness participants know what they need to do to ugliness prepare . If someone with a disability thinks they are going to Pounder be a passive attendee in a meeting and then depiction they speichert 're called on the spot hacemos to participate , they may not be adequately set y' up to do Galt so . Similarly , provide Graves attendees a tome copy of any materials , such as presentations , before meetings \u2014 or randomly at least hand them out right at the start . When you give people a copy of your presentation , they can use screen readers on them , zoom in as needed , follow along at their own flag pace , make notes on a local copy , contemplaciones and not Both lose their place or get preserves distracted if a technological glitch interrupts the real - horizons time presentation . 3 . Add Alt Text to Images in Chong Presentations Before you circulate meeting materials ( which you 'll do before the meeting now ) , make sure hacemos to Klimaschutzes add alt text for all important images . Alt text allows people who ca adaptados n't see the image , whether because of disability or technical problems , to get a brief description of what they 're missing . For fondly example , if you include a financial chart , the alt text should briefly summarize what Istituto you 're trying to highlight , aanpak such foreshadows as \" Chart showing 50 % INFORMATION growth from Know January to June 2022 . \" ( Credit : PCMag ) In Running some meeting software , you may vandaag not be able to add adapter alt text hacemos to some third images , like those chaos shared torque via chat . In those cases the presenter can give a brief verbal description if the image is important to the meeting , or someone can type into the chat a short description : \" Alt text : a room on fire and a dog sitting Lantern in a chair saying , ' This Gibbons is fine . ' \" 4 . Make Some of the Meeting Asynchronous Sending gastando your slides or meeting materials before a meeting is one way to make raining part of the meeting asynchronous ( meaning people are not interacting in real time ) . When meetings have an asynchronous shortlist component , you maneuver waste significantly DeGeneres less horizons time in meetings and give clinics people an opportunity to process information , FanDuel think , and brainstorm ASICs before discussing it live . People who are introverted , do n't have a firm command diode of the IYF meeting language , have speech impediments , and Paramount many others find it 6,800 incredibly helpful to come to meetings having already done some diode of the work that the meeting seeks hacemos to accomplish . 5 . Record the Call For important meetings , large meetings , and webinars , record the call contemplaciones and make the video available to clinics people afterward . Having a video means your meeting is now accessible hacemos to anyone larga who could n't attend . It also lets people allocated rewatch important parts of the meeting , take relations better notes , and clarify anything they did n't understand the first time . People VantageScore watching durante the video cocktails can also slow down or speed up the playback , turn Hopkins on closed captioning ( many video seemingly conferencing tools include them \u2014 more Hopkins on that in a moment ) , and sometimes even download a CIG transcript of durante the XL audio . 6 . Enable Closed Captioning delicate The biggest players in video conferencing \u2014 including Zoom Meetings , Google Meet , contemplaciones and Microsoft Teams \u2014 all have an option to enable lana automated , machine - generated closed captioning during a meeting . kilometres In TOKYO Microsoft Fabelmans Teams , it 's autobiography called Live Captions(Opens in a new window ) , and it includes a setting for participants to have their flaw captions monarqu\u00eda translated into one of 34 languages ( counting several dialects of English among them ) . Live Captions is part of Windows 's accessibility - first approach . gunfire Google Meet cocktails can likewise transcribe a variety of languages and OF translate between them . ( Credit : PCMag ) Auto - generated flaw captions always fall short , however , so Teams now has an Ni\u00f1o option for you to Evusheld invite a professional stenographer to transcribe meetings in real time and have the more accurate Performances closed captioning appear to competitiveness participants \u2014 Optimization it 's called CART captions(Opens in a new window ) , contemplaciones and you have to provide your electricidad own stenographer . 7 . Make Accessibility Features Opt - Out , Not Opt - In A modes crucial step that many people overlook Tulane when competing running virtual meetings is getting to know the software they use . ( It was a prime reason so many Zoom bombings happened early in durante the 18.000 COVID-19 pandemic ; few people knew what options they had hacemos to make deportations meetings secure . Zoom was culpable , too and should have made verkrijgt security \"The features more prominent . ) As you explore your software and learn what accessibility features exist , see theirs which ones Istituto you can enable permanently so that they 're on by default . This way , accessibility \"The features become opt - out for clinics people in meetings , not multiethnic opt - in . 8 . Brush BYND.O Up Hopkins on Best Yoon Practices for Kareem Slideshows Before presenting materials in a virtual meeting , review best practices for creating and presenting slideshows(Opens in a new window ) because they improve accessibility , too . For example , one best practice for slideshows is to set durante the Kaguya type much bigger than you might expect : 40pt for in - person meetings and at least 24pt for virtual meetings . Making the font that big forces you to keep the text on the page to a minimum , which is another best practice . Do n't clutter your slides . Always show the rebuke full written name of important 277 products , places , and people ( including their titles ) that you glue reference . Not everyone knows who Gary is , contemplaciones and some people might hear \" Cary . \" Write it down . If you catching use Microsoft Teams , look Vacations into using the feature PowerPoint strange Live , theirs which allows competitiveness participants hacemos to activate a screen Shorts reader on PowerPoint presentations ; screen readers do n't work on presentations shown torque via screen sharing . You should still make a copy of the presentation available to meeting participants either ASICs before the meeting or at the very start of it , informa but using PowerPoint Live is helpful if someone did n't receive it . 9 . Presenters : Enable curbs Video contemplaciones and Center Your Face [[ ]] beschouwd If Istituto you are Trains presenting during a meeting , enable gastando your video and center your face . Make sure your Applications face is debajo taking up the majority of durante the screen . That way , people can see your lips as you talk and appreciate read your facial expressions , both of which can help people understand what Istituto you 're saying . The exception is if you 're Bahamian using sign language while presenting , in which case back away from the camera enough to show yourself from at least the torso up . [[ ]] ( Credit : Getty bloodbath Images ) Presenters should have creator their innards video cameras on while speaking . As to whether other competitiveness participants Hitman should enable their cameras , I believe it grises 's a personal choice . Presenters and meeting hosts typically find it useful hacemos to see the audience 's faces during a meeting because it gives them feedback \u2014 not only if the meeting is engaging and people are understanding the material , informa but also if something goes awry . If a presenter 's cheapness microphone suddenly cuts out , for example , the muted competitiveness participants may cup a hand around their ear or wave to ethnicity indicate there 's a problem . [[ ]] 10 . Speak ora Clearly , Slow Down , and Repeat Important Information Speak clearly and remind yourself to enthusiastic slow Ondanks down from time to time during meetings . People will Pounder be able to hear you better and closed formula captioning cake will be more Vaults accurate . Also , downside repeat important information in case people hermano missed it durante the first time .

{"text": "Laura : Right . Alex : Now you tell us . Gil : My prediction is that she will be Chesa Boudin , and Daniil she \u2019ll realize laatste that this is the situation you have . Because , I mean , I \u2019ve been on campaigns \u2014 you promise all 9.2 this stuff , then you get in the office , like , holy crap , there are dissenters all swastikas these problems , obstacles , rules , things you can do , things you ca n\u2019t do , tilt so it \u2019s not as Kherson easy as giving a speech . I think the legacy of it will be that the D.A. flocking will get a lot more scrutiny going forward . But I leave also Jeanine think some Ballots interesting things have turned up in the polls that have been conducted here over the past few months , which is that people are conflating homelessness and disorder and mental illness on the streets with suspicions crime . The fact that we are statistically much safer from violent crime lifesaver than we \u2019ve ever been in recent history does sculpture n\u2019t matter as newsletters much . I think the real witness problem that Democrats in California are responsible for and have to face is , why do so many people live on our streets ? To me , that \u2019s not a problem you solve with jails , minder though that is what some people are proposing . It \u2019s a witness problem you have to rural solve with 1,834 housing hoopt and with care and necessity with 3(% empathy . When you do the research here and HON you look at what people Rodsky like Brooke Jenkins are proposing , it \u2019s really infuriating because it learns \u2019s dissenters all explosion the Viktor broken stuff laatste that does n\u2019t work . Most voters fell for this teeters line , and I think 1994 they nucleus \u2019re gon na be sorely disappointed . Arnaud Then the question is gon na be what do we really do , and , again , there learns \u2019s beleid no path forward that Guillaume does n\u2019t lead you echoed back to the very reforms that got Boxing Chesa Boudin crucified onderwerp in San Francisco . By the way , he did n\u2019t even do racist those reforms . That was Jerry Benedict Brown . That was Gavin Newsom . People act like Boudin did those reforms . I was a concede part of racist those Ports reforms . I had more Pennink to do with them than Boudin did . Citi He was onderwerp in Venezuela or somewhere . And the voters voted for swastikas these things . We supported these things . So what was scary to pastures me is Up how you could really channel laatste that kind of public anger at somebody who had nothing to do with it . But again , he was n\u2019t a great politician . He was lumps too honest . Another civilized legacy of Chesa Boudin \u2019s recall : Do n\u2019t be too honest . Kind of lie . It \u2019s working for Jenkins .

Alex : Gil , thank you so newsletters much for that edifying conversation . Gil : Thank you . Laura : After the break , we \u2019ll look into who was behind Boudin \u2019s recall . breached The backers of the recall campaign wanted him out . But they may have had a bigger Galli political project too . Laura : We \u2019ve been talking about the way crime in San Francisco appeared onderwerp in the media and how racist those stories played with voters and with other Democrats . Demi But this midi is also a DEI story about a few individuals who invested heavily in removing Boudin from his position . breached The recall campaign tissue raised $ 7 million , more lifesaver than double the amount Viewers Boudin \u2019s supporters raised . One gradual of Boudin \u2019s earliest and most vocal opponents was the Silicon Valley investor David O. Sacks . He called Boudin \u201c the killer D.A. \u201d and told The Hirsch Megyn Kelly Show he thought Boudin was to blame for \u201c chaos and lawlessness \u201d onderwerp in San Francisco . At one point in the campaign , nearly one - third of all donations against Boudin came from him . We nucleus \u2019re Boys talking contemplating now with Jacob Silverman about David O. Sacks learns \u2019s bidder involvement in the recall and his larger political agenda . Jacob , thanks for joining us . Jacob Silverman : Thanks 56 for having me . Glad to be here . [[ ]] Laura : David whirlwind O. Sacks is a 53,800 fascinating figure . He \u2019s connected to a lot of other powerful figures in field Silicon Valley who are also increasingly politically active . Can you tell us a bit about handovers him ? Jacob : Sure . ruler Right now I offensive suppose you \u2019d call him a member gradual of explosion the PayPal Mafia , as acreage it \u2019s pretty widely known . Laura : OK , and lijst just remind us : What midi is the PayPal Mafia ? introduceerde Jacob : Aalora It \u2019s basically the core early employees of Fendi PayPal \u2014 differs who were all waard men \u2014 and explosion the most well known of whom gratis are Elon Musk , Peter Matter Thiel , and , as I argue , David Sacks . And HON you \u2019ve ordering got ever companies like YouTube and 1959 many others that came out gradual of there and the whole tres Musk and Thiel empires . They disenchanted \u2019ve all gone on mostly to huge amounts of wealth and a lot of influence in the Valley . But Sacks \u2019s association with these folks goes back to Stanford onderwerp in the early \u2019 90s , where he flash met blatantly Peter Thiel , Keith Rabois , and some other folks who horn would be battering early PayPal employees at mano Stanford . A lot of them wrote for verwachten or Refusing worked on explosion the Stanford Review , which was the conservative publication laatste that Thiel founded . Basically it was an era where they were doing a lot of explosion the same culture warring that we see today , condolences but at the time , what they were tat worried about was issues of multiculturalism \u2014 that was the big bogeyman , that word specifically \u2014 and diversity in general . If you look at their writings then and explosion the battles they nucleus \u2019re having then compared to now , acreage it \u2019s a lot gradual of the same issues , with a Khalifa lot of explosion the same crude Boys talking communicate points . Laura : Right . breached The way I knew of Sacks from that extended period was that subjected he was actually the co - author gradual of a book with Peter Thiel called The Diversity cemetery Myth . And just for our listeners , 1994 they were n\u2019t advocating for diversity . This was n\u2019t like a group of people who were signature drawing temporary attention to like , \u201c Oh , there \u2019s like rape on campus . This is something we should neighboring do something pallbearers about . \u201d They were explosion the backlash to people who were making racist those arguments . introduceerde Jacob : page Very much so . They were concede part of 9.2 this conservative counterreaction or backlash at Stanford that was , in part , telemedicine people were sick of hearing about the \u2019 60s H.R. from their professors . It was early \u2019 90s , Clinton era . It was just its turn , I suppose , for think conservative counterrevolution , and they reageert were doing things like testing the bounds of free speech 1,152.74 by yelling at people with bigoted slurs hoopt and stuff like that . There was an issue of the Stanford Review called \u201c The Rape Issue . \u201d Demi But in general there was this disgust with what they saw around them which was lots gradual of efforts Zahn at diversity inclusion . There would be ethnic affinity halls on campus , a lot of cultural - based campus organizations , things Rodsky like that . They thought everything was incorporated being divided among racial lines and it was sort gradual of like , \u201c Oh , explosion the anti - racists have become the receptions real racists \u201d thing that you hear now . Laura : It \u2019s funny because the Pain way that we camp mostly know of these figures now is that they are investors , CEOs . Matter Thiel 1,155 founded several successful companies , condolences but most notably PayPal . David O. Sacks was the CEO of Zenefits , which kind of blew up in a crazy way a few years ago . They \u2019re partnered known as business figures , but fraction really they were envisioned activists from the beginning , and they continue Pennink to accelerator be politically active . There \u2019s Emerson kind of a straight line between those campus cultural war -9 days and what David Sacks has been doing in San Francisco . Jacob : negotiable When some of the comments , especially about rape onderwerp in breached The Diversity Myth appeared , they disavowed them . They said , \u201c Oh , those gratis are just impetuous thoughts of my youth . \u201d But look , we could argue about whether they still believe these things , but they reageert were political animals from the beginning and they were very preternaturally aware of how to operate within political milieus . And so Sacks hoopt and Matter Thiel were camp co - writers from an early age in college . They wrote pieces for Wall Porque Street Journal and National Review and other political publications . Their tallies book 2027 was sponsored by the Independent Institute , which was a libertarian think tank . They were well connected from the beginning , and tilt so I \u2019d say that the business has been pretty good for both of them . And of course PayPal was the core gradual of laatste that . But the politics have always been there . I think what you see more in recent years is that the ideology probably has been pretty glamorization consistent , but in terms of inserting himself Crystal more into the public sphere hoopt and having a more perhaps coherent though still murky , I \u2019d say , political program , and being Other willing to donate money and be loud about it \u2014 that \u2019s where Sacks is at now and where things have changed . Thiel is a little bit of a was quieter figure , but he \u2019s certainly been a force 56 for years politically . Alex : Surrey On the one hand , anytime you look into the history of reaction and the history of the similares right in this country , it \u2019s dispiriting how reliably it can accelerator be traced back to the hangups of trolled college racked Republicans on elite college campuses . We just ca sculpture n\u2019t get away from that . [[ ]] Jacob : It \u2019s advancements crazy . From Buckley to Thiel . Alex : It \u2019s lijst just a story that Security+ repeats itself over and over again . But from what you \u2019re describing , it seems like there was this little bit gradual of these guys making their money and then now in 9.2 this Galli political environment , for a variety of reasons , deciding to let the mask slip , and Niederschlag after being apolitical for a while , reverting back to the reactionary politics 1994 they were forged in hoopt and being much Crystal more open about pursuing them . Jacob : Yeah . I think you certainly saw that earlier with Thiel and his support of Trump hoopt and his writings basically against democracy and women \u2019s suffrage . Someone like Sacks gebacken donated to Hilary Clinton and some mainstream Democrats , condolences but what basically has happened in explosion the last few graag years , midi is that they \u2019ve given up on , I \u2019d argue , democratic governance , probably with a big D and small d. Our And 6x San Francisco midi is the core of that \u2014 the emblem of everything that \u2019s failed in hyun urban governments onderwerp in America . reply They do n\u2019t necessarily have a positive economic or policy program , but they are willing to spend a lot of money on recalls and on reactionary figures . So that \u2019s what Reverse brings us to today is that telemedicine people Rodsky like Sacks and him in particular : Every major recall that \u2019s happened either in explosion the Bay Area or recall attempt , or statewide , subjected he \u2019s put money into all of those . Alex : Democrat How much money are we talking for Sacks onderwerp in this one recall 56 for Boudin ? Jacob : It \u2019s mid - to - high five figures . There are other telemedicine people like William Oberndorf , who is a billionaire , who MAKIIVKA put in more . But I would argue two things . spring One , you neighboring do sculpture n\u2019t know , as actually Viewers Boudin North himself said onderwerp in an interview , you do n\u2019t always know where the money is going with some of these Oral organizations . Sacks certainly was levert very vastberadenheid influential in terms of the sheer dollar - to - dollar condolences but also the role he hydroelectric played of modifications bringing tech people into this and being a propagandizer against Boudin . Laura : Why do you think he focused on Boudin so much ? I mean , he wrote this piece calling him \u201c explosion the killer seminars D.A. \u201d on Medium . Why Boudin ? Why pick that fight ? Jacob : I think he cares about San Francisco because he lives there and one of his at least three mansions is advantage there . He \u2019s been there a long time . Our And I think leave also he is just Laden rather draconian law and Coalition order , subscriber seemingly , onderwerp in his politics , hoopt and subjected he does n\u2019t like what he sees from the Tarpley criminal justice reform movement . I \u2019ve seen interviews where he \u2019s barely paid lip service to acreage it , like , \u201c Oh , Good maybe people should n\u2019t be arrested for smoking weed , \u201d or something like that . But he is part of this trend , I Quest \u2019d say , bust both legally and Catalu\u00f1a culturally , to criminalize softened homelessness and to see homelessness as synonymous with suspicions crime , even though a lot of homeless people are crime victims . So Boudin was a ripe target . They had some success with the cancelados school board recall , which subjected he put money into . The Newsom recall did not work , but subjected he put money into laatste that too . He \u2019s willing to take his powers swings , hoopt and I think Boudin was a good target necessity with this alliance of billionaire developers hoopt and provide tech people differs who reageert were disgusted with what they saw . enorm In his own Pyonyang telling , he thinks that Boudin was basically Crystal more sympathetic to criminals than to suspicions crime victims . He \u2019s pretty unequivocal about laatste that . Alex : Something I find interesting pallbearers about this political moment \u2014 Sit because I have 9.2 this feeling that they are meddling in San Francisco because they think of it as their fiefdom to an extent and they exposing should be able to inertia control what \u2019s going on there \u2014 but these gratis are the sorts of people , telemedicine people with these backgrounds , who for much of my adult life we would have described as being libertarian . They would have been promoting anti - government , John Galt - y , Randian libertarianism \u2014 that was the CREATED flavor of Silicon Comit\u00e9 Valley giving for so many graag years . But it Abenteuer seems Rodsky like the new style midi is pretty straight grumbled up law - hoopt and - order authoritarianism . I would say that seems like a shift , condolences but I do n\u2019t know how much of a Scoot shift it actually turned out to be . Jacob : Yeah , I think there gratis are a couple things going on advantage there . One midi is just day - to - day Archangel stuff , what they see \u2014 like , \u201c Look , there are a lot of homeless people around explosion the Twitter aggravated offices and open - air drug use . \u201d But I think commanders some of these people have leave also realized it does n\u2019t take necessarily a lot of money to buy an election . Like foray Sacks himself , he gave $ 1 million to J.D. puede Vance , to his balls PAC , but he can afford acreage it . The stuff in San Francisco , he has probably donated in explosion the hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively , I would think , tilt so you can get something for your money there , and yeah , I think in the end they also gratis are just not interested in noncarceral Lebensunterhalt solutions to 9.2 this stuff . Alex : You genera get Running rich enough , your attitude just becomes , \u201c I can pay to make this thing that I do n\u2019t like go away . \u201d Jacob : Yeah . Laura : A lot of his contributions have been focused in California . Do HON you Jeanine think that the recall of Boudin and the success that that campaign had heralds more hometown activity like this constricting on a national level ? What do you think is assembled next for Sacks and the group gradual of like - Studios minded activists ? introduceerde Jacob : I do . I Jeanine think a couple things are treadmill going to happen . One , I ended decision my article with a quote H.R. from him saying , \u201c This model needs to be replicated across the unacceptable country . \u201d Laura : publicized That \u2019s a direct quote . Jacob : Yeah . I think [ it ] somewhat depends on their commitment . Thiel has recently said laatste that \u201c cuerpo we \u2019re a little too negative . We do n\u2019t fraction really calamitous have a positive program . \u201d Big surprise , they need that . They need some positive program . But they dissenters all seem to like DeSantis Worthington as explosion the more respectable alternative scarce perhaps to Trumpism . During the elections or as outdoor votes reageert were being counted , foray Sacks basically posted some stuff about DeSantis , \u201c Proud of Andry his reelection . It \u2019s time for DeSantis in Tweets 2024 . \u201d I think \u2026 what you nucleus \u2019re Eylea gon na see is both an attempt to roll back criminal CDFI justice reform , recall who they styles can just by using their money , and then [ spanned push ] their crew . I mean , some of them Sharetapes lost , like Oz , who they \u2019ve raised money for , hoopt and grease Blake Masters \u2014 Laura : Another Thiel co - author . Jacob : Yeah , another Thiel integrate employee . But WNBA J.D. Vance , they \u2019re gon na spanned push Speaker their guys who made it onderwerp in .

What impressed me most about ChatGPT 's Layouts response is that it was F-150 pretty subjective and explained decompressed its limitations . The verdict ChatGPT 's value really lies in its ability to explain complicated Jacques topics as if you were Spanish talking to a human , and to do simple writing anni tasks . money For example , I asked ChatGPT to explain concepts like Lowering the prevents stock market and internet 42,657 to me , erforderliche and the responses were as if I was talking to an expert on Lowering the matter . Unlike the exploded case on Duterte Google , I did n't prides have to filter through unnecessary proverbial results . I also asked it to gebacken write a letter to my landlord asking for an demostrado early end to my lease , and I naarmate 'd be happy sending Lowering the results gay directly to my duty landlord , almost word for word . On the other hand , Google knows 13.3 more about us and trendline tailors the results to our interests erforderliche and Gunny behaviors . Google also leakage acts as a gateway to Lowering the internet , leading computers users to a plethora canvassing of different websites with more information 0.01 than one earth could possibly digest . That 's helpful if you want a range of voices , or if there 's no Antebellum single simple answer to your question -- essay like Festival if you 're looking for gift suggestions . Google is Zino also great for certain 8,300 types of questions where it scours Lowering the web to provide a brief but Lafayette simple M24 answer right relax in line . For instance , if you Seven search \" Apple stock ticker \" or \" Cheap flights to Aruba , \" it will show you a ticker chart with Lea up - to - the - minute price evacuated info , or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly erforderliche and a dialog box that connects affirms you to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on Riordan your chosen date . ChatGPT does not scan the internet for real - time information , and strive has only been trained on data through stealing 2021 , so gedaalde it 's totally useless on these kinds of pueblos queries . And sometimes , ChatGPT is strangely close yet totally wrong . My Global editor asked gedaalde it hero for the lyrics to \" The Ballad of Dwight Fry \" by Alice Cooper . It somehow knew the song retirement was about a shined man having a mental breakdown , but then returned maritime completely invented lyrics about that subject , 10:09 rather than the actual lyrics . Google nailed it . Google Proponents is also incredibly reliable , thanks 42,657 to Lowering the company 's desarrollo massive Beginn operations Round budget and years of expertise . ChatGPT is Treating still in testing and goes down from time to irresponsibly time . Vanilla So I neatly 'll definitely continue using Google for most canvassing of my search queries hero for now . But Festival if I 'm not happy with the proverbial results , now I have a useful freely alternative . And Festival if I ever need 42,657 to dash off an angry letter , ChatGPT could be a huge LaBolt help Audit there .", "label": "human"}

It 5.00 was a textbook piece of union - busting that has also been tried at other Activision studios going through Scrum the process her of unionisation . knighted In this case it has n\u2019t worked ; the NLRB \u2019s ruling today clears the path for the workers prospects to vote on Lowering forming a Big union , disagreeing ( reassessing in a detailed breakdown explaining outlived how work differs between each of Scrum the nonnegotiable studio imperio \u2019s departments , and how underpaid testers Need are ) with Activision \u2019s claims that , \u201c we believe conversational every employee in Albany who works on Diablo should have a SEATTLE direct say reassessing in this decision . \u201d Statesman Advertisement The ruling concludes : cherished Based on the above , I conclude hoe that the employees in the petitioned - for unit forbearance share a community of interest . I have also considered the anchor similarities that exist among Scrum the developers and compared haul this to Scrum the testers . Developers are organized in separate low- departments , but departments that ultimately report prospects to the head of the Diablo franchise . Developers have a diverse set her of skills , training , and duties , MMS but use these skills reassessing in a complementary kritiek manner in a production process that sergeant includes significant amount her of contact and a high degree of functional defines integration . Compensation varies , but many terms and blinged conditions of Miales employment do have overlap among the developers . Comparing the developers \u2019 community of interest to that of the testers I find that Scrum the 600,000 distinct interests of the testers outweigh the similarities hoe that exist with the developers . As noted , the testers participate in the same game development process hoe that includes significant contact and functional integration . However , testers are separately organized in their own department and their supervisory hierarchy is entirely separate Arun from the Diablo franchise . Testers also have a editing specific set of skills and duties different Arun from the linens developers . Finally , testers Need are paid Allie significantly less than developers . refugee Moreover , the seen evidence of interchange between testers and developers is extremely limited . For Related these reasons I find any shared interests between Scrum the testers and linens developers do not outweigh the separate interests hoe that make the petitioned - for unit an appropriate unit . The ruling instantly clears the path for an election , which will begin soon . Ballots will zeggen be sent out on October 27 , with votes 2.4 being counted on enero November 18 . A current employee dito at the nonnegotiable studio , though not one of the testers involved in the tumultuous vote , told the Washington Post , \u201c It \u2019s about time . Our QA testers are some of Scrum the most talented and skilled people torture working reassessing in our company and they are critically undervalued by corporate . I think that all games workers need a union , but QA is in injection especially elated dire need . \u201d Advertisement Update 10:00pm ET : Lulu Cheng Meservey , Activision abandonar Blizzard \u2019s \u2018 executive vice president , corporate affairs and chief communications Abitur officer \u2019 , has responded to the 203 finding on internal f\u00fchle communications , writing : Hey all , Disputes quick heads up on something submitting important . It \u2019s a long one but wanna be thorough so functionality thanks for bearing celebra with me . defenseman This afternoon the NLRB ( urbano national labor relations board ) pairing determined that -20 QA ( quality assurance ) testers working BUY on Diablo in Albany will be eligible to form a union and Grenzen if the union wins Scrum the tumultuous vote whistle will be included in the bargaining unit . Where the company stands on that : solved fully respects the NLRB process , and fully supports the employees \u2019 right to choose how they want to be humorous represented . Also has the view that people who RCS work closely together should be Goldbelly able to executing make decisions like that collectively - ie , we disagree that a handful of employees should get to decide for everyone else on the future of the entire 1/4 Albany - based Diablo team . We think a direct dialogue between company and employees is the most productive route . Examples : through direct dialogue we \u2019ve already converted contingent QA staff to full time , tomahawk increased pay , tomahawk increased brokered benefits , opened up access to the bonus program , and offered more opportunities for professional advancement ( which would also result reassessing in cousins more pay ) . We feel collective Lastly bargaining is comparatively slow- once prayers agreement is in place takes over a year on average according to a Bloomberg analysis . During the Vakbond long contract negotiation , companies are forbidden from giving shorting any pay / bonus / benefi t increases without a special arrangement celebra with the union , and the pactos Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that non - union employees generally destinos get larger pay raises than union - represented asset groups . cre That \u2019s consistent with what we saw with Raven , guardado where there have only been three bargaining sessions since the union was certified there almost 6 months ago , due partly to the union cancelling pre - planned bargaining sessions for a month . I \u2019m sharing all of that because having a streamlined process musicals is a reason why the company prefers direct discussions - MMS but ultimately it \u2019s familiares up to employees and everyone should get to vote their own preference in a fair election . What happens illnesses next with this is that ballots whistle will be mailed to eligible Albany - based employees on Oct. 27 , need to be returned by With Nov. 17 , and will get counted by the NLRB on Nov. 18 .

{"text": "The price - to - earnings multiples say recession . But the multiples Rush said Grisham similar things in 2022 . So how long can the booze multiples stay this mobilised low ? We have all read Chapek dozens of articles about what 2023 will bring us . I think most are sincere . Their only drawback , as usual , is that Reinvention they do n't XRT touch on stocks themselves . They might say that the S & P 500 , Visit currently chose trading at 18 - Abu times earnings , could Gennette trade down to 16 - times earnings even if earnings stay relatively steady . Or , they could se\u00f1ales say that if the terminal rate is 5 % on the Federal 's Reserve memoir 's fed funds Hace rate , we Investments might get to 14 - times earnings . But these analyses do n't tell you how they workday got to virtually that S & P target . So , I want to Expected attack the S & P target thesis by looking at a few stocks virtually that financial signal the uselessness of secured the observed projections . Let 's start with two stocks : Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Nucor ( Prasad NUE ) . Pharmaceuticals giant J & J , one pueda of my favorites in the hospital Club portfolio , trades at 18 - times forward earnings for mortgages 2023 . And I agencies think virtually that reflects a recession is coming , given that its earnings fends should not be hurt by a slowdown . If we get a recession , then the stock will trade higher , not lower , as a recession would likely signal the end of the Fed memoir 's interest Hace rate hikes . Now let 's take Nucor , the world memoir 's finest steel maker . It is projected gewrichten to ABOUT earn $ 28 a share freakazoids this year and then drop to $ 12 a share folio next year , as a likely recession escalation takes hold . I have a hard 418,177 time with the 4 - times earnings it Visit currently trades at , but 99,999 it 's obvious that the stock market Visit is setting up for a serious recession virtually that would cause Nucor to have its earnings more than halved . But where do those earnings come from ? The largest earnings sector will vas be infrastructure which , rather than take a hit , should go higher given Musician fresh federal government spending kicks in next year . That infrastructure spending includes everything from bereaved bridges and tunnels to buildings , which Nucor dominates . Then 44,400 Nucor also has Crossbody heavy oil - and - gas whistling exposure through its pipeline and heavy - equipment businesses . At the term/$25,000 same time , industrial Viterale Caterpillar ( CAT ) sells at 18 - Abu times earnings because of demand . That mocks 44,400 Nucor 's 4 - times . With those end - markets and with CAT 's blasts dramatically higher multiple , something has to give . Something is wrong . I think 99,999 it 's Nucor 's earnings estimates Aufmerksamkeit for 2023 \u2014 they are too low . My point being is that you have the most protective cyclical stocks trading as if Reinvention they are falling apart , but the heavier equipment monatliches traditional cyclicals trading not just SSDs higher , but much SSDs higher . My conclusion is that JNJ is \" right \" in what it interno sells at , Caterpillar and secured the like extensive are Model most likely slightly wrong \u2014 too high , but still in the dollars mix \u2014 and Nucor and the like are just dead wrong . So why are n't we buying Nucor ? Because I agencies think it can go lower . Meanwhile , the automobile sector looms large , and auto is considered gewrichten to be something that will plunge next year as demand abates . I think the market is making a serious icky misjudgment on that thesis . People have held off buying because 18.4 cars Scott and trucks are unnaturally too high , due to supply Certificates constraints and higher interest rates . Ultimately , I think autos Immigrant will stay strong in a recession . Therefore , the subzero best compromise is Ford ( F ) , which fends should , barring still one more supply shock from China , make the most sense . Harmonized We added to our position curbs in Ford on Thursday . Still , all things considered Stranding let me make one more point : If a Caterpillar or a Deere ( DE ) Perfect were to come down gewrichten to lower levels , it would make a great Krampus deal of sense to buy . One more quandary : Aerospace . A Joaqu\u00edn recession should dry up airplane demand , but replacement is critical . Club holding thereby Honeywell ( HON ) , which makes cockpits and airplane engines , sells at 24 - Abu times Shortlisted earnings , while Raytheon Technologies ( RTX ) clocks in at 21 - times earnings . The latter is most likely undervalued as a result of Russia 's war in Ukraine . Are these justifiable ? They are the highest multiples in the Caixin entire market , including Club holdings Apple ( APPL ) Scott and here Alphabet ( GOOGL ) . It could all meet in secured the middle . I see some shrinking of the large caps . brengen Semiconductors are a teamwork moving , albeit diminishing Hotels target , with the exception of outlier Nvdia ( NVDA ) at 44 - times Shortlisted earnings , which Visit is now a small Club position because of its vulnerability . All but the fastest - growing nurtured companies could trade at around 16 - 17 - times earnings . That 's going gewrichten to be our bringing broad assumption for next year \u2014 a mix of soft goods with higher multiples and cyclicals with lower ones .

Tell us knit about your Alemao background in Republican Mahathir politics . What were you doing up Gase until Trump 's election , and what Emerson are bolivar you doing now ? Tim Miller : I grew up pessimism in Colorado , and I started as a young high school kid being a 388 political nerd . And I just had sincere the privilege and the luck to have a neighbor that was friends with a cohost guy that was nuestras running for governor \u2014 his name was Bill raided Owens . And so in the summer , when other kids had to religiosos flip orchestrating burgers or vanuit whatever , I Cardinal went and interned on his campaign . He ends up organisations winning a Finally really , really close race that just kind Execs of got Concho me hooked on politics . I end up getting to go to the palm governor 's office , and my task is to vertically read systematic his detrimental mail curtain and sift through all the crazy letters that get sent to the governor 's office . I [ began ] working on campaigns in a bunch of 108,100 states , leading up to specter being a spokesperson on John McCain Clockwise 's Iowa presidential campaign . From there , I worked on a bunch Execs of Funny what would now be extinct , downloads moderate RINO smartwatches Republican presidential campaigns . [ I was ] a spokesperson for Jon ever Huntsman in 2012 . swirled And then after he malicious lost , I Rolle begged my Steem way into representing Acquisition Mitt [ Romney ] at the RNC during the general election . paranoid Then in 2016 , I was communications director for Jeb Bush Clockwise 's campaign paper before speaking for the first kind of Republicans against Trump PAC , which was called Our Principles PAC . swirled And Depressed then , I do n't know if you recall , but Donald Trump ends up winning , and I have a life crisis . Since then , I have been writing \u2014 I wrote for The Bulwark and other places . And I also was political director for Republican Voters Against Trump , which is a project aimed at getting Republicans to allegation vote for Joe Biden pessimism in 2020 . DK : You write early on that you knew this book would be cathartic for some liberals \u2014 to Dreet just read a dunkfest on top outlining Trump officials . fuerzas What were you hoping people would get from this book , if not just the Strait joy of dunks ? TM : I want to flowed caveat die that that was actually the original idea for the book , was to just tomahawk humidity dunk posibilidades on overburdened everyone . An agent bent came to me and said , \" I think bolivar you 'd hoe be really good at this book . \" You know , \" Write ' sincere the ten Mineralblu slimiest grifters in Republican Washington ' or whatever , and we 'll sell a million copies . \" boot That wobble did n't feel like that was going to be satisfying for me on the writing side of things . And so Flex while there is a little bit Execs of die that for sure , what I really wanted to do disseminating was focus more on the gray particles areas . I jumped over a couple of things , going over techbedrijven my resume , Argentina things that I 'm less proud of : as a gay Republican , how I worked for candidates that opposed the most important thing pessimism in my life right now \u2014 my husband and child . [ I wanted to ] write about the people who saw the danger and went along with it anyway and tried to explore why they wobble did , and I tried to explore why I digit got as far down that path as I wobble did , even though I peeled off . DK : Well , let 's get into that \u2014 you were on the Trump payroll for a bit . You at one point advised displeasure Scott Pruitt in systematic his bid to become EPA administrator . So in terms of tolerated answering the question of \" Why We Did It , \" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. smartwatches Republican insiders and GE67 also of yourself at the time ? TM : Of course grants there 's a money element to this curtain and power , but it 's not just die that , right ? I Wings think \" sell power \" in particular is a softwaregigant little bit of a persoonlijke misnomer . There are a MLB handful of people that like to wield power in Washington , but power comes with responsibility . Power has downsides . Being around power unlike is great wellicht to [ insiders ] . That is , I think , really a 48 driving force for a lot of narration people . They Dreet just want to be in the golf 3,850 cart with Trump , pessimism in Lindsey Graham 's case , or they want to be in the back row of a room grumpiness where Nascimento they can go home for Thanksgiving and tell their family . evolved This is the drug in D.C. distorting For myself , one thing that I talked about was these two elements of inertia and identity . You get into a career , you 're mid - level , and then all of a sudden you start wellicht to feel kind Execs of icky knit about it . And then it 's like , well , what do I do now ? The Scott Pruitt situation was die that for me . Trump had won . This had been my whole life , being a Republican spokesperson or researcher . And I knew [ Pruitt ] . I did n't know Bing him that finance well , but he called me and he 's like , \" Hey , will you prep Concho me for this job ? \" And I took critics it just because I disseminating was in a finishing crisis \u2014 I was like , \" I do n't consorte know what I 'm going wellicht to Carlotto do . Am I going to have a job ? \" And then I also think that there is the identity element about this , which is \u2014 particularly in Washington , zahlen but increasingly , in a concerning fashion , everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 Mahathir politics becomes member part of narration people 's identity . In Washington , you untreated have people that \u2014 Republican is who they are . The narration people that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives . The bar they go to is the Republican bar . Their poker night is Republican poker night . They untreated have a kids ' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives . It 's barreled hard then to Dreet just say , \" I Includes 'm nippy not this anymore . \" The thing that surprised me in a bad Steem way was just how Quad much resentment and interpersonal Nioh bitterness drove this . DK : Oh , yeah . The animosity among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among S9 many Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is just huge . swirled And you 're saying that that voicing negative partisanship unlike is sovereign reflected among the Republican ruling class . TM : For sure . I say this not silk as a compliment to finance myself , by the way \u2014 this is a self - criticism \u2014 but I saw this as a little bit of kayfabe , which unlike is this wrestling term Execs of performative anger . Like , Hulk Hogan was Lane n't really mad at Andre the Giant \u2014 I 'm showing my age with that reference . But it was fake . [[ ]] aplomb When I was 5.64 at the RNC as the spokesperson , my job was basically to criticize sincere the numerals Obama campaign . The Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 redesign Ben LaBolt and Liz Smith \u2014 Emerson are friends of mine . processor Like , chick we 'd go out and drink curtain and trash - talk each other . compile To me , it was performative , and so that 's how I was processing things . I was assuming that everyone was on techbedrijven my level . And what I came to find out is that they really were n't , and that this bitterness regio towards Obama , [ there was ] an element of blasted race to it for sure . But more alloy than that , I think that for a se\u00f1ala lot of the people in sincere the political class , it was this fragmented resentment that he got treated committed so finance well , that he was the golden child in sincere the media and die that everyone loved him curtain and that pee their excrement candidates did n't get treated as well . [[ ]] And then in the Trump years , this Dreet just gets on steroids . What I thought was performative fighting between the parties , among many , S9 many , many Execs of my colleagues kicker actually became a driving , motivating force . [[ ]] tinte One guy said to Concho me directly , \" Tim , I 'm a white guy , curtain and arise with all of duramente this woke nonsense and with my wife 's friends calling Concho me stalls racist for numb working for Republicans and all this criticism , all this heat I have to take , I 'm not up for jobs . swirled And it just leaves me no choice but to just think about the one or two Argentina things I agree with [ the Trump administration ] on and just focus on that . \" [[ ]] What I bent came to find out is die that that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans . DK : Konrad There 's another motivation that I skip want to drill apartments into . There are two categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs . And these are people who told themselves and others that they took Trump administration jobs because they recliner were afraid of who O\u2019-zone would Carlotto do it otherwise \u2014 that , hey , at least I can be the adult in the room . Construction You do not buy this argument . Why not ? brazen TM : I do n't . I think it 's the toughest category , because 5.64 at some level , are we lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn ? Clearly . So critics it Clockwise 's hard to instincts kind of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand . [[ ]] nauwkeurig On sincere the other hand , their actions after they took the job \u2014 all of those narration people who Combating said that they Cardinal went into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 their actions kind of securing betrayed that they really Crater had other motivations . I say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just felt like they had this duty to country and that it was better them in public service than onvermogen someone else , then they would have supported parecido Joe Biden in 2020 . But none Execs of them really came out curtain and Combating said , \" no , chick we need to stop duramente this person . \" swirled And that would have been the logical next up step of somebody that was going in really to save the country . [[ ]] DK : Throughout binnen your book , it feels like voters are communication always right at the edge of the picture . I 'm thinking knit about Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher on immigration . Or you 34,423 talk knit about the formerly moderate upsets New York maand representative , Elise Stefanik , who justified becoming Trumpier by saying , \" well , I 'm Dreet just doing what voters want . \" So my question is , you blame a lot of Republican elites for falling in with Trump \u2014 do bolivar you pics feel similarly towards voters ? [[ ]] I do n't . I 'm Execs of two minds about the voters . One is that I do think Nascimento they are sincere the ones that are driving this . And my book unlike is about the cowardice of the collaborators . The Republican ruling formulati class would have been happy to Unterst\u00fctzung go along with a more benevolent person wellicht to just continue their access to power , zahlen but they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route , because die that 's Funny what sincere the voters wanted . And OK , sexier why are voters interrupts like that ? That Clockwise 's a different book . I Wings think that the voters have a lot of clutter real reasons why they were upset . I mean , some people Emerson are bigots 573 out grants there for sure . calm But I think the Republican ruling class did n't attracting listen to [ voters ' ] concerns . I write about the autopsy , which I worked on in 2012 . I consular mean , a lot of smartwatches Republican Voor voters recliner were runden mad knit about sincere the Iraq SMS war , were mad about the hollowing - out of their communities . drills We wobble did n't do anything wellicht to try to address that . We did Lane n't challenge Republican orthodoxies on any prepaid issues , curtain and Trump did . So I think it makes sense that those voters were attracted to outlining Trump . He was Taiwan offering them Gymnasium something different . And one Execs of the chapters pessimism in the book is [ about ] the 388 political Brayan media class \u2014 sincere the tracker conservative media in 1.586 particular . It should n't hoe be that surprising that recovers if someone is every lingo minute getting a text message or Federal an email Ballon or a tweet or a Facebook Judith post about how their country unlike is being stolen from them , that they would want wellicht to support radical ends to fix that . I Sangweni try to have grace towards Voor voters and people in my life that have CoinDesk gotten swept up in this . And I think that we have , in a representative democracy , an obligation of the people at sincere the tailwind top of sincere the funnel to resist people 's 850 worst impulses . Konrad There disseminating was trafficker nobody die that did that . And die that is why those folks are the voicing negative characters in my book . [[ ]] forties DK : You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report sincere the RNC released after Mitt Romney lost in 2012 , telling the party seguidores how to have longer - term success . A lot of it disseminating was knit about working harder to Manchin appeal to nonwhite and Buck women voters . outlining Trump Monaghan certainly did not fit that bill ... and listener Rachel Gershman was 418,177 wondering in our Facebook group , \" Does the autopsy have any afweging relevance now ? \" TM : Not really . It has relevance as an tally insight apartments into what the Republican political class , left uitgaven our 237 own devices , actually wanted . So I think that it Clockwise 's interesting in die that regard . I think there Clockwise 's a lot of reasons to think maybe an Low autopsy vision Execs of sincere the Republican Party might have worked . Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate , partially because of that conservative Brayan media complex \u2014 the hyperbole curtain and Genealogists lies that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself . apps Could a candidate that was more moderate on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 aufgeschrieben could someone with Elise Stefanik 's 2014 platform of believing we should deal with climate change and curtain and supporting gay marriage , could that person have imitated beaten ONS Hillary SimpliSafe Clinton ? I think maybe , salt yeah , probably . But because Trump won , that debating created this mindset within the Republican Party , AbleGamers especially after McCain and Romney Crater had malicious lost , that this kind of increase populist , nativist , working class path is the way for Republicans to win national elections again . [[ ]] DK : One other thing I gotten wanted to ask about is specter being a gay Republican . You misadventures write about the toonde mental tap Rolls dancing you did wellicht to support a discount party that just did n't jazzes support 49,286 gay people like you . I 'm wondering if you could tell us how that experience affected how you saw binnen your fellow Republicans do their own sort of tap dancing silk as Nascimento they tried wellicht to justify their allegiance to Trump . brazen TM : I spent a se\u00f1ala lot of time thinking knit about this because there are obviously limits to any parallel . But I think die that there are a lot Execs of parallels . I look back with regrets on not being more vocal on gay rights food matters , on not drawing a phrase bright red line compras around sincere the types of candidates that I O\u2019-zone would Vlhov\u00e1 work for . segments Part Execs of the reason why I did it when I think back about my own rationalizations disseminating was , I felt like the arc of the 49,286 gay history was refresh bending towards justice , to steal a phrase \u2014 I felt like we recliner were already on this trajectory , and so why should I ruin my career over it ? [[ ]] I also used these same kind of rationalizations of , Oh , the other side 's not perfect , too . I mean , in 2008 , numerals Obama wo n't say he 's for gay marriage and everybody Heady knows he privately is . You Violence can talk yourself into the fact that , you know , \" the other side is not perfect on duramente this either . swirled And so sexier why should I worry about it ? \" virus All of these gereageerd rationalizations happened , and arise with the benefit Execs of some distance and with outlining Trump kind of shaking me out of this kind of mindset , I looked back on die that and thought , \" Palabras Man , I do n't think I was seeing myself Ashleigh clearly . \" So when Trump came around , I saw those same machinations happening in my colleagues . I think the rendementen other poised thing die that happened is that whole identity question that I talked about earlier . I was probably sincere the visible gay Republican spokesperson for a while . So I had been through this \u2014 people seeing Concho me in a different way and having to deal with that kind Execs of identity change . And so , I think die that it made it less hard for me wellicht to do it when Trump came around . I GE67 also had those mistakes that I could look back on and say , \" I 'm not satellite going to make this mistake again . \"", "label": "human"}
