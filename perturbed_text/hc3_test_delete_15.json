For example , if you hold finger up in front you one eye , open that and close the other eye , your finger will to against the background . This is because you are looking at it from two different angles . We can use this same principle to determine the distance nearby stars . By measuring apparent shift in position of a star the background of more distant stars ( as viewed from opposite sides of Earth 's orbit around the sun ) , we can calculate how far away the star is . is most for stars that are relatively close to us ( within a few hundred light - years ) . For more objects , as quasars and galaxies , we other methods to determine their . One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder , involves using a series of \" rungs \" or steps to the distance to increasingly objects . of the ladder relies a different of \" standard candle , \" which an object that known to have a certain intrinsic brightness . By measuring the of the object as seen from Earth , we can determine its distance . For , one type of standard that we use a type of star called a Cepheid variable . These stars have a very regular pulse , and time pulses directly related to star 's intrinsic brightness . By measuring the time pulses , we can determine star brightness , and therefore its distance . Once we the distance to a variable , we can use it as a \" rung \" on the distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away . For example , we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies , and then use those galaxies as \" rungs \" to measure the distance even more distant galaxies .

We have things called routes , so 're to tell the application(website ) to point to when the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' ) ; So does do ? Simple , really . our class have a method called show . All we doing is saying item is requested here if there is a parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC car above had an i d of 0 .

{"text": "* * EXIST * * In order to protect normal people , the has created all sorts of rules and regulations for how companies that invest money on behalf of other people should operate . While this makes the safer and less volatile , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing but more profitable . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge are companies that make these . They are not to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such pension funds , banks , insurance companies , endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to get into a hedge fund , as only are they limited by the number of investors they can take , but they rated on the of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , funds gather large piles of money from wealthy institutions and invest it their behalf . The is to do two . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and look at all stocks on , odds almost all up . A rising tide all boats . This is referred to as beta . assets , or portfolios assets , will in the direction of general market . is finding assets that go up even than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above % . People invest in hedge funds to an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is to be the to find assets that will do this . The goal of hedge is to earn absolute returns . What this means is make money every year , regardless what stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were to do that , and them went of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by clients . A hedge fund is staffed by veterans of the financial industry , typically people who have worked for a long at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman , Lynch , or Morgan , or commercial with investment banking , such as Citigroup Bank of America , to borrow large sums money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and 10 % , you make $ . But if you $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , you made $ 100 ( less ) for your investors off $ 100 they invested with . ( downside of is that you 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and drive ) . The funds like to borrow from the banks because , need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you doing a bond offering through Goldman . Maybe in process of , you meet their hedge fund clients , talk up your business to to drive demand your stock , they hear the CFO and CEO personally , and make than average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for , with investor money , contacts at banks , and piles of borrowed . do they invest in ? answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most funds . They buy some , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its back in the 1950s . 2 ) Macro - These invest assets that will give them exposure broad economic forces , which to . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - assets . Do you ' hit peak ? companies , and oil futures . George Soros became for making predicting England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning no one knows what their criteria are , as it a trade . Often they write programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets go long or on them . frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that buy and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a combs publicly available Food , looking for changes regarding new drugs , use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Driven Funds - As the name suggests , buy sell short assets price be affected by future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires , usually the buyer 's stock , they are overpaying , while the acquired company 's jumps , as someone about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy . In the * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen contacts with a law firm to find clients the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this of strategy , and when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying default swaps on debt ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that this approach . ( I believe is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other . By diversifying among various funds , the is that returns be less safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a long list other strategies , many too complicated to about here . ( For example , the Galleon fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . founder is facing to years prison . an effective strategy , one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever want , and will be judged on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You ' ve already heard about how many make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the fee . If invest money with a hedge fund ( anyone for matter ) , the first thing they is take a percentage of your from you and keep it themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , office space , and cover until their real payday at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance . At the end the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , a of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 payday for the people run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

This smaller pile of stuff you paid in for and you n't owe another cent on is your \" equity \" . It can broken to the classic accounting equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities ( in pile that the bank can take back because have n't paid for it yet ) + Equity ( in the pile that is paid for yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out a mortgage a $ 200,000 , and promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I of a house . is my equity .

To answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is how it important : Let us say that I owned entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of control . I take cat to the , and the bank the cat $ 995,000 as a business under the agreement that the bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't back . The cat takes the bank 's 995k and I in 5k of my own money that the cat never has to pay me back for , buys 1 million dollars worth of rat equipment . if I on Craigslist offered to sell cat and his 1 million dollars worth of rat control supplies highest bidder , my cat sell for close to 1 million dollars . , the potential buyer found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 the still , the potential buyer realize the cat only $ 5,000 , and would n't pay much more than that . Now that begs the question , why would I the feline $ 5,000 that he did n't have to me back for ? This to the second use of equity in finance , which is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 a partner in his business . Think this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on things that will make his better , and he does n't have to worry paying me or repaying directly . Instead , he me 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock of a 200 shares outstanding . He 100 , which he assigned to himself when incorporating his business . What 's in it for me ? As owner 50 % of the EQUITY in the company ( I own 100 of 200 total ) , I am entitled to half of the ! Now if the cat very successful and makes $ 200,000 in profits year after interest on loan to the bank , that is great for me ! Going back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Principle Still Owed to the Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs me and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed the bank does n't change . We still have 1 million dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so 200k is pure profit for us ( me and my cat ) as business . $ can either use of dividends , reinvested in new equipment services can the business .", "label": "hc3human"}

Pi is a number is a little bit than 3 , and it is important because it helps understand the the circumference ( the distance the circle ) and the diameter ( the across the circle through center ) . The Tau Manifesto is a that suggests that we should use a different circle constant called tau , which is represented by the Greek \u03c4 . Tau is equal to 2\u03c0 , or about 6.28 . The idea behind the Tau Manifesto is that a more natural and intuitive circle constant to use , especially when it comes to understanding radians . are a way of measuring angles . If you think of a circle as a clock , with the 12 position at top , then one is equal to 1/6 the way around the circle . Using tau as the circle constant makes it to understand radians , because one radian is equal to 1/3 tau , rather than 1/2 of pi . This it to see are a measure of how far the circle an angle is , rather than how wide the angle is . , in summary , both pi important that help us understand and measure circles , but some people believe tau a better circle constant use because it makes easier to understand radians .", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

So basically there 's limits on temperature rise ( which I 'll GTR from now cause I ' m lazy ) . GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before industrial revolution . The last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C in temperature , which before was considered okay at best ( this was in the 90 's I believe ) . Since then new and research has out tells us 2 \u00b0 C could be bad . 's also another thing you should know which is feedback loops : Under the arctic huge amounts of trapped methane . If temperature becomes too high the ice that traps methane gas melts and the methane enters the atmosphere . Methane is a greenhouse gas and is one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the it reinforces global warming and effect melting and further releasing methane until it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and in sea ice : Ocean is dark absorbes heat . Ice is white and reflects it . as ice , particularly sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter goes away the the things beneath ice tend to absorbes that and make everything hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is and the more Ocean there is to absorb heat which further melts infinitum until we all die . Now to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered seriously it these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse civilization . At current we 're things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is pretty death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are the but we have a very good chance of living comfortably on , with nearly all the same luxuries we have today albeit differently . the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they ' ve changed it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which a huge a really big .

The agreement that developed nations have to help financially nations protection against rising sea levels other things and to help them their infrastructures to green energy while them develop their economies and humanitarian situations . It also sets a goal for developed nations to try and cut all they emit . Lastly they will stock of emissions and temperature rises and environmental climate change in and every years after .

It does this by using the formula : MIRR(values , finance_rate , reinvest_rate)Where:\"values \" is a range of cells that contain the series of payments and investments associated with the . \"finance_rate \" is the interest rate used to the present value of the cash flows . \"reinvest_rate \" is the interest rate to calculate the future value of the cash flows . The MIRR is useful for comparing the returns on different investments , as it takes account the fact reinvestment rate may be different from the financing . It also useful for evaluating the profitability investments with irregular cash flows , such as those that involve the sale of assets or the repayment of loans . Example : Suppose you are $ 100,000 a that is expected to following cash flows over the next 5 years : Year 1 : $ 2 : $ 30,000Year 3 : $ 40,000Year 4 : $ 5 : $ 60,000The financing rate on the investment % , and the reinvestment rate is 8 % .

This that 's essentially a point where an insect ca grow any bigger , it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) make up for the increased volume / weight ( need for oxygen ) . For more of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to bigger millions millions years ago during dinosaur times .

If 're a Democrat would like as many Democrats as ; if a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because gets 10 it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to that many of those 10 spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's a group of always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only , district . It could [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're giving up that district . You know that Democrats will never be able win it . But you also know that Democrats will a * * much * * chance in the other 9 because all Republican voters are 1 district . So 're drawing borders so get 9 / Representatives Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the outcome want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and only care about getting as many Democrats as possible . Let 's say 20 % of people in Calville are 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % the population Republican Representatives , therefore it 's that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . you , you n't care or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So take that % and you spread them around . make that each district has 20 % , but no more , over 6 feet tall . That way you be able to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you ' ve abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is a is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have worry about being re - elected . a is from a district where they know that only 20 % people are 6 feet tall may not have to worry about being re - elected .

There are certain genetic factors that can increase a 's chances of having twins , such having a family history of twins or certain racial or ethnic . Here 's a simple explanation of how this works : when a woman becomes pregnant , her body produces a hormone human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . This hormone helps the body maintain the pregnancy by preventing the woman 's body from ovulating ( releasing eggs ) again . women produce more hCG than others , and can lead to the release of more one egg during .

Starting from the rightmost digit , assign the value 0 to the rightmost digit , 1 to the second rightmost digit , 2 to third rightmost digit , and so on . 3 . For each digit , multiply the of that digit by the corresponding power of 2 . For example , the value of rightmost digit ( which is 0 or 1 ) should be by 2 to the power of 0 , the of second digit should be multiplied by 2 to the power 1 , and so on . 4 . Add up all of the products from step 3 to get decimal equivalent of the binary number . an example : let 's convert the binary number 1011 ( which is in decimal ) to decimal . 1 . down binary number : 1011 2 . Assign values to each digit : 1 * 2 ^ 3 + 0 * 2 ^ 2 + 1 * 2 ^ 1 + 1 * 2 ^ 0 3 . Calculate the products : 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 4 . Add the products : 11 So the decimal equivalent of 1011 is 11 .

There are two different things that people erroneously loopholes : There are tax deductions , and then are standard accounting practices . A tax is anything that you can * spend * money that * reduces * taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ a year . You spend a quarter that , let 's say , * * , stuff like mortgage and and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 at the end of the . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your tax rate is a flat 10 % of your taxable income , and your taxable income is everything make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent that is $ , meaning at the end of the year you the government $ 10,000 , out of the $ 75,000 you on hand . But the government allows you to * deduct * charitable from your taxable income . Meaning anything you give to charity is * subtracted from * your for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to your soup , let 's say . $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income $ , rather than $ 100,000 . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced your tax bill from $ 10,000 to $ , is only 5 % of your . look at the last sentence \u2014 you paid 5 % your gross income taxes \u2014 and think that 's , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we give tax deductions * hoping people take advantage of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people do certain things with their money , things like give charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are standard accounting . One thing that 's been in the news of recently is the question of personal managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does n't get paid a salary ; instead , he gets a the the fund makes under his management . Makes sense , right ? You 're tying the manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund gain , all his is taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 % , not at the income tax rate of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole , that 's just propaganda . Accounting for your income that is what 're * to do . * It not a . It 's the system is set up . can talk about whether the system * should be * set up that way or not , but the fact is that * is * how the system is up , and the hedge manager who reports income capital gain is following the rules . If he it any * other * way he 'd be * breaking * the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they 're almost certainly talking about that built into the system for good reason which people because they 're supposed to . The phrase does * not * imply that people are cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so you get mad at dirty cheats \u2026 who are in just doing exactly and nothing other than what the code them they 're supposed to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": " long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history this which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll amazed at how much of what he said applies to us . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very answers for the faults . His basic plan that industrialized nations move to socialism , then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll later why no communist country actually followed his plan . One of Marx Engels arguments was that prior industrialization , we produced not much more we used . Obviously there was but for most the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then come along our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the of Wealth Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a , you might have 10 who accomplish different the task . This made production go way . What Marx criticized was the effect of a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the good because the supply is high . This required two things , to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition , free market competition , lower prices . The second that you had to find new markets . Given the the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your . So the markets that up the more needed to be produced . believed that workers standard of living decreased as people moved into the cities to the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead owning your land or home , you lived worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private ownership ( understatement , his summation Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , by the family . land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the land . Back to industrialization , this period time where we find labor , a lack labor laws , , or fighting for workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . first was the ( boor - zhwa ) had the ( the , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The basically means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was . These are the in the factories and the farms . standard of living is so that they can only to . The means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat ones who are actually doing work producing the goods , yet they are the worst and receive little profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers . He argued labor protect themselves from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these \" then the managers and owners would have to . They ca n't work on their own , they a number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx , was the result of and the drive it produced . stated producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is , demand is decreased , and price decreases . is not good news the as this cycle feeds on itself , and the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}
