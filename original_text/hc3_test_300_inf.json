{"text": "There can be a variety of reasons why someone might choose to live in a hotel instead of an apartment, even if it's more expensive on a nightly basis. Here are a few possible reasons:\r \r Short-term stay: Sometimes, people need a place to stay for just a few days or a week, and it might be more convenient or cost-effective to stay in a hotel rather than renting an apartment for such a short period of time.\r \r Flexibility: Staying in a hotel can offer more flexibility than an apartment, as you can stay for just one night or several weeks, and you can often easily extend your stay if needed. This can be helpful for people who are unsure how long they will need a place to stay.\r \r Amenities: Hotels often offer a variety of amenities, such as a swimming pool, fitness center, and on-site dining options, which can be convenient for people who don't want to worry about cooking or finding places to eat.\r \r No lease: Some people might prefer to stay in a hotel because it doesn't require signing a lease, which can be helpful for those who are unsure about how long they will need a place to stay or who don't want to commit to a long-term rental.\r \r No upfront costs: Renting an apartment often requires paying a deposit and first month's rent upfront, which can be a financial burden for some people. Staying in a hotel might be a more affordable option, as you typically only need to pay for the nights you stay.\r \r It's worth noting that living in a hotel can be more expensive than renting an apartment in the long run, especially if you need to stay for an extended period of time. However, it can be a good temporary solution for people who need a place to stay on a short-term basis or who don't want the commitment of a long-term rental.", "label": "machine"}

A nonresident's presence for business in Massachusetts will ordinarily be considered casual, isolated and inconsequential if it meets the requirements of the Ancillary Activity Test (AAT) and Examples. When nonresidents earn or derive income from sources both within Massachusetts and elsewhere, and no exact determination can be made of the amount of Massachusetts source income, an apportionment of income must be made to determine that amount considered Massachusetts gross income. 4th - Apportionment of Income:   Apportionment Methods:   The three most common apportionment methods used to determine Massachusetts source income are as follows:   Gross income is multiplied by a:   So if you go to Massachusetts to work, you have to pay the tax.

If anything, your company might have to pay Oregon taxes on revenue you generate (you are their agent or employee in Oregon).   Does the answer change depending on whether the income is reported at 1099 or W-2? This shouldn't matter legally.  It's possible that it would be easier to see that the work was done in Oregon in one or the other.  I.e. it doesn't make any legal difference but may make a practical difference.   All this assumes that you are purely an employee or contractor and not an owner.  If you are an owner, you have to pay taxes on any income from your Massachusetts business.  Note that this applies to things like copyrights and real estate as well as the business.   This also assumes that you are doing your work in Oregon.

{"text": "Single malt Scotch whisky is made from water, malted barley, and yeast. Here's the general process for making single malt Scotch whisky:\\n\\nMalting: The barley is soaked in water and allowed to germinate, or sprout. During this process, enzymes are produced that will convert the starch in the barley into sugars. The germinated barley is then dried over a peat fire, which gives it a distinctive smoky flavor.\\n\\nMilling: The dried malt is ground into a coarse flour called grist.\\n\\nMashing: The grist is mixed with hot water in a large vessel called a mash tun. This process, called mashing, extracts the sugars from the malt and creates a liquid called wort.\\n\\nFermentation: The wort is transferred to a large vessel called a washback, where it is mixed with yeast. The yeast ferments the sugars in the wort, converting them into alcohol and producing a liquid called wash. The wash has an alcohol content of about 8-9%.\\n\\nDistillation: The wash is transferred to a still, where it is heated until the alcohol vaporizes. The vapor is then condensed back into a liquid, resulting in a clear, colorless liquid called low wine. The low wine is then distilled again, producing a liquid called spirit.\\n\\nAging: The spirit is placed in oak barrels to mature. The barrels are typically aged for at least three years, although some single malt Scotch whiskies are aged for much longer. During the aging process, the spirit takes on the color and flavor characteristics of the barrel.\\n\\nBlending and bottling: The aged spirit is typically blended with spirit from other barrels to create a consistent flavor profile. The blended spirit is then bottled and sold as single malt Scotch whisky.\\n\\nThere are many variables that can affect the flavor of single malt Scotch whisky, including the type of barley used, the water source, the type of yeast, the type of barrel used for aging, and the length of aging.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Cloud Atlas is a science fiction movie that tells six different stories set in different time periods and locations. The stories are all connected, but they each have their own separate plot. The first story is set in the 1800s and follows a sailor named Adam Ewing, who is traveling from the Pacific Islands to San Francisco. Along the way, he meets a man named Dr. Henry Goose, who is trying to poison him for his money. The second story is set in the 1930s and follows a young musician named Robert Frobisher, who becomes the apprentice of an elderly composer named Vyvyan Ayrs. Frobisher writes a symphony called the \"Cloud Atlas Sextet,\" which becomes a major part of the movie. The third story is set in the 1970s and follows a journalist named Luisa Rey, who is investigating a nuclear power plant that is potentially dangerous. She meets a man named Rufus Sixsmith, who helps her uncover the truth about the power plant. The fourth story is set in the present day and follows a publisher named Timothy Cavendish, who gets in trouble with some gangsters and ends up in a nursing home. The fifth story is set in the future and follows a fabricant (a type of artificial human) named Sonmi-451, who is being interviewed about her experiences as a fabricant. The sixth and final story is set in a post-apocalyptic future and follows a tribe of humans who are trying to survive in a world that has been destroyed by some unknown disaster. Throughout all of these stories, the characters are connected to each other in some way, and their actions have an effect on the other stories. The movie is about how our actions can have an impact on the world and the people around us, and how the events of the past can shape the future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe. One way is by using something called parallax. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles. For example, if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye, then open that eye and close the other eye, your finger will appear to move against the background. This is because you are looking at it from two different angles. We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars. By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars (as viewed from opposite sides of Earth's orbit around the sun), we can calculate how far away the star is. This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us (within a few hundred light-years). For more distant objects, such as quasars and galaxies, we use other methods to determine their distance. One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder, which involves using a series of \"rungs\" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects. Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of \"standard candle,\" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness. By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth, we can determine its distance. For example, one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable. These stars have a very regular pulse, and the time between pulses is directly related to the star's intrinsic brightness. By measuring the time between pulses, we can determine the star's brightness, and therefore its distance. Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable, we can use it as a \"rung\" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away. For example, we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies, and then use those galaxies as \"rungs\" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies. This way, we can build up a \"ladder\" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history into this explanation which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts without learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on to the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very clear answers for addressing the faults . His basic plan was that industrialized nations should move to socialism , and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain later why no communist country actually followed his plan . One of Marx and Engels arguments was that prior to industrialization , we produced not much more than we used . Obviously there was trade but for the most part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines come along and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author of Wealth of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a product , you might have 10 who accomplish different portions of the task . This made production go way up . What Marx criticized was the effect of having such a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the good decreases because the supply is so high . This required two things , one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition who , through free market competition , lower prices . The second was that you had to find new markets . Given the world at the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods . So the more markets that opened up the more needed to be produced . Marx believed that workers standard of living decreased as people were moved into the cities to meet the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of owning your own land or home , you lived in worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private land ownership ( understatement , his summation of Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not by the family . If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the local land . Back to industrialization , this is the period of time where we find child labor , a lack of labor laws , unions , or anyone fighting for the workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . The first was the bourgeois ( boor - zhwa ) who had the capital ( the money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name basically means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was the proletariat . These are the workers in the factories and on the farms . Their standard of living is so low that they can only afford to survive . The name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the ones who are actually doing the work and producing the goods , yet they are treated the worst and receive little of the profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers ruled . He argued for labor unions to protect themselves from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to lose their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these conditions \" well then the managers and owners would have to listen . They ca n't do the work on their own , they require a large number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , or strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than it cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx said , was the result of industrialization and the drive for profit it produced . He stated that we stopped producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is increased , demand is decreased , and the price decreases . This is not good news for the worker as this cycle feeds back on itself , and ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "human"}

The author that wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Ellis , is known for a common theme in all of his books . Simply put , they are about the detachment prevalent in modern society . Specifically the effect that wealth and privilege can have on people . No one has friends only acquaintances . People are only as important as what they can do for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity I 'll only deal with what 's in the movie . In American Psycho the main character is pretending to be a human . He takes everything way too far because he is over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he is with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his whole shower procedure . He is pretending to work . His father owns a competing firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick as an employee simply because of his fathers name . He pretends to have a fiance , who of course is completely fake too , otherwise she would n't survive long around him . He pretends to have sexuality . He has no clue what it is to love someone let alone to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he feels cheated . He can see all around him what humanity is supposed to be and he just is n't \" that \" . He knows that it 's getting worse and worse , and is afraid that he will be caught . He is n't afraid of going to jail or dying , but rather he is afraid of being exposed as a fake person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your specific question regarding the scene where he calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so he calls his lawyer and admits everything he can think of . The lawyer thinks the caller is someone other than Patrick playing a joke . He never takes it seriously because to him Patrick is just some bland rich guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other bland rich guys . Later when Patrick sees the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about it the lawyer , not realizing he is talking TO Patrick , laughs about the ridiculousness of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are common themes in the movie and book . People constantly remark how normal Patrick is , people constantly mistake him and others for someone else . They all look and act alike . In my opinion the movie is about how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer to blend into society because of how uncaring and superficial we all are . If you likes the movie of course read the book . If books are n't your thing then at least watch Less Than Zero and maybe The Rules Of Attraction .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A 401(k) plan is a type of employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary on a tax-deferred basis. The contributions are made through payroll deductions and are invested in a selection of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other investment options offered by the plan. Employers may also make matching contributions or offer other incentives to encourage participation in the plan.There are several strategies that you can consider when investing in a 401(k) plan:Diversification: One of the key principles of investing is diversification, which means spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, in order to reduce risk. By diversifying your 401(k) investments, you can potentially reduce the impact of volatility on your portfolio.Contribute as much as you can: The more you contribute to your 401(k), the more you'll have to save for retirement. Consider increasing your contributions over time, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.Consider your risk tolerance: Different investments carry different levels of risk, so it's important to consider your risk tolerance when selecting your 401(k) investments. If you're younger and have a longer time horizon, you may be able to tolerate more risk in your portfolio. On the other hand, if you're closer to retirement, you may want to focus on more conservative investments.Review your portfolio regularly: It's important to review your 401(k) investments periodically to ensure that they're still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. This may involve rebalancing your portfolio by selling some investments and buying others.Take advantage of employer matching contributions: If your employer offers matching contributions, be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. Employer matching contributions can significantly increase the amount of money you'll have saved for retirement.It's also a good idea to consult with a financial professional or a 401(k) plan representative for additional guidance on investing in a 401(k) plan.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "5,000 years ago humans did n't know much about metal , metalworking , geology , or mining . But they did have a sense for fashion . Most metals exist naturally as rock . The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they do n't look very interesting ( to a non - geologist ) . In the world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold . Gold can be found as \" nuggets \" or \" dust \" . The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some , you 're likely to find more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers , so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it , and then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold without heat . It is \" malleable \" at room temperature , which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it wo n't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things . Gold will not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade . It is much denser than most other materials so it would make a good club , but you do n't get much more head - bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood . So other than as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical \" use \" to an ancient human . But it is pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" next to human skin tones . Why this is so is pretty much a mystery . But it 's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people . In the ancient world \" rich \" was defined as \" do n't have to farm \" . There were only three kinds of people like that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals . Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it , and it was n't good for any practical use , and as a metal it would \" stay all in one place \" and did n't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained , it became a way for rich people to display their wealth . Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold , of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat , or slaves , or land , or whatever . It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale , a cup , some water , and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me . 5,000 years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals . Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins , even though plutonium is worth , ounce for ounce , vastly more than gold . Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that ancient humans did n't know about - it 's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity . And it still looks good next to human skin .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "* * WHY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect normal people , the SEC has created all sorts of rules and regulations for how companies that invest money on behalf of other people should operate . While this makes the investments safer and less volatile , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing riskier but possibly more profitable investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge funds are companies that make these investments . They are not allowed to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with less than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such as pension funds , banks , insurance companies , college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to get into a good hedge fund , as not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take on , but they are also rated on the rate of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , hedge funds gather large piles of money from very wealthy institutions and invest it on their behalf . The goal is to do two things . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you look at all the stocks on the market , odds are almost all of them went up . A rising tide lifts all boats . This is referred to as beta . Most assets , or portfolios of assets , will move in the direction of general market . Alpha is finding assets that go up even more than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is supposed to be the ability to find assets that will do this . The other goal of hedge funds is to earn absolute returns . What this means is that they make money every year , regardless of what the stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were able to do that , and many of them went out of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by various clients . A hedge fund is normally staffed by veterans of the financial services industry , typically people who have worked for a long time at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . After accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley , or commercial banks with investment banking arms , such as Citigroup or Bank of America , to borrow large sums of money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and make 10 % , you make $ 10 . But if you borrow $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , and you made $ 100 ( less interest ) for your investors off the $ 100 they invested with you . ( The downside of this is that if you lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds though , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear what leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and rumors drive trades ) . The hedge funds like to borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding the need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you 're doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs . Maybe in the process of that , you meet their hedge fund clients , and talk up your business to them to drive demand for your stock , while they hear from the CFO and CEO personally , and make better decisions than the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for investment banks , with investor money , contacts at investment banks , and large piles of borrowed money . What do they invest in ? The short answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most simple funds . They buy some stocks , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Macro - These funds invest in assets that will give them exposure to broad economic forces , which they hope to predict . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - denominated assets . Do you think we 've hit peak oil ? Buy oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became famous for making billions for predicting that England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning that no one knows what their criteria are , as it is a trade secret . Often they write computer programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and go long or short on them . High frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can buy stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a fund that combs through publicly available filings through the Food and Drug Administration , looking for any changes regarding new drugs , to use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , the buy or sell short assets whose price will be affected by future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires another , usually the buyer 's stock goes down , as they are probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock jumps , as someone is about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy the prey . In the movie * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen uses contacts with a law firm to find clients of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort of strategy , and is arrested when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy is John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took this approach . ( I believe Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope is that returns will be less volatile and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a pretty long list of other recognized strategies , many too complicated to worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . The founder is now facing 15 to 19 years in prison . It was an effective strategy , but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point of this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they want , and will be judged solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You 've probably already heard about how many hedge funds make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the management fee . If you invest money with a hedge fund ( or anyone for that matter ) , the first thing they do is take a percentage of your money from you and keep it for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , rent office space , and cover overhead until their real payday arrives at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance fee . At the end of the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , and takes a chunk of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion payday for the people who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "human"}

We had all the necessary paperwork(Arms Declaration , etc ) to go along with the weapons so it was never an issue when entering foreign ports . If we were going to be working in an area with a high risk for piracy the company would send a security team to meet us prior the entering the area , they would travel with us for how ever long deemed necessary . The issue is often when an armed security team travels to a different country . For example ( if I 'm remembering correct ) the Suez Canal does n't allow armed security team to transit so now you have to deal with weapons and personnel getting off the vessel . Now you got a problem of ' importing ' weapons , even though you 're just going through . We never had these issues as the weapons were ours and not the security teams . When in Africa we never had any direct contact with pirates but we did have a couple situations . Coming into Douala , Cameroon approaching the anchorage a skiff approached us with about 6 people on it . We had no security team onboard , the captain went below and came up with a few of the rifles , we held them up on the bridge wing and the skiff took off . When we got into port talking with the locals they said that the bandits ( they never called them pirates ) were from Nigeria and that they were pissed that they Somalis pirates were getting all the press . A couple days after we left two ships we attacked and 6 guys kidnapped . A similarish incident happened off of Beira , Mozambique again after we left the was an attack not too far from where we were .

Here are some examples : 1 : Tony Abbott sent no one the Summit on climate change which won us the humiliation award as a country by a large group of scientists . He even removed the minister for climate change and dissolved the office in the process . 2 : He has given the green light to cull the shark population off the west coast . Seemingly to reduce the amount of sharks to make the place more of a tourist destination . However , those sharks are part of an eco - system that we largely do n't understand . The funds that were diverted to this were reallocated from improving the standard of living . 3 : He made himself \" Minister of Women 's Issues \" .... need I explain that ! ? 4 : He has been annoying our nearest neighbours to the north , Indonesia , by crossing into their waters to intercept boats laden with refugees and wither sending them away orarresting them and placing them in detention centres . Recently , rioting and deaths have become a more and more common . Top it off with a severe lack of information about the facilities , conditions and what the process of integration is , if it exists at all , is making Australians question \" what is there to hide ? \" 5 : Tony Abbott is sexist . 6 : Tony Abbott is Prime Minister and head of the Liberal party . This means financial liberty . Not socialist . Liberal meaning you can make money from anything you want and at the end of the day , it 's every man for himself . At the end of the day , you can be fairly certain he is merely lining his pockets so that he and his children are set for life . Liberal goal achieved . 7 : His party have sent photos to the UNESCO ( World Heritage Listings Association ) that are misleading about the state of the forests in Tasmania . They wish to declassify the area so it can be logged . The entire area is untouched . Australians mostly want that to remain is \" mint ' condition . The liberal party thinks lying to get their way is an acceptable strategy . It 's not . 8 : Tony Abbott panders to Gina Rinehart , a mining magnate that inherited her wealth from her father and has fought to keep it from the rest of her family . She has recently said that she disapproves of the latest generation to come into the job market because of they 're \" Entitled \" behaviour and mind set . This seems \" rich \" coming from her .

It was set up and on probation and several couples married and now their union is no longer recognised by any authority . If something happened to one partner of these unions , then the other would have no rights to what happened to children and property . But , heterosexual couples would .

{"text": "If you are a worker on a visa in the United States and want to build a credit history, there are a few steps you can take:Get a credit card: One of the easiest ways to build a credit history is to get a credit card and use it responsibly. You can apply for a credit card from a bank or credit card company. Keep in mind that you may need to provide proof of income and a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to apply.Use your credit card wisely: To build a good credit history, it's important to use your credit card responsibly. This means making timely payments and not exceeding your credit limit. Paying your bills on time is particularly important, as payment history is a major factor in your credit score.Consider a secured credit card: If you have difficulty getting approved for a traditional credit card, you may be able to get a secured credit card. With a secured credit card, you deposit money into an account as collateral and are then given a credit line equal to the amount of your deposit. As you use the card and make timely payments, your credit score will improve.Use utility bills to your advantage: If you have a utility bill in your name (such as for electricity, gas, or water), you can ask the company to report your payment history to the credit bureaus. This can help you build a credit history, as long as you make timely payments.Rent a home or apartment: If you rent a home or apartment, you can ask the landlord to report your rental payment history to the credit bureaus. This can also help you build a credit history, as long as you make timely rental payments.By following these steps and using credit responsibly, you can build a credit history as a worker on a visa in the United States.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It is called \"Credit card installments\" or \"Equal pay installments\", and I am not aware of them being widely used in the USA. While in other countries they are supported by banks directly (right?), in US you may find this option only in some big stores like home improvement stores, car dealerships, cell phone operators (so that you can buy a new phone) etc. Some stores allow 0% financing for, say, 12 months which is not exactly the same as installments but close, if you have discipline to pay $250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end. Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well, and it adds risks of customer default, introduces debt collection possibility etc. That's why it's usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not care in this case, from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $250 every month. In other countries banks support this option directly, I think, taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants. This has not happened in US. There is a company SplitIt which automates installments if stores want to support it but again, it means stores need to agree to it. Here is a simple article describing how credit cards work: https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html In general, if you move to US, you are unlikely to be able to get a regular credit card because you will not have any \"credit history\" which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt. The easiest way to build the history - request \"secured credit card\", which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount. It's like a \"practice credit card\". You use it for 6-12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus, establishing your \"credit score\". After that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card. Credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that. As anything else in US, there are some businesses which help to solve this problem for extra money.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Microsoft's explanation of MIRR (Modified Internal Rate of Return) is a financial function that is used to calculate the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows, taking into account the fact that the investment's cash flows may be reinvested at a different rate than the original cost of the investment.The MIRR function calculates the internal rate of return on an investment with multiple cash flows, taking into account the fact that the investment's cash flows may be reinvested at a different rate than the original cost of the investment. It does this by using the following formula:MIRR(values, finance_rate, reinvest_rate)Where:\"values\" is a range of cells that contain the series of payments and investments associated with the investment.\"finance_rate\" is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows.\"reinvest_rate\" is the interest rate used to calculate the future value of the cash flows.The MIRR function is useful for comparing the returns on different investments, as it takes into account the fact that the reinvestment rate may be different from the financing rate. It is also useful for evaluating the profitability of investments with irregular cash flows, such as those that involve the sale of assets or the repayment of loans.Example:Suppose you are considering investing $100,000 in a project that is expected to generate the following cash flows over the next 5 years:Year 1: $20,000Year 2: $30,000Year 3: $40,000Year 4: $50,000Year 5: $60,000The financing rate on the investment is 10%, and the reinvestment rate is 8%. You can use the MIRR function to calculate the internal rate of return on the investment as follows:=MIRR(A1:A5, 10%, 8%)This would return a result of approximately 12.63%, indicating that the investment is expected to generate a return of approximately 12.63% per year.I hope this helps clarify Microsoft's explanation of MIRR.

{"text": "Pinyin is actually a standardized system for writing Chinese using the Roman alphabet, and it is widely used in China for teaching Chinese as a second language, transcribing proper nouns and place names, and as a tool for inputting Chinese characters on computers and phones.  However, Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese. Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi or Kanji in Japanese) are the primary written form of Chinese and have a long history dating back over 3,000 years. They are still used today because they are an important part of Chinese culture and history, and they are also very efficient for written communication.  One of the main reasons that Pinyin is not used as the primary written form of Chinese is that it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words. Chinese characters, on the other hand, can convey the full meaning and pronunciation of a word in a single character. For example, the Chinese character for \"water\" is \u6c34, which is pronounced \"shui\" in Mandarin. Pinyin cannot represent the meaning of the character, only the pronunciation.  Additionally, replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin as the primary written form of Chinese would be a massive undertaking that would involve changing the way that Chinese is taught in schools, updating dictionaries and other reference materials, and potentially requiring people to learn a new writing system. It would also be difficult to determine a standard way to represent the many different regional accents and dialects of Chinese using the Roman alphabet.  In summary, while Pinyin is a useful tool for learning Chinese and transcribing proper nouns, it is not used as the primary written form of Chinese because it cannot fully represent the sounds and meanings of Chinese words, and replacing Chinese characters with Pinyin would be a major undertaking.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Well it actually kind of has , just not in the way people expected . The problem is the kind of solar you are thinking about , the green square panels . They are really , really expensive , and not terribly efficient . Those systems can take 10 - 20 years to generate enough electricity to pay for themselves . Second problem is they do n't scale well . Each individual cell generates its own power , that power than needs to be run down a wire and combined with all of the power generated by each other cell , and this infrastructure to move the power and take the individual small amounts of power and convert them into high voltage AC current to be put into the grid is expensive . We live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do n't make sense at an industrial scale . However that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements . It has ! And even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point . Its just not fancy looking green photo - voltaic cells that have , it is concentrated solar power(CSP ) systems that have . These systems use mirrors and lenses to magnify the intensity of the sun onto a relatively small point . This small point contains a system that turns heat into steam and turns a steam turbine to create electricity . They are much cheaper at scale because the mirrors and mounting brackets for them do not require the level of manufacture that photo - voltaic does . If solar is ever to take hold at the kind of level required to become the major source of power for the world it is going to be CSP systems that do it , and not photo - voltaic . CSP systems are the only solar solution that can compete with fossil fuels on a price per kWH basis . It was calculated that the entire world power consumption could be met by covering 1 % of the world 's desert climate with CSP . It is also expected that within the next 10 years CSP should be more cost efficient than fossil fuel .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "They 're not loopholes . That 's just a propaganda word people use to confuse things . There are basically two different things that people sometimes erroneously call loopholes : There are tax deductions , and then there are standard accounting practices . A tax deduction is anything that you can * spend * money on that * reduces * your taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ 100,000 in a year . You spend a quarter of that , let 's say , on * stuff * , stuff like your mortgage and food and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 at the end of the year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your tax rate is a flat 10 % of your taxable income , and your taxable income is everything you make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of that is $ 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe the government $ 10,000 , out of the $ 75,000 you have on hand . But the government allows you to * deduct * charitable contributions from your taxable income . Meaning anything you give to charity is * subtracted from * your taxable income for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to your local soup kitchen , let 's say . That $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income just $ 50,000 , rather than $ 100,000 . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced your tax bill from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 , which is only 5 % of your gross income . Some people just look at the last sentence \u2014 you only paid 5 % of your gross income in taxes \u2014 and think that 's unfair , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we give tax deductions * hoping people will take advantage of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people to do certain things with their money , things like give to charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are just standard accounting practices . One thing that 's been in the news kind of recently is the question of personal income from hedge fund managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does n't get paid a salary ; instead , he gets a percentage of the profits the hedge fund makes under his management . Makes sense , right ? You 're tying the manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's gain , all his income is taxed at the capital gains tax rate of 15 % , not at the income tax rate of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole , but that 's just propaganda . Accounting for your income that way is what you 're * supposed to do . * It 's not a cheat . It 's how the system is set up . We can talk about whether the system * should be * set up that way or not , but the fact is that * is * how the system is set up , and the hedge fund manager who reports his income as capital gain is following the rules . If he did it any * other * way he 'd be * breaking * the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they 're almost certainly talking about things that are built into the system for good reason and which people do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does * not * imply that people are cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so you can get mad at those dirty cheats \u2026 who are in reality just doing exactly and nothing other than what the tax code tells them they 're supposed to do .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Using collateral to purchase a home means using an asset, such as a car or a savings account, as security for a loan. In other words, the lender will hold the collateral as a way to secure the loan, and if you fail to make the required payments on the loan, the lender has the right to take possession of the collateral.There are several ways to use collateral to purchase a home, including:Mortgage: A mortgage is a type of loan that is used to buy a home. When you take out a mortgage, you typically need to put down a down payment, which is a percentage of the purchase price of the home. The lender holds the mortgage as collateral for the loan. If you default on the loan, the lender has the right to foreclose on the property and take ownership of the home.Home equity loan: A home equity loan is a type of loan that is secured by the equity you have built up in your home. Equity is the difference between the value of your home and the amount you owe on your mortgage. If you have a lot of equity in your home, you may be able to use it as collateral to get a home equity loan, which you can use to purchase a new home.Personal loan: A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan that is not tied to any specific asset. However, if you have collateral, such as a car or savings account, you may be able to use it to get a better interest rate on a personal loan. You can then use the personal loan to purchase a home.It's important to carefully consider the terms of any loan that you use to purchase a home, including the interest rate, fees, and repayment terms. You should also be aware of any potential risks associated with using collateral, including the possibility of losing the collateral if you default on the loan.", "label": "machine"}

Arranging three coils around a spinning magnet is the basic principle of the power station 's generator . There will be a transformer box somewhere in your block that has three coils that are connected to the power lines . The coils create a spinning magnet force field , rotating at the same speed as the magnet in the generator . Then there are three more coils , but smaller ones , in the transformer . These secondary coils see the rotating field and it appears just like a spinning magnet to those three smaller coils . So they generate too , but at a lower voltage that is safer for the houses in your street . The three coils can be connected together as a \" star \" like a Y or as a triangle \" Delta \" . The power lines connect to the corners of the triangle or the points of the star to give 3 phase power . The centre of the star is also connected and that cable is called \" neutral \" . Wall sockets are connected to one of the 3 phases and neutral . Big motors in factories can use all three phases . Big office blocks will use different phases for different power outlets to keep a balanced load . The voltage between two of the phases is more than the voltage from phase to neutral because in a star connection ( Y ) that is the voltage across two of the coils .

{"text": "A ranked voting system is a way of casting and counting votes in an election where voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. Instead of just choosing one candidate, voters can indicate their top choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.In a ranked voting system, if a candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, they are declared the winner just like in a normal election. If no candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the voters' next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winner.One advantage of ranked voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters, rather than just a plurality of voters. In a normal election, it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50% of the vote if there are more than two candidates running. In a ranked voting system, this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least popular candidate can be redistributed to the voters' next choice.As for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the two-party system, it's important to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity. However, ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third-party candidates or independent candidates to win elections. Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference, they can choose to support a third-party candidate as their first choice while still expressing a preference for one of the major party candidates as their second choice. This could make it more likely that a third-party candidate could win an election, or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome.", "label": "machine"}
