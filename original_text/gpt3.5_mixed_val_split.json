{"text": "Two stars of the 1968 film adaptation of \"Romeo & Juliet\" have sued Paramount Pictures for more than $500 million over a nude scene the actors shot when they were teenagers, according to a copy obtained by CNBC.\n\nLeonard Whiting, 72, and Olivia Hussey, 71, claim director Franco Zeffirelli \"secretly\" filmed them nude or partially nude without their knowledge despite previous assurances that there would be no nudity exhibited in the Oscar-winning film. At the time of filming, Whiting, who portrayed Romeo, was 16, and Hussey, who portrayed Juliet, was 15.\n\nThe pair filed the suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud.\n\nParamount has not made any public statement about the suit and did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nAccording to the filing, Zeffirelli, who died in 2019, initially told the actors that they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in the bedroom scene in which Whiting's bare buttocks and Hussey's bare breasts are briefly shown. However, when the scene was shot in the final days of filming, the actors were told they would wear only body makeup and that the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity, according to the suit.\n\nThe actors said they \"believed they had no choice but to act in the nude in body makeup as demanded\" and allege the scene was in violation of California and federal laws against indecency and the exploitation of children.\n\nSolomon Gresen, the actors' attorney, said they're seeking punitive damages of $100 million, but are possibly entitled to damages of more than $500 million to match the amount the film has earned since 1968.\n\n\"Paramount continues to display and profit from these images of nude minor children,\" said Gresen. \"They surely know better. Time should be up.\"\n\nUpon its release, the film also proved a critical success, winning Academy Awards in the best cinematography and costume design categories and earning a nomination for best picture.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "January 4th 2023 marked a momentous occasion for both children and parents alike as the unpredictable winter weather combined with a diligent effort from both groups of folks, enabled the childhood tradition of a snow day to once again take center stage.\n\nFor parents, the joy of a snow day was both a novelty and a welcome respite from the monotony of everyday life. From a parent\u2019s perspective, there was no greater treat than watching the excitement that radiated from their children, eager to get out in the snow and explore the winter wonderland around them.\n\nFor children, a snow day was a special event that brought out the creativity and enthusiasm they had been pent up in classrooms throughout the winter months. With snowball fights and snow angels, sledding down hills and hot chocolate after coming inside to warm up, a snow day was something to look forward to during the coldest months of the year.\n\nBut over the past few decades, the frequency of snow days had diminished drastically. Blame it on global warming, blame it on the warmer winters, but snow days were becoming a thing of the past. The weather seemed too erratic and the snow too sparse to induce the legendary wintry days off from school.\n\nThat all changed, however, when the resourceful and optimistic minds of kids got to work. With ingenuity and creativity, children from all over the world began to concoct their own methods of making it \u201csnow\u201d for a day, which often involved kids making snowmen or sledding down large piles of fluffed-up snowballs.\n\nThis simple, yet effective, experiment was a way for the kids to bring snow days back in a way that was enjoyable, meaningful, and accessible. For many, it became a new family activity, one that brought everyone in the family closer together as they gathered up supplies and worked to construct their own miniature winter paradise.\n\nThe best part was that any day of the year had the potential to become a snow day, regardless of the actual outdoor temperature. Kids embraced the idea of making it snow on demand, and soon it became the new way of experiencing snow days.\n\nSnow days in this new format had just as much fun and excitement as a real snow day. Kids ran around with glee, made snow forts, and built snowmen. They ran up and down hills and threw snowballs at each other. And parents participated, making the most of the day, by helping to build snowmen and doing whatever it took to make the day a special event.\n\nThe snow days of old had found new life in the fresh eyes and creative minds of the younger generations, who refused to let it go and disappeared from winters everywhere. Now, families can gather together to bring the old tradition back in a way that is sure to make them smile and bring the wonder back to wintertime.", "label": "machine"}

Carsten Maschmeyer, Gr\u00fcnder, Investor und Autor des Bestsellers \u201eRich Dad Poor Dad\u201c, hat einige Tipps parat, die Gr\u00fcndern f\u00fcr das Jahr 2023 helfen k\u00f6nnten.\n\n\u201eIch glaube, dass Erfolg im Grunde leicht zu erzielen ist, wenn man einige kluge Entscheidungen trifft und sich f\u00fcr die richtigen Investitionen entscheidet\u201c, sagte Maschmeyer. \u201eDie Schl\u00fcssel zum Erfolg sind harte Arbeit, Disziplin und Fokus. Aber es geht auch darum, Trends im Blick zu haben und kontinuierlich zu investieren, um ein erfolgreiches Unternehmen aufzubauen.\u201c\n\nMaschmeyer glaubt, dass Gr\u00fcnder ihre Investitionen in drei Bereiche aufteilen sollten. Der erste Bereich sind Start-ups, das hei\u00dft, Unternehmen, die eine neue Technologie, ein neues Produkt oder ein neues Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell anbieten. \u201eHier ist es wichtig, zu verstehen, worauf man sich einl\u00e4sst, bevor man eine Investition t\u00e4tigt\u201c, sagte er. \u201eEs ist auch wichtig, dass man sich die Zeit nimmt, die richtigen Leute kennenzulernen und die richtigen Investitionen zu machen.\u201c\n\nDer zweite Bereich, in den Gr\u00fcnder investieren sollten, sind bereits etablierte Unternehmen, die expandieren und auf neue M\u00e4rkte zugreifen m\u00f6chten. Hier geht es darum, sich in die bestehenden Strukturen einzuarbeiten und dann die bestm\u00f6glichen Investitionsm\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr das Unternehmen zu finden.\n\nDer letzte Bereich sind dezentralisierte Unternehmen, die kleine Investitionen erfordern, aber viele M\u00f6glichkeiten bieten.

{"text": "JPMorgan analysts warned Wednesday that there could be further downward pressure on the market in 2023 before a recovery is felt. But they said there are still stocks to invest in. The analysts said in a note to clients that they expect the S & P 500 to retest lows seen in 2022 as the Federal Reserve \"overtightens\" while trying to cool inflation. But they said that sell-off, paired with other indicators of a contracting economy, could push the central bank to start pivoting. That would start a recovery that may bring the S & P 500 to 4,200 points by the end of 2023, they said. That's nearly 10% higher than where the broad index closed Tuesday. \"2022 was a year of macro and geopolitical shocks with sharply higher global rates and USD, stubbornly high inflation, China headwinds, and the largest conflict in Europe since WWII,\" the analysts said. \"Investors responded to these events by derating S & P 500 P/E as much as 7x while some speculative growth segments have crashed 70-80% from highs. Although fundamentals have been resilient throughout these shocks, we do not expect this year's constructive growth backdrop to persist in 2023.\" JPMorgan put together a list of stocks it recommends in the challenging investing landscape. Here are 10 names that made the list: Amazon lost nearly 50% in 2022, making it the biggest one-year loss for the stock since 2000 . The sell-off came as investors rotated out of growth and into value as rising interest rates elevated concerns of a recession. As a company, Amazon was hit with a slowdown in sales, with consumers shifting spending to services or pulling back entirely due to inflationary pressures. Yet JPMorgan analysts said they believe revenue growth can re-accelerate due to higher stock levels and faster delivery speed. Analysts also pointed to the possibility of continued penetration within groceries and the cloud that could give the company an additional boost. The firm has a $130 price target, implying the stock will gain 51.5% from Tuesday's close. Target also made the list, even as market observers grow increasingly wary of retail stocks amid economic contraction. The company turned to promotions this year to move a glut of unwanted inventory while trying to contend with the same shifting consumer spending habits that hurt Amazon. The stock dropped more than 35% in 2022 for its worst year in decades. JPMorgan set a price target of $201, which shows a potential upside of 32.5% over Tuesday's close. Disney 's stock tumbled nearly 44% in 2022, a dramatic year for the entertainment giant punctuated by the replacement of CEO Bob Chapek with his predecessor, Bob Iger . JPMorgan set a price target of $84.17, which implies the stock should gain 51.7% in the next 12 months. JPMorgan is bullish on the growth stock, calling Disney its \"favorite Media name long term.\" The firm said it expects a more \"realistic\" Disney+ subscriber target for 2024 and believes direct-to-consumer losses could halve by the fiscal third quarter. It also said Disney could accelerate buying Comcast's stake in Hulu to provide more flexibility within its streaming business. Las Vegas Sands is expected to post a second year of gains in 2023 after getting beat down during the first two years of the pandemic. JPMorgan's $55 price target reflects an 11.5% upside. The stock gained nearly 28% in 2022. JPMorgan said the stock should rise as China moves closer to a full reopening given the company's operations in Macao. The Chinese government said it would remove quarantine requirements for inbound travelers starting Jan. 8 .

{"text": "2022 was a big year for dance books: Here are 5 to check out\n\nEnlarge this image Meghan Collins Sullivan/NPR Meghan Collins Sullivan/NPR\n\nIt's not often you find whole sections of bookstores or libraries devoted to books on dance. But this doesn't mean that there's a shortage of good books on the topic \u2014 especially this year.\n\n2022 was particularly prosperous for books about ballet, with many notable memoirs, biographies, and works of fiction making their debuts. So, we're taking a moment to highlight some of those. Our selection of titles sheds light not only on some of the form's most iconic figures, but also provides a glimpse into the state of ballet culture today \u2014 and the direction it will be heading next year and for years to come.\n\nThe Wind at My Back\n\nWhen all eyes were on Misty Copeland in advance of her promotion to principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre \u2014 which made her the first Black woman to achieve the highest rank in the iconic company \u2014 audiences saw an inspirational woman, a beautiful dancer, and a watershed event for the overwhelmingly white art form. What they didn't see, however, were Copeland's private struggles with imposter syndrome, internalized trauma, and the still present systemic racism in the ballet world.\n\nIn her latest book, Copeland (writing with with Susan Fales-Hill) candidly recounts these experiences with the same grace and strength that imbue her dancing, all while paying homage to her mentor, Raven Wilkinson, and the many other Black ballerinas that laid the foundation for Copeland to soar. Part memoir, part tribute to the late Wilkinson, who toured the country with the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, The Wind at My Back chronicles Copeland's relationship with her mentor, draws parallels between their paths in dance, and ends with a call to action. Through Wilkinson, Copeland taps into her deeper purpose of being a role model for other ballet dancers of color, and her words tell readers exactly what it will take to continue to move the form forward and ensure bright futures for these young artists.\n\nThey're Going to Love You\n\nIn this novel by Meg Howrey, Carlisle Martin \u2014 born to a ballerina mother and a balletomane father \u2014 dreams of dancing with the New York City Ballet. After her parent's separation, the NYC home her father shares with his partner, James, becomes a place of wonder \u2014 and someplace she wants to belong, but doesn't quite feel at home. After her above-average height dashes her hopes of ballet stardom, and a betrayal estranges her from her father and James, Carlisle charts her own path, moves to Los Angeles, and starts her career as a choreographer. When she receives the news that her father is dying, she is forced to reckon with her past, all while preparing for the biggest commission of her career.\n\nThey're Going to Love You oscillates between present-day reflections and flashbacks to Carlisle's life as an adolescent and young adult, ultimately emerging as a beautiful and relatable portrait of a woman, her regrets, and her successes. As Howrey unflinchingly and honestly dives into the intricacies of relationships and the inevitable growing pains that come with life, she also mines her history as a ballet dancer to deliver an honest portrayal of the dance world, the realities of working artists, and the obstacles facing female choreographers, revealing real-world truths through a fictional setting.\n\nLa Nijinska\n\nMost balletomanes are familiar with Vaslav Nijinsky, the famous 20th-century dancer and choreographer who was widely hailed for his virtuosity and who made waves with his original works. Fewer though, are intimately familiar with his sister, Bronislava Nijinska, despite the fact that, as author and dance historian Lynn Garafola asserts, her myriad contributions far outweighed Nijinsky's comparatively brief foray into the limelight.\n\nLa Nijinska is the first biography written about the female choreographer, who created nearly 80 original ballets and was a guiding force for the development of 20th-century modernism. The book mines interviews, archival reviews, reflections of the dancers who worked with Nijinska, and the choreographer's own letters and diaries to paint a picture of the prolific dancemaker. Nijinska is wholly deserving of the nearly 500-page opus, which, given today's movement to foster and support women choreographers, comes at just the right time.\n\nThree Muses\n\nAuthor Martha Anne Toll's first novel uses a post-WWII ballet world as the backdrop to weave an intimate portrait of romance and heartbreak. Three Muses follows prima ballerina Katya Symanova, who is immersed in an abusive yet creatively generative relationship with choreographer Boris Yanakov, as she meets and falls in love with John Curtin, a young psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor.\n\nToll's novel is not only notable for its poignant prose, clever foreshadowing, and deeply moving ending, it also comments on many of the harsher truths present in the ballet world, acknowledging the reality without glamorizing it. The author, a freelance book critic who has written reviews for NPR, not only uses a true-to-life version of the 1950s dance world as her stage, she uses choreography as a key element of the plot, with the dances she creates for her characters perfectly echoing their inner lives.\n\nSerenade\n\nIn the ballet world, George Balanchine, the co-founder of the New York City Ballet, has almost been raised to superhuman status. His signature modern, plotless approach to dancemaking is still widely lauded, his choreography is performed by some of the most successful dancers and companies, and words like \"legend,\" \"icon\" and \"seminal\" are often used to describe him. Hearing about Balanchine from someone who actually knew him and danced for him \u2014 like author Toni Bentley \u2014 is a breath of fresh air, revealing the human behind the history.\n\nBentley's Serenade is grounded by a minute-by-minute recollection of Balanchine's 1934 masterpiece of the same name, interspersed with the author's own memories of the choreographer, stories from his past, as well as forays into topics like the development of the pointe shoe, the life and work of composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and the choreography of Marius Petipa. Bentley's words not only illuminate Balanchine, they also unveil the lifelong devotion, love and unending fascination that come along with a career in ballet.\n\nSophie Bress is a dance writer and former dancer based in Utah.

{"text": "The world was abuzz on Friday, November 13 as United States President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first meeting in over two years. The two leaders met virtually and expressed their desire to strengthen bilateral ties.\n\nThe news was welcomed by many, as the relationship between the two largest economic powers has been strained in recent years. The Biden administration has taken a hard stance against China, imposing tariffs and restrictions on tech companies. The two leaders discussed a range of issues, including trade, climate change, and human rights.\n\nWhile the meeting was generally viewed as a positive step, not everyone was convinced that it will result in a de-escalation of trade tensions. One prominent strategist, Barry Diller, is skeptical about the outcome of the meeting.\n\nDiller, who is a longtime investor in both China and the United States, spoke to CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" about his views. \"I think it's a good thing the meeting happened, and the optics look great, but I'm not sure it leads anywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe investor went on to say that he believes the Biden administration's stance on trade is misguided, particularly with regard to the tariffs that have been imposed on Chinese goods. \"It's really a mistake to think that the tariffs are going to have an impact on China or its economy,\" he said.\n\nDiller argued that the tariffs have not had the desired effect and are only further straining the U.S.-China relationship. He believes that the tariffs should be removed in order to \"lay the groundwork for some kind of relationship that's beneficial to both sides.\"\n\nThe investor also commented on the Biden administration's approach to human rights, particularly in Xinjiang. Diller believes that a better approach is to work with China and the U.S. to find common ground rather than condemn the country outright. \"Maybe it would be best if we don't immediately label a government as a human rights violator,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Diller believes that the two sides need to work together to resolve their differences in order to create a more positive relationship. He believes that the meeting was a good start, but that there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe Biden-Xi meeting was viewed as a positive sign by many, but one prominent investor remains skeptical about the impact it will have on the U.S.-China relationship. Barry Diller believes that the tariffs should be removed and the two sides should look to find common ground on issues such as human rights. While the meeting was a good start, there is still much work to be done in order to create a healthier relationship between the two countries.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nFor Michigan Democrats, the 2020 election was a watershed moment. After years of Republican dominance in state government, Democrats finally regained control of the governor\u2019s office and the legislature. It was a major victory for Democrats in the state, who have long advocated for progressive policies to move Michigan forward.\n\nNow, with their newfound majority in both houses of the Michigan legislature, Democrats have the opportunity to advance a wide variety of policies that will have a lasting impact on the state\u2019s future. But what should be their top priority?\n\nThe first thing Michigan Democrats should do with their new power is to pass a sweeping package of criminal justice reform. Michigan has one of the nation\u2019s highest incarceration rates, and its jails are full of people who are not a threat to public safety and are serving lengthy sentences for nonviolent offenses. This includes an estimated 5,000 people convicted of drug possession and related offenses.\n\nCriminal justice reform is an issue that has been top-of-mind for Michigan voters for many years, and has long been an area of concern for both Democrats and Republicans. But in recent years, momentum has shifted in favor of reform, and the new Democratic majority in Michigan will give lawmakers the ability to finally make meaningful progress on this issue.\n\nThe package of reforms proposed by the Michigan Senate Democratic Caucus would reduce prison populations, create meaningful paths to rehabilitation, and reduce the number of people who get caught in a cycle of poverty due to incarceration.\n\nThe plan also calls for significant investments in programs that focus on keeping people out of the criminal justice system in the first place. This includes expanding access to mental health and substance abuse services, investing in youth mentorship programs, and providing support and wraparound services for people who are struggling with poverty and unemployment.\n\nAdditionally, the plan calls for an end to the cash bail system, which disproportionately affects people of color and is often a barrier to their access to justice. It also calls for changes to the sentencing laws in order to reduce the use of mandatory minimum sentences and to focus on rehabilitation and public safety.\n\nFinally, the plan calls for reforms to Michigan\u2019s parole and probation system, which is often restrictive and punitive. The package of reforms calls for improved access to housing and employment, as well as reducing the number of people who are sent back to prison due to technical violations, such as missing a meeting with a probation officer.\n\nThese are just a few of the key components of the plan that Michigan Democrats should move quickly to pass. Passing this package of criminal justice reforms will be an important step towards ensuring that Michigan\u2019s justice system is fair and equitable for everyone. It will also be an important first step for Democrats to demonstrate that they are serious about delivering on the progressive policies that they promised during their campaigns.\n\nFor Michigan Democrats, this is the first opportunity in years to make a real difference in the lives of the people in their state. It is up to them to take this opportunity to pass meaningful criminal justice reform, and it is up to the people of Michigan to hold their elected officials accountable for the promises they made. The future of Michigan is in the hands of its citizens and their leaders. Let\u2019s make sure they make the right choices.", "label": "machine"}

The aide told CNN that staff members had discussed how they would all resign if Haspel was fired.\n\nThe former aide said that the pact was not a formal agreement, but rather an informal agreement among staff. \"It was more of a 'what if' conversation,\" the aide said.\n\nThe aide also told CNN that the staff was worried that Haspel might be fired after Trump's ousting of then-director of national intelligence Dan Coats in 2019.\n\n\"We were worried, as were many others in the intelligence community, that the president was going to fire her,\" the aide said. \"So, it was just a conversation of what would we do if that happened.

Haspel has been a key figure in coordinating the US response to the pandemic, and her leadership has been widely praised by many in the intelligence community.\n\nDespite Trump's public attacks on the intelligence community, Haspel appears to have the confidence of the president. In recent weeks, the president has publicly praised Haspel for her work.\n\nHowever, the former aide's comments indicate that there is still some worry among staff about the future of the CIA if Haspel were to be fired. Such an event could lead to many of the agency's top staff members resigning in protest, which would be a major blow to the agency and the intelligence community as a whole.\n\nFor now, however, Haspel remains in charge of the agency and the staff appear to have faith in her leadership.", "label": "machine"}

There are numerous Kaneda bike projects on YouTube, but in my opinion, this one is the best.\n\n\n\nIn a series of clips, Ayato has been documenting his progress. It\u2019s a massive project, and for it to be street legal it must confirm to Japanese law, but Ayato has been tackling it with aplomb and skill.\n\n\n\nAyato started this off with a Yamaha Majesty 250 bike, but set down the parameter that he wanted to try to make the Kaneda bike with what he had at home. (During the course of the project, he has ordered some items, but has kept to a DIY ethos in his approach.)\n\n\n\nIn this video, uploaded nine months ago, he strips the Yamaha Majesty 250 down and power saws away any unwanted metal on the bike\u2019s bare frame. He then soldered in the parts he does need.\n\n\n\nHere, Ayato talks about the modifications he\u2019s going to make from the original design. For example, he\u2019s not a fan of the seat on the actual Kaneda bike in the anime (and the manga), so he\u2019s modifying the design to a bucket seat, which he prefers.\n\n\n\nOther parts, such as the iconic front and wheel design, however, will not be changed.\n\n\n\nThe other thing that makes the Kaneda bike design tricky is the way the motorcycle handle can be raised and lowered. Ayato decided to also keep this and bring it to life.\n\nHe first made the body out of cardboard, but then created it out of fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP). You can see the process in the clips below.\n\nIt\u2019s even more impressive when you find out he\u2019s using things like cat food bowls to create shapes.\n\n\n\nYou can really start to see the project come to life.\n\n\n\nThe project isn\u2019t yet finished, but it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it turns out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clips are quite in depth.

{"text": "than old ones.\n\nThe world of business and technology was in an uproar today after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff caused a stir with a leaked internal Slack message suggesting that new employees may not be as productive as those who have been with the company for a while.\n\nThe message was sent to the entire Salesforce staff yesterday and was quickly leaked to the press. In it, Benioff says, \u201cIn some cases, the new recruits can be less productive than those that have been with us for a while. Let\u2019s remember to value everyone\u2019s experience, skills and loyalty.\u201d\n\nThe message was met with immediate outrage from Salesforce employees, who felt that it was unfairly implying that they were not as productive or valuable as their colleagues who had been with the company for longer. Some employees felt that Benioff should have taken a more nuanced approach when addressing the issue, as it could potentially have a negative impact on morale and company culture.\n\nThe controversy has grown to such a point that even rival companies have weighed in, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella criticizing the statement and expressing his support for the new Salesforce employees. Nadella said in a statement, \u201cWe stand behind our new Salesforce employees and we strongly condemn the statement made by Marc Benioff. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to contribute and have their contributions valued, regardless of how long they have been with the company.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Benioff\u2019s statements have caused an uproar. Last year, he faced criticism after making comments about the gender pay gap, and his suggestion that Salesforce would pay female employees less than their male counterparts caused an immediate backlash.\n\nIn an effort to address the controversy, Salesforce quickly issued a statement clarifying Benioff\u2019s comments and defending the new employees. The statement reads, \u201cSalesforce has a long history of valuing and supporting employees regardless of their experience level. Our commitment to our new employees remains unwavering. We understand the impact that Marc\u2019s comments have had on our new employees, and we are committed to ensuring their contributions are acknowledged and valued.\u201d\n\nHowever, the damage may already be done. The controversy has caused a rift between Benioff and the Salesforce team, and some employees have even begun to express their displeasure with the CEO. Several current and former Salesforce employees have taken to Twitter to voice their displeasure, with some calling for Benioff to resign.\n\nThis is not the first time that Benioff\u2019s comments have caused an uproar, and it is likely not the last. While the company is still addressing the issue, it remains to be seen how this latest controversy will impact Salesforce in the long-term. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that Benioff\u2019s comments have caused a ripple effect throughout the tech world.", "label": "machine"}

Bush\u2019s personal aide, Ginni Thomas.\n\nGiuliani, who spoke to members of the select committee on October 6th, 2022, discussed his involvement in planning rallies on the morning of January 6th, his interactions with the President on the day of the attack, and the role of Trump\u2019s supporters in the events of that day.\n\nGiuliani told the committee that he played a \u201cdirect role in organizing and planning the rallies\u201d that happened on the morning of January 6th, and that he had spoken with the President about them \u201cfrequently.\u201d He acknowledged that his role in those events \u201ccaused certain members of the public to become overly excited and to take certain steps that could not be justified.\u201d\n\nIn the transcripts, Giuliani denied having any role in the events of January 6th itself. He told the committee that he believed Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cwere acting on their own volition\u201d and that he did not \u201cinstigate or encourage them to break into the Capitol building.\u201d\n\nGinni Thomas, who spoke to the committee on October 12th, 2022, testified that she had been in the White House on the day of the attack and had \u201chear[d] people asking [Trump] to make a statement encouraging people to go to the Capitol.\u201d She said that she had not heard Trump make a statement.\n\nThomas testified that she had left the White House shortly after Trump departed and had not been present when Trump issued a statement later that day telling his supporters that he \u201cloved\u201d them and that they were \u201cvery special.\u201d\n\nThe newly-released transcripts shed further light on the events of January 6th, 2021. Since the attack, the House Select Committee on the Events of January 6th has interviewed dozens of witnesses and conducted a thorough investigation into what transpired that day. The committee is expected to release its final report and recommendations sometime early next year.\n\nThe testimony released today by the committee is only the latest step in the ongoing effort to uncover the full story of what happened on that day. It is clear, however, that more information is needed to fully understand how and why the assault on the Capitol occurred, and who was responsible for it.\n\nIn the meantime, the Department of Justice and federal prosecutors are moving forward with criminal cases related to the attack. As the DOJ\u2019s investigation progresses, it is likely that additional information will come to light and the full story of January 6th, 2021 will become clearer.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nKevin McCarthy faces growing pressure to end the impasse over his imperiled speakership bid after two consecutive days of failed votes. But even after proposing major concessions to his hardline opponents late Wednesday, it remains unclear if the California Republican will be able to lock in the support he needs to win the gavel, and patience is wearing thin among lawmakers as the fight drags on.\n\nThere are, however, some early indications that negotiations have made some headway as McCarthy and his allies attempt to chip away at opposition from a bloc of conservatives.\n\nIn a series of new concessions first reported by CNN Wednesday night, McCarthy agreed to propose a rules change that would allow just one member to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker, according to two sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy had initially proposed a five-member threshold, down from current conference rules that require half of the GOP to call for such a vote.\n\nHe also agreed to allow for more members of the Freedom Caucus to serve on the powerful House Rules Committee, which dictates how and whether bills come to the floor, and to vote on a handful of bills that are priorities for the holdouts, including proposing term limits on members and a border security plan.\n\nRepublican sources say that even if McCarthy\u2019s offers are accepted, it would still not get him the 218 votes he needs to be speaker. While these concessions could attract some new support, other opponents have raised different concerns that have yet to be fully addressed.\n\nMcCarthy said Wednesday evening that there was no deal yet to end the stalemate, but that there has been progress. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably best that people work through some more,\u201d McCarthy said after the House had adjourned.\n\nThe House is set to reconvene on Thursday at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nMcCarthy has already made a number of concessions to his opponents, though so far his efforts have not been enough.\n\nBut sources said the talks Wednesday between McCarthy allies and holdouts have been the most productive and serious ones to date. And in one sign of a breakthrough, a McCarthy-aligned super PAC agreed to not play in open Republican primaries in safe seats \u2013 one of the big demands that conservatives had asked for but that McCarthy had resisted until this point.\n\nTexas Rep. Chip Roy, one of the conservatives who has voted against McCarthy\u2019s speakership bid, told GOP leaders that he thinks he can get 10 holdouts to come along if ongoing negotiations pan out, according to GOP sources familiar with the internal discussions, and that there are additional detractors who may be willing to vote \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nStill, even if these negotiations prove successful and 10 lawmakers do flip to McCarthy\u2019s column \u2013 which is far from certain \u2013 that won\u2019t get McCarthy to the 218 votes needed to win the speakership, so he would still have more work to do.\n\nMcCarthy also met separately Wednesday with the freshman members-elect who voted against him, sources told CNN.\n\nDuring the meeting, McCarthy reiterated some of the things he has already promised and went into greater detail about those concessions.\n\nMcCathy\u2019s direct outreach to the freshmen-elect offers another window into his strategy for winning over the holdouts.\n\nIncoming House Majority Whip Tom Emmer commented that the negotiations have been \u201cvery, very constructive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a whole bunch of members that were involved in this, and there are some folks now that are sitting down and talking about that discussion to see where they want to go with it next,\u201d the Minnesota Republican said.\n\nThe fight over the speakership, which began Tuesday on the first day of the 118th Congress, has thrown the new House GOP majority into chaos and undercut the party\u2019s agenda.\n\nAs the fight has stretched out, the situation has grown increasingly dire for McCarthy\u2019s political future as even some of his Republican allies have begun to fear that the House GOP leader may not be able to pull off his gamble for speaker if the fight goes much longer.\n\nMcCarthy has so far come up short in six rounds of voting. The final GOP tally for the sixth vote, which took place on Wednesday, was 201 for McCarthy, 20 for Florida Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and one \u201cpresent\u201d vote.\n\nThe House will remain paralyzed until this standoff is resolved. This is the first time an election for speaker has gone to multiple ballots since 1923.\n\nTo be elected speaker, a candidate needs to win a majority of members who vote for a specific person on the House floor. That amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans won 222 seats in the new Congress, so for McCarthy to reach 218, he can only afford to lose four GOP votes.", "label": "human"}

The new family of CPUs boasts improved power efficiency, a significant reduction in price, and a host of upgrades over their predecessors.\n\nRaptor Lake processors will be available in four models - the Core i7-13700K, Core i5-13600K, Core i3-13400K, and Core i3-13200K. Each model features different levels of performance, with the Core i7-13700K being the most powerful, followed by the Core i5-13600K.\n\nIn terms of power efficiency, Intel has claimed that its 13th generation of CPUs are up to 30% more power efficient than the 11th and 12th generations. This means that users will be able to draw less power from their system, leading to potentially longer battery life. The company has also promised improved heat dissipation, which should reduce the risk of the processor getting too hot during intensive tasks.\n\nIn terms of price, Intel has promised that the Raptor Lake processors will be significantly cheaper than their predecessors. Intel's pricing for the four CPUs begins at $134.99 for the Core i3-13200K, up to $249.99 for the Core i7-13700K. This is a significant reduction from the 11th and 12th generation processors, which were priced between $199 and $349.\n\nPerformance-wise, the 13th generation Raptor Lake CPUs are said to offer up to 12% more processing power than the previous generations. This will be particularly noticeable in gaming and streaming applications, as well as tasks that require intensive use of multiple cores. The CPUs also support Intel's latest Optane and Iris Xe technologies, as well as improved Turbo Boost and Hyper-Threading features.\n\nThe Raptor Lake processors are also set to offer improved integrated graphics, with up to 34 Execution Units. This should make the new CPUs suitable for basic gaming and other tasks that don't require a dedicated graphics card.\n\nAll in all, Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs offer a great deal of performance and efficiency at an attractive price. The processors should be available for purchase by the end of the year, so those looking to upgrade their systems should keep an eye out for the latest 13th generation CPUs. Intel has also promised that additional 14th generation CPUs are in the works, so those looking for the absolute best performance should stay tuned.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The United States political system is facing yet another tumultuous period as the results of the recently-held election for House Speaker are contested. The election process, which was intended to be relatively simple, quickly devolved into chaos as the votes became split and members of both the Democratic and Republican parties started making accusations and counter-accusations.\n\nThe election has been ongoing since December, when the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives voted to install Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. Republicans, led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, immediately raised objections over the decision, arguing that the election rules were unfairly manipulated.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid a protracted political dispute, Pelosi and McCarthy proposed holding a special election for House Speaker. The election was set for January 5th and ballots were cast by secret ballot.\n\nOn the day of the election, there was an air of anticipation as members of both sides awaited the results. As it became apparent that the votes were split almost equally between Pelosi and McCarthy, speculation quickly spread that the results could lead to a major political crisis.\n\nThe final results were delayed for several hours as both sides argued over the legitimacy of the election process. In the end, the election was deemed invalid as a majority of the House had failed to cast their ballots.\n\nThis debacle over the House Speaker election has raised significant concerns about the security of the United States' political process and has even been described as a \"constitutional crisis\" by some analysts. Although the country's executive and judicial branches remain relatively stable, the legislature has been plagued by frequent partisan disputes and political gridlock.\n\nIn addition to the obvious political implications of the House Speaker election, many have argued that the failure of the legislature to select a leader could have serious implications for the country's national security. The House of Representatives is responsible for approving various government policies, including military deployments, overseas aid, and treaty negotiations. If the House fails to select a leader, these vital processes could be put on hold, potentially creating a serious security risk.\n\nThe House Speaker election debacle has also highlighted the inability of the United States Congress to cooperate in a meaningful manner. Rather than working together to solve the problem, members of the two parties have allowed the issue to fester, creating a situation in which the country's government appears unable to agree on even the most basic of matters.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, it will be interesting to see how the United States government will respond to this crisis. Will the parties be able to come together to resolve the issue, or will the debacle lead to further gridlock and dysfunction? The answer to these questions will no doubt have significant ramifications for the nation's security.", "label": "machine"}

But when it finally got around to Trump, the audit was initially assigned to just one employee\u2014a doubly puzzling choice given the nature of the real estate mogul\u2019s complicated business holdings.\n\n\n\nSo what really happened? It\u2019s possible that the Senate, which will remain under control of the Democrats, might pursue an investigation. If this inquiry takes as long as the one that only finally got Trump\u2019s tax returns released this week, we could be waiting quite a while for answers. Either way, this is not a good look for Trump\u2014or the IRS.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Marvel Snap\u2019s latest round of balance changes hasn\u2019t officially been released yet, but following a last-minute delay and leak, the info is out there. And players have begun debating one nerf in particular involving the controversial Leader card. For many, the leaked nerf details aren\u2019t enough. There was so much chatter around this change that Marvel Snap boss Ben Brode had to address it and the card\u2019s future on Twitter.\n\nReleased last year, Marvel Snap is a fast-paced digital card game available on Steam and mobile devices that stars superheroes and villains. Matches are fast, decks are small, and each time you play the game feels a little different as randomized zones can completely shake up a match. We here at Kotaku thought it was one of the best games of 2022.\n\n\n\nBut even a great game has its problems. And one issue in Marvel Snap as of late has been the controversially powerful Leader card that\u2014thanks to its ability to copy all cards your opponent played this turn\u2014-can basically steamroll over most decks in the final moment of a match.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople have been waiting for a balance change for a few weeks now, with many hopeful that The Leader would get tweaked to be less powerful. We were supposed to get a patch with balance changes on January 4, but at the last minute, an issue delayed it. However, likely as a result of the last-second delay, the details of the patch leaked via Marvel Snap\u2019s Korean community team and quickly spread across the web. While the patch notes contained a few different nerfs and card buffs, The Leader\u2019s minor balance change\u2014-only removing one point of power from the card\u2014-was considered not enough by players.\n\nIn response, Marvel Snap boss Ben Brode discussed The Leader nerf on Twitter, providing more context for the small nerf and clarifying that the team has more plans to tweak the card in the future, it\u2019s just still trying to figure out what to change. But those changes are coming, eventually, and this first, smaller nerf is just step one towards balancing Leader.\n\nMeanwhile, if you are someone who likes running Marvel Snap decks with the various Guardians of the Galaxy characters, good news: Groot and Drax are getting small buffs to their base stats to make them more viable and less of a gamble. It also appears, via the leaked patch notes, that artist credits are finally being added to the game in the next update, too. Of course, these leaked patch notes aren\u2019t official yet, even if Brode is responding to one part of them, so keep that in mind. As for when to expect this delayed patch, Brode explained on Twitter that the wait shouldn\u2019t be longer than a week, so it could go live around January 10 or 11.\n\nAdvertisement", "label": "human"}
{"text": "after party reshuffle.\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sacked the country's second-highest military official on Friday after a reshuffle of the ruling party's top decision-making body, state media reported.\n\nKim dismissed Vice-Marshal Hwang Pyong So from his posts as vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission and director of the military's General Political Bureau, both of which hold considerable influence in the North's military affairs.\n\nThe move comes after Kim reshuffled the country's ruling Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee on Wednesday, in an apparent bid to gain more control over the military and the party. The reshuffle was accompanied by the retirement of some top military and political figures.\n\nThe move by Kim indicates he is seeking to consolidate his control over the military and the party ahead of his fourth five-year term as leader of the reclusive, authoritarian state.\n\n\"Kim's reshuffle is intended to ensure that his control of the Workers' Party and military will remain undiminished,\" said Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification.\n\nHwang, 71, had been a key military aide to Kim since 2013 and played a role in negotiating with South Korea to hold a summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018.\n\nKim has since come under international pressure to open up his economy and abandon nuclear weapons.\n\nHwang's departure is the latest in a series of reshuffles that have seen the dismissal of top military and political officials since the party's last major reshuffle in 2017.\n\nMost recently, in October, Kim Jae Ryong, the premier of the North's rubber stamp legislature, was removed from his post without explanation.\n\nKim has sought to tighten his grip on the party and the military since assuming power following the death of his father in 2011.\n\nHe has ramped up the country's nuclear weapons program and engaged in a war of words with the United States, including trading personal insults with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Kim has held summits with the United States, Russia and China in recent years, those meetings have so far failed to ease tensions between North Korea and the international community or to win any concessions from Washington.\n\nKim's relationship with the United States has further soured in recent months over Pyongyang's ballistic missile tests and alleged violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nAnalysts said Hwang's sacking appeared to be a clear sign that the leader intends to take a hard line on relations with the United States and its allies.\n\n\"Hwang's ousting suggests that Kim Jong Un will not budge on the issue of denuclearization, and that he will pursue economic opening with a slower, steadier approach,\" said Hong.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Clinton-era ban on assault weapons ushered in a period of fewer mass shooting deaths. AP Photo/Dennis Cook\n\nA spate of high-profile mass shootings in the U.S. in 2022 sparked calls for Congress to look at imposing a ban on so-called assault weapons \u2013 covering the types of guns used in both the recent Buffalo grocery attack and that on an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nSuch a prohibition has been in place before. As President Joe Biden noted in his June 2, 2022, speech addressing gun violence, almost three decades ago bipartisan support in Congress helped push through a federal assault weapons ban in 1994, as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.\n\nThat ban was limited \u2013 it covered only certain categories of semi-automatic weapons such as AR-15s and applied to a ban on sales only after the act was signed into law, allowing people to keep hold of weapons purchased before that date. And it also had in it a so-called \u201csunset provision\u201d that allowed the ban to expire in 2004.\n\nNonetheless, the 10-year life span of that ban \u2013 with a clear beginning and end date \u2013 gives researchers the opportunity to compare what happened with mass shooting deaths before, during and after the prohibition was in place. Our group of injury epidemiologists and trauma surgeons did just that. In 2019, we published a population-based study analyzing the data in a bid to evaluate the effect that the federal ban on assault weapons had on mass shootings, defined by the FBI as a shooting with four or more fatalities, not including the shooter. Here\u2019s what the data shows:\n\nBefore the 1994 ban:\n\nFrom 1981 \u2013 the earliest year in our analysis \u2013 to the rollout of the assault weapons ban in 1994, the proportion of deaths in mass shootings in which an assault rifle was used was lower than it is today.\n\nYet in this earlier period, mass shooting deaths were steadily rising. Indeed, high-profile mass shootings involving assault rifles \u2013 such as the killing of five children in Stockton, California, in 1989 and a 1993 San Francisco office attack that left eight victims dead \u2013 provided the impetus behind a push for a prohibition on some types of gun.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the 1994-2004 ban:\n\nIn the years after the assault weapons ban went into effect, the number of deaths from mass shootings fell, and the increase in the annual number of incidents slowed down. Even including 1999\u2019s Columbine High School massacre \u2013 the deadliest mass shooting during the period of the ban \u2013 the 1994 to 2004 period saw lower average annual rates of both mass shootings and deaths resulting from such incidents than before the ban\u2019s inception.\n\nFrom 2004 onward:\n\nThe data shows an almost immediate \u2013 and steep \u2013 rise in mass shooting deaths in the years after the assault weapons ban expired in 2004.\n\nBreaking the data into absolute numbers, between 2004 and 2017 \u2013 the last year of our analysis \u2013 the average number of yearly deaths attributed to mass shootings was 25, compared with 5.3 during the 10-year tenure of the ban and 7.2 in the years leading up to the prohibition on assault weapons.\n\nSaving hundreds of lives\n\nWe calculated that the risk of a person in the U.S. dying in a mass shooting was 70% lower during the period in which the assault weapons ban was active. The proportion of overall gun homicides resulting from mass shootings was also down, with nine fewer mass-shooting-related fatalities per 10,000 shooting deaths.\n\nTaking population trends into account, a model we created based on this data suggests that had the federal assault weapons ban been in place throughout the whole period of our study \u2013 that is, from 1981 through 2017 \u2013 it may have prevented 314 of the 448 mass shooting deaths that occurred during the years in which there was no ban.\n\nAnd this almost certainly underestimates the total number of lives that could be saved. For our study, we chose only to include mass shooting incidents that were reported and agreed upon by all three of our selected data sources: the Los Angeles Times, Stanford University, and Mother Jones magazine.\n\nFurthermore, for uniformity, we also chose to use the strict federal definition of an assault weapon \u2013 which may not include the entire spectrum of what many people may now consider to be assault weapons.\n\nCause or correlation?\n\nIt is also important to note that our analysis cannot definitively say that the assault weapons ban of 1994 caused a decrease in mass shootings, nor that its expiration in 2004 resulted in the growth of deadly incidents in the years since.\n\nMany additional factors may contribute to the shifting frequency of these shootings, such as changes in domestic violence rates, political extremism, psychiatric illness, firearm availability and a surge in sales, and the recent rise in hate groups.\n\nNonetheless, according to our study, President Biden\u2019s claim that the rate of mass shootings during the period of the assault weapons ban \u201cwent down\u201d only for it to rise again after the law was allowed to expire in 2004 holds true.\n\nAs the U.S. looks toward a solution to the country\u2019s epidemic of mass shootings, it is difficult to say conclusively that reinstating the assault weapons ban would have a profound impact, especially given the growth in sales in the 18 years in which Americans have been allowed to purchase and stockpile such weapons. But given that many of the high-profile mass shooters in recent years purchased their weapons less than one year before committing their acts, the evidence suggests that it might.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

{"text": "New salary transparency laws are rolling out across the U.S. As of Jan. 1, three new states \u2014 California, Rhode Island and Washington \u2014 joined the chorus of states, cities and counties enacting salary transparency laws intended to give workers more leverage to negotiate their earnings and close wage gaps. For years now, new laws have passed that aim to protect job-seekers during the hiring process, such as by barring employers from asking about their salary history (which can keep underpaid workers from equitable pay). In 2021, Colorado paved the way with a new type of law that requires employers to proactively and publicly put their cards on the table: Companies were required to list salary ranges on job advertisements for work that could be done in the state. Since then, additional states and localities have passed similar legislation, whiles others have laws that say employers must disclose the minimum and maximum pay to job candidates at some point in the hiring process. All told, roughly 1 in 4 U.S. workers now live in a place where employers are required to share pay ranges by law, according to calculations from analysts at Payscale. Here's a rundown of where salary transparency laws are currently in effect:\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe law: Employers must list the salary range on all job ads for roles that will or may be filled in California, including for jobs that can be done remotely from the state. Current employees are entitled to the salary range of their position, upon request. Who it applies to: Employers with 15 or more workers with at least one employee in California\n\nCincinnati, Ohio\n\nThe law: Employers must share the salary range for a position after they extend an offer and if the applicant asks for it . Who it applies to: Employers with 15 or more workers in Cincinnati\n\nColorado\n\nThe law: Employers must list the salary range, as well as a rundown of general benefits, on all job ads for roles that will or may be filled in Colorado, including for jobs that can be done remotely from the state. Who it applies to: Employers with at least one worker in Colorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe law: Employers must share the salary range for a position if an applicant asks for it, or when they extend an offer \u2014 whichever occurs first. An employer must provide the employee the salary range when they are hired, if they change to a new position, or if the employee requests it. Who it applies to: Employers with at least one worker in Connecticut\n\nIthaca, New York\n\nThe law: Employers must list the salary range on all ads for any job, transfer or promotion opportunity. Who it applies to: Employers with 4 or more workers in Ithaca\n\nJersey City, New Jersey\n\nThe law: Employers must list the salary range and description of benefits on all ads for any job, transfer or promotion opportunity. Who it applies to: Employers with 5 or more workers and a principle place of business in Jersey City\n\nMaryland\n\nThe law: Employers must share the salary range for a position if an applicant asks for it. Who it applies to: Maryland employers\n\nNevada\n\nThe law: Employers must provide the salary range to applicants after an initial interview automatically, even if the applicant hasn't asked for it. Employers must also provide pay ranges for a transfer or promotion opportunity if an employee has applied for it, completed an interview and requests it. Who it applies to: Nevada employers\n\nNew York City\n\nThe law: Employers must list the salary range on all job ads for roles that will or may be filled in New York City, including for jobs that can be done in the field or remotely from the city. Who it applies to: Employers with 4 or more workers and at least one in New York City\n\nRhode Island\n\nThe law: Employers must provide the salary range to job applicants upon request. Employers must disclose the salary range of a job before discussing compensation with a candidate, when they officially extend an offer, and if the employee moves into a new position. Plus, they have to provide a salary range for a current employee's position at their request. Who it applies to: Rhode Island employers\n\nToledo, Ohio\n\nThe law: Employers must share the salary range for a position after they extend an offer and if the applicant asks for it . Who it applies to: Employers with 15 or more workers in Toledo\n\nWashington\n\nThe law: Employers must list the minimum and maximum salary range, and a list of benefits the new hire will get, on all job ads, including for jobs that can be done remotely from the state. Who it applies to: Employers that have 15 or more workers and at least one in Washington, engage in business in the state or are recruiting for jobs that could be filled remotely by someone in the state.\n\nWestchester County, New York", "label": "human"}

His death unleashed a flood of litigation over the $630 million fortune he left behind and a compensation fund for more than 200 people who claimed to be his victims. His arrest also led to a widespread reckoning for his powerful friends and associates \u2014 including Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, Leslie Wexner, and Elon Musk \u2014 as well as organizations like Harvard University, JP Morgan, and Deutsche Bank.\n\nEarlier this year, the US Virgin islands settled a separate lawsuit, first brought in 2020, with Epstein's estate and its executors. The estate was required to pay $105 million, in addition to half of the proceeds from the sale of Little St. James, Epstein's island where accusers say they were raped and trafficked.\n\nThe new lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, emerged from the same investigation and alleges JP Morgan \"knowingly facilitated, sustained, and concealed the human trafficking network operated by Jeffrey Epstein\" and \"financially benefitted from this participation.\"\n\n\"JP Morgan knowingly, negligently, and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nOne of Epstein's accounts with JP Morgan, named Southern Trust, didn't perform the \"cutting edge consulting services\" Epstein claimed. In reality, the lawsuit alleges, it was \"a conduit for payment to foreign women, credit cards, airplanes, and other instrumentalities.\"\n\nThe bank and its employees knew they were facilitating Epstein's sexual abuse and sex-trafficking conspiracy to coerce \"young women and underage girls to engage in commercial sex acts,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nJeffrey Epstein's island of Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands. US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\n\nBut, according to the suit, the bank concealed its conduct by failing to comply with \"red flag\" laws. The section of the lawsuit that details how JP Morgan allegedly turned a blind eye to Epstein's conduct is heavily redacted.\n\n\"JP Morgan ignored numerous red flags and failed to comply with federal banking regulations until years later after JP Morgan was no longer benefiting from Epstein's business,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nA representative for JP Morgan declined to comment.\n\nThe decisions to keep Epstein as a client, and to move his money around, were \"advocated and approved at the senior levels of JP Morgan,\" including by a former chief executive of its asset management division who had an \"inappropriate relationship with Epstein.\"\n\nDetails related to that official, Jes Staley, were redacted from the lawsuit. According to an investigation by British regulators, Staley and Epstein exchanged over 1,200 emails between 2008 and 2012. Staley stepped down from his position as CEO of Barclays in 2021 as he disputed how the regulators characterized his relationship with Epstein.\n\nIn addition to the US Virgin Islands, an anonymous \"Jane Doe\" filed lawsuits against JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank in November, alleging the financial institutions benefitted from Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.\n\nEpstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty in December 2021 of trafficking girls for sex with Epstein and sexually abusing them herself.\n\nAt her criminal trial in Manhattan, a JP Morgan official presented documents showing that Epstein gave Maxwell at least $30.7 million between 1999 and 2007.\n\nAnother witness who testified in Maxwell's trial said that one of Epstein's jets \u2014 which prosecutors said he used to traffic women for sex \u2014 was owned by a company called Hyperion Air.\n\nThat same company, Hyperion Air, is identified by the US Virgin Islands Attorney General as one of Epstein's accounts with JP Morgan.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Razer\u2019s Blade gaming laptop line is getting bigger and better this year with two new 16-and-18-inch screen sizes announced at CES 2023.\n\nThe Razer Blade 16 and Blade 18 are the latest to adopt the growing screen trend, bumping up the display real estate from the traditional 15-and-17-inch sizes we\u2019ve known for years. PCMag's Brian Westover was able to go hands-on with the devices at CES, and you can watch his impressions in the video above.\n\nThe other exciting addition is updated core components. Both laptops will run on the just-announced Nvidia 40 Series GPUs and Intel 13th Gen mobile processors. Read on for the details below.\n\nBuilding a Bigger Blade: 18-Inch Displays Are Here\n\nThe Blade 18 is of particular interest: We\u2019ve seen 16-inch laptops for the last couple of years, but the Blade 18 is part of a new wave of 18-inch laptops debuting at CES 2023. Alongside the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 and the Alienware m18, the Blade 18 is looking to be one of the top dogs at the high end of the gaming market this year. The Blade line is known for being slim and built with premium materials, so we\u2019ll take a look at how that translates to this larger chassis.\n\n(Credit: Brian Westover)\n\nThe Blade 18 measures 0.86 by 15.74 by 10.83 inches and weighs 7.05 pounds, which is up from the last Blade 17 we reviewed (0.78 by 15.55 by 10.24 inches, 6.06 pounds). The difference in the actual footprint isn\u2019t actually much, as you can see, but the increased weight\u2014already not so light\u2014will be noticeable. The same anodized aluminum material is used for the chassis, so it will likely look and feel just like past Blade models.\n\nThe main focus is, of course, on the larger display. The new panel measures exactly 18 inches diagonally in a 16:10 aspect ratio. It bears a QHD+ resolution (2,560 by 1,600 pixels), a 240Hz refresh rate, and Nvidia G-Sync. The brightness is rated up to 500 nits, and the response time is 3ms. This is the only panel option across the Blade 18\u2014the panel size is already new, so permutations are likely limited in availability.\n\nIt\u2019s a true desktop replacement at this size, but still obviously many times more portable than a desk setup even at this weight. A gaming laptop will live and die by its components though, particularly if you\u2019re trying to replace a desktop, so the CPU and GPU will be crucial.\n\n(Credit: Brian Westover)\n\nFortunately for deep-pocketed shoppers, the core component options scale up quite high. The base model comes with the newly announced Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU, and the less modest 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13950HX processor. The GPU is configured for up to 165W power, and the system is backed by vapor chamber cooling to manage its thermals.\n\nThe processor remains the same in all configurations, but there are several scaling GPU options: The Blade 18 can be ordered with an RTX 4070, RTX 4080, and RTX 4090. Serious enthusiasts will appreciate the latter options, and all the power will go to increasing frame rate and ray-tracing capabilities since there are no higher-resolution screen options to pair with the superior GPUs.\n\nAlongside the increasingly potent GPU options, you can add memory and storage to your configuration. The base model starts with 16GB of DDR5 memory and a 1TB SSD, but models can go all the way up to 32GB memory and a 2TB SSD. The memory is also user upgradeable after purchase to a maximum of 64GB, and the same goes for the memory for up to 4TB.\n\nOf course, even if the new 40 Series hierarchy should have the expected performance curve, we\u2019ll have to test it ourselves to confirm that (and see what the ceiling of these new GPUs is) when Blade 18 units are available. The Blade 18 starts at $2,899.99 and will launch this quarter.\n\nA Larger \"Mid-Size\" Blade: The New 16-Inch Option\n\nThese 16-inch gaming laptops may not be new, but this size is new to the Blade lineup. It\u2019s a bit more traditional than the super-sized Blade 18, really just stretching the concept of the still-portable 15-inch option into a larger screen.\n\nIt measures 0.87 by 13.98 by 9.61 inches (HWD) and weighs 5.4 pounds\u2014much more portable than the Blade 18\u2014though still a departure from the previous Blade 15 (0.67 by 13.98 by 9.25 inches and 4.4 pounds). The larger screen size and updated components add about a pound to each of these new laptops compared to the existing sizes, testing the portability selling point somewhat.\n\n(Credit: Brian Westover)\n\nIf 16 inches is more appealing, you\u2019ll get a screen that\u2019s just as advanced as its larger sibling. The QHD+ resolution and 240HZ refresh rate panel are here too, but unlike the Blade 18, there is more than meets the eye to the screen.\n\nThe Blade 16 is also available with mini LED panel that can swap between full HD+ 240Hz (a 1080p equivalent for the 16:10 aspect ratio, 1,920 by 1,200 pixels) or UHD+ 120Hz (a 4K equivalent for the 16:10 aspect ratio, 3,840 by 2,400 pixels) resolutions on the fly. This dynamic resolution panel allows you to change the resolution and refresh rate between those two options to better suit your next gaming session. The mini LED screens have a maximum brightness of 600 nits, while the standard IPS screen is 500 nits.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this laptop will also utilize the latest Intel and Nvidia components, featuring 13th Gen CPUs and 40 Series GPUs. The options are the same as the Blade 18 as well, with the Core i9-13950HX processor as the pick on all models, and GPU options running from the RTX 4060 to the RTX 4090.\n\n(Credit: Brian Westover)\n\nOne key difference is, due to the smaller body and thus more limited thermals, the Blade 16 has a maximum graphics power of 140W. Memory also ranges from 16GB to 32GB (also user upgradeable to 64GB after purchase), and storage from 1TB to 2TB (also user upgradeable to 4TB). The Blade 16 will launch starting at $2,699.99 in Q1 of this year.\n\nBoth laptop sizes benefit from the signature Razer Chroma per-key customizable RGB lighting, Razer Synapse customization and monitoring software, support for USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, the precision touchpad (which we\u2019ve traditionally rated as one of the best among Windows laptops), and Windows Hello via IR full HD cameras.

The restructuring is also expected to result in unspecified cash savings and capital expenditures savings over the next three years.\n\nIn addition to the job cuts, HP will also reduce its number of entities by up to 45%, which the company said would \u201chelp improve its agility and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nHP said the move is part of a strategy to \u201cimprove customer experience, simplify operations, and drive long-term value creation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe changes we are making are necessary to ensure that HP is a leader in its chosen markets and an employer of choice for our employees and partners,\u201d Lores said.\n\nThe layoffs mark the latest move by HP to adjust to the changing economic landscape brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company already cut jobs earlier this year, including 1,400 positions in March.\n\nThe tech giant has been struggling in recent years, with its stock price tumbling over the past five years. HP\u2019s share price is down about 28% since the start of 2020.\n\nThe company said it is hoping the job cuts and other measures will help put HP on a path to long-term growth and profitability.\n\n\u201cI am confident that these decisions will ensure that HP can remain a leader in technology innovation and customer engagement in the years ahead,\u201d Lores said. \u201cHP is a great company with an exciting future, and I am looking forward to leading this transformation.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

As is, 16 celebrities (and sort-of celebrities) take the plunge, in an unscripted Fox series whose premiere felt heavy-handed even by the genre\u2019s standards.\n\nNarrated with the kind of brooding solemnity that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on an episode of \u201cSuccession,\u201d the format resembles an old Fox show called \u201cBoot Camp,\u201d a competition in which drill instructors put contestants through the paces of military training.\n\nHere, there\u2019s no pot of gold at the rainbow\u2019s end, just a lot of physical and emotional torment, as a quartet of tough-talking trainers spend much of their time shouting at the contestants, with a handful failing to survive (figuratively, not literally) the two-hour premiere.\n\n\u201cRemember, you volunteered to come into our world,\u201d the players are told by one of the trainers, which seems worth recalling when they\u2019re asked to leap headfirst into water from a helicopter or cross a 300-foot ravine while tethered to ropes more than 100 feet above the ground.\n\nSure, there\u2019s a lot of talk about embracing the challenge and testing their limits, but there\u2019s also a tiresome amount of theatricality in the presentation, which includes throwing bags over the players\u2019 heads when they\u2019re brought in for \u201cinterrogation,\u201d which sort of doubles as therapy sessions.\n\nThe celebrity \"recruits\" follow Director Staff \"Foxy\" in \"Special Forces: World's Toughest Test.\" Pete Dadds/FOX\n\nThe participants include a by-now-familiar mix of the famous and vaguely recognizable, including several athletes (Danny Amendola, Dwight Howard, Carli Lloyd, Mike Piazza, Nastia Liukin, Gus Kenworthy); singers (Mel B, Montell Jordan), actors (Jamie Lynn Spears, Beverley Mitchell), those previously associated with other reality shows (Kate Gosselin, Hannah Brown, Kenya Moore); a TV doctor (Dr. Drew Pinsky) and TV chef (Tyler Lawrence); and Anthony Scaramucci, famous in part for his 11-day stint in the Trump administration, followed by good-naturedly joining in turning his brief tenure into a unit for measuring short-lived events.\n\nThe elevated drama notwithstanding, some of the challenges genuinely appear pretty harrowing, and it doesn\u2019t require much in the way of acting chops to look apprehensive when gawking at the ravine test. Indeed, scanning some of the reaction shots, the title of another old reality show, the \u201cSurvivor\u201d-like \u201cI\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!,\u201d comes to mind.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call your agent,\u201d a trainer barks at the outset. \u201cNo one\u2019s coming to save you.\u201d\n\nOf course, one can argue whether their agents really had their clients\u2019 best interests in mind in the first place, but for some the hope might be a call from another less-perilous showcase, earning them a few more minutes in the spotlight.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard, seeing these big stunts, to put oneself in the participants\u2019 shoes, which coupled with the celebrity angle could be a source of initial curiosity and media attention.

{"text": "Tens of thousands of people today paid their respects to Benedict XVI, the 265th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, as his body lay in repose in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican.\n\nBenedict, who served as head of the church from 2005 to 2013, died in his native Germany on Saturday, February 2nd, at the age of 92. His body was brought to Rome shortly after his death and today marks the start of several days of tributes and mournful farewells.\n\nThe line of people began forming very early this morning as people braved the cold and rain to be part of this historic event. Later in the day, the line extended around the perimeter of the Vatican walls.\n\nAmong those who waited patiently in line were Catholics from around the world who wanted to be present when Benedict\u2019s body was laid to rest. As the line moved inside St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, a hush fell over the crowd as Pope Benedict\u2019s casket was placed near the main altar of the church.\n\nPeople kneeled and prayed, touched the casket, and took pictures as Benedict\u2019s body lay in state. Many used their phones to capture the special moment and take a piece of this special day home with them.\n\nThe Vatican also shared live footage of the event, giving the world a glimpse of what was going on inside the papal basilica.\n\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony, many of the attendees passed by Benedict\u2019s coffin and silently bid him farewell.\n\nAs the ceremony ended, the crowd spilled out into the square in front of the basilica and lit candles and prayed together.\n\n\u201cBenedict XVI was an extraordinary pope who has had a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world,\u201d said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. \u201cToday is a sad day, but it is also a day to remember his life and legacy.\u201d\n\nBenedict, who was the oldest pope to be elected since 1730, was known for his conservative stances and for his strong belief in the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\nPope Francis, Benedict\u2019s successor, will lead a memorial Mass tomorrow afternoon in St. Peter\u2019s Square, which is expected to be attended by tens of thousands of people from around the world.\n\nThe Mass will be followed by a private burial service for Benedict, which will take place later in the day.\n\nThe official cause of death for Benedict, who had been suffering from respiratory problems for some time, was listed as congestive heart failure. His death comes just two days after Pope Francis led a Mass at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica marking the beginning of Lent, a period of fasting and prayer in the Catholic Church.\n\nBenedict was born Joseph Ratzinger in Marktl, Bavaria, on April 16th, 1927, and was ordained a priest in 1951. He was elected as the 265th pope in 2005 and served as pope until 2013, when he retired.\n\nBenedict was the first pope to retire in nearly 600 years, setting a precedent that opened the door for Pope Francis\u2019 election later that year.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the crowds of people slowly started to disperse from St. Peter\u2019s Square, but their memories of the special day will remain. \n\nToday marks the start of a period of mourning for the Catholic Church, and for millions of Catholics around the world who have been touched by Benedict XVI\u2019s life and his teachings.", "label": "machine"}

From the earliest known human surgery to fossils from a lost human species, the archaeological discoveries of 2022 are sure to fascinate and amaze. Here are 12 of the most incredible finds of the year.\n\n1.The World's Oldest Limb Amputation \u2013 Archaeologists in northern Chile made an incredible discovery when they uncovered a 5,000-year-old human arm bone with evidence of an amputation. Tests revealed that the arm had been amputated during an ancient medical procedure, making it the earliest known example of human limb amputation. The technique used by the ancient surgeons suggests they had an advanced understanding of anatomy and surgical techniques.\n\n2. The Sausage Dog Fights of the Roman Colosseum \u2013 A team of archaeologists discovered that the Roman Colosseum may have once hosted gladiator-style fights between sausage dogs. The discovery was made when researchers unearthed remains of a fighting ring near the Colosseum, along with a variety of bones from sausage dogs. The remains suggest that the dogs were used for entertainment purposes and could have been made to fight each other in the arena.\n\n3. The Earliest Known Human Culture \u2013 A team of researchers uncovered evidence of what may be the world\u2019s earliest known culture. The discovery was made in a cave in South Africa and the remains suggest that ancient humans were already living in complex social groups more than 200,000 years ago. This discovery pushes back the known timeline of human society by over 100,000 years.\n\n4. Prehistoric Human Tattoos \u2013 Researchers made a unique discovery when they uncovered the oldest known example of a human tattoo. The tattooed body of a 5,000-year-old Egyptian priestess was found with intricate symbols covering her arm and chest. Tests revealed that the symbols represent a religious and spiritual belief system that dates back to at least 3,000 BCE.\n\n5. A Lost Human Species \u2013 Scientists made a stunning discovery when they uncovered the remains of a previously unknown human species that lived in the Philippines. The remains date back 50,000 years and show that the species coexisted with modern humans for thousands of years. The species is thought to have been wiped out by the arrival of modern humans in the region.\n\n6. The Lost City of Sodom \u2013 An expedition to the Dead Sea uncovered evidence of a lost city from the biblical era. The remains suggest that the city of Sodom may have actually existed, providing further evidence of the biblical account.\n\n7. Oldest Human Poetry \u2013 Archaeologists in Iraq uncovered a 5,000-year-old tablet with the oldest known example of human poetry. The tablet features a two-line poem written in cuneiform script, showing that humans had already developed an appreciation for poetry in ancient times.\n\n8. A Lost Civilization in Saudi Arabia \u2013 A team of researchers discovered an ancient civilization in Saudi Arabia that had been lost to time. The civilization dates back 5,000 years and appears to have been a sophisticated society with complex trade networks and advanced agriculture.\n\n9. The World's Oldest Wheel \u2013 Archaeologists unearthed the world\u2019s oldest wheel, which dates back 5,500 years. The wheel was uncovered in eastern Europe and is thought to have been used for transportation and in the manufacturing of tools and pottery.\n\n10. Evidence of the Viking Expansion \u2013 Researchers made a remarkable discovery when they uncovered evidence of a Viking settlement in North America. The discovery suggests that Vikings arrived in the region much earlier than previously thought, and could have even made contact with native peoples.\n\n11. Oldest Animal Drawing \u2013 Archaeologists in France uncovered the world\u2019s oldest known animal drawing. The drawing, which dates back 15,000 years, depicts a wild cow and suggests that ancient humans had a deep understanding of wildlife and the natural world.\n\n12. Evidence of Aliens? \u2013 A team of scientists made an astonishing discovery when they uncovered a 4,000-year-old stone slab with strange symbols etched into it. The symbols, which look to be some form of writing, remain a mystery to this day. Some researchers have theorized that the symbols could be evidence of an extraterrestrial visit, though this remains to be proven.\n\nArchaeology is an ever-changing field, with new discoveries being made every year. These 12 discoveries are sure to open up a wealth of new knowledge and understanding about our ancient past. By uncovering our history, we gain an insight into who we are today and how we can move forward.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A Harvard brain expert is providing an inside look at her top 10 groceries for staying \"sharp and focused\"\u2014at any age.\n\nDr. Uma Naidoo, M.D., the director of Nutritional and Lifestyle Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and McLean Hospital, has shared her grocery list with CNBC Make It.\n\n\u201cWe all want to keep our brains as healthy as possible, but don\u2019t always know where to start when it comes to nutrition and lifestyle,\u201d Naidoo says. \u201cThe truth is, \u2018one size fits all\u2019 is not the answer when it comes to nutrition and its impact on mental health.\u201d\n\nIt's not just about healthy eating \u2014 it's also about individualizing what\u2019s best for you. So, when it comes to this Harvard brain expert\u2019s grocery list, Naidoo emphasizes the importance of understanding the body and what works best for you.\n\n\u201cI do encourage my patients to experiment and see what works for them, and for many, there are some very simple, tasty and easy additions that can be incorporated into their regular eating routine that can have meaningful impacts on their overall health and wellness,\u201d she says.\n\nSo what does Naidoo\u2019s grocery list look like? Here are the 10 items she\u2019d recommend adding to your cart for optimal brain health.\n\n1. Omega-3 rich fish and plant-based sources\n\n\u201cOmega-3 fatty acids are essential for us to function normally,\u201d Naidoo says. \u201cThey are important for the development and function of our nerves, cells, muscles and organs, as well as our brain.\u201d\n\nGood sources of omega-3 fatty acids include cold-water fish like salmon, anchovies, sardines, herring and mackerel, as well as some plant-based sources such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds and walnuts.\n\n2. Avocados\n\nAvocados are high in healthy fats, which are essential for your body to function, including your brain. They are rich in oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that has been linked to improved memory and cognition. Plus, avocados contain carotenoids that act as powerful antioxidants and protect the brain from damage.\n\n3. Dark green leafy vegetables\n\nNaidoo recommends loading up on dark, leafy greens as often as possible. They\u2019re full of essential minerals and vitamins, including iron, zinc, calcium and folate \u2014 all of which play a role in brain health. Kale, spinach, Swiss chard and arugula are all excellent sources of these nutrients.\n\n4. Fermented foods\n\nFermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi and tempeh are full of probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that help support your digestion, immune system and overall health. The probiotics in fermented foods also help your body absorb nutrients, including those that are important for brain health.\n\n5. Nuts and seeds\n\nNuts and seeds are a great source of healthy fats and protein, both of which are essential for the brain to function optimally. They also contain vitamins and minerals like B-vitamins, magnesium, zinc and selenium. Naidoo recommends walnuts, almonds, pecans, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and flaxseeds.\n\n6. Extra virgin olive oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is high in healthy fats and contains powerful antioxidants. It\u2019s also a great source of polyphenols, which have been shown to improve learning and memory.\n\n7. Wild-caught salmon\n\nWild-caught salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for brain health. It\u2019s also high in vitamin B12, which helps protect nerve cells from damage.\n\n8. Berries\n\nBerries are a great source of antioxidants, which help protect the brain from damage. They\u2019re also high in polyphenols, which have been linked to improved learning and memory. Naidoo recommends blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries.\n\n9. Dark chocolate\n\nDark chocolate is a source of healthy fats and antioxidants. It\u2019s also been linked to improved memory and cognition, due to its ability to increase blood flow to the brain. Look for dark chocolate that\u2019s at least 70% cocoa.\n\n10. Spices\n\nSpices can provide a variety of health benefits, including cognitive improvements. Naidoo recommends adding turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom and cumin to your dishes to get the most out of their health-promoting compounds.\n\nOf course, no single food is a magic bullet.", "label": "machine"}

Keep in mind, though, that it's very easy to increase your spending when your salary goes up, especially if the salary increase seems small to you.\n\nInstead of falling into bad financial habits, you can direct this additional money towards your financial goals. Here are some tips on managing your finances after a raise, big or small.\n\nFigure out how much your raise changes your take-home pay\n\nAfter receiving a raise, the first thing you want to do is understand how that raise affects your take-home pay. Doing so will help you get into the right mindset. A larger raise can help you accelerate your financial goals, while a smaller raise (such as a cost-of-living adjustment) may not amount to much per paycheck. We'll discuss more below.\n\nOnline paycheck calculators will help you estimate how much you will receive after taxes. It's also helpful to wait for your first paycheck after the raise to see how much you actually receive (versus the gross amount).\n\nA good rule of thumb is to try and save at least 75% of every raise\n\nIt's essential to understand the concept of lifestyle creep so you can avoid it at all costs. While it's OK to set aside a small amount for yourself or use a portion of your raise for something fun, you don't want to get into the habit of consistently spending more after each raise.\n\nWhen you want to splurge on a purchase, think about items that may make your life more comfortable or happier. Make sure you're not just spending more because you can. The more you align your spending with your values and goals, the less likely you are to have buyer's remorse.\n\nBe proactive about how you'll use your raise\n\nLast but not least, you want to be proactive. Have a budget, goals, and a plan. A budget is essential, since your ability to manage your cash flow directly impacts your ability to achieve financial goals. Setting goals gives you the motivation to stay on track, and a well-thought-out plan is the roadmap to achieving your goals. When you have these three items in place, it's easier to know how you should allocate additional cash from a raise.\n\nAnother way to be proactive is to set rules ahead of time for how to treat raises or other unexpected money. For example, you could allocate a certain percentage to increase savings or pay off debt, a certain percentage for charitable giving, and a certain percentage for fun. The specific percentages and categories are up to you.\n\nHow to handle small raises vs. large raises\n\nYour approach to handling your finances after a raise can be different based on the size of the raise.\n\nSmall raises may not amount to much of an increase in your take-home pay, but consider using them to increase contributions to your employer-sponsored plans. For example, if you receive a 3% raise, you could increase your 401(k) contributions by another 1-2%. Another option is to increase contributions to your Health Savings Account. Either way, small savings increases build up over time. Don't let those small raises slip through your fingers!\n\nWhat if you receive a large raise? I highly recommend redirecting the money right away so you're not tempted to spend it.\n\nThe first thing you should do is revisit your income tax withholding. In some cases, a large raise can push you into a higher tax bracket. Check with a tax professional to determine if the amount you're withholding from your paycheck is sufficient. If it's not, adjust your tax withholding or plan to make estimated tax payments so there are no surprises on April 15.\n\nAssuming your lifestyle is comfortable, you can use large raises to accelerate savings and debt payments. Prioritize building an emergency fund and paying off high-interest debt. From there, allocate your raise to other financial priorities that match your goals. If you have automatic savings contributions or debt payments, increase those before the money touches your hands.\n\nIf you're still working towards a comfortable lifestyle, take baby steps. Don't make a lot of major purchases right away, especially ones where you take on debt.

{"text": "As tensions between the US and China threaten to disrupt the global supply chain, countries such as India and Vietnam could benefit from chipmakers looking to diversify their sources of supply, analysts said.\n\nChipmakers such as Intel, Samsung, TSMC and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have begun looking at other regions including India and Vietnam for alternative sources of semiconductor fabrication as the US-China trade war shows no signs of abating.\n\n\"Semiconductor companies in India and Vietnam have been given a great opportunity to expand their operations and take advantage of this shift in the global supply chain,\" said Arun Mahajan, a technology analyst at HDFC Securities.\n\nThe trade war has already had an impact on the global semiconductor industry, with chipmakers in the US, Taiwan and South Korea having to reconsider their supply chain strategies in an effort to avoid sanctions from the US government.\n\nAnalysts say that India and Vietnam could be among the beneficiaries of this shift in production.\n\n\"The US-China trade war has caused a major disruption to the global supply chain and chipmakers are now looking for alternatives to China,\" said Ajay Vaidya, a technology analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"India and Vietnam are both well-positioned to benefit from this trend.\"\n\nIndia, in particular, has been eager to take advantage of the shift away from China and has already been making moves to boost its semiconductor production.\n\nThe Indian government has set up the National Program for Semiconductor Fabrication (NPSF) to help boost the country's semiconductor fabrication capabilities. The program has a budget of \u20b95500 crore (around US$750 million) and is expected to be completed by 2023.\n\nThe program will fund the construction of new fabs in India and also provide incentives for existing and new fabs to increase their production.\n\nVietnam, on the other hand, has been less vocal about its ambitions to become a major semiconductor player but analysts say the country could also benefit from the US-China tensions.\n\nVietnam has a skilled workforce and is home to several major tech firms such as Samsung, Intel, Micron and Qualcomm, which have all set up semiconductor fabrication facilities in the country.\n\n\"Vietnam has a well-established semiconductor industry which has been growing steadily over the past few years,\" said Mahajan. \"The country is well-positioned to take advantage of the supply chain disruption due to the US-China trade war.\"\n\nAnalysts said that while India and Vietnam are well-positioned to benefit from the US-China trade tensions, the countries would need to invest in infrastructure and technology to take full advantage of the opportunity.\n\n\"The challenge for both countries is to ensure that the right infrastructure and technology is in place to accommodate the additional demand,\" said Vaidya.\n\nHe added that while India had made progress in recent years in setting up infrastructure and facilities to support the semiconductor industry, more needed to be done.\n\nVietnam, too, needed to further invest in infrastructure and technology if it wanted to fully benefit from the US-China trade war.\n\n\"Both countries need to continue to make investments in infrastructure and technology, and build an ecosystem that will attract foreign investments,\" said Vaidya.\n\nAnalysts said that in order for India and Vietnam to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the US-China trade tensions, the countries needed to invest in talent and research and development (R&D) to ensure that the semiconductor industry in both countries could compete on a global level.\n\n\"Indian and Vietnamese companies need to ramp up their R&D capabilities in order to be competitive in the global semiconductor industry,\" said Mahajan. \"The companies need to invest in technology and talent to ensure that they remain competitive in the face of competition from China and other countries.\"\n\nAnalysts said that India and Vietnam had an opportunity to take advantage of the US-China trade tensions, but the countries needed to act quickly and make the right investments in order to reap the benefits.\n\n\"The countries should move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the US-China trade war,\" said Vaidya. \"It is important that India and Vietnam make the right investments in order to be competitive in the global semiconductor industry.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Some Wall Street analysts see a buying opportunity in Tesla in 2023 \u2014 though others think the car maker's recent deliveries miss spells trouble for the electric vehicle maker. Tesla reported deliveries of 405,278 vehicles in the final quarter of 2022 , less than the 427,000 deliveries expected by analysts, according to consensus estimates compiled on FactSet, as of Dec. 31. Still, that was an increase of 40% year over year \u2014 a record for Tesla. For some on Wall Street, the ramp up in production helped offset the deliveries miss. Baird analyst Ben Kallo, who recently named Tesla a top pick for 2023, reiterated an outperform rating and said he would remain a buyer of the stock ahead of the company's earnings report on Jan. 25. \"Q4 deliveries missed consensus but beat our estimates. Importantly, production increased ~20% q/q which we expect to continue into 2023 as gigafactories in Berlin and Austin continue to ramp,\" Baird's Kallo said in a Tuesday note. Kallo's $252 price target implies the stock can more than double from Friday's closing price of $123.18. Canaccord Genuity's George Gianarikas had a similar view on the stock, saying that any demand pressures on Tesla will pass, especially after a reopening in China. The anayst reiterated a buy rating on Tesla, and maintained a $275 price target. \"Tesla reported 4Q22 deliveries that were slightly below consensus but above CG estimates and, in our opinion, better than worst-case fears,\" Gianarikas wrote in a Monday note. \"[Our] conviction remains that current demand issues reflect cyclical pressures and that strong secular growth remains for years to come. We see Tesla sustaining multiple years of extraordinary growth as EV penetration continues to move higher, new vectors of growth open, and competitors begin to falter,\" Gianarikas added. To be sure, not all analysts on Wall Street were as bullish on the stock. Shares of Tesla increasingly came under pressure last year from weakening demand of the firm's vehicles, which are more expensive than similar offerings from competitors. Meanwhile, a rise of Covid cases in China caused Tesla to temporarily suspend and lower production at its Shanghai facility. The stock was down about 65% in 2022. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman lowered his price target on Tesla to $125, while remaining underweight on the stock, saying the need for more promotions to sell vehicles in the last quarter points to further downside ahead. \"We are lowering our estimates and price target after Tesla on Monday reported 4Q deliveries which tracked modestly higher than our model but seemingly at the cost of higher incentives, suggesting lower pricing and margin,\" JPMorgan's Brinkman wrote in a Tuesday note. \"[Moreover], 4Q deliveries were a miss vs. consensus expectations, which when combined with the drag from lower pricing in our view suggests potential downside to Bloomberg consensus EPS of $1.19 heading into the release,\" Brinkman wrote. Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi also had an underperform rating on the stock, saying he expects that consensus estimates are too high, and that demand pressures will continue for Tesla. \"We expect demand challenges to persist in 2023, particularly since *NO* Tesla models appear to currently qualify for any IRA rebates except the 7-seat Model Y (which is a $3000 option),\" AllianceBernstein's Sacconaghi Jr. wrote in a Monday note. \"We believe Tesla will need to either reduce its growth targets (and run its factories below capacity) or sustain and potentially increase recent price cuts globally, pressuring margins. We see demand problems remaining until Tesla is able to introduce a lower priced offering in volume, which may only be in 2025.\" His $150 price target represents roughly 22% upside for shares of Tesla. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "This year in ETFs highlighted the dramatic difference in performance of varying areas of the market, with one sector dominating the top performers list. Given the towering outperformance of oil and gas assets and major declines elsewhere, many top performers were leveraged versions of commodities strategies and inverse funds. In many cases, the energy funds didn't even need leverage to outperform, with plain vanilla sector funds seeing massive gains. However, when you strip out the leveraged funds, there are some surprising names at the top to break the stranglehold of oil and gas ETFs. *List excludes inverse funds and levered versions of other strategies. Return data through 12/23. The iShares MSCI Turkey ETF has surged in the second half of the year and has a total return of more than 100%. That actually puts it ahead of the non-leveraged energy funds, according to FactSet. Sky-high inflation and political influence at the nation's central bank make investing in Turkey a tricky proposition for investors, but it has worked out in 2022. Even with Turkey ETF as an outlier, the list overall is still dominated by oil and gas funds, with the VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH) generating a total return of 65%. Seven other energy-related funds had a total return of more than 60% through Dec. 23. Excluding all of the energy-specific funds, the remaining list shows more innovative strategies that had success. *List excludes inverse funds and levered versions of strategies. Return data through 12/23. The second best-performing fund on the list is the Simplify Interest Rate Hedged ETF (PFIX) . The fund is one of several that have flourished in a year marked by the highest inflation in decades and repeated rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The Advocate Rising Rate Hedge ETF (RRH) and FolioBeyond Rising Rates ETF (RISR) also did their job in buoying investors' portfolios. The KFA Mount Lucas Managed Futures Index Strategy ETF (KMLM) , which gained more than 30%, was also indicative of a trend in 2022. Several managed futures funds had big years as active management of directional bets on areas of the market like tech and energy proved to be a target-rich environment. On the inflows side, broad market funds from Vanguard and iShares were the big winners, as those two brands continued to dominate the ETF market.

They've punched out. They're done,\u201d TV host Mike Rowe said on The Brian Kilmeade Show, citing research from economist Nick Eberstadt.\n\n\u201cSo what's really happening in the country now that scares me right to my core fundamentally is that we've never had so much unrealized opportunity and so little enthusiasm for it.\u201d\n\nDon't miss\n\nWhy the workforce participation rate is waning\n\nEberstadt first noted the decline in the number of men with jobs in his 2016 book, Men Without Work \u2014 a trend he says was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While plenty of workers were laid off or left due to illness, not all of them returned to the labor force \u2014 even after job openings picked up.\n\nThe Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank also found that 25% of prime age Americans aren\u2019t currently working \u2014 and while some say they\u2019re looking for jobs, but can\u2019t find any, others are actively choosing not to join the job hunt. The report points to reasons like caregiving for an elderly parent or child, health-related concerns, retiring early, going to school or joining the military.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce surveyed Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic and about a quarter said federal aid incentivized them to not actively look for work, while about half aren\u2019t willing to take jobs that don\u2019t offer the option of remote work. Over a third of younger respondents said they were focusing on learning new skills and prioritizing their personal growth before re-entering the labor force.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s a growing gender gap\n\nEberstadt says a vast majority of these prime-age men spend around 2,000 hours a year on screens, do little housework and don\u2019t spend time volunteering. However, there might be more to the story than men simply slacking off and sitting at home.\n\nThe decline of men in the workforce may be partially due to the drop in manufacturing jobs since the 1960s, which have either been automated or moved offshore.\n\nRead more: 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)\n\nAdditionally, research shows that women are more likely to have four-year college degrees compared to men, when postsecondary education typically comes with better employment prospects. Women account for more than half of America\u2019s college educated workforce, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nCollege-educated women are now participating in the labor force at the same rate they were before the pandemic, while the share of college-educated men working or actively looking for work has lessened.\n\nWhy this is a problem\n\nRowe calls the decline in male participation in the workforce \u201cthe most chilling metric of all\u201d since it\u2019s \u201can indication of what's to come.\u201d\n\nReduced labor force participation has already taken its toll on lower-paying industries \u2014 the leisure and hospitality sector has seen the highest quit rate since July 2021, and retail isn\u2019t far behind, reports the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAnd durable goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade and education and health services are contending with a shortage of skilled workers.\n\nThis puts more pressure on the remaining employees, who may be dealing with longer hours, tougher responsibilities and burnout.\n\n\u201cRunning your workers like this \u2014 asking them to do 20%, 30% more because you\u2019re short staffed \u2014 it\u2019s very much a short-term strategy.

In their latest forecast, Fannie Mae researchers predicted that 30-year fixed rates will trend down throughout 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut whether mortgage rates will drop in 2023 hinges on if the Federal Reserve can get inflation under control.\n\nIn the last 12 months, the Consumer Price Index rose by 7.1%. This is a significant slowdown compared to where inflation was earlier this year, which is a sign that mortgage rates may start coming down soon as well.\n\nIf the Fed acts too aggressively and engineers a recession, mortgage rates could fall further than what current forecasts expect. But rates probably won't drop to the historic lows borrowers enjoyed a few years ago.\n\nShould I get a HELOC? Pros and cons\n\nIf you're looking to tap into your home's equity, a HELOC might be the best way to do so right now. Unlike a cash-out refinance, you won't have to get a whole new mortgage with a new interest rate, and you'll likely get a better rate than you would with a home equity loan.\n\nBut HELOCs don't always make sense. It's important to consider the pros and cons.\n\nHELOC pros\n\nOnly pay interest on what you borrow\n\nTypically have lower rates than alternatives, including home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards\n\nIf you have a lot of equity, you could potentially borrow more than you could get with a personal loan\n\nHELOC cons\n\nRates are variable, meaning your monthly payments could go up\n\nTaking equity out of your home can be risky if property values decline or you default on the loan\n\nMinimum withdrawal amount may be more than you want to borrow\n\nWhen will house prices come down?\n\nHome prices are starting to decline, but we likely won't see huge drops, even if there's a recession.\n\nThe S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index shows that prices are still up year-over-year, though they've been falling on a monthly basis. Fannie Mae researchers expect prices to decline 1.5% in 2023, while the MBA expects a 0.7% increase in 2023 and a 0.1% decrease in 2024.\n\nSky high mortgage rates have pushed many hopeful buyers out of the market, slowing homebuying demand and putting downward pressure on home prices. But rates may start to drop this year, which would remove some of that pressure. The current supply of homes is also historically low, which will likely keep prices from dropping too far.\n\nWhat happens to house prices in a recession?\n\nHouse prices usually drop during a recession, but not always. When it does happen, it's generally because fewer people can afford to purchase homes, and the low demand forces sellers to lower their prices.\n\nHow much mortgage can I afford?\n\nA mortgage calculator can help you determine how much you can afford to borrow. Play around with different home prices and down payment amounts to see how much your monthly payment could be, and think about how that fits in with your overall budget.\n\nTypically, experts recommend spending no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses. This means your entire monthly mortgage payment, including taxes and insurance, shouldn't exceed 28% of your pre-tax monthly income.\n\nThe lower your rate, the more you'll be able to borrow, so shop around and get preapproved with multiple mortgage lenders to see who can offer you the best rate.

{"text": "Price Review\n\n\n\nPrice is a critical factor when booking an air ticket.\n\nAnd most 'low cost' airlines in South Africa make money by charging for date changes, bags, in-flight snacks, or seat selection.\n\nHere's how SA's surviving domestic airlines compare when it comes to fees for luxuries and penalties.\n\nFor more stories, go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.\n\n\n\nPrice is the biggest factor for most people booking plane tickets. Research suggests it's more important than convenient departure times, airports, airline brands, and customer service.\n\nBut with the constant ebb and flow of \"low-cost\" air travel in South Africa, finding out which airline sells the least expensive tickets is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nThis isn't accidental. Some airlines may sell tickets at low base fares and make up the lost profit by selling other items, like food, checked bags, and seat selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe converse is often also true. Airlines touting the most freebies or amazing flexibility aren't offering them because they care about your wardrobe size or changing diary \u2013 they'll likely make up the loss elsewhere, preferably without you realising.\n\nAlthough aviation companies guard their fare algorithms closely, the best way to beat them at their own game is to book the airline that offers the lowest fare combined with freebies that best suit your travel priorities.\n\nAfter you've considered the base fare cost, you can move on to other aspects \u2013 it's pointless saving R50 on the ticket if you're going to spend upwards of R285 to check your golf clubs. Unless you want a free snack, or to choose your seat. And that ticket flexibility or cancellation policy is great for the uncertain travellers \u2013 but if you're not going to use it you may as well look for a cheaper alternative, or one that's more likely to get you there on time.\n\nIt's complicated to factor in all costs, and each airline in South Africa has tried to carve out something of a niche. But to avoid digging around deep in each airline's terms and conditions, Business Insider South Africa has compiled a list of the most common fees you'll encounter aside from the ticket.\n\nHere's how domestic carrier fees compare for baggage, special equipment, seat selection, in-flight food, ticket changes and cancellations, and those with the best on-time policy.\n\nBest airline if you need to check a bag\n\nBoth Lift and Safair charge you to put a bag in the hold. Airlink, Cemair, and South African Airways (SAA) allow passengers to check one bag at no extra cost. The only difference between these airlines' baggage policies is how much you can stuff into that checked bag.\n\nWinner: SAA edges out the competition by allowing a free 23 kg bag to go into the hold \u2013 2 kgs more than Cemair.\n\nBest airline for carry-on luggage fans\n\nSouth Africa, thankfully, hasn't yet reached the point of charging for carry-on luggage like low-cost carriers elsewhere. The only difference between domestic carrier carry-on policies is how many kilograms you can squeeze into the overhead bin.\n\nWinner: SAA and Airlink allow carry-on bags that weigh 8 kg \u2013 one more kg than other carriers.\n\nBest airline for golfers, cyclists, and double bass players\n\nAbnormally large items like bikes, golf clubs, and musical instruments will almost always cost you extra when flying. Airlines usually call it \"Special Equipment\", and all but one add a sizeable surcharges for flying with it. This category is a little unclear \u2013 some charge per kg for special equipment, others require you to email ahead to enquire, and others will include it in your checked baggage allowance and charge you more if you go over that.\n\nWinner: SAA offers a relatively liberal special equipment policy \u2013 they won't charge you if it meets specific requirements and falls within your allocated checked baggage allowance.\n\nIf it's light special equipment you want to fly with, Airlink's R33 per kg, or included 15kg for sporting equipment, is also competitive.\n\nBest airline for slightly fussy sitters\n\nSeat selection comes at a cost for many low-cost carriers, and South Africa is no different. Some domestic carriers charge you just to select a regular seat somewhere in the back and even more to snag a front or exit-row seat.\n\nWinner: Airlink and Lift allow you to choose a normal seat at no extra cost when buying a ticket.\n\nBest airline for the tall or impatient\n\nIf bagging a seat with extra legroom or close to the front of the plane is a priority, then you'll need to pay extra on most airlines.\n\nAirlink charges the most for this privilege, with others offering a sliding scale depending on how special your seat is.\n\nWinner: Safair charges between R50 and R80 for a premium seat \u2013 which is R10 less than the closest competitor Lift.\n\nBest airline for hungry flyers\n\nWith the demise of Kulula and Mango, the policy of charging for an average mid-air snack has gone out of fashion. All but one domestic carrier in South Africa now offers complimentary snacks and drinks to passengers \u2013 including, in some cases, alcohol.\n\nWinner: Everyone but Safair, the only airline to still charge for food and drink.\n\nBest airline for indecisive flyers\n\nFlight changes have historically been one of the most significant fees in the low-cost market \u2013 if they were even possible. Although all will charge you the fare difference and not jump to refund you if your new flight is cheaper, more airlines are lowering their punitive \"administration\" fees.\n\nAirlink is the only airline sticking to pre-pandemic ticket change policies \u2013 they'll hit you with a fee of R500 if you change your flight. Others, except one, will charge you between R265 and R300 plus the fare difference to change your booking.\n\nWinner: Lift differentiates itself with flexibility and doesn't charge a fee for changes made more than 24 hours to take off.\n\nBest airline for ghosters\n\nIf you're likely to cancel your flight altogether, you're in for a heftier fee \u2013 if you're offered the option at all.\n\nAirlink and SAA will take your full fare if you cannot fly. Safair and Cemair charge R300 and R500, respectively, for flight cancellations.\n\nWinner: Lift doesn't charge any fee to cancel a flight \u2013 though, like others, they'll put the money you initially paid into a \"wallet\" that you can use for a future Lift flight.\n\nBest airline if you want to arrive on time\n\nOn-time arrival is an often-overlooked but critical feature to consider when booking an air ticket \u2013 particularly during busy periods and on airlines with smaller fleets.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe top three House Democrats who are stepping back from their leadership spots did not coordinate on their decisions to do so, outgoing Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Sunday, adding that \u201cthe timing was right.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you heard I was 83?\u201d Hoyer quipped about his age in an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nHoyer\u2019s departure from his leadership post, as well as the decisions by Nancy Pelosi and Jim Clyburn, both 82, to step down as House speaker and majority whip, respectively, represent a generational change for the Democratic Party in the chamber.\n\n\u201cI think all of us have been around for some time and pretty much have a feel for the timing of decisions. And I think all three of us felt that this was the time,\u201d Hoyer told Bash.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders, front row from left, Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn and Nancy Pelosi walk out of the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, on October 15, 2013. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nHoyer noted that the trio has led the House Democratic Caucus \u201cfor a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that capacity, I think each of us made an individual decision. The timing was right,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Democrats chose current Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries of New York, 52, to replace Pelosi as top Democrat in the chamber. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, 59, who will serve as minority whip, and California Rep. Peter Aguilar, 43, who will lead the caucus, are a generation younger than their predecessors.\n\nThe octogenarians, however, are still expected to have a presence in the incoming Congress. Clyburn will serve in a slightly demoted leadership role as assistant leader (the party\u2019s No. 4 position), while Pelosi was recently designated \u201cspeaker emerita.\u201d Hoyer said Sunday that he expects to still advise the new Democratic leaders.\n\n\u201cMr. Jeffries and I have talked. I think he wants me to continue to give advice and counsel and to be involved in decision making \u2013 albeit not as majority leader,\u201d the Maryland Democrat told Bash.\n\n\u2018The most effective political leader\u2019\n\nReflecting on his career in leadership, Hoyer praised two people who he said will be remembered by history as giants: the late civil rights icon and longtime congressman John Lewis and Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think we have a very respectful relationship,\u201d Hoyer said of Pelosi, with whom he has worked for years. \u201cI think we have a business-like relationship but I like Nancy and I admire Nancy greatly. She is an extraordinary human being. She\u2019s indefatigable. She has extraordinary energy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s probably the most effective political leader that I\u2019ve worked with over the years.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on interning with the Baltimore-born Pelosi in the office of Maryland Rep. Daniel Brewster in the 1960s, Hoyer told Bash: \u201cI think that story doesn\u2019t get enough play.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy was sitting in the front office as receptionist, and I was sitting right behind her in sort of a little divided half wall handling academy appointments, opening mail, doing things that interns do or part-time employees do, and we were there together. Some 40 years later, we became the speaker and the majority leader,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two lawmakers, however, have not always had a straightforward relationship.\n\nHoyer remarked that he was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d when Pelosi endorsed Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha over him to become majority whip in 2006, though Hoyer won that race \u201cpretty handily,\u201d he recalled.\n\nA few years earlier, in 2001, Pelosi had defeated Hoyer to become House Democratic whip.\n\nAsked whether he would\u2019ve liked to have become speaker had Pelosi not been in the picture, Hoyer replied: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t? What politician in the House of Representatives would not like to be the speaker? Of course, I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut very frankly, as I remarked to one reporter, I said I\u2019m not sure I could have done a better job than Nancy and maybe not as good a job as Nancy,\u201d he told Bash.\n\nHoyer said he has not ruled out running for Congress in 2024: \u201cI may. I may.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Berkshire Hathaway 's stock, dragged down by the recent market turmoil, has become cheaper than the level when the conglomerate started aggressively buying back its own shares four years ago. The conglomerate's Class A stock fell more than 22% in the second quarter, down nearly 24% from its all-time high reached on March 28. The pullback coincided with a big sell-off in the broader market, which tumbled into a bear market after aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve sparked fears of a recession. UBS' Berkshire analyst Brian Meredith said after the recent sell-off, Berkshire's stock is currently trading at around a 26% discount to its intrinsic value, which is more than the 22% average discount since the conglomerate resumed share repurchases in the third quarter of 2018. Meredith's calculation used an estimated book value of Berkshire's non-insurance operations, plus the value of its various balance sheet investments including its equity investment in Kraft Heinz, and subtracts deferred taxes on marketable securities. A combination of factors have made Berkshire's stock cheaper. Besides the recent pullback in share prices, Berkshire's various assets have increased in value drastically in recent years, compressing the multiple of the stock. Record buybacks Warren Buffett has supported Berkshire's stock through an aggressive and consistent buyback program over the past few years. The conglomerate repurchased a record $27 billion of its own shares in 2021 as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" found few opportunities externally. The program authorized in 2018 allowed for buybacks at prices as high as 120% of book value, according to Stephen Biggar, Berkshire analyst at Argus. Buffett said back then that repurchases \"make good sense\" as appealing deals remained scarce. \"Charlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods are never pleasant; they are also never permanent,\" Buffett wrote in his annual letter released in February 2022. \"Fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during 2020 and 2021 for deploying capital.\" Slowdown began In the first quarter, however, Berkshire's stock buybacks slowed down to $3.2 billion from $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 as share prices skyrocketed to a record high. The stock closed above half a million dollars for the first time in March with the multifaceted conglomerate benefiting from the economic recovery. The company also started to become more active with dealmaking and stock picking than it had been for a while. In late March, the company agreed to buy insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion \u2014 marking Buffett's biggest deal since 2016. Meanwhile, Berkshire continued its buying spree in the public markets. The conglomerate ramped up its bet on Occidental to nearly 20% as of the end of last week, a regulatory filing showed. Berkshire also acquired a new stake in HP this year. While the low share price presents a good opportunity for buybacks, it doesn't mean that the conglomerate would increase repurchases dramatically if it keeps finding things to buy externally. \"Mr. Buffett reported that Berkshire didn't buy back any stock in April, probably reflecting both valuation and re-emerging external capital deployment opportunities,\" said Meyer Shields, Berkshire analyst at KBW. Shields said he projects a total of $13.6 billion in buybacks this year. Buffett himself told shareholders at its annual meeting this year that he would prefer acquiring stakes in other companies to share repurchases. \"If we have the choice of buying businesses that we like, or buying back stock \u2014 the controlling factor's how much money we have \u2014 we'd rather buy businesses,\" Buffett said in April in Omaha, Nebraska.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "on the edge\n\nTom Brady's 2020 NFL season has come down to the wire, with just one week left before the regular season ends and the playoff picture is set in stone. The six-time Super Bowl champion has gone from being one of the league's most reliable quarterbacks to a walking question mark as his Tampa Bay Buccaneers face the Atlanta Falcons in Week 17.\n\nBrady has been mired in a six-week slump, throwing for just three touchdowns and six interceptions during that stretch. But with the Bucs needing to win to stay alive in the playoff race, the 43-year-old gunslinger has a chance to turn his fortunes around and keep his playoff dreams alive.\n\nBrady's numbers this season are not overly impressive, with 24 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions. His completion percentage of 63.6 percent is his lowest since 2003 and his passer rating of 84.2 is the lowest since 2011. However, he has looked better of late, throwing for 12 touchdowns and just two interceptions in his last five games.\n\nThe Buccaneers have struggled as a team in recent weeks, losing three of their last five games, and will be relying heavily on Brady if they are to end the season on a high note.\n\nAs for the Falcons, the end of the season could be a turning point for the team. They have gone 4-2 over the past six weeks, with their only losses coming to the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints. Atlanta has the fourth-best scoring offense in the league, averaging 28.8 points per game, and quarterback Matt Ryan is having one of the best seasons of his career, throwing for 4,242 yards, 23 touchdowns and just nine interceptions.\n\nThe Falcons' defense has also been reliable, ranking in the top 10 in points allowed per game. In their last three games, Atlanta has allowed just 9.7 points per game, so Brady will have his work cut out for him if he is to lead the Bucs to victory.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Brady's future remains unclear. His contract with Tampa Bay expires at the end of the season, and he could be facing his final game in a Buccaneers uniform. Of course, if Brady can lead the Buccaneers to a victory and into the playoffs, he could end up securing a new contract and extending his legacy with one more deep postseason run.\n\nNo matter the outcome, there is sure to be plenty of drama when the Buccaneers and Falcons meet in Week 17. With the playoff picture coming into focus and the fate of two veteran quarterbacks on the line, it promises to be an intriguing matchup.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Afghan commandos who fled the Taliban are being recruited to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine.\n\nAfghan volunteers because they lack stable incomes and are being offerred high salaries.\n\nMany of these US-trained fighters see joining Russia's war in Ukraine as the least bad option.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Media reports citing former Afghan officers suggested that the Wagner Group, a private military contractor with close ties to the Kremlin, was behind the recruitment campaign.\n\nFormer Afghan commandos in Iran that I spoke to largely confirm the rumors, though I found less evidence to support the claim of Wagner's role. Many of the commandos confirmed having been contacted via WhatsApp or Signal and offered the opportunity to volunteer to fight in the war.\n\nThe messages were brief and direct, offering a monthly salary of $1,500, a Russian residence permit for the soldiers' families and even passports. Senior officers were promised salaries of $2,500.\n\nWhile there is no reliable information on how many of those contacted actually accepted these offers, the reports raise the question of what happened to the roughly 22,000 US-trained Afghan special operations forces that made up the core of the much larger Afghan army.\n\nThese commandos formed the tip of the army's spear in the fight against the Taliban and other insurgents in the final years of the US military's involvement in Afghanistan, a role that only expanded as US troops began withdrawing in 2021.\n\nImmediately following the sudden collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021, the Afghan army disintegrated \u2014 and the commandos were no exception. After the Taliban takeover, only about 1,000 Afghan commandos were evacuated to the US, while a few others made it to Europe and Turkey. About 20,000 were simply left behind.\n\nCommandos during graduation at the Afghan National Army Special Operations Corps in Kabul in January 2020. Rahmatullah Alizadah/Xinhua via Getty\n\nWhile many lower-ranking soldiers in the army accepted an amnesty offered by the Taliban in return for turning over their weapons, most special operations forces did not. This was perhaps out of the pride born of being part of an elite fighting force, but it was also due to fear of reprisals, given that the Afghan commandos had killed a significant number of Taliban during the war.\n\nIn fact, some of those who did surrender and hand over their weapons were killed in revenge attacks. The Taliban have been actively hunting down the rest.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that many former Afghan special operations forces and their families have sought refuge in neighboring countries, with several hundred in Pakistan and a few reportedly in Tajikistan. But above all, they have fled to Iran, where between 2,000 and 5,000 former commandos can be found, mostly concentrated in Tehran and Mashhad.\n\nAmong the roughly 14,000 ex-commandos estimated to still be in Afghanistan, some are fighting in the ranks of various opposition groups, such as the National Resistance Front. A few even enlisted in the Islamic State in Khorasan for purely pragmatic reasons, attracted by offers of relatively generous pay and shelter from the Taliban.\n\nHowever, the Islamic State leadership soon decided they were too \"ideologically contaminated\" by their past experience with US forces to be trustworthy. Those that had joined were subsequently expelled, and all further recruitment was banned.\n\nBut the vast majority of the special operations forces left in Afghanistan seem to be in hiding, waiting for an opportunity to get out of the country safely. Many hoped to be evacuated by the US or a European country. Few were that lucky, however.\n\nAfghan special forces in Kunduz City. Thomson Reuters\n\nFor most of those who fled, especially the Farsi-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras, Iran was the refuge of choice. Nevertheless, while Iran has allowed them to enter, it has not proved to be a particularly welcoming destination. The commandos there complain about a lack of income to support their families or else working long hours at menial jobs. As unregistered refugees, their children cannot enroll in schools.\n\nMost of them are not keen to join a new war, but they see no other viable options. What I most often heard from those who were contacted to fight in Ukraine is that, even if they did not make it back alive, at least their families would be provided for.\n\nAlthough the recruiters contacting them do not identify themselves, they are almost certainly using information passed along by the Iranian authorities, who collected the commandos' telephone numbers and details about their previous experience when they entered Iran.\n\nMoreover, the Iranian authorities opened recruitment offices in Tehran and Mashhad where Afghans can volunteer to fight in Ukraine; information about these offices is spreading by word of mouth, according to a former commando who went to Mashhad to register along with six others.\n\nBesides dire economic conditions, another motivation for volunteering seems to be a sense of betrayal. One commando who agreed to fight in Ukraine told a member of my team:\n\nIt was the Americans and the Europeans who handed us over to the Taliban. Believe me, one of my reasons for going to fight against Ukraine is that I understand that Americans and European countries are involved in the war, and for revenge I am going to fight against Ukraine to tell the Americans and Europeans that with your military training I am going to make you fail in the war in Ukraine.\n\nIt's unclear, however, how widespread these feelings are. Another Afghan commando, for instance, expressed resentment toward Russia because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.\n\nMany of the commandos are also likely to be influenced \u2014 and misinformed \u2014 by the Iranian media's pro-Russian reporting on the conflict. As one told the team:\n\nSome people, including myself, joined the Russian side because there is less danger fighting for Russia than fighting for Ukraine, because Russia has more modern weapons and their casualties are much less then Ukrainian casualties.\n\nIt remains difficult to determine with certainty how successful the Russian recruitment effort has really been. Those volunteering seem to have the impression that many of their colleagues are also doing so.\n\nA US Special Forces soldier patrols with Afghan Commandos. US Army\n\nBased on the personal contacts of four former commandos my team spoke with in Iran, as many as a third of the commandos there \u2014 or at least a few hundred and up to about 1,500 \u2014 have already accepted the offer to fight in Ukraine.\n\nOne commando in Mashhad whom the team spoke to in mid-November suggested that some 200 former commandos and their families had already been sent to Russia in preparation for deployment to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, the recruiters now seem to be trying to attract former commandos inside Afghanistan. One of those who joined from Iran says he was asked to share the contact information of former commandos he knows who are still inside Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to another former commando in Iran, several of his contacts still in Afghanistan have indeed received the same offer he did, and some of them are considering whether to accept. The Iranian authorities are even reportedly offering the use of their consulates in Afghanistan to help volunteers leave the country.\n\nJoining the war in Ukraine appears to be the least bad option for many of these former fighters. The bitter irony is that, having been on the losing side of the US war in their own country, they may now be heading off to join another fight with a highly uncertain outcome.\n\nAntonio Giustozzi is a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute and the author of \"The Taliban at War,\" among other publications.", "label": "human"}

Investors in Tokyo were encouraged by the news that the government had approved an extra $203.7 billion stimulus package, hoping it could help bolster the country's struggling economy.\n\nBut the country remains saddled with a sluggish economy and many economists warn that a rebound may be difficult to achieve, given the extent of the COVID-19 fallout.\n\nAcross the region, the immediate outlook remains a grim one, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating the Asia-Pacific region could experience its deepest contraction on record.\n\nThe fund expects the regional economy to contract by 1.7% this year, with output falling for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year and unemployment expected to stay elevated.\n\nWith weak economic growth expected to persist, investors in the region appear to be positioning themselves defensively. According to data from Nomura Global Markets Research, the largest inflows into Japan equities over the past two months have been into stocks with high dividend yields and lower volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, in Singapore, stocks with low debt, low beta and high dividend yields have seen the greatest inflows.\n\nAs for the rest of the region, investors may continue to remain cautious in the near term as the coronavirus pandemic rumbles on.\n\nAnalysts are predicting that vaccine rollouts across the region could take longer than anticipated.

{"text": "For five years in a row, Finland has ranked No. 1 as the happiest country in the world, according to the World Happiness Report. In 2022's report, people in 156 countries were asked to \"value their lives today on a 0 to 10 scale, with the worst possible life as a 0.\" It also looks at factors that contribute to social support, life expectancy, generosity and absence of corruption. As a Finnish philosopher and psychologist who studies the fundamentals of happiness, I'm often asked: What exactly makes people in Finland so exceptionally satisfied with their lives? To maintain a high quality of life, here are three things we never do:\n\n1. We don't compare ourselves to our neighbors.\n\nThere's a famous line by a Finnish poet: \"Kell' onni on, se onnen k\u00e4tkek\u00f6\u00f6n.\" Roughly translated, it means: Don't compare or brag about your happiness. Finns really take this to heart, especially when it comes to material things and overt displays of wealth. I once ran into one of the wealthiest men in Finland. He was pushing his toddler in a stroller towards the tram station. He could have bought himself an expensive car or hire a driver, but he opted for public transportation. That's what success looks like in Finland: just like everyone else. Happiness tip: Focus more on what makes you happy and less on looking successful. The first step to true happiness is to set your own standards, instead of comparing yourself to others.\n\n2. We don't overlook the benefits of nature.\n\nAccording to a 2021 survey, 87% of Finns feel that nature is important to them because it provides them with peace of mind, energy and relaxation. In Finland, employees are entitled to four weeks of summer holiday. Many of us use that time to hit the countryside and immerse ourselves in nature. The fewer amenities, even to the point of no electricity or running water in the house, the better. A lot of Finnish cities are also densely built, which means that many people have access to nature at their doorsteps. I live next to Helsinki Central Park, where I go on regular walks. Happiness tip: Spending time in nature increases our vitality, well-being and a gives us a sense of personal growth. Find ways to add some greenery to your life, even if it's just buying a few plants for your home.\n\n3. We don't break the community circle of trust.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\nFor the last few decades, the number of mass shootings in the United States has risen to unimaginable levels. Just this week, a gunman opened fire in a grocery store in Colorado, killing 10 people. With this tragic event, it is impossible to ignore the national conversation surrounding assault weapons. \n\nIt was 20 years ago, in 1994, when the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was signed into law. The ban prohibited the sale, manufacture, and transfer of some semi-automatic firearms, magazines over 10 rounds, and \u201ccertain other military-style features.\u201d The aim was to reduce the frequency and severity of mass shootings and gun-related violent crime. \n\nIt was a bold move and the impact of the ban was widely debated. To settle the debate, we looked at the numbers to try and determine the effectiveness of the ban.\n\nThe first statistic we looked at is the rate of mass shootings during the AWB\u2019s 9-year tenure. Unfortunately, the ban did not seem to have a direct effect on the number of mass shootings. From 1994 to 2003, the average number of mass shootings per year was 8.9. After the ban expired in 2004, the average number of mass shootings per year rose to 12.5. \n\nThis suggests that the ban had little effect on the overall number of mass shootings. However, there are some interesting findings when it comes to the severity of the shootings.\n\nWhen the AWB was in effect, we saw an average of 1.32 deaths per mass shooting. After the ban expired, the average rose to 2.58 deaths per mass shooting. This suggests that, even though the number of mass shootings was not reduced, the AWB helped to reduce the number of fatalities in these situations.\n\nWe also looked at the number of guns used in mass shootings from 1994 to 2018. During the AWB, the average number of guns used per mass shooting was 3.71. After the ban expired, this number jumped to 4.45 guns per mass shooting.\n\nThis suggests that while the AWB did not reduce the number of mass shootings, it did reduce the number of guns used in these events. This could help explain why the AWB seemed to be effective in reducing the number of fatalities in mass shootings.\n\nThe last statistic we looked at was the average number of rounds fired in mass shootings. From 1994 to 2003, the average number of rounds fired per mass shooting was 24.26. After the ban expired, this number rose to 37.53.\n\nThis finding suggests that while the AWB reduced the number of guns used in mass shootings, it did not reduce the number of rounds fired. This could help explain why we saw an increase in the number of fatalities after the ban expired. \n\nOverall, our analysis suggests that the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 did help to reduce the severity of mass shootings in the United States. While the ban did not reduce the number of mass shootings, it did reduce the number of guns used, which could explain why we saw a reduction in the number of fatalities. Of course, this is an incomplete analysis and more research is needed to determine the long-term effects of the ban. However, this data suggests that the ban did have a positive impact and that we should consider reinstating it in some form.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "After years of oppressive drought, California finally experienced a wet winter\u2014 with the Sierra Nevada Mountains receiving more snow than in decades. While this much-needed downpour has created extraordinary skiing conditions and brought temporary relief to the water-starved state, experts say the wet winter may not be enough to fully address the reservoirs' long-term water shortage.\n\nIn December 2020, the Californian Department of Water Resources reported that the state's snowpack measured at a staggering 175% of its historic average. This meant that winter storm after winter storm had brought the Sierra Nevada Mountains all the moisture they needed to build up the vital snowpack and help the region fill its lakes, rivers and reservoirs.\n\nUnfortunately, while the 2019\u201320 winter was one of the snowiest on record, the extreme precipitation is still far below what is needed to replace the years of drought. From 2012 to 2015, California experienced one of the worst droughts in recorded history. This stretched from 2012 until 2019, leaving the state's reservoirs perilously low and the region in desperate need of water.\n\nThe following winter season, which typically brings the most precipitation, saw a bit of a reprieve but not enough to truly combat the drought. From 2016 to 2019, the snowpack measurements steadily decreased and the mountain ranges saw no more than 70% of the average snowfall, far below the necessary amount.\n\nFinally, this past winter, beginning in October 2020, brought extremely wet conditions to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Subsequent months of snowstorms filled the basin, elevating the snowpack to 175% of average.\n\nThese heavy conditions have brought unparalleled skiing opportunities. Ski resorts that typically don't open until December were able to open by Thanksgiving and most had opened by December 15th. This allowed for an extra month of skiing, as well as a strong start for the new season.\n\nUnfortunately, though, this extra snow still may not be enough to repair the damage from the years of drought. Already, California's reservoirs are slowly draining as the state experiences an abnormally dry January and February.\n\nWhile the snowpack has contributed to slightly improved conditions, and more rain is expected this spring, experts say the state is still far behind the years' worth of water needed to restore the region's lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. The snowpack may be great, but without the expected rain, California will only be able to draw on its current water supply.\n\nFortunately, California is currently in its fifth consecutive wet year, and more storms are expected in the coming months. As the snow accumulates and melts, it is expected to raise the reservoir levels slightly but not enough to offset the damage of the years of drought.\n\n\"We need these wet years, but unfortunately it is not enough,\" said Professor Clarissa Machado from the University of California, Davis. \"We need multiple wet years in a row, and even then we will still not have enough water to fill our reservoirs and make up for the years of drought.\"\n\nIn the face of climate change, California is likely to experience more frequent droughts and increasingly dry winters. This is why experts have been urging the state to take better measures to conserve water and prepare for future droughts.\n\n\"Climate change is happening, and it is going to bring about extreme weather patterns,\" said Professor Machado. \"We need to find new ways to manage our water resources, and ensure that we are prepared for more extreme droughts in the future. It is the only way to make sure that the effects of a wet winter are not so quickly forgotten.\"", "label": "machine"}

I was here defending the U.S. Constitution and I'm so sorry that it got to this point.\"\n\nThe heated exchange ended with both Hannity and Boebert agreeing that Pelosi's actions were wrong, but that their disagreement over how to handle the situation should not be the focus of their discussion.\n\nThe incident follows a chaotic day in the House of Representatives, where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a heated debate over the rules governing the election of the new speaker. After Pelosi eventually broke the impasse by using procedural moves, the House voted to elect Ohio Representative Anthony Gonzalez as the new speaker, despite a rebellion from some members of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe spat between Hannity and Boebert highlights the contentious power struggle within the Republican party, as the Freedom Caucus continues to take a more hardline stance on issues like healthcare and immigration.\n\nHowever, Boebert has shown a willingness to work with members of both parties. After the Republican-led effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in the Senate, Boebert worked with Democrats to pass a bill that would reinstate key portions of the law, protecting patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe incident also shows how media outlets like Fox News can shape the direction of the Republican party, particularly as the party seeks to reinvent itself following the election of President Joe Biden. The network, which has been closely associated with former President Donald Trump, has sought to push a more hardline stance on issues like immigration and healthcare, while some members of the Freedom Caucus have argued for a more moderate stance.\n\nUltimately, the disagreement between Hannity and Boebert serves as a reminder of the deep divisions within the Republican party. For now, the party's leadership appears to have settled on a stance of working with Democrats on some issues, while holding firm on others. Whether or not the party can maintain this fragile balance remains to be seen.", "label": "machine"}

Theoretically, the COVID-19 pandemic wouldn't happen, right?\n\nNot quite, because then future-you wouldn't have decided to time travel in the first place.\n\nFor decades, physicists have been studying and debating versions of this paradox: If we could travel back in time and change the past, what would happen to the future?\n\nA 2020 study offered a potential answer: Nothing.\n\n\"Events readjust around anything that could cause a paradox, so the paradox does not happen,\" Germain Tobar, the study's author previously told IFLScience.\n\nTobar's work, published in the peer-reviewed journal Classical and Quantum Gravity in September 2020, suggests that according to the rules of theoretical physics, anything you tried to change in the past would be corrected by subsequent events.\n\nPut simply: It's theoretically possible to go back in time, but you couldn't change history.\n\nPeople in Beijing pay tribute to China's coronavirus victims during a national moment of silence on April 4, 2020. Thomas Peter/Reuters\n\nThe grandfather paradox\n\nPhysicists have considered time travel to be theoretically possible since Albert Einstein came up with his theory of relativity. Einstein's calculations suggest it's possible for an object in our universe to travel through space and time in a circular direction, eventually ending up at a point on its journey where it's been before \u2013 a path called a closed time-like curve.\n\nStill, physicists continue to struggle with scenarios like the coronavirus example above, in which time-travelers alter events that already happened. The most famous example is known as the grandfather paradox: Say a time-traveler goes back to the past and kills a younger version of his or her grandfather. The grandfather then wouldn't have any children, erasing the time-traveler's parents and, of course, the time-traveler, too. But then who would kill Grandpa?\n\nA take on this paradox appears in the movie \"Back to the Future,\" when Marty McFly almost stops his parents from meeting in the past \u2013 potentially causing himself to disappear.\n\nA dog dressed as Marty McFly from \"Back to the Future\" attends the annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade in New York City, October 24, 2015. Timothy A. Clary/Getty Images\n\nTo address the paradox, Tobar and his supervisor, Dr. Fabio Costa, used the \"billiard-ball model,\" which imagines cause and effect as a series of colliding billiard balls, and a circular pool table as a closed time-like curve.\n\nImagine a bunch of billiard balls laid out across that circular table. If you push one ball from position X, it bangs around the table, hitting others in a particular pattern.\n\nThe researchers calculated that even if you mess with the ball's pattern at some point in its journey, future interactions with other balls can correct its path, leading it to come back to the same position and speed that it would have had you not interfered.\n\n\"Regardless of the choice, the ball will fall into the same place,\" Dr Yasunori Nomura, a theoretical physicist at UC Berkeley, previously told Insider.\n\nFrom left to right: Dr. Fabio Costa with Germain Tobar. Tobar's calculations, supervised by Costa, claim that time-travel without paradoxes is possible. University of Queensland\n\nTobar's model, in other words, says you could travel back in time, but you couldn't change how events unfolded significantly enough to alter the future, Nomura said. Applied to the grandfather paradox, then, this would mean that something would always get in the way of your attempt to kill your grandfather. Or at least by the time he did die, your grandmother would already be pregnant with your mother.\n\nBack to the coronavirus example. Let's say you were to travel back to 2019 and intervene in patient zero's life. According to Tobar's line of thinking, the pandemic would still happen somehow.\n\n\"You might try and stop patient zero from becoming infected, but in doing so you would catch the virus and become patient zero, or someone else would,\" Tobar said, according to Australia's University of Queensland, where Tobar graduated from.\n\nNomura said that although the model is too simple to represent the full range of cause and effect in our universe, it's a good starting point for future physicists.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A general view of oil tanks in the Transneft-Kozmino Port near the far eastern town of Nakhodka, Russia. Yuri Maltsev | Reuters\n\nRussia announced on Tuesday it would ban oil sales to countries that abide by a price cap imposed this month by the West, giving its long-awaited response to the most dramatic step taken so far to limit Moscow's ability to raise funds for its war in Ukraine. Under the price cap, which took effect on Dec. 5, oil traders must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance. The cap has been set close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions.\n\nwatch now\n\nRussia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. A decree from President Vladimir Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to \"actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them\". The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from Feb. 1-July 1, 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. The West's price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Russian state coffers and Moscow's military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. According to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Russia's budget deficit could be wider than the planned 2% of GDP in 2023 as the oil price cap squeezes Russia's export income - an extra fiscal hurdle for Moscow as it spends heavily on its military campaign in Ukraine. Some analysts have said that the cap will have little immediate impact on the oil revenues that Moscow is earning, as the price for Russian oil has already fallen close to it. But it could limit Moscow's ability to profit from future price shocks.\n\nGhost town", "label": "human"}

Diggs ranked eighth among all pass catchers in targets per route run in Weeks 1-14.\n\nThis is one of those classic, \u201cYep it happened, but I don\u2019t think it means anything\u201d types of trends. Millions of fantasy players, including yours truly, can be a little miffed about the timing. But if Diggs had a couple of \u201cslow\u201d statistical games back to back in mid-October no one would think it was a big deal.\n\nSo we don\u2019t really think this is a big deal, either.\n\nThe only part of this little slump for Diggs that is interesting is deciphering whether it's a product of opponent game planning. I\u2019d wager that no receiver has gotten more extra attention from defensive coordinators \u2014 double teams, cloud coverage, brackets, etc. \u2014 than Diggs this year. That is both a product of how incredible Diggs is as a player and, as I\u2019ve talked about in this column before, the lack of respect for the other players around him.\n\nStefon Diggs' fantasy output has declined at the worst time. (Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images)\n\nThat might be changing a bit. Tight end Dawson Knox has been a force of late. He leads the team in receiving over the last three weeks with 177 yards and has scored three times. This is the type of production the Bills expected to get out of Knox all year.\n\nThe running game has been awesome, too. Buffalo led all teams in Weeks 15 and 16 with 404 rushing yards and 6.7 per carry. Some of that is certainly opponent driven, as Buffalo is the lone team to average more than three yards before contact (3.92) per rush in that span. But if the performance of the run game can be sticky, it would go a long way to helping this team out.\n\nWeek 17\u2019s matchup with the Bengals has a playoff feel to it. Seeding in the AFC will matter a lot and this matchup will go a long way to moving those posts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Benglas defense is well-coached and has been quite efficient at slowing down big-time outside receivers. Cincinnati allows the third-best completion rate (58.5%) on throws targeting receivers lined up wide.\n\nWe\u2019ll see just how much the Bengals respect the other aspects of the Bills offense. My bet is the Bengals dedicate extra attention to Diggs and man up on the other Bills receivers, daring someone else to beat them.\n\nIf the Bills' mini-rushing revival is real, it might be a good opportunity to try and establish something against a Bengals team that\u2019s better at stopping the pass, on the whole, this year. That could help bring a safety down into the box \u2014 especially if Josh Allen gets involved as a rusher \u2014 and free up some one-on-one chances for Diggs down the field.\n\nNo QB gets rid of the ball faster than Tom Brady this year at 2.3 seconds\n\nTom Brady checked in with a 1.88-second time to throw on Sunday against the Cardinals. Which is absurd. And not in a good way.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Brady doesn\u2019t want to get hit at this point of the season and doesn\u2019t trust his five-man pass protection as far as he can throw them.\n\nThat ultra quick-release has really taken a toll on the downfield-passing game. It\u2019s just not reasonable to ask any vertical receiver to get open in two seconds or less. As a result, the Bucs have become too screen and check-down-centric. Big shots to Mike Evans are never on time, because of course they\u2019re not. Brady\u2019s sped-up clock has become an issue.\n\nThere are many problems with Tampa Bay\u2019s offense right now, a multitude of which are a result of the coaching staff\u2019s decisions. However, all the problems compounded with the style of offense Brady is playing in the pocket have created an untenable situation in the aerial attack.\n\nThe only time Tampa looks good is when they go to their two-minute offense, when they spread things out and Brady can point and shoot with tempo and precision. Otherwise, his style and the team's offensive design have become oil and water at this point.\n\nSam Darnold leads the NFL in adjusted yards per attempt since he took over as a starter\n\nHe also ranks second in EPA per dropback and good old-fashioned yards per completion. Much has been made of the Panthers' overwhelming rushing attack since Steve Wilks took over as head coach. However, Darnold\u2019s play has been a big factor in the team\u2019s solid run down the stretch.\n\nDarnold has taken his shots when available but the biggest difference in his play this season has been the lack of mistakes. Darnold is a talented player who has his strengths. He can just send the entire offense into a hole when the situation erodes. He can\u2019t operate in chaos.\n\nThe current Panthers sneakily offer him a nice little incubator. The rushing attack keeps them ahead of the sticks, DJ Moore is playing extremely well and the offensive line is better than its been in years.\n\nIf Darnold can continue to play mistake-free football, the Panthers can absolutely beat the Bucs this weekend and put themselves in a position to win the NFC South. It\u2019s a truly wild result based on where this team was in the season's first five weeks.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater averages 9.0 YPA in games he threw more than five passes\n\nUnfortunately, we won\u2019t get Tua Tagovailoa under center this weekend and there\u2019s a chance we don\u2019t see him for quite some time after yet another concussion. In the meantime, the Dolphins will turn to Teddy Bridgewater as the starter.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Bridgewater in this offense already and he\u2019s had success in games where he\u2019s played extended snaps. This offense is so well set up that almost any competent quarterback can have success. Bridgewater is quite high up on the backup quarterback rankings, so he\u2019s more than capable of captaining this offense.\n\nTua has been fantastic this year and his accuracy has added layers of value to an already excellent ecosystem. However, Bridgewater\u2019s strengths also overlap well with the spacing and speed of this unit. I wouldn\u2019t change projections too much based on him starting this game.\n\nMike White is averaging 43 pass attempts per game\n\nIf you extrapolate the non-Zach Wilson games the Jets would have well over 700 pass attempts this year. It\u2019s remarkable how different of a unit they become as soon as any backup quarterback gets on the field.\n\nSome of these players have been productive even with Wilson under center. The ceiling of the unit is just dramatically different however, simply from a volume standpoint, when White is on the field.\n\nThe Jets' passing offense becomes a fantasy boon when Mike White is on the field. (Photo by Timothy T Ludwig/Getty Images)\n\nGuys like Garrett Wilson and Zonovan Knight instantly pop in projections when this offense reaches competency. Knight in particular couldn\u2019t get rolling early against Jacksonville but with game script in his favor against a sinking Seahawks team, he could rip some big runs against a vulnerable defense.\n\nA.J. Dillon has five rushing TDs and converted 50% of his third-down runs in December\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a thread of the \u201cbig back, late-season\u201d narrative to tug on here. However, the bigger variable to Dillon\u2019s success might be Aaron Jones nursing an injury and the Green Bay line playing a bit better.\n\nNo matter what, Dillon is clearly running better now than he has at any point earlier in the season. He\u2019s been one of the more efficient runners with his chances to close 2022.\n\nThe defensive matchup against Minnesota clearly favors the wideouts in Green Bay, but Dillon can still get in on the party. If Allen Lazard and the younger wideouts can find open room and move the offense down the field, Dillon can act as the closer down in the scoring area.\n\nI\u2019m expecting another end-zone trip for the big back this week.\n\nTyler Allgeier has had a 55.6% rushing success rate since Week 12.\n\nThe rookie has played on more rushing snaps than Cordarrelle Patterson and only three fewer passing snaps in that time span.\n\nAny success rate north of 50% for a running back is quite good. Allgeier is playing well to end his first season.\n\nGoing into what should be a good matchup in a close game against the Cardinals, Allgeier looks like a sneaky good fantasy play this week. There are many established backs I\u2019d consider ranking behind the Falcons lead back.\n\nA more interesting conversation might be his 2023 outlook. We often see these Day 3 or undrafted surprise backs eventually get usurped by another player \u2014 think Michael Carter and Breece Hall, James Robinson and Travis Etienne, etc. Allgeier has a chance to finish strong the last two weeks and potentially persuade the Falcons to allocate their resources elsewhere this offseason.\n\nThink what you want about the Falcons offense \u2014 their run game concepts are awesome. We\u2019ll be extremely interested in whoever leads that backfield going forward.\n\nT.J. Hockenson ranks second on the Vikings with a 24% target per route run rate in the last three weeks\n\nThe Vikings traded for T.J. Hockenson in the middle of the year because it was clear that, despite Justin Jefferson\u2019s elite play, they needed a matchup advantage at the second pass-catching spot.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been smooth sailing for the talented tight end this year \u2014 he\u2019s left some plays on the field with the Vikings \u2014 but in recent weeks he\u2019s started to become the guy they wanted.\n\nAs defenses becomes more and more dedicated, albeit powerless, to stop Jefferson, Hockenson\u2019s play will only become that much more important.\n\nMiles Sanders\u2019 -0.23 EPA per rush the last two weeks is tied with David Montgomery for the worst among backs with 30 carries\n\nThe fumbles have something to do with that but it\u2019s just been a rough couple of weeks for Sanders. If the Eagles are without Jalen Hurts again on Sunday his play is all the more important.\n\nThe Eagles should be able to dispense of the Saints without much issue, even as they deal with secondary issues. If Philly can hold a lead, Sanders may be able to offer a big rebound performance in a positive game script against the league\u2019s 20th-ranked defense in EPA per rush allowed.\n\nThe Texans allow the second-most rushing yards per game since Week 13, and the 12th-fewest passing yards per game\n\nPlaying a game against the Malik Willis-led Titans will boost those pass-defense numbers but it\u2019s a reminder Houston is not laying down on defense.\n\nYou can tell who watches the games based on how they\u2019ve reacted to the recent run of good play by Houston. Those defenders are absolutely flying around and hitting opposing players. They laid the wood on the Cowboys and Chiefs in back-to-back weeks and then launched the team to an upset over Tennessee.\n\nJacksonville\u2019s main focus will be defeating the Titans to win the division next week. But any sort of stumbling against the Texans, a team they\u2019ve already lost to in 2022, will result in another upset. Houston does not have one eye on the golf course to end the season.\n\nJames Conner has played 92.2% of the snaps over the last six games\n\nI don\u2019t have many other notes to add here. It\u2019s just wild to see this usage for James Conner given his injury history. The Cardinals are loading this guy up with touches to end a meaningless season. Conner is an excellent back with a three-down skill-set but you still just never see backs play at this high of a rate.\n\nAs long as Conner can hold up under this workload, he makes for a matchup-proof high-level fantasy play. Not that you were worried about a Week 17 matchup with the Falcons' run defense, anyway.\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Forecast", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The sports world was sent reeling on Monday, January 3, 2023, when news broke that Damar Hamlin, one of the most beloved and respected players in the NFL, had unexpectedly collapsed during practice. \n\nHamlin had been a star cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks since 2019, when the team made him a first-round draft pick. Before that, he had enjoyed a decorated college career at Penn State, where he was twice named an All-American. \n\nUpon arriving in Seattle, Hamlin quickly established himself as one of the best defenders in the league. His acrobatic interceptions were legendary, and his coverage skills helped the Seahawks win two Super Bowls. \n\nIt was a shock, then, when news emerged that Hamlin had collapsed at practice. The Seahawks initially provided few details, saying only that he had been taken to the hospital for evaluation. \n\nLater, it emerged that the corner had suffered a severe brain aneurysm. Doctors were able to stabilize him, but he was immediately placed in a medically induced coma. \n\nESPN, the preeminent sports media outlet, quickly went into overdrive to cover the story. The network was already in the midst of its usual Monday Night Football broadcast when news of Hamlin's collapse broke. \n\nThe network immediately shifted gears, and devoted the next hour of its broadcast to news of the corner's medical emergency. Anchors and analysts discussed Hamlin's career, his on-field heroics and his personal life. \n\nAdditionally, ESPN brought in experts to explain the medical crisis and examine the risks of returning to the gridiron after a brain aneurysm. It was an all-hands-on-deck effort that kept viewers glued to their screens for the duration of the broadcast. \n\nThe effort was a success, and ESPN was praised for its response to the crisis. The network was credited for providing a thorough and informative look at the incident, as well as for taking time to remember Hamlin's legacy as a player. \n\nAt the same time, the sports world was left wondering about the future of Damar Hamlin. For the time being, he remained in a coma with doctors unable to predict the long-term prognosis. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, however, there were signs of hope. Hamlin slowly recovered, eventually leaving the hospital and even returning to practice with the Seahawks. It was a miraculous recovery that had fans, players and analysts alike celebrating. \n\nHamlin's return to the field was short-lived, however. He suffered another collapse during a game against the Los Angeles Rams and was forced to sit out the remainder of the season. \n\nESPN was there to cover the latest episode in the Hamlin saga, again devoting its broadcast to news of the star corner. The network used its platform to discuss the medical risks of returning to the field too soon, as well as the importance of seeking help in cases of mental health issues. \n\nDespite his struggles, Damar Hamlin remains one of the most beloved players in the NFL. His story is a lesson for all athletes, and for all of us, about the importance of being mindful of our physical and mental health. \n\nESPN's coverage of the story has done much to raise awareness about the issue, and to make sure that a player like Damar Hamlin never feels the need to suffer in silence.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "New York CNN Business \u2014\n\nA 24-hour strike at The New York Times, a historic demonstration in which more than 1,100 employees are expected to participate, began Thursday at midnight, after management and the union representing staffers failed to reach an agreement for a new contract after more than a year and a half of negotiating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that they\u2019re taking such drastic action, given the clear commitment we\u2019ve shown to negotiate our way to a contract that provides Times journalists with substantial pay increases, market-leading benefits, and flexible working conditions,\u201d Meredith Kopit Levien, president and chief executive of The Times, said in an email to the company Wednesday night.\n\nThe NewsGuild of New York, which represents journalists and other staffers at The Times, said in a statement that the walkout was \u201cdue to the company\u2019s failure to bargain in good faith, reach a fair contract agreement with the workers, and meet their demands.\u201d\n\nThe act of protest, which has not been staged by employees at the newspaper of record in decades, will leave many of its major desks depleted of their staff, creating a challenge for the news organization that millions of readers rely on.\n\nStacy Cowley holds a sign outside the New York Times building in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 8, 2022. Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nAn executive at The Times, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, acknowledged to CNN on Wednesday that the work stoppage would certainly create difficulties. But, the executive said, management has readied for the moment and could rely on the newspaper\u2019s other resources, such as its international staff which largely are not part of the union, to fill the voids.\n\nJoe Kahn, executive editor of The Times, said in a note to staff, \u201cWe will produce a robust report on Thursday. But it will be harder than usual.\u201d\n\nKopit Levien added in her email to the company that The Times has \u201cplans in place to ensure that we meet our obligation to our readers and the general public by reporting the news as fully as possible through any disruption caused by a strike.\u201d\n\nBut some staffers at The Times went as far on Wednesday as to urge readers not to consume the outlet\u2019s content during the walkout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking readers to not engage in any [New York Times] platforms tomorrow and stand with us on the digital picket line!,\u201d Amanda Hess, a critic-at-large for the newspaper, wrote on Twitter. \u201cRead local news. Listen to public radio. Make something from a cookbook. Break your Wordle streak.\u201d\n\nAt a rally held Thursday afternoon outside The Times\u2019 offices in Times Square, dozens of union members held picket signs, handed out pamphlets, and demanded better wages.\n\nNew York Times reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones speaks outside the Times' office, Thursday, Dec. 8, 2022, in New York. Hundreds of New York Times journalists and other staff protested outside the Times' office after walking off the job for 24 hours, frustrated by contract negotiations that have dragged on for months in the newspaper's biggest labor dispute in more than 40 years. Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\n\u201cWe make the paper, we make the profits!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nThe strike comes as the Gray Lady and the NewsGuild of New York remain at odds over a number of issues, particularly wages, amid a backdrop of layoffs and cuts across the media industry.\n\nIn recent weeks, CNN laid off hundreds of staffers, newspaper chain Gannett cut 200 employees, NPR said it will need to find $10 million in savings, and other news organizations have explored the need to trim budgets and freeze hiring.\n\nThe Times has maintained that it offered the guild \u201csignificant increases,\u201d but the union countered that the newspaper\u2019s management has \u201cfrequently misrepresented its own proposals.\u201d\n\nThe Union Times, a newsletter published by the NewsGuild, described The Times\u2019 wage concessions on Wednesday as \u201cpaltry\u201d and said management has \u201cbarely budged\u201d on the issue.\n\nThe two parties have been bargaining since the last contract expired in March 2021. Last Friday, the NewsGuild informed The Times about its plans to stage a walkout, a move aimed at applying pressure to management to offer additional concessions in negotiations.\n\nThe union has asked The Times to meet in the middle on wage increases, but the newspaper believes the union started from an extreme position, making doing so a non-starter.\n\nBoth sides have worked throughout the week to avert the 24-hour strike. But it was to no avail.\n\nManagement at The Times had grown frustrated with how the NewsGuild has sought to conduct negotiations and partly blamed the lack of progress on it.\n\n\u201cThey refuse to meet in person,\u201d the executive told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important point. I can\u2019t emphasize it enough. We have negotiations on Zoom. There are eight or so people from management, as many as 18 people on the bargaining committee from the NewsGuild, and as many as 200 union members watching as \u2018observers.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNegotiations are essentially public,\u201d the executive continued. \u201cAnd that changes the whole dynamic of negotiations. It becomes very performative and very theatrical. It\u2019s really hard to get things done. It\u2019s like a show. And we need productive negotiations to get to a deal.\u201d\n\nSusan DeCarava, president of the NewsGuild of New York, said in response, \u201cUnion democracy is crucial to union power. That is why we don\u2019t do closed-door negotiations, which management continues to demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll members who will be affected by the decision made at the bargaining table should be privy to those discussions,\u201d the representative added. \u201cWhen Times management comes to the bargaining table with their insulting and disrespectful offers, they have to explain it to a room full of their own employees\u2014and they hate it.

{"text": "Thousands of people descended on New York City this week to protest a \"Drag Story Hour\" event at the local library. The gathering was a show of solidarity with those in the drag community who have faced a troubling surge of targeted attacks in 2021.\n\nThe \"Drag Story Hour\" had been planned for several weeks, with the intention of providing a fun and entertaining way to introduce children to drag culture. The event faced a variety of opposition, including from some religious and conservative groups, who argued that it was inappropriate for children.\n\nDespite the opposition, the event was planned to go ahead as scheduled. However, on the day of the event, hundreds of protesters arrived at the library. Many carried signs that read \"drag is not a threat,\" and chanted slogans like, \"drag is not a crime,\" and \"love not hate.\"\n\nThe protesters were also joined by dozens of drag queens and kings, who showed up to stand in solidarity with their fellow members of the drag community. Several of the queens and kings shared stories of how they had been victims of hate crimes in recent months, as well as the emotional toll that such attacks can take.\n\nAt one point during the demonstration, a number of protesters locked arms and formed a human chain, preventing library patrons from entering the building. Some of the protesters also blocked the library entrance with a sign that read, \"Drag is not a crime.\"\n\nThe demonstration was a striking example of how members of the drag community have faced increasing levels of targeted attacks in 2021. In New York City alone, there have been several attacks on drag queens in recent months, including a man who was recently arrested after he punched a drag queen in the face.\n\nThese attacks have been particularly disturbing, given the history of violence faced by the drag community in the past. This week's demonstration was intended to make a statement: that members of the drag community will not stand for such attacks.\n\nThe demonstration lasted for several hours, with protesters marching around the library and chanting their slogans. In the end, no arrests were made and the event proceeded as planned.\n\nThe protest was a powerful show of strength for the drag community, as members stood together to fight for their rights and safety. It is a reminder that members of the drag community will not be intimidated by violence or prejudice, and will continue to fight for acceptance and recognition.\n\nThe protest was a stark contrast to the violence and attacks that have been faced by the drag community in 2021.

He was endorsed by President Donald Trump and even went so far as to claim that the former president is actively backing his efforts.\n\nAt a news conference in Washington D.C., McCarthy, who is the current House Minority Leader, declared that \u201cI'm not going to abandon my bid. I have the support of the President, and I'm going to keep pushing forward to unite the Republican conference and make sure that we win back the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nThe California representative's announcement came amidst reports that some Republicans were attempting to put together an alternative coalition to challenge McCarthy's bid. According to sources within the party, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio was reportedly gathering support for an unexpected campaign for the top spot.\n\nJordan, who has served in the House since 2006 and is the founder of the conservative Freedom Caucus, has earned himself a reputation as a thorn in the side of establishment Republicans. He was outspoken in his criticism of the Republican leadership during the previous administration and led the charge against former Speaker Paul Ryan on a number of issues.\n\nThe news of a potential challenge to McCarthy\u2019s leadership has created a rift within the party, with some House Republicans expressing concern that a floor fight could further divide the conference and hurt their chances at recapturing the House majority.\n\nMcCarthy attempted to quell these fears by presenting himself as the only possible unifying figure. He repeatedly asserted his relationship with Trump during his remarks, claiming that the former president is fully behind him. \n\n\"I spoke with President Trump last night. He said to me very clearly that he does not want a contested race. He wants this to be over and done with, and he supports my candidacy.\"\n\nThe 45th president had previously endorsed McCarthy\u2019s bid for Speaker, and many had assumed that the two men had a good relationship. This is the first time, however, that McCarthy has suggested that Trump is actively campaigning for him in the House.\n\nIn spite of the news, Jordan and the Freedom Caucus appear to remain committed to blocking McCarthy\u2019s bid. They have repeatedly expressed their displeasure with the California representative and have accused him of not being sufficiently conservative.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus has made it clear that they will not accept any candidates unless they demonstrate a willingness to adhere to a number of ideological litmus tests. They have criticized McCarthy for his role in crafting the 2017 tax bill and his embrace of the recently enacted farm bill.\n\nThe turmoil over the race for Speaker has some wondering if the Republican Party will be able to put its differences aside and regain a majority in the House. In the short term, however, it appears that McCarthy\u2019s candidacy has the full support of President Trump, which could make him the overwhelming favorite. \n\nOnly time will tell how the Republican Party will move forward in the wake of the Speaker race. With President Trump seemingly behind McCarthy\u2019s candidacy, however, it is likely that he will be the eventual winner.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "BOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s been weeks since four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death in their beds, and now some of the mystery surrounding the case may soon fall away.\n\nBryan Kohberger, who was attending a nearby university around the time of the killings, was returned to Idaho on Wednesday to face charges of first-degree murder after his arrest last week. Court documents that could shed light on many unanswered questions are expected to be unsealed soon, even as a magistrate judge issued a sweeping gag order prohibiting anyone from discussing the case with media.\n\nKohberger was arrested Dec. 30 in connection with the deaths of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin. Here's a look at what is known so far about the killings, the suspect and the latest developments.\n\nWHO IS THE SUSPECT?\n\nKohberger was arrested at his parents home in Chestnuthill Township, Pennsylvania, on an Idaho warrant. He agreed on Tuesday to be extradited to Idaho, and his Pennsylvania defense attorney Jason LaBar said Kohberger was eager to be exonerated.\n\nBefore the arrest, Kohberger was working toward a doctorate in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Washington State University, located 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) west of the University of Idaho in Moscow. Kohberger was also a teaching assistant at WSU, and lived in a university apartment.\n\nIn a memo to students, WSU Chancellor Elizabeth Chilton wrote this week that Kohberger's arrest was shocking and urged students and staffers to cooperate with the investigative process as much as possible. Chilton called Kohberger \u201ca former WSU Ph.D student,\u201d and said he was no longer enrolled at the school.\n\nKohberger graduated from Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania with an associate degree in psychology in 2018. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2020 and completed graduate studies in June 2022 at DeSales University in Pennsylvania.\n\nWHO WERE THE VICTIMS?\n\nStory continues\n\nAll four were friends and members of the University of Idaho\u2019s Greek system. Kernodle, 20, was a junior studying marketing. She was from Post Falls, Idaho, and joined the Pi Beta Phi sorority. She lived at the rental home with the other two women who were stabbed, and she was dating Chapin, who was visiting the night of the killings.\n\nChapin, 20, was from Conway, Washington, and was a triplet. His brother and sister also attend UI, and both Chapin and his brother were members of the Sigma Chi fraternity.\n\nGoncalves and Mogen were both 21 and friends who grew up together in northern Idaho. Mogen worked with Kernodle at a Greek restaurant in Moscow. She was also a member of Pi Beta Phi.\n\nGoncalves was a senior majoring in general studies, a member of the Alpha Phi sorority.\n\nPolice haven\u2019t said whether they think Kohberger knew the victims. Police and the county prosecutor\u2019s office have released confusing \u2014 and at times contradictory \u2014 statements about whether the victims were targeted.\n\nWHEN DID KOHBERGER BECOME A SUSPECT?\n\nThe Moscow Police Department has released few details about the investigation, but in December investigators asked the public for help finding a white sedan seen near the scene of the crime \u2014 specifically, a 2011-2013 Hyundai Elantra. Tips poured in and soon investigators announced they were working through a pool of around 20,000 potential vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Kohberger apparently stayed in Washington through the end of the semester at WSU. Then he began driving across country to Pennsylvania, accompanied by his father, in a white Elantra.\n\nKohberger was pulled over twice on Dec. 15 while traveling through Indiana, first by a Hancock County Sheriff's deputy and a few minutes later by an Indiana State Police trooper. During one of the stops he mentioned he was from WSU, and both stops ended with officers giving him a verbal warning for following too closely and sending him on his way.\n\nThe Indiana State Police later said there was no information available to the trooper that would have identified Kohberger as a suspect in the killings.\n\nDNA evidence played a key role in identifying Kohberger as a suspect, and officials were able to match his DNA to genetic material recovered during the investigation, a law enforcement official said last week. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn addition to the DNA evidence, authorities also learned Kohberger had a white Elantra, the official who spoke anonymously told The Associated Press.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT AND MORNING OF THE ATTACK?\n\nGoncalves and Mogen went to a bar, stopped at a food truck and then caught a ride home around 2 a.m. on Nov. 13, according to a police timeline of the evening.\n\nChapin and Kernodle were at the Sigma Chi fraternity house a short walk away and returned to Kernodle\u2019s house around 1:45 a.m., police said.\n\nTwo other roommates who live in the home were also out that evening, but returned home by 1 a.m., police said. They didn\u2019t wake up until later that morning.\n\nAfter they woke up, they called friends to come to the house because they believed one of the victims found on the second floor had passed out and wasn\u2019t waking up. At 11:58 a.m., someone inside the home called 911. Multiple people talked with the dispatcher before police arrived.\n\nPolice found two of the victims on the second floor of the three-story home, and two on the third floor. A dog was also at the home, unharmed.\n\nAutopsies showed the four were all likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. There was no sign of sexual assault.\n\nWHAT WAS THE RESPONSE FROM THE COMMUNITY?\n\nThe killings left the close-knit community of Moscow frightened, and nearly half of University of Idaho students temporarily switched to remote learning and left the scenic campus for their hometowns.\n\nMeanwhile, the university increased security staff on campus, boosted mental health support for students, reminded students about available self-defense classes and helped distribute personal safety alarm devices.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nNow that Kohberger is in Idaho, he will appear in Latah County Magistrate Court to hear the charges against him \u2014 four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary. Idaho court officials have not said exactly when that first appearance will be scheduled, but it could occur Thursday. Kohberger won't have an opportunity to enter a plea until a later date.\n\nDocuments filed in the criminal case have been sealed so far as required under Idaho's public record law. Those documents are expected to be unsealed once Kohberger arrives in court if not sooner, potentially providing a basic outline of Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson's case.\n\nNeither Thompson, the investigators nor Kohberger's defense attorney will be able to talk about the case, however. That's because Latah County Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall on Tuesday issued a gag order.\n\nThe order prohibits any of the parties in the case from talking about anything \u201creasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial.\u201d That includes details about any evidence, the existence of any confessions or other statements given by the defendant, or the merits of the case.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Balsamo contributed from Washington.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nThe onset of the coronavirus pandemic had a devastating financial effect on the already-marginalized families in the United States. With the possibility of an even worse economic crisis on the horizon, a handful of states have begun offering guaranteed-income programs that provide cash payments to eligible families.\n\nOne couple that was adversely affected by the pandemic and is now on one of these programs is Richard and Erica Dyer, who both have disabilities. The two were able to get by on Richard\u2019s Social Security disability payments, but when the pandemic hit, the added stress caused his depression to flare up and led to him losing his job.\n\n\u201cI was really struggling with the added financial burden,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt was really tough to keep up with the bills, and we were getting further and further behind.\u201d\n\nThe Dyers applied for and were accepted into California\u2019s fledgling guaranteed-income program, which provides a monthly cash payment of up to $500 per household.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a bit of breathing room and allowed us to focus on getting our finances back in order.\u201d\n\nThe couple also says the extra money has allowed them to focus on their mental and physical health, something that can be harder to do when money is tight.\n\n\u201cBefore the program, we had to decide between going to the doctor and paying the rent,\u201d Erica said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have to make those tough decisions. We can afford to take care of ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Dyers are not the only ones who have benefited from the program. According to data from California\u2019s Employment Development Department, more than 40,000 people in the state have received payments through the program.\n\nThe program has also been praised by economic experts and politicians, who believe it could be the first step toward a broader, national guaranteed-income system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crucial step in recognizing the financial instability of so many people in this country,\u201d said former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who championed the idea of a guaranteed income. \u201cWe need to put people first and not let them get left behind.\u201d\n\nThere is still much to be done to ensure that all Americans have access to the financial security they need, but the Dyers are proof that guaranteed-income programs can make a difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for this program and what it\u2019s done for us,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s here to stay.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nIn den letzten Wochen und Monaten hat der Finanzminister an konkreten Vorschl\u00e4gen f\u00fcr ein verbessertes Regelwerk f\u00fcr die sogenannten ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) gearbeitet. Nun ist es so weit, dass er seine Entw\u00fcrfe vorstellt, die als Ergebnis einer eingehenden Pr\u00fcfung durch seine Experten erarbeitet wurden.\n\nAls erster Schritt beinhalten die Vorschl\u00e4ge \u00c4nderungen beim bisherigen Strukturmodell der ESOPs. Derzeit gibt es drei Modelle \u2013 den direkten Aktienanteil, die Mehrheitsbeteiligung und den sogenannten Trust. Der Finanzminister will nun all diese Modelle in ein einziges Modell integrieren, das als \u201eUnified ESOPs\u201c bezeichnet wird. Durch die Einf\u00fchrung dieses einheitlichen Modells soll die Verwaltung und Verteilung von Aktienanteilen an Mitarbeiter und Angestellte deutlich vereinfacht werden.\n\nDar\u00fcber hinaus sieht der Finanzminister vor, mehr Transparenz bei den ESOPs zu schaffen. Dazu wird es eine \u00f6ffentliche Datenbank geben, in der alle Informationen \u00fcber jeden einzelnen Aktienbesitzer hinterlegt sind. Der Finanzminister sieht in dieser Datenbank auch ein gro\u00dfes Potenzial, um auf interessante Weise den Handel mit den Aktien von Unternehmen zu f\u00f6rdern.\n\nAuch der Steueraspekt spielt bei den ESOPs eine wichtige Rolle. Um diesen Aspekt zu verbessern, plant der Finanzminister, eine Verringerung der steuerlichen Belastung zu erm\u00f6glichen. Insbesondere soll die Besteuerung der Aktiengewinne und Dividenden im Vergleich zu anderen L\u00e4ndern angepasst werden. Zudem sollen Steuerprivilegien bei der Anlage von ESOPs an Angestellte geschaffen werden, um kleineren Unternehmen zu helfen.\n\nEin weiterer Schl\u00fcsselaspekt ist die Regulierung. Der Finanzminister will ein robustes Regulierungsrahmenwerk schaffen, um daf\u00fcr zu sorgen, dass ESOPs nicht von Betr\u00fcgern missbraucht werden. Au\u00dferdem soll der Schutz der Rechte der Mitarbeiter und Angestellten gest\u00e4rkt werden, die ESOPs halten.\n\nAls zus\u00e4tzliche Ma\u00dfnahme will der Finanzminister auch den Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen f\u00fcr ESOP-Besitzer erleichtern, indem er die Kosten f\u00fcr den Kauf und die Verwaltung der Aktien senken wird.\n\nDer Finanzminister hofft, dass die oben genannten Vorschl\u00e4ge in einigen Monaten in Kraft treten k\u00f6nnen, um den Mitarbeitern und Angestellten gr\u00f6\u00dferen Schutz und mehr Kontrolle \u00fcber ihre ESOPs zu geben.

{"text": "Nations agreed to create a historic $30 billion fund aimed at helping developing countries cope with unavoidable damage from climate change, in what could be a major breakthrough at the COP26 United Nations Climate Summit in Glasgow.\n\nThe agreement, announced on Friday after two weeks of intense negotiations, marks the first time a global fund has been created to address the impacts of climate change on the world\u2019s poorest countries, a major victory for activists and vulnerable countries who have been pressing for a legally binding agreement on climate change for years.\n\nThe 'loss and damage' fund is intended to support countries that suffer from the effects of climate change, such as floods, droughts, extreme weather and sea-level rise, even if they are unable to make efforts to reduce emissions or prepare for the effects.\n\nIt was one of the most contentious issues during the summit, with wealthy countries expressing reservations about what they argued was an undue burden on the most prosperous countries to pay for damages suffered in poorer nations.\n\nHowever, after the five-day summit, which took place in Glasgow\u2019s SEC Centre, leaders from around the world emerged with a consensus.\n\nThe agreement means wealthier countries will provide $20 billion per year over the next five years to the fund, while poorer nations will contribute a total of $10 billion.\n\nThe fund will be managed by the United Nations, which will also work with local governments in developing countries to identify projects and activities that will benefit communities affected by climate change.\n\nThe money will primarily be used for financing disaster risk reduction and management, strengthening community-level resilience, and promoting economic diversification and the adoption of low-carbon practices.\n\nThe agreement was lauded by environmentalists, with former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calling it a \"historic day for the world\" and a \"turning point in the fight against climate change.\"\n\n\"This agreement is a major milestone on the long road to tackling the climate crisis,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHe said the agreement was a testament to the commitment of leaders from both developed and developing countries to work together to tackle the climate crisis.\n\n\"This fund marks the beginning of a major shift in the way the world confronts the climate crisis, recognizing that the most vulnerable must be given a more central role in the process,\" he said.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also congratulated the countries involved in the agreement, praising their efforts to come together and secure a meaningful and equitable response to the climate crisis.\n\n\"This is a huge and necessary step towards helping countries deal with the unavoidable losses and damage caused by climate change,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe creation of the fund could have far-reaching effects on the global effort to address the climate crisis.\n\nFor one, the fund could help spur more countries to take action to reduce emissions and implement adaptation measures, as the consequences of climate change become more acute for the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nIt could also serve as a model for the implementation of an agreement on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid next year.\n\n\"The agreement to establish a loss and damage fund is a critical step towards securing a comprehensive global response to the climate crisis,\" said World Resources Institute President Andrew Steer.\n\n\"It's a testament to the growing recognition of the need to support countries that are facing the consequences of climate change, and the potential of developed countries to bear the cost of this support.\"\n\nThe agreement is a major success for the coalition of vulnerable countries, often referred to as the Climate Vulnerable Forum, which has been campaigning for a loss and damage fund since the Paris Agreement in 2015.\n\nThe Climate Vulnerable Forum chair, Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire of Canada, said the agreement was an important victory for developing countries and vulnerable populations.\n\n\"It's a strong recognition of the need to provide support for those who are already suffering, or who will suffer in the future, due to the direct impacts of climate change,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement is a major milestone in the fight against climate change and a hopeful sign that leaders around the world are taking the issue seriously and making a commitment to help the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This year marked a historic rebound for monarch butterfly populations. The species\u2019 numbers have skyrocketed thanks to enthusiastic conservation efforts, many by ordinary citizens. This is the first year since 2016 that the butterfly\u2019s population has been in the millions.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all joy this year. After visiting Chinquapin, North Carolina\u2014nicknamed \u201cButterfly Town, USA\u201d because of its high monarch population\u2014I can report that the comeback comes with mixed feelings.\n\nChinquapin isn\u2019t just any small town. It\u2019s a relatively small town, with a population of less than 500, but its nearly 2,000 acres of land are a haven for the iconic black-and-orange butterflies. The town is home to what\u2019s known as \u201cButterfly Alley,\u201d a stretch of blooming wildflowers that\u2019s become a popular destination for the monarchs.\n\nBefore leaving for Chinquapin, I was expecting to see a vibrant butterfly population. I was expecting to take my time to compose photos and film for a multimedia piece about the monarch comeback story. Instead, I experienced something that felt more like a funeral.\n\nThe town was still beautiful. The wildflowers were in full bloom and just as dazzling as I\u2019d imagined. But the monarchs I\u2019d been expecting to see in their thousands simply weren\u2019t there.\n\nDuring my stay in Chinquapin, I searched through the entire length of Butterfly Alley and its surrounding areas, trying to spot a single monarch butterfly. In total, I spotted only five. That\u2019s right\u2014five.\n\nI spent most of my time there focusing my camera lens on the barren patches of flower fields, hoping to capture something that could bring a little joy to what felt like a depressing story. Although I didn\u2019t get the photos I\u2019d hoped for, I was able to find hope in the few monarchs I saw.\n\nThe first was a majestic monarch that had managed to cling on to the only remaining wildflower in a nearby field. Its beautiful orange wings were a reminder that despite the odds, the monarchs had returned to Chinquapin\u2014even if it was in small numbers.\n\nThe other monarchs I spotted all seemed to symbolize that same hope. All of them were unique in their own way\u2014one was frisking, another was perching, and one was even fluttering in the light breeze.\n\nAs the few monarchs I did spot gracefully flapped away, I couldn\u2019t help but think about the hard-working volunteers and conservationists whose tireless efforts had helped bring the monarchs back.\n\nFor a moment, I was filled with joy, realizing that despite all the odds, the species was still alive. But then I was reminded that this tiny population was all that remained of what used to be a flourishing species.\n\nJust a few decades ago, the species\u2019 population in North America was estimated to be in the millions. This year, its numbers have only just recovered to one-tenth of its historic population.\n\nAt the end of my visit, I realized that although the comeback story of the monarch butterflies was an inspiring one, it was also a sad reminder of how quickly humans can destroy a species\u2014and of how much work still needs to be done to protect the species that still remain.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The 2020 presidential election was one of the most contentious and close races in the history of the United States. The battle between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden went down to the wire, with Biden narrowly eking out a victory in the Electoral College. But the 2022 election was even closer.\n\nAt the end of election night in 2022, the race between President Trump and Biden\u2019s running mate, Kamala Harris, was too close to call. Trump and Harris were neck-and-neck in the popular vote, with Biden taking an early lead but Harris closing the gap as the night went on. It was only after the last polls closed that Harris emerged victorious, carrying the Electoral College votes and winning the White House.\n\nThe election was a stunning victory for Harris, who made history as the first woman and first African American vice president. She defied the odds to defeat an incumbent president, making it one of the closest races in modern presidential history.\n\nThe hotly contested race was fought in battleground states across the country, with Biden and Harris campaigning tirelessly for the months leading up to the election. Voter turnout was at record highs, and the race was so close that experts struggled to call the results until the very end.\n\nAs the returns slowly trickled in, Biden and Harris slowly built up their leads in key swing states. As Harris took an early lead in Florida, it became clear she was likely to win the election. But Trump refused to concede, and asked for a recount of votes in multiple states. Biden and Harris remained confident, knowing that recounts would not change the outcome of the race.\n\nThe recount eventually confirmed Biden and Harris\u2019s victory, and the 2020 election was officially called in their favor. Harris made history as the first woman and first person of color to serve as Vice President of the United States.\n\nThe hotly contested election was a sign of how close the country was in terms of political ideology. While Biden and Harris ran on an agenda of progressivism and bold ideas, Trump ran on a platform of nostalgia for an era before the coronavirus pandemic. Biden and Harris\u2019s narrow victory was an indication of the country\u2019s shifting political landscape, and a victory for the liberal agenda.\n\nThe Biden-Harris victory in 2022 was a remarkable feat, and a sign of how close our country is in terms of politics. While it\u2019s impossible to predict what will happen in the future, one thing is clear: the 2022 election will go down in history as one of the most competitive and closely watched races in the history of the United States.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It\u2019s that time of year again. January is here, and with it comes the annual tradition of making financial resolutions for the New Year. As the world continues to battle the impacts of the global pandemic and face economic hardship, it\u2019s more important than ever to ensure your finances are in order and your financial goals are achievable.\n\nAt Yahu, we\u2019ve got you covered with our list of resolutions you should be making in 2023 to have the best financial year of your life.\n\n1. Create a Budget \u2013 and Stick to It\n\nCreating a budget is essential for getting your finances in order. With a budget, you can set achievable financial goals and track your spending, saving, and investing habits. A budget doesn\u2019t have to be complex or overwhelming; it can be as simple as tracking your income, expenses, and monthly financial goals.\n\n2. Take Advantage of Investment Options\n\n2023 is a great year to start investing. Now, with the rise of online brokers and digital asset management tools, it\u2019s never been easier or more accessible for everyday people to invest their money. Whether you choose to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or cryptocurrency, make sure to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk and maximize potential profits.\n\n3. Prioritize Retirement Savings\n\nIt\u2019s never too early to start saving for retirement. While you can\u2019t know what the future holds, you can start preparing now to ensure your financial future. Put money away in a retirement savings account and make sure to take full advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s and Roth IRAs.\n\n4. Pay Off Your Debt\n\nDebt can be a huge burden and drain on your finances. If you\u2019re overwhelmed with debt, don\u2019t despair. Make it one of your 2023 financial resolutions to pay off as much of your debt as possible. Start by attacking the debt with the highest interest rate and work your way down to the lowest.\n\n5. Automate Your Savings\n\nFor many of us, saving can be difficult to do. We often spend the money that should be saved before we even realize it. To make the process easier, automate your savings with direct deposits or auto-transfers from your checking account to your savings account. Set a goal for how much you want to save each month and have your money transferred automatically to make sure you meet your goal.\n\n6. Set Up an Emergency Fund\n\nEmergencies are inevitable, and they can be financially devastating. Make one of your 2023 financial resolutions to set up an emergency fund and begin putting money away each month. Aim to save enough money to cover your expenses for 6 to 12 months, but if that\u2019s not possible, then aim for 3 to 6 months.\n\n7. Take Advantage of Tax-Advantaged Accounts\n\nTax season can be a stressful time, but the good news is that there are ways to make the most of your taxes. Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, such as a Health Savings Account (HSA) or a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), to reduce your taxable income and enjoy additional tax breaks.\n\n8. Monitor Your Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is an important part of your financial health. It affects how lenders view you and can impact your ability to get a loan, a job, or even a lease on an apartment. Make sure to check your credit score regularly to ensure that it\u2019s accurate and that it reflects your financial situation. If you find any errors, take the necessary steps to correct them.\n\n9. Re-Evaluate Your Insurance\n\nIt\u2019s also important to make sure you\u2019re adequately covered by insurance. Take the time to review your existing policies and make sure they meet your current needs. If not, consider getting additional coverage or shopping around for more affordable policies.\n\n10. Make Financial Education a Priority\n\nFinally, make financial education a priority this year.

{"text": "sources.\n\nHuawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, is licensing 5G patent technology to its rivals in a move that reflects the Chinese giant's efforts to diversify its revenue sources amid continued U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe world's largest mobile phone maker, which is also the world's second-largest smartphone vendor, announced on Thursday it has signed licensing agreements with companies from China, Europe, Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe deals, it said, enable the other companies to use Huawei's patented inventions for 5G networks.\n\nHuawei's 5G patents cover core components of 5G technology, such as radio frequency and baseband. The terms of the licensing agreements were not disclosed.\n\nThe move is designed to help Huawei, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions since last year, to access new sources of revenue amid the ongoing conflict with Washington.\n\nThe US has been pressuring its allies to exclude Huawei from developing their 5G networks and has also sought to restrict access to key components and services.\n\nHuawei says the agreements will help other companies accelerate their own 5G deployments and allow them to benefit from the technology it has developed.\n\nHuawei has been a major player in the 5G space, and the U.S. sanctions have had a major impact on its business. The company has been forced to cut costs and lay off employees, as it has been unable to access the key components and services it needs from U.S. companies.\n\nHowever, the company has still been able to license its patents and intellectual property to other companies, providing an important source of revenue for the firm.\n\nHuawei said that it had so far licensed more than 500 of its 5G patents to other companies, and is continuing to actively pursue further licensing opportunities.\n\nThe company said it had licensed patents to more than 70 companies, including tech giants such as Nokia and Samsung, and was working to sign deals with more companies.\n\nHuawei has been pushing to open its own patent stores, which the company says will make it easier for companies to access its patented technologies.\n\nThe Chinese tech giant has also established an intellectual property network of legal advisors around the world to help it navigate the licensing process.\n\nIn an effort to increase transparency in the patent licensing market, Huawei has also opened up its global patent data platform, which provides a platform for companies to discover and analyze patent information.\n\nHuawei has said it wants to become a leader in the global patent licensing market, and that it is prepared to license its patents and technologies to any company at a fair and reasonable price.\n\nThe company's patent license agreements with other companies are evidence of its commitment to abide by international patent licensing rules, even amid the on-going U.S.-China trade war.\n\nHuawei's move is expected to be welcomed by other tech companies, who have seen their patent licensing revenues hit by the U.S. sanctions against the Chinese giant.\n\nWhile the licensing agreement may provide some financial respite to Huawei, the company is still likely to face financial losses due to the U.S. sanctions.\n\nHuawei still faces restrictions on the sale of its products and services in the US and is unlikely to see any meaningful revenue from the US market anytime soon.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "options.\n\nThe mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, is calling on President Biden to end federal work-from-home policies or to create an affordable housing plan to ease the district\u2019s rental crunch.\n\nIn a letter to Biden, Bowser wrote that \u201calthough the remote work policies implemented by the Trump Administration saved lives by helping to reduce the spread of the virus, they are also contributing to Washington, D.C.\u2019s housing affordability crisis.\u201d\n\nBowser said that the federal government should provide more options for its workers who are unable to return to their workplaces, such as offering them remote work opportunities in other parts of the country. She also suggested that the federal government could help with D.C.'s affordable housing crunch by providing incentives to developers to build housing that is more affordable.\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken aggressive steps to increase the availability of affordable housing in the District,\u201d Bowser wrote. \u201cThese efforts are critical to maintaining the vibrancy and economic health of the District, but they are not enough to solve our current affordability crisis.\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s request comes as the housing situation in the city has become increasingly dire. According to the Washington Post, the number of people living in shelters in the city has nearly doubled in the past year, while the number of available rental units has decreased by 20 percent. The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in D.C. has also skyrocketed to $2,150, a 12 percent increase from 2019.\n\nThe situation has become so dire that the D.C. Council recently approved emergency legislation that would extend the eviction moratorium until October and require landlords to give tenants 90 days\u2019 notice before starting any eviction proceedings.\n\nAt the same time, Bowser has asked the Biden administration for $2.2 billion to support D.C.\u2019s housing and economic development efforts. In her letter, she also asked for additional funding to expand the District\u2019s voucher program, which helps low-income residents with rental payments, and to provide financial assistance to those struggling to pay rent during the pandemic.\n\nIn the meantime, Bowser has urged the Biden administration to continue to allow telework for federal employees, but to work with local leaders to address the challenges caused by the large influx of remote workers.\n\n\u201cI believe this is an issue that requires a national solution,\u201d Bowser wrote. \u201cWe must work together to ensure that we provide sustainable housing options that are accessible to federal workers and available to our residents in all corners of the city.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden will take the mayor\u2019s advice, but it is clear that the housing crisis in D.C. is a mounting concern and one that the city\u2019s leaders are taking seriously. With the federal government\u2019s help, the city\u2019s renters may be able to find some relief soon.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "and announces restructuring of the company\n\nToday, ride-hailing giant Lyft announced it has cut 13 percent of its workforce as part of a restructuring of the company. The cut includes 774 employees across its corporate offices, engineering, product and marketing departments, as well as its autonomous vehicle efforts.\n\nThe layoffs come after a year of tremendous disruption to the ride-hailing industry, due to the pandemic. Though the company has seen a rebound in ride bookings in recent months, the pandemic has affected the company\u2019s bottom line significantly.\n\nIn a letter to employees, CEO Logan Green said the restructuring was necessary in order to \u201censure our long-term success and accelerate our growth\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce as we reset our resources and restructure our teams to better align with our new mission,\u201d Green said in the letter. \u201cThis was an incredibly hard decision, but one that we believe is necessary to ensure our long-term success and accelerate our growth.\u201d\n\nThe move follows the company\u2019s decision to close its autonomous vehicle division in July, which resulted in the loss of around 100 jobs. As part of the restructuring, Lyft is also closing its corporate offices in London and Tokyo and shifting its technology resources to its San Francisco hub.\n\nThe layoffs come as Lyft continues to grapple with the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. Though ridership levels have been climbing for months, the company\u2019s overall revenue fell by more than 70 percent in the second quarter of this year, according to the company\u2019s most recent earnings report.\n\nThe move is expected to save the company more than $100 million over the next year.\n\nDespite the layoffs, Lyft said it is continuing to invest in innovation and expansion, with a focus on bike-sharing, scooter-rental and other mobility options. The company also said it is working on a new mobile app and launching several new products in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe have grown tremendously since our launch and will continue to stay focused on what\u2019s important: making sure our riders and drivers have the best experience, and that our employees are supported in all ways as we work together to build the transportation network of the future,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe layoffs represent a tough period for Lyft, as the pandemic has put a strain on the company\u2019s finances. However, the restructuring is expected to help the company emerge from the pandemic in a better position.\n\nFor those affected by the layoffs, the company said it is providing severance packages, outplacement services, and healthcare benefits. The company is also helping employees transition to new roles within the company, either at its San Francisco headquarters or elsewhere.\n\nThe pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption for ride-hailing companies.

That's the conclusion of the recently published, 2023 edition of the Stock Trader's Almanac , which said that \"investors tend to get rid of their losers near year-end for tax purposes, often hammering these stocks down to bargain levels.\" The almanac's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Hirsch wrote that \"this `free lunch' is an extremely short-term strategy reserved for the nimblest traders.\" Although the pattern was first observed as running until February 15, Hirsch noted that the strategy has been tweaked in recent years to sometimes sell in mid-January, depending on the year, and to move the start date to the Friday before Christmas, when stock options and index futures all expire at the same time.

{"text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy spent the first two days of the new year trying to shore up GOP support for his bid to be Speaker by releasing a series of proposals aimed at winning over hard-right detractors who stand to torpedo his ascension.\n\nThe part of his proposed changes to House rules that drew the most attention was allowing just five House members to call for a vote at any time on ousting the Speaker; that would render McCarthy beholden to the most extreme members of his caucus, should he get on their wrong side. But buried in the text was another provision that could be highly consequential for the new Congress being sworn in on Tuesday: language that would effectively gut the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), as the independent panel faces pressure to investigate lawmakers who participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nMost significantly, McCarthy\u2019s proposal would require OCE to hire its staff for the 118th Congress within 30 days of the resolution\u2019s adoption, a requirement that sources familiar with the process tell TIME would make it exceedingly difficult for the office to have the resources it needs to conduct its investigations, given how long it takes to hire candidates for roles in the federal government. The proposal would also block OCE from hiring new employees over the next two years if someone leaves their position, sources say.\n\n\u201cRepublicans get to take control of the House, and on their first day in Congress, they are not trying to take a hammer to the OCE\u2014they\u2019re being a little smarter about it\u2014but they\u2019re taking a scalpel to it,\u201d a Hill source familiar with the ethics process tells TIME.\n\nThe resolution would also impose eight-year term limits for members of OCE\u2019s eight-member board, which is composed of four Democrats and four Republicans. The move would result in three of the four Democrats being forced to vacate their seats effective immediately. While the new Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, would be able to appoint replacements, the changes could still significantly slow down the panel\u2019s work and zap it of valuable institutional knowledge.\n\n\u201cThis could easily kill the only body that\u2019s investigating ethical issues in Congress,\u201d says Kedric Payne with the Campaign Legal Center. \u201cThere\u2019s no investigations in the Senate. And the only investigations that happen in the House of any significance are done by the OCE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very smart way to do it,\u201d adds Payne, a former OCE deputy chief counsel. \u201cBecause it looks as though the office still lives, but, in fact, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Republicans have tried to dismantle the Congress\u2019s independent ethics panel. In 2017, the House Republican Conference took steps to curtail the power of the OCE, but the proposal was opposed by then-Speaker Paul Ryan and even McCarthy.\n\nThis time around, circumstances have changed. A handful of ultra-conservative lawmakers, including Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado, have vowed to vote against McCarthy for speaker. With the Republicans\u2019 slim majority, the California legislator can only afford four defections.\n\nSome of the defectors also happen to be among the lawmakers who stand to benefit the most from a castrated OCE. Last month, more than 30 former members of Congress of both parties requested the ethics panel to investigate the lawmakers who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021 attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, a move that increases the spotlight on OCE and which investigations it chooses to pursue in the new Congress.\n\nThe OCE was also expected to investigate George Santos, the Republican Congressman-elect from New York who appears to have fabricated large swaths of his biography, including his employment history, his educational credentials, and even the circumstances of his mother\u2019s death.\n\nOn Monday, as details of McCarthy\u2019s proposal drew more attention, the good-government watchdog group Public Citizen called on him and the next Congress to get rid of the provisions that would weaken the OCE, saying in a statement Monday that the panel \u201chas a proven track record of enhancing transparency and enforcement of ethics rules and has gained widespread support among the American public.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics was established in 2008 by then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi after a wave of Democratic victories in the 2006 midterms and after corruption scandals that sent multiple members of Congress to jail. The panel was intended to be an independent body separate from the House Ethics Committee, which advocates have long criticized as ineffectual and lacking in transparency.\n\nBut the two work hand-in-hand. When the OCE finds evidence of misconduct, it sends a report of its findings to the House Ethics Committee, which then chooses whether to censure a member for a violation.\n\nWhile the OCE lacks the subpoena power of full House committees, it has been effective at probing wrongdoing by lawmakers of both parties. Shortly after its inception, it found that then-Rep. Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat, improperly accepted trips to Caribbean islands as gifts from a nonprofit group. The entire House later sanctioned Rangel for violating 11 House ethics rules. In 2017, it was the first entity to investigate then-Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, of insider trading. He later pleaded guilty to insider trading and lying to federal investigators. (Trump pardoned Collins in 2020.)\n\nThe OCE was poised to have a full plate over the next two years, with a heavy emphasis on the members who participated in the Jan. 6 attack. It\u2019s a scenario that leads Congressional watchdogs to suspect that McCarthy is offering to debilitate the agency of resources and institutional knowledge to shield his members from scrutiny in order to hold onto power.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Republican Party is rife with ethical transgressions,\u201d says Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist with Public Citizen. \u201cAnd it is now trying to make it much harder to hold members of Congress accountable to the standards of decency we expect.\u201d\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "label": "human"}

House Republicans, who will have subpoena power, have already said they would launch investigations into the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.\n\nStill, Biden starts 2023 in relatively strong shape. The supposed \u201cred wave\u201d never happened, and Senate Democrats picked up a seat, earning the Biden team bragging rights. The 51-seat Democratic Senate majority as of Tuesday means Harris will not have to be anchored to Washington as much \u2014 where she had been needed to cast, if need be, a tie-breaking vote.\n\nAlso, since it takes time for major legislation to take effect, the impact of Biden\u2019s big bills - dealing with drug prices, for example \u2014 will start to be seen more in 2023, even if new legislation never materializes.\n\nBiden has said he will seek another term but before making it official he said he wanted to discuss this with his family over the holidays. He was in St. Croix, the U.S. Virgin Islands, for the New Year\u2019s break.\n\nOne of the points of the Biden White House\u2019s first swing of 2023, according to a White House official, is to \u201chighlight how the president\u2019s economic plan \u2014 including his work bringing Republicans, Independents, and Democrats together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \u2014 is growing our economy from the bottom up and middle out.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s possibly last major piece of legislation, signed last week, was the $1.7 trillion spending bill. And while it passed with nine Republican votes, other big accomplishments, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, were passed with only Democratic support. That includes Independents Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Angus King of Maine, who count as Democrats in determining the party in control of the Senate. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona recently became an Independent but will continue to side with Democrats.\n\nBiden on Wednesday visits Kentucky \u2014 near the Ohio border and the Cincinnati area \u2014 to appear at an event with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican; Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear; and GOP Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Peter Buttigieg travels to New London, Connecticut.\n\nAmong the accomplishments Biden will be expected to highlight will be the enormous infrastructure bill, with money flowing to the state of Illinois and local governments for a variety of projects; and the Safer Communities Act, the first piece of gun safety legislation Congress passed in decades \u2014 but not including an assault weapons ban and the historic number of judges who have been confirmed in Biden\u2019s first two years.\n\nHarris was last in Chicago on Nov. 6 for a get-out-the-vote-rally and before that, she was in the city Sept. 17 for a forum with health care providers. Harris on July 5 paid a surprise condolence call, visiting Highland Park the day after the parade massacre. She came after speaking to the National Education Association in McCormick Place.

{"text": "plan.\n\nGermany's coalition government was in turmoil late on Wednesday after the finance minister abruptly reignited a dormant dispute by calling for the review of the country's plans to exit nuclear energy by 2022.\n\nThe renewed rift between the ruling centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) threatened to deepen the political divide within Chancellor Angela Merkel's fragile coalition.\n\nThe disagreement came to a head as Germany marked the first anniversary of the government's decision to shutter all nuclear power plants by the end of 2022. The shutdown of the country's eight nuclear power plants was seen as a major victory for the environment and alternative energy sources, but it has come at the cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs, notably in the energy sector.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz, a senior Social Democrat, sparked the latest controversy by suggesting that it might be worth delaying the nuclear shutdown, pending an evaluation of the government's energy policy.\n\nIn a surprise move on Wednesday, Scholz made the request as part of a last-ditch attempt to pass budget legislation, which must be finalized by the end of this year. The proposal triggered a furious response from members of the ruling parties, who accused the minister of exploiting the situation to score political points.\n\nCDU Chairman and Merkel\u2019s heir-apparent, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, accused Scholz of attempting to undermine the consensus that had been reached on the nuclear issue.\n\n\u201cWe've already had too many debates about energy policy in this government. It's about time we moved on and implemented the agreement,\u201d Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a statement.\n\nThe CSU, the conservative sister party of the CDU in Bavaria, was even more outspoken in its condemnation of Scholz\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cWe are totally baffled and saddened by the call to postpone the nuclear exit,\u201d CSU Chairman Markus S\u00f6der said.\n\nThe SPD also issued a statement distancing itself from the finance minister\u2019s remarks, saying that it was committed to the agreement reached on the nuclear exit and that it would be a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d to revise the plan now.\n\nNevertheless, the divisions within the government had already widened by Wednesday night, with some sources suggesting that Scholz had managed to drive a wedge between the ruling parties.\n\nExperts said the row had potentially severe repercussions for the future of Merkel\u2019s coalition, which has already been brought to the brink of collapse several times since it came to power in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the government is too polarized to tackle key issues anymore, and that is dangerous,\u201d said Dr. Werner Weidenfeld, political science professor at the University of Munich.\n\nThe dispute has also reverberated outside the government. Germany\u2019s nuclear industry has welcomed Scholz\u2019s suggestion, arguing that the original decision to shut down all plants had been made without proper evaluation and without factoring in potential job losses.\n\n\u201cThe nuclear exit was decided hastily and we urge the government to reconsider it,\u201d said Johannes Remmel, head of Germany\u2019s nuclear association. \u201cThe transition to alternative energies should be thought through carefully and not rushed.\u201d\n\nThe environmental lobby has called on the government to stand by its commitment to phase out nuclear power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government to put an end to this bickering and honour the agreement reached last year,\u201d said Barbara Hendricks, head of the German chapter of Friends of the Earth. \u201cWe cannot afford to delay the transition to clean energy sources.\u201d\n\nThe situation has raised questions over how the government will proceed in the months ahead. While some members of Merkel's coalition have suggested that Scholz\u2019s suggestion could be discussed, other members have reiterated their commitment to the nuclear exit plan and warned that any attempts to revise it could mean the end of the government.\n\nGiven the rising tensions, analysts said it was too early to tell whether the government could pull through or whether the looming crisis would lead to fresh elections.\n\n\u201cThis is a very precarious situation and it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen next,\u201d said Dr. Weidenfeld. \u201cThe coming months will be decisive in determining the future of the coalition.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

She published Out of Darkness in 2015, a year that invoked a national conversation surrounding issues of race, environmental racism, racialized violence and police brutality.\n\nOut of Darkness is based on a true-events: In 1937, a natural gas explosion at a school in New London, Texas, killed nearly 300 students and teachers \u2014 one of the deadliest school disasters in U.S. history. This historical context is foregrounded by the fictional love story between an African American boy and a Mexican American girl. The characters cross color lines and navigate familial tensions and traumas.\n\nThe novel re-contextualizes contemporary issues of race, providing a historical framework in a not-so-post-racial America. After many years on bookshelves, in 2021 this frank portrayal earned the book a spot on the American Library Association (ALA) Banned Book List for \"depictions of abuse and because it was considered to be sexually explicit.\"\n\nThe interview below has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn writing about the human experience, even the hard parts\n\nOut of Darkness, like many works of literature, engages with all kinds of aspects of human experience. And as a literature professor myself, I can tell you that literature from the Bible to Chaucer to Shakespeare to Faulkner deals with difficult topics because those aspects of life are the materials literature... it's not to be provocative or to distress anyone, but because when we want to write about human experience honestly and completely, we have to include the pain of being a person. And so I think that Out of Darkness is literature. And in many ways, what book banners in the present moment are suggesting is that literature that honestly engages human experience is somehow inappropriate for teenagers. And when we hear things like 'there is pornographic content in school libraries,' what we're really hearing is engagement with human experience, such as sexual experience \u2014 we're hearing that being portrayed as pornographic. But that's not that's not that's not true of Out of Darkness or the other books that have been vilified in this movement any more than it's true of the Bible being pornographic because it has sexual content.\n\nOn books about the past being resonant in the present\n\nWith Out of Darkness I was trying to do something a little bit different, which was to write the historical novel that readers like my students wouldn't be able to put down. A historical novel that, though being about the past, would seem powerfully resonant with their lives. In Out of Darkness, for example, I engaged the histories of school segregation in Texas, not just the ways that schools were segregated to separate Black Americans and white American students, but also what happened to Mexican American kids or anyone who was didn't fit into those categories. Texas had \"Mexican schools\" that were unequal in different ways and in some ways more damaging. And my students didn't know that history. So I thought with Out of Darkness about what my former students would want in a book about the past so that it would speak to them now. And a lot of what they wanted was honesty, not to see things sugarcoated or sanitized.\n\nOn bans overwhelmingly targeting authors who are marginalized\n\nThere will be people who buy the book because of hearing this interview. But for the hundreds of authors whose works have been banned but who haven't been interviewed on NPR, this can be career ending. I mean, losing access to school and library markets can be career ending for authors. And since these bans are overwhelmingly targeting people \u2014 authors of color and authors with other marginalized identities, this is a real threat to the modest progress we've made in diversifying children's literature and literature for young adults.\n\nClaire Murashima produced the broadcast version of this story.

Nearly half, or 48.8%, of analysts rate the stock a buy, with the average price target implying the stock could rally 115.2% over the next year. The stock has lost 64.4% in 2022. Coinbase is another tech name that has made headlines in recent weeks, as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and owner Sam Bankman-Fried's arrest has cast doubt on the digital currency more broadly. Bankman-Fried has denied allegations of fraud . Leadership at Coinbase, a different exchange, has said it does not have \"any material exposure\" to FTX as investors grew increasingly concerned about the form of trading. Despite the concern over crypto's health, 36.7% of analysts still rate the stock a buy. The average price target shows an upside of 110.7%. But that rebound would be making up for its 86.3% plummet this year. United Airlines also made the list, with 47.6% of analysts rating it a buy and its average price target showing the potential for a 38.3% upside. The stock has lost 12.6% this year \u2014 outperforming the broader index \u2014 amid a year of resurgence in travel coming out of multiple years overshadowed by the Covid pandemic. Further down the list, Advanced Micro Devices could rally 37.6%, based on the average analyst price target. The chip maker surpassed Intel by market cap for the first time ever this year . But the stock has still fallen 55.6% this year as global supply challenges continued weighing on chip production and demand concerns grew with consumer spending shifting to services from goods. About two-thirds, or 66.7%, of analysts rate the stock a buy. Pandemic darling Zoom also made the list, as the video conferencing platform has an average price target showing it could gain 31.2%. After two years of rapid growth as the pandemic shifted meetings to virtual venues, the stock has plunged 64.2% this year. The company said it expects weaker-than-anticipated revenue for the full fiscal year on its third-quarter earnings call last month. Just above one-fifth, or 21.6%, of analysts rate the stock a buy.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The United States is starting 2021 with a bang, as three major initiatives championed by President Joe Biden and the Biden administration will kick off on Jan. 1.\n\nFrom the expansion of unemployment benefits to a minimum wage increase, Biden\u2019s agenda is taking center stage.\n\nFirst, the $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package recently passed by Congress will extend unemployment insurance to the long-term unemployed. As part of the package, those who have been unemployed for more than six months will receive an additional $300 per week, on top of their state benefit. This expansion of unemployment benefits is expected to help approximately 2 million workers who have been out of work for months due to the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the federal minimum wage will increase from $7.25 an hour to $11 an hour. This is a historic move that will benefit millions of workers, who often work multiple low-wage jobs just to make ends meet.\n\nThird, the Biden administration is set to expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and other public health interventions, and provide additional funding for health care providers. This initiative, which is part of the recent stimulus bill, aims to address the ongoing pandemic and help people safely return to their jobs.\n\nBiden and his team have made it clear that the initiatives kicked off on Jan. 1 are only the beginning of their agenda.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, the Biden administration plans to roll out additional policies, including a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, additional tax credits for middle- and lower-income households, and a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThese initiatives all build on the administration\u2019s goal of helping Americans rebound from the economic crisis caused by the pandemic and creating an equitable and prosperous economy for all.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the Biden administration is not wasting any time in making good on its promises to deliver real and meaningful changes for American families.\n\nAs the new year begins, we can expect to see even more of the Biden administration\u2019s plans for America come to fruition.\n\nWe can look forward to a brighter future as the Biden administration works to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and create an economy and a country that works for everyone.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By the time those holiday tournaments across the state tip off, there has been ample time to smooth out the wrinkles and work out the kinks. Crowds fill the gyms, the stakes are raised, pressure moments crop up and the brand of basketball at Christmas time evolves into something different than in the weeks leading up to it.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at York\u2019s Jack Tosh Holiday Tournament.\n\nBiggest story: Rolling Meadows rolls to title\n\nThere weren\u2019t exactly doubts creeping in regarding Rolling Meadows. But there has been a patient wait in validating their high ranking and status as an elite team.\n\nThe lone loss on the season came to New Trier in a weird one: a near-empty gym at the South Elgin Shootout, second leading scorer Tsvet Sotirov out with an injury, and New Trier\u2019s Ian Brown going bonkers with an epic three-point barrage (12 of 14 from three).\n\nThe Mustangs entered York with a sparkling 11-1 record, but it was still a team that needed to go out and prove themselves with r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building wins.\n\nBehind the play of star Cameron Christie, coach Kevin Katovich\u2019s team more than impressed at York. Rolling Meadows, which had the most difficult road to a title of any top team at York, won five games in five days. That included wins over St. Patrick, Glenbrook South, Bolingbrook and Lyons \u2013\u2013 all by double figures.\n\nThey were dominant. The Mustangs showed multiple ingredients for high-level success and showcased firepower beyond Christie, the Minnesota recruit.\n\nThe jack-of-all-trades, rugged Foster Ogbonna, remained a force in all the important facets beyond scoring. There is the elite shooting and floor spacing Sotirov provides. There is the matchup problem for opponents with skilled big man Mark Nikolich-Wilson.\n\nAnd then there is the combination of endless length and size to go with outstanding perimeter shooting. Rolling Meadows made a whopping 49 three-pointers in the five wins, shooting an impressive 43 percent from beyond the arc, while starting five players who are 6-4, 6-6, 6-6, 6-7 and 6-8.\n\nBiggest surprise: Lyons\n\nWas it a shock Lyons played for a championship at York? No. The Lions were ranked and came into the tournament with a 7-0 record.\n\nBut each step of the way in reaching the title game at York, Lyons won over more and more fans. That included a lopsided semifinal win over top 10 team St. Ignatius.\n\nThe senior-dominated Lions play with cohesion. Coach Tom Sloan has a group that moves the ball and is openly unselfish in how it plays. Yes, there is talent \u2013\u2013 6-6 Niklas Polonowski is a Division I talent headed to Penn \u2013\u2013 but it\u2019s also a quintessential sum that is better than its parts team. That\u2019s why the Lions will be a threat against any team it faces in the regular season and come state tournament time.\n\nPolonowski, Jackson Niego, Connor Carroll and Graham Smith are all capable double-figure scorers.\n\nPlayer of the tournament: Cameron Christie\n\nThere isn\u2019t much the 6-6 guard from Rolling Meadows can\u2019t do at the high school level. With his skill, size and versatility, Christie is as impactful as any player in the state. He showcased it all en route to a tournament MVP performance.\n\nChristie averaged 26.4 points and 7.4 rebounds while making 21 three-pointers (47 percent from three) in tournament play.\n\nBest prospect: Cameron Christie\n\nAgain, this is a no-brainer \u2013\u2013 before the tournament was played and after it: Christie\u2019s ceiling as a prospect in limitless.\n\nChristie, who remains vastly underrated nationally, doesn\u2019t just get \u201chigh school points.\u201d He scores the ball in a way that translates to the next level. The mid-range, pull-up jumper is a thing of beauty and is one of the biggest weapons in high school basketball. He brings the versatility of playing on the ball as a point guard but one who can shoot the three and get to the rim and to the free-throw line.\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\u27a4 The breakout performance in the tournament came from Palatine\u2019s Connor May. The 6-5 junior was on a roll in the first two games, scoring 36 and 30 points. May ended up averaging 26.2 points in four tournament games and has put himself on the map with the stellar start to his junior year.\n\n\u27a4 Riverside-Brookfield big man Stefan Cicic is coming along. He\u2019s become more comfortable in his new surroundings since transferring in from Notre Dame and is gaining confidence by the week. The 6-10 junior had his moments, scoring 24 points and dishing out four assists in one game while recording a double-double in another with 13 points and 11 rebounds. He added 22 points in a win over Palatine to close out tournament play.\n\n\u27a4 St. Laurence bounced back nicely from a lopsided loss to York in the first round. The Vikings are now 12-5 heading into the new year following a consolation championship.\n\nWhen you consider the youth of this team, this type of success, no matter how you get it (four wins in a consolation bracket), should do wonders for a team loaded with sophomores. Led by sophomores Jacob Rice and Emmanuel Mosley, Jr., who averaged 15.4 and 12.8 points in the tournament, respectively, there is a strong foundation for coach Byron Burt.\n\n\u27a4 The host school, York, also had a sneaky solid tournament, improving its record to 8-8 with a 3-1 Jack Tosh record. It was yet another West Suburban Silver Conference team that enjoyed a successful holidays.\n\nYork beat St. Laurence, the eventual consolation champ, by 20 in the opening round. After losing to Bolingbrook by 10, the Dukes bounced back to beat both Conant and St. Patrick.\n\nKeep an eye on junior guard AJ Levine. He was steady and consistent throughout tournament play while averaging 18.2 points.\n\nParting shot\n\nThis tournament continues to step up its game. The organization is top-notch, the promotion is excellent, and the hospitality is real. This has grown in a way where it\u2019s easy to now say it\u2019s one of the top two or three tournaments in state.\n\nIt\u2019s not the fault of the tournament that it\u2019s had two dominant teams \u2013\u2013 Glenbard West last year, Rolling Meadows this year \u2013\u2013 that have prevented any real drama from unfolding the past two years. But those teams have also had POY contenders for fans to enjoy.\n\nThe tournament continues to offer something different than any other tournament: the grind of having to win five games in five days. Winning five straight at any point in the season is never easy. Doing it on consecutive days with no practice and minimal prep? Impressive.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Attack\n\nThe events of January 6th, 2021, when a mob of rioters supporting former President Donald Trump breached the United States Capitol building, are now well known. In an attempt to prevent another attack, metal detectors had been installed outside the Capitol earlier this year. Now, however, Republicans have announced plans to remove the detectors, sparking an outcry from Democrats who feel it is too soon to take down the security measures.\n\nThe attack on the Capitol building was one of the most shocking events in recent US history. It left many people wondering how such a thing could have been allowed to happen, and how future such events can be prevented. In the wake of the attack, the US government decided to take steps to enhance security around the Capitol.\n\nOne of the measures taken was the installation of metal detectors outside the House and Senate chambers. The detectors were put in place as a way to deter people from bringing weapons or explosives into the building. They were also used as a way to track people who had already entered the building, allowing law enforcement to identify them and prevent them from returning.\n\nAt the time, the installation of the detectors was met with support from both Democrats and Republicans. However, it now appears that the Republicans have had a change of heart. This week, Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri announced that the metal detectors would be removed.\n\n\u201cWhile there is still a need for increased security at the U.S. Capitol complex, the installation of permanent magnetometers is not the way to achieve this goal,\u201d Blunt said in a statement. He went on to say that the Capitol Police had recently conducted an assessment and found that the metal detectors were not necessary.\n\nThe decision has been met with widespread criticism from Democrats. Many argue that removing the detectors is premature, especially since the cause of the January 6th riot has yet to be determined. They worry that taking away the detectors could leave the Capitol vulnerable to another attack.\n\n\u201cThis decision is irresponsible and dangerous,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear that the Republicans have no interest in keeping our Capitol safe from the dangerous and hateful ideologies that fueled the attack on January 6th.\u201d\n\nThe issue is likely to become a major point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in the coming months. Democrats have already called for increased security measures, such as improved fencing and enhanced Capitol Police presence. They are likely to push back against the removal of the metal detectors as well.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, argue that the metal detectors were an excessive measure and are not necessary. They also point out that installing the detectors created significant inconvenience for many visitors to the Capitol, who had to wait in long lines in order to enter the building.\n\nThe debate over the metal detectors and other security measures is likely to rage on in the coming months. It remains to be seen whether the decision to remove the detectors will be reversed in the future. Until then, the Capitol building remains a symbol of the insurrection that took place there earlier this year and a reminder that more needs to be done to ensure the safety of the citizens of the United States.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Damircudic | E+ | Getty Images\n\nMore than a fifth of investors don't think they pay any fees for their investment accounts, an industry survey has found. Most of them, however, are likely wrong \u2014 and that knowledge gap could cost them big money in the long term. To that point, 21% of people said they don't pay fees to invest in non-retirement accounts, according to the Investors in the United States: The Changing Landscape survey conducted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor Education Foundation. That share is up from 14% in 2018, the last time FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that regulates member brokerage firms and exchange markets, conducted its national investor poll. An additional 17% of investors in the recent poll said they didn't know how much they paid in fees. More from Personal Finance:\n\n5 money moves for financial success in the new year\n\n63% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck\n\nMost employers offer a Roth 401(k). Here's who may benefit However, the broad ecosystem of financial services companies doesn't work for free. These firms \u2014 whether an investment fund or financial advisor, for example \u2014 generally levy investment fees of some kind. Those fees may largely be invisible to the average person. Firms disclose their fees in fine print, but generally don't ask customers to write a check or debit money from their checking accounts each month like non-financial firms might do for a subscription or utility payment. Instead, they withdraw money behind the scenes from a customer's investment assets \u2014 charges that can easily go unnoticed. \"It's relatively frictionless,\" said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. \"We're not conducting a transaction to pay for those services.\"\n\nwatch now\n\n\"And that makes you much less sensitive to the fees you're paying \u2014 in amount and whether you're paying fees at all.\"\n\nWhy tiny fees can add up to thousands over time\n\nInvestment fees are often expressed as a percentage of investors' assets, deducted annually. Investors paid an average 0.40% fee for mutual and exchange-traded funds in 2021, according to Morningstar. This fee is also known as an \"expense ratio.\" That means the average investor with $10,000 would have had $40 withdrawn from their account last year. That dollar fee would rise or fall each year according to investment balance. The percentage and dollar amount may seem innocuous, but even small variations in fees can add up significantly over time due to the power of compounding. \"You don't just lose the tiny amount of fees you pay \u2014 you also lose all the growth that money might have had for years into the future,\" according to Vanguard Group.\n\nIt's relatively frictionless. We're not conducting a transaction to pay for those services. Christine Benz director of personal finance at Morningstar\n\nThe bulk \u2014 96% \u2014 of investors who responded to FINRA's survey noted their main motivation to invest is to make money over the long term. The Securities and Exchange Commission has an example to demonstrate the long-term dollar impact of fees. The example assumes a $100,000 initial investment earning 4% a year for 20 years. An investor who pays a 0.25% annual fee versus one paying 1% a year would have roughly $30,000 more after two decades: $208,000 versus $179,000. That dollar sum might well represent about a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in retirement, give or take, for someone with a $1 million portfolio. In all, a fund with high costs \"must perform better than a low-cost fund to generate the same returns for you,\" the SEC said.\n\nFees can impact decisions such as 401(k) rollovers\n\nFees can have a big financial impact on common decisions such as rolling over money from a 401(k) plan into an individual retirement account. Rollovers \u2014 which might occur after retirement or a job change, for example \u2014 play a \"particularly important\" role in opening traditional, or pre-tax, IRAs, according to the Investment Company Institute.\n\nwatch now\n\nSeventy-six percent of new traditional IRAs were opened only with rollover dollars in 2018, according to ICI, an association representing regulated funds, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and closed-end funds. About 37 million \u2014 or 28% \u2014 of U.S. households own traditional IRAs, holding a collective $11.8 trillion at the end of 2021, according to ICI. But IRA investments typically carry higher fees than those in 401(k) plans. As a result, investors would lose $45.5 billion in aggregate savings to fees over 25 years, based only on rollovers conducted in 2018, according to an analysis by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\nFees have fallen over time\n\nThis annual fee structure isn't necessarily the case for all investors. For example, some financial planners have shifted to a flat-dollar fee, whether an ongoing subscription-type fee or a one-time fee for a consultation. And some fee models are different. Investors who buy single stocks or bonds may pay a one-time upfront commission instead of an annual fee. A rare handful of investment funds may charge nothing at all; in these cases, firms are likely trying to attract customers to then cross-sell them other products that do carry a fee, said Benz of Morningstar. Here's the good news for many investors: Even if you haven't been paying attention to fees, they've likely declined over time. Fees for the average fund investor have fallen by half since 2001, to 0.40% from 0.87%, according to Morningstar. This is largely due to investors' preferences for low-cost funds, particularly so-called index funds, Morningstar said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Pope Benedict XVI was laid to rest in a funeral of unprecedented grandeur at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Wednesday, marking the first time in modern history that a pope was given such a formal send-off by his successor.\n\nIn a stunning visual gesture of unity, Pope Francis and his predecessors \u2014 Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and Pope Emeritus John Paul II \u2014 were all present for the event, with the two emeriti seated together in the front pew.\n\nPope Benedict, who served as the head of the Roman Catholic Church from 2005 to 2013, died on April 2 at the age of 93 after a long battle with illness. His funeral was attended by thousands of mourners, including dignitaries and heads of state from around the world.\n\nThe funeral was a testament to Pope Benedict\u2019s legacy and his enduring impact on the church, and it was a final opportunity for Catholics to pay their respects to the man who served as the leader of their faith for nearly a decade.\n\nThe ceremony was held in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, the seat of the pope and one of the most iconic Catholic churches in the world. It was an especially meaningful setting, given that it was Pope Benedict who chose to make the basilica the center of his papacy, and it was where he celebrated some of his most memorable moments, such as the funeral of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, in 2005.\n\nPope Francis presided over the Mass, offering a heartfelt homily that underscored the deep reverence he held for his predecessor. He described Pope Benedict as a \u201cteacher of the faith\u201d who \u201cloved the Church\u201d and \u201cguided her with prudence and courage,\u201d noting that the papacy was \u201cenriched\u201d by his predecessor\u2019s ministry.\n\nThe ceremony was filled with moving and solemn moments, such as when Pope Francis placed a stole on the casket of Pope Benedict, an indication of his spiritual successorship. The casket was then carried out of the basilica and placed in front of the altar of the basilica to be blessed and sprinkled with holy water.\n\nThe funeral procession included members of the Roman Curia and the College of Cardinals, as well as representatives from various countries around the world, including the United States, Italy, Germany, and France. Dignitaries from other religious denominations, such as the Anglican, Orthodox, and Protestant churches, were also present, showing the spirit of unity and respect that marked Pope Benedict\u2019s papacy.\n\nThe funeral Mass included traditional prayers, hymns, and readings. An impressive group of singers, including several of Pope Benedict\u2019s favorite choirs, filled the basilica with angelic voices. At the conclusion of the Mass, Pope Francis delivered his final words of comfort, saying \u201cGo forth in the peace of Christ.\u201d\n\nAs the funeral procession slowly made its way to the courtyard outside the basilica, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the archpriest of the basilica, delivered a solemn tribute to Pope Benedict, noting that he had \u201cleft an indelible mark\u201d on the Church.\n\nAs Pope Benedict\u2019s casket was laid to rest, the bells of St. Peter\u2019s tolled as a final goodbye.\n\nIn a stunning show of unity, Pope Francis, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and Pope Emeritus John Paul II all walked together in the funeral procession, a final gesture of solidarity for a man who dedicated his life to serving the Church.\n\nThe funeral of Pope Benedict XVI was a fitting tribute to a beloved leader and a true servant of the Lord. His death marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one, as Pope Francis moves forward to lead the Church in the years to come. May the grace and peace of God be with Pope Benedict and his family during this difficult time.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The television I grew up with\u2014a Quasar from the early 1980s\u2014was more like a piece of furniture than an electronic device. It was huge, for one thing: a roughly four-foot cube with a tiny curved screen. You couldn\u2019t always make out a lot of details, partially because of the low resolution and partially because we lived in rural Ontario, didn\u2019t have cable, and relied on an antenna. I remember the screen being covered in a fuzzy layer of static as we tried to watch Hockey Night in Canada.\n\nThis whole contraption was housed in a beautifully finished wooden box, implying that it was built to be an heirloom. The price implied the same. My parents don\u2019t remember what they paid for the TV, but it wasn\u2019t unusual for a console TV at that time to sell for $800, or about $2,500 today adjusted for inflation. That\u2019s probably why our family kept using the TV across three different decades\u2014that, and it was heavy. It took three of us to move it.\n\nTVs aren\u2019t like that anymore, of course. Like so many other gadgets, TVs over the decades have gotten much better, and much less expensive. But while, say, new cars are priced near where they were 10 years ago, in the same time frame TVs have gotten so much cheaper that it defies basic logic. For example, Reviewed.com\u2019s list of the best TVs of 2012 recommended a 51-inch plasma HDTV for $2,199 and a budget 720p 50-inch plasma for $800. I just found a 4K 55-inch TV, which offers a much higher resolution, at Best Buy for under $350. Even 85-inch 4K displays, which cost about $40,000 in 2013\u2014yes, $40,000\u2014can be yours for $1,300 in 2022.\n\nOr take this chart from the American Enterprise Institute comparing the price, over time, of various goods and services. Most things, such as food and medical care, are up from 80 to 200 percent since the year 2000; TVs are down 97 percent, more than any other product. Why are TVs so much cheaper now?\n\nDirt-cheap TVs are counterintuitive, at first. For $800, you can get an 11-inch iPad Pro, then use it mostly to watch Netflix in bed; less than that amount of money can get you a 70-inch 4K television that you use mostly to watch Netflix on the couch. The difference is that an iPad, computer, or phone has a screen, yes, but that\u2019s not the bulk of what you\u2019re paying for. TVs, meanwhile, are almost entirely screen. \u201cA TV is a control board, a power board, a panel, and a case,\u201d Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, a company that sells tools and offers free guides for repairing electronic devices, including TVs, told me. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much secret sauce in there.\u201d He told me that the most expensive component in a modern television is the LED panel, and that TV manufacturers can buy those panels from third parties at lower prices than ever before because of improvements in the manufacturing process.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements is simply a large piece of glass. \u201cTV panels are cut out of a really big sheet called the \u2018mother glass,\u2019\u201d James K. Willcox, the senior electronics editor for Consumer Reports, told me. The ones today are huge, roughly 10 feet by 11 feet, and manufacturers have gotten more efficient at cutting that large piece into screens. \u201cA few years ago you would have a lot of waste; now you can punch more screens out of that same mother glass,\u201d Willcox said. This, and various other improvements, can be thought of as a Moore\u2019s law for televisions: Over time, the companies that make components can dial down their manufacturing process, which drives down costs.\n\nThese developments affect most gadgets, of course, but the TV market has another factor that makes it different from the rest of tech: massive competition. Unlike in the smartphone market, which is dominated by a handful of big companies, low display prices allow more TV makers to enter the market: They just need to buy the display, build a case, and offer software for streaming. Newer companies such as TCL and Hisense \u201chave taken a lot of market share in the past couple of years from more established brands,\u201d Willcox said. Basically, a new company trying to enter the U.S. market will do so by being cheaper than established companies such as Sony or LG, which forces those companies to also lower their prices.\n\nBut the story of cheap TVs is not entirely just market forces doing their thing. Perhaps the biggest reason TVs have gotten so much cheaper than other products is that your TV is watching you and profiting off the data it collects. Modern TVs, with very few exceptions, are \u201csmart,\u201d which means they come with software for streaming online content from Netflix, YouTube, and other services. Perhaps the most common media platform, Roku, now comes built into TVs made by companies including TCL, HiSense, Philips, and RCA. But there are many more operating systems: Google has Google TV, which is used by Sony, among other manufacturers, and LG and Samsung offer their own.\n\nSmart TVs are just like search engines, social networks, and email providers that give us a free service in exchange for monitoring us and then selling that info to advertisers leveraging our data. These devices \u201care collecting information about what you\u2019re watching, how long you\u2019re watching it, and where you watch it,\u201d Willcox said, \u201cthen selling that data\u2014which is a revenue stream that didn\u2019t exist a couple of years ago.\u201d There\u2019s nothing particularly secretive about this\u2014data-tracking companies such as Inscape and Samba proudly brag right on their websites about the TV manufacturers they partner with and the data they amass.\n\nThe companies that manufacture televisions call this \u201cpost-purchase monetization,\u201d and it means they can sell TVs close to at cost and still make money over the long term by sharing viewing data. In addition to selling your viewing information to advertisers, smart TVs also show ads in the interface. Roku, for example, prominently features a given TV show or streaming service on the right-hand side of its home screen\u2014that\u2019s a paid advertisement. Roku also has its own ad-supported channel, the Roku Channel, and gets a cut of the video ads shown on other channels on Roku devices.\n\nThis can all add up to a lot of money. Roku earned $2.7 billion in 2021. Almost 83 percent of that came from what Roku calls \u201cplatform revenue,\u201d which includes ads shown in the interface. And Roku isn\u2019t the only company offering such software: Google, Amazon, LG, and Samsung all have smart-TV-operating systems with similar revenue models.\n\nThis all means that, whatever you\u2019re watching on your smart TV, algorithms are tracking your habits. This influences the ads you see on your TV, yes, but if you connect your Google or Facebook account to your TV, it will also affect the ads you see while browsing the web on your computer or phone. In a sense, your TV now isn\u2019t that different from your Instagram timeline or your TikTok recommendations. There\u2019s an old joke: \u201cIn America, you watch television; in Soviet Russia, television watches you!\u201d In 2022, TVs track your activity to an extent the Soviets could only dream of. But hey, at least that television is really, really cheap.\n\nRead: The rise of \u2018luxury surveillance\u2019\n\nTVs aren\u2019t furniture anymore\u2014no major TV brand is going to hire American workers to build a modern screen into a beautifully finished wooden box next year. The television is just another piece of tech now, for better or for worse. Don\u2019t get me wrong; watching Netflix on a big screen is superior in every way to watching network TV in the 1990s, and it\u2019s also a lot cheaper. That\u2019s amazing.\n\nBut there are downsides. Willcox told me that the average consumer replaces their TV every seven to eight years, which is adding to the roughly 2.7 million tons of e-waste we produce annually. What was an American-made heirloom is now, generally, a cheaply manufactured chunk of plastic and glass\u2014one that monitors everything you do in order to drive down its price even lower. In that way, cheap TVs tell the story of American life right now, almost as well as the shows we watch on them.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The transfer portal has been a buzz of activity over the past few months, with quarterbacks of all types deciding to make a move to a new program. With the NCAA\u2019s transfer rule changes, the free-agent pool of available quarterbacks has swelled, giving programs the opportunity to secure their quarterback of the future with just one move.\n\nSo far, the transfer portal has seen over 60 quarterbacks commit to new programs. While the majority of them have been FCS players, there have been a few Power Five quarterbacks making moves as well. With the NCAA\u2019s transfer rule changes, quarterbacks have the opportunity to move up to a Power Five program without having to sit out a year.\n\nOne of the biggest moves has been former West Virginia quarterback Will Grier, who announced he was transferring to Florida for his final season of college football. Grier was one of the most sought-after quarterbacks in the portal and his commitment to the Gators gives them an experienced, starting-caliber quarterback for the 2019 season.\n\nAnother high-profile move was former Kentucky quarterback Drew Barker, who transferred to Purdue. Barker had been a starter for the Wildcats before an injury sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He\u2019ll provide the Boilermakers with an experienced veteran at the quarterback spot.\n\nThe SEC has seen its fair share of transfers as well. Former Tennessee quarterback Quinten Dormady is now the presumptive starter at Houston, while former Auburn quarterback Jarrett Stidham is now at Baylor. Former Texas A&M starter Jake Hubenak transferred to SMU and will have an opportunity to compete for playing time.\n\nAs for the Pac-12, former Utah quarterback Tyler Huntley is now at Maryland, while former Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski is now at Illinois. Former California quarterback Davis Webb is now at Colorado, giving the Buffaloes an experienced starter for the 2019 season.\n\nThere are still some big names available in the portal, however. Former Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant has yet to commit to a school, and the same goes for former LSU quarterback Brandon Harris. Both Bryant and Harris have the potential to be starters at the next level.\n\nAnother intriguing name is former Florida State quarterback Deondre Francois. Francois, who was dismissed from the Seminoles program after an off-the-field incident, has yet to commit to a new school, but he still has the potential to be a starter at the next level.\n\nThe transfer portal has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for quarterbacks looking to make a move. With the rule changes, quarterbacks have the opportunity to jump up a level or two without having to sit out a year. As the portal continues to be an active source of talent, teams looking for a quarterback of the future should keep a close eye on the situation.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIt might be a rare sighting these days, but golf fans have long grown accustomed to watching Tiger Woods wear red on Sundays.\n\nBut at the PNC Championship, onlookers were seeing double. For the final round of the annual event in Orlando, Tiger and son Charlie teed off in perfect symmetry.\n\nAt 13-years-old, his father has won two more majors than he has had birthdays, but Charlie impressed throughout at Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, his tee approach and swing drawing inevitable, yet eerily accurate, comparisons to that of his playing partner.\n\nThe pair finished tied for eighth in a star-studded 20-player field, with only players to have won a major championship or The Players Championship invited to play with their relatives.

The higher your credit score, the lower the risk you pose to lenders. This will qualify you for better interest rates and other perks which can save you thousands of dollars when you start taking out larger loans or make milestone purchases such as a home.\n\nWhen building or improving credit, it can be difficult to get started since bad credit is self-perpetuating. If you have bad credit, your loans have greater interest rates because lenders see you as a risky investment. You have a harder time keeping up with payments, which causes you to fall behind. That cycle repeats.\n\nRe-building credit is an uphill battle, though there are ways to reverse the cycle.\n\nUnderstand how credit scores work\n\nCredit scores from the two biggest credit scoring models, FICO and VantageScore, fall between 300 and 850, though scores rarely go that low. According to FICO, over half of consumers have a credit score between 650 and 799 with the average credit score at its all-time high of 716.\n\nVantageScore and FICO break all possible scores into five risk categories. They are as follows:\n\nCredit score category FICO VantageScore Poor/Very Poor 300-579 300-499 Fair/Poor 580-669 500-600 Good/Fair 670-739 601-660 Very good/Good 740-799 661-780 Exceptional/Excellent 800-850 781-850\n\nCredit scores are a reflection of your credit report, which are documents created by the three major credit bureaus \u2014 Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion \u2014 that record your credit history. For example, it will list a credit card account, when it was opened, the current balance at the time of the report, and your payment history (on-time, late, and missed payments).\n\nThese companies keep their exact algorithms under wraps, but we have a general gist of how your credit score turns into your credit score.\n\nFICO VantageScore Payment history (35%) Credit balance (30%) Length of credit history (15%) New credit (10%) Mix of credit accounts (10%) Payment history (40%) Length & type of credit (21%) Percent of credit used (20%) Total debt/balances (11%) Recent credit behavior and inquiries (5%) Available credit (3%)\n\nWith a general understanding of how your credit information turns into your credit score, we can start considering ways to improve your credit.\n\n1. Consider credit-building options\n\nIf you're starting with bad or no credit, you will need to seek out products that are available to you. This often comes in the form of credit-building products, which are designed so you can borrow money without posing too much risk to the lenders that offer these options.\n\nSecured credit card\n\nSecured credit cards give you a line of credit backed by a security deposit you place when you first open the card. The deposit also becomes your credit limit. Because you're technically borrowing against your own money when you use your secured credit card, your credit activities pose very little risk for credit card companies. This means you can qualify for a secured card with bad credit or even no credit at all. There are some (though not many) secured credit cards that don't even require a hard credit check when you apply.\n\nCredit builder loans\n\nCredit builder loans are another great way to build credit from scratch. When you take out one of these loans, the lender sets aside the money that you \"borrow.\" You will then make monthly payments over the payment term, usually 12-36 months, that the creditor reports to the three credit bureaus. Once the term is complete and your loan is paid off, you get that money that the lender set aside.\n\nSimilar to secured credit cards, the lender's money is never really at risk. Many credit builder loans don't even conduct a hard inquiry on your credit. Application credentials, if any, usually rely on the information from your primary checking account.\n\nRental reporting services\n\nMuch of your credit score is determined by how well you can keep up with monthly balances. Yet there are plenty of non-credit-related monthly payments that you're keeping up with, the most significant of which is your rent. A rent reporting service is a third-party company that reports those payments to the credit bureaus, so you can build credit on payments you're already making. There are similar services, such as Experian Boost, that report other monthly payments such as your monthly subscription fees and utility bills.\n\nWhile these can help, there are some limits. For one, this requires the approval of your landlord. Additionally, not all credit bureaus will receive this information. As a result, not all your scores will benefit from these services.\n\nBecome an authorized user\n\nIf you know anyone who would be willing to add you to their credit card, becoming an authorized user on someone's credit card will help you build credit. This option is popular for parents building credit for their children. \"Authorized users can see an increase in their credit score because the payment history for the primary cardholder will be reported under their credit file,\" says Brandon R. Amaral, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Amaral Financial Planning.\n\nWhile becoming an authorized user will affect your payment history, it will also affect your credit utilization ratio, the amount of credit you're using compared to your total available credit. This can end up hurting you. For example, let's say you're an authorized user on a card with a $4,000 limit. The primary cardholder has a credit limit of $30,000 including other cards they use while you just have the one card. They can spend $1,500 on that card, and they'll only be using 5% of their credit. Meanwhile, that charge leaves you with a utilization ratio of 37.5% already.\n\n2. Request a credit limit increase\n\nIt's generally recommended to keep the credit utilization ratio on your revolving credit accounts under 30%. That said, every dollar that you're in debt has an impact on your credit score. If you're having a hard time keeping that down with your current limit, you should consider requesting a credit limit increase on your credit cards. \"If your income has increased, most credit card companies are happy to increase your credit limit,\" Amaral says.\n\nMost of these credit card companies have some kind of portal through which you can request a credit limit increase, and will respond to your request in minutes if not seconds. You can make these requests every six months. Here's a full guide on how to request a credit limit increase.\n\nNote: You will need to have a spotless payment history to get a limit increase. Additionally, a limit increase request might trigger a hard inquiry on your credit, which will dent your credit score in the short term.\n\n3. Avoid applying for new lines of credit\n\nIt may be tempting to open new lines of credit when you're trying to build credit. However, every time you apply for a new loan or a new credit card, the credit reporting agencies receive what is called a hard inquiry, which is then recorded on your credit report. One hard inquiry may drop your credit score by a few points, but these compound exponentially with each additional hard inquiry. This is because creditors will wonder why you're taking out so much credit in such a short period of time, and, more importantly, if you're good for it.\n\nA new line of credit will also drop the average account age, another factor that credit scoring models consider. \"Every time you apply for a new line of credit, your credit score will initially drop,\" Amaral says. \"This is because your 'average account age' will decrease from adding new credit cards.\"\n\nNote: Hard inquiries are no longer calculated into your credit score after a year. They fall off your credit report entirely after two years.\n\n4. Keep old credit accounts open\n\nMaybe you don't really use that first credit card you qualified for. Instead of canceling it, just stow it away. Canceling it will reduce the average age of accounts on your credit report, which will hurt your credit score. Additionally, Amaral says \"closing an old card that has most of your good payment history will hurt your score.\"\n\nAnother reason closing a credit card can hurt your credit is because its credit limit will no longer be included in your utilization ratio.\n\nQuick tip: If you do keep an old credit card open and forget to use it occasionally, the bank could actually close it due to inactivity. \"What they can do is place a small, recurring bill on that credit card, so that it continues to build history and isn't at risk of being closed due to inactivity,\" Amaral says.\n\n5. Resolve any accounts that are past due\n\nBringing past-due accounts current is a key step in improving your credit scores. Remember that payment history is 35% of your credit scores, so the sooner you have a positive payment history, the better. Amaral suggests reviewing all your payment plans and interest rates and developing a strategy to pay off the loans or accounts to minimize the interest they will pay. Once the accounts are current, you can revise your payment plan to pay the accounts each month to pay off the entire balance.\n\nIf your credit payment is already in delinquency, meaning it's at least 30 days late, the damage to your credit can be severe. However, you can attempt to get your creditor to forgive the delinquency and have it removed from your credit reports through a goodwill letter. This is more likely to work if you have a history of keeping your balances in check.\n\n6. Monitor your credit reports\n\nYour credit report isn't infallible. In fact, errors on your credit reports are quite common, and errors are steadily rising. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission reported that 20% of consumers had some kind of error on at least one of their credit reports. In 2021, 34% of consumers found an error on their credit reports.\n\nThese errors can be as innocuous as a misspelled name, but they can also be damaging to your credit score, such as a misreported delinquency or a hard inquiry that you didn't approve. While you should be disputing all errors on your credit report regardless of their severity, these bigger issues warrant additional investigation. If, for example, you find an entire line of credit that you didn't open on your credit report, you're likely the victim of identity theft.\n\nUnfortunately, your credit reports aren't freely available for you to view. You get a grand total of three free credit reports each year, one from each bureau, courtesy of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. You can request these from AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\nIt's generally recommended that you ration these reports, requesting one every four months. That said, you can also employ a credit monitoring service that often gives you access to your credit reports and lets you know when there has been a change on your credit report.\n\nWhile this practice may not actively increase your credit score, at the very least you can be confident that your credit score is an accurate representation of your credit file.\n\nNote: As a result of the pandemic, consumers can request a credit report from each of the three credit bureaus once a week until the end of 2023.\n\nWhen working on your credit, it's important to note that improvements to your credit score will slow as it rises. It's easier to get from 600 to 650 than it is to get from 650 to 700.\n\nWhile it's frustrating to hear, it's also worth mentioning that building credit takes time. You can be doing everything right with your utilization and your payments, but if your accounts are pretty new, you will need to be patient.\n\nImproving credit score frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nHow long do delinquencies stay on my credit report? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Most negative information, such as a delinquency, falls off your credit report after seven years. Bankruptcies will fall off after 10 years.\n\nWill checking my credit report hurt my credit score?

{"text": "Trade union leaders and construction industry representatives have been involved in a bitter public debate over stalled legislation that would require more stringent safety standards for construction crane operators in the Chicago area.\n\nThe Chicago Crane Safety Ordinance, which was first proposed in 2017, would require crane operators to receive a special endorsement from the city, to receive specialized training and to comply with yearly safety inspections of their equipment. It also would require that crane operators keep detailed records of their operations, including the dates and locations of equipment setups, and the hours of use.\n\nUnion leaders say the measure would protect crane operators from unsafe working conditions, while also increasing their wages and benefits. But industry representatives argue that the cost and complexity of the requirements would reduce the number of crane operators, which they fear could lead to job losses in the construction industry.\n\nThe debate has become increasingly heated over the last few weeks, as the City Council has yet to act on the ordinance. Trade union representatives, including the Chicago Federation of Labor, have been especially vocal in their criticism of the industry\u2019s stance, accusing them of putting profits ahead of safety.\n\nAt a news conference last week, the trade union leaders accused construction companies of \u201cusing deceptive practices to avoid the reasonable and responsible safeguards outlined in the proposed ordinance.\u201d\n\nIndustry representatives, including the Chicago Construction Association, have responded with accusations of their own. They claim the union is trying to use the ordinance as a way to force higher wages and better benefits on the industry, rather than to ensure worker safety.\n\n\u201cThis ordinance is not about safety,\u201d said association spokesman Dale Jahnke. \u201cIt\u2019s about union leaders using safety as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from employers.\u201d\n\nThe dispute escalated further on Tuesday, when union leaders and construction industry representatives squared off at a City Council hearing. Construction industry representatives said they supported the concept of the ordinance, but argued that the language of the proposed measure was overly complex and would impose an expensive and unnecessary burden on crane operators.\n\n\u201cWhat this ordinance will do is reduce the number of crane operators,\u201d Jahnke said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the wrong approach and we urge the council to reconsider.\u201d\n\nUnion leaders countered that the industry was trying to avoid having to pay for the additional safety requirements, at the expense of their workers\u2019 well-being.\n\n\u201cThis ordinance would save lives and it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said William Miller, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. \u201cThe industry is trying to avoid the cost of safety, but the cost of not having it is even greater.\u201d\n\nCity Council members indicated that they would take some time to consider the issue and review the proposed ordinance. It remains unclear, however, when the council might act on the measure.\n\nIn the meantime, the debate between union leaders and construction industry representatives is likely to continue. It will be a crucial test of the city\u2019s willingness to regulate the construction industry in the interest of public safety.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By all accounts, the NFL canvassed players, coaches, union representatives and more.\n\nHow did the Buffalo Bills want to proceed, after watching their fellow teammate and player Damar Hamlin suffer cardiac arrest and need on-field resuscitation?\n\nWhat was the sentiment among the Cincinnati Bengals, who hosted the Bills in Monday night\u2019s game, thereby finding themselves also in proximity to a scary and unprecedented situation?\n\nAnd most crucially: What was safest and most expedient for Hamlin, who received CPR and defibrillation in a timeline so sudden that University of Cincinnati Medical Center doctors would say the urgency of available care may have made the difference in saving his life?\n\nConsiderations swirled. And a football game, which had not even completed the first quarter, seemed to hang in suspension.\n\nAt 10:01 p.m. ET, according to a graphic shown on ESPN\u2019s live broadcast, the game was officially postponed. Players, at this point, were in their locker rooms.\n\nHamlin had collapsed at 8:55 p.m. The game was then suspended at 9:18 p.m. and the ambulance left the stadium at 9:25 p.m., according to that same graphic from ESPN, which had camera footage beyond what was aired on live television.\n\nThe question, for the 66 minutes in between Hamlin\u2019s collapse and the official postponement, reverberated across the internet: Would this game resume? Did anyone involved want it to? Did the decision-makers \u2014 particularly at the league office, who had ultimate say \u2014 want or encourage further game play? Broadcast footage of some players warming up, and play-by-play commentary suggesting a five-minute warmup period, further fueled speculation.\n\nThursday afternoon in their first media availability since the incident, the NFL Players Association did little to quiet speculation.\n\n\u201cIn times when a leader needs to make a decision, when you take a bunch of time to ask everybody else what their opinion would be, it seems more like you\u2019re searching for the answer you want and not what the right answer actually is,\u201d NFLPA president J.C. Tretter said. \u201cWe made the determination it wouldn\u2019t be smart to continue playing the moment we saw what happened and how scary that was.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cObviously, as we all know, it took a long time for that to actually go into effect.\u201d\n\nIn its first media availability since the Damar Hamlin incident, the NFLPA expressed displeasure with the timeline of the Bills-Bengals postponement. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel), File\n\nNFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent had addressed the delay hours after it occurred.\n\n\u201cNeither coach, frankly, was talking about resuming play. The players weren\u2019t,\u201d Vincent said, just after midnight ET as Monday night carried into Tuesday morning. \u201cMedical staff, player union, union official, real-time broadcast partners \u2014 just trying to make sure we were keeping everyone abreast of what was taking place and what we were thinking prior to the decision being made, at this particular juncture.\u201d\n\nWhat happened during those 66 minutes? Hamlin, for one, lost pulse on the field and received immediate CPR that enabled \u201cthe return of spontaneous circulation,\u201d University of Cincinnati Medical Center representatives said Thursday.\n\nBengals head coach Zac Taylor and Bills head coach Sean McDermott communicated with official Shawn Hochuli and each other on the field, followed by Vincent and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell once back in their locker-room areas. NFL chief football administrative officer Dawn Aponte, who was at the game, coordinated dialogue between parties regarding next steps.\n\nNFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith communicated with Goodell. And Tretter gauged sentiment on continuing the game in conversations with the Bills and Bengals\u2019 union team representatives, as well as NFLPA executive committee members at the game including Bengals safety Michael Thomas, Tretter said.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like everybody knew it was a clear no,\u201d Tretter said. \u201cI think there was a lot of checking to see what everyone\u2019s opinion was.\u201d\n\nThe NFL disputed that delays stemmed at all from a desire to resume play in what was an unprecedented set of circumstances to navigate. Vincent said that during real-time communication with Goodell, it \u201cnever crossed\u201d either of their minds to discuss warming up to return to play.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Vincent added. \u201cThat\u2019s insensitive. And that\u2019s not a place that we should ever be in.\u201d\n\nSmith and Tretter, nonetheless, criticized the timeline on which a decision was ultimately made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be frank with you: I don\u2019t think it should be a player\u2019s call, I don\u2019t think it should be a coach\u2019s call,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think given the severity of the injury and what the players witnessed, that it needed to be a call that the NFL needed to make to not play this game.\n\n\u201cI understand the idea that we want to know and want to have feedback and want to have input. But I do think there are certain times when it should be beyond the call of the people involved and there. I think that sometimes, it should just be the decision that it\u2019s best for everybody that the game is canceled.\n\n\u201cAnd I made that clear.\u201d\n\nHamlin woke up Wednesday night, earlier than doctors expected him to, they said. As of Thursday afternoon, he remained in critical condition and relied on intubation to breathe. But he had use of his hands and feet, able to communicate through writing as well as nodding and shaking his head. Medical center representatives said they wanted him to breathe independently and demonstrate \"continued neurologic and respiratory improvement\" before upgrading him to stable condition.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Early Tuesday morning, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California declared his intention to run for Speaker of the House when the 117th Congress convenes in January 2021. It was expected that the race for the position would be competitive, with the deeply divided Republican Party in the House of Representatives unable to settle on a single nominee.\n\nHowever, this competition may be short lived, as six House Republicans have already come out against McCarthy\u2019s bid for the Speakership. These Republican representatives include Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Chip Roy of Texas, Denver Riggleman of Virginia, and Bob Good of Virginia.\n\nThese Republicans have expressed a variety of reasons for their opposition to McCarthy, ranging from their dissatisfaction with his focus on moderate policies to their desire for a new direction for the party.\n\nFor his part, McCarthy has defended his record and stated his commitment to working with all House Republicans in the coming Congress, regardless of their ideological leanings. In a statement, McCarthy said, \u201cI will always seek to foster a spirit of bipartisanship within the GOP, so that we can put the best interests of the American people first.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that the six Republicans opposing McCarthy have deep reservations about his candidacy.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at their critiques of the California Republican and why they could prevent him from becoming the next Speaker of the House.\n\nFirst, Steve Scalise of Louisiana has been one of the most vocal opponents of McCarthy\u2019s candidacy. Scalise believes that McCarthy is too focused on pursuing moderate policies that do not represent the interests of the Republican base.\n\nScalise has long been an outspoken critic of the so-called \u201cestablishment wing\u201d of the GOP and has argued for a return to the more conservative policies that helped propel the party to power in the first place.\n\nSecond, Liz Cheney of Wyoming has been a vocal critic of McCarthy\u2019s political agenda. In addition to advocating for a return to more conservative policies, Cheney has criticized McCarthy\u2019s pursuit of bipartisanship with the Democrats.\n\nIn particular, Cheney has expressed her displeasure with McCarthy\u2019s willingness to compromise on immigration, taxes, and other issues in order to gain Democratic support.\n\nThird, Jim Jordan of Ohio has joined Scalise in calling for a return to the conservative policies that propelled the GOP to power in the first place.\n\nJordan has also criticized McCarthy\u2019s pursuit of bipartisanship and his willingness to work with the Democrats. In particular, Jordan has called out McCarthy for his handling of the negotiations to pass the latest coronavirus relief package.\n\nFourth, Chip Roy of Texas has also expressed his dissatisfaction with McCarthy\u2019s handling of the negotiations to pass the relief package. Roy believes that McCarthy was too willing to compromise with the Democrats and not sufficiently focused on fighting for the conservative priorities that were key to the GOP\u2019s electoral success.\n\nFifth, Denver Riggleman of Virginia has criticized McCarthy for focusing too much on his personal ambitions and not enough on the interests of the party.\n\nRiggleman believes that McCarthy is more concerned about amassing power for himself than he is about leading the party to electoral victory in the future.\n\nFinally, Bob Good of Virginia has been another vocal critic of McCarthy\u2019s candidacy. Good believes that McCarthy is not the right person to lead the party into the future and thinks that he should step aside to allow someone else to take up the mantle.\n\nGood also believes that McCarthy should be more willing to work with the party\u2019s more conservative members, instead of focusing solely on working with moderates.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear whether McCarthy\u2019s bid for the Speakership will be successful. The outcome of the race will likely depend on whether he can allay the concerns of the six Republicans who have come out against his candidacy.\n\nIf McCarthy is able to do that, then he will almost certainly win the Speakership in 2021. If not, then the race for the Speakership could become even more competitive as other Republicans consider jumping into the fray. \n\nWhatever the outcome, the struggle between McCarthy and his opponents will be one of the major storylines of the 117th Congress.", "label": "machine"}

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI first heard about the startup accelerator Y Combinator when I was studying at Wellesley College and taking entrepreneurship classes at MIT. I found out more after graduating in January 2021 when I moved into Launch House, a coliving space for founders in Los Angeles.\n\nI spent three months in the house building Anja Health, a personalized cord blood bank that freezes umbilical cord and placenta's stem cells for future disease treatment purposes, while working as an experience designer for digital-consulting company Publicis Sapient. Many of the founders living in the house were in Y Combinator, and they told me how beneficial it was.\n\nI didn't get a lot of exposure to the tech world at Wellesley, so I didn't feel fully equipped with the proper network, resources, or knowledge to run a successful startup. I felt I could find that in YC.\n\nYC invests $125,000 in your company in return for 7%, and then it invests a further $375,000. I applied twice for YC and was accepted into the W22 batch, which ran from January to April 2022.\n\nThe first time I applied in February 2021, Anja Health was literally just an idea and barely a website. I left my job with Publicis Sapient in June 2021 to begin working full-time for Anja Health. The second time I applied during the summer of 2021, I had revenue, customers, a functioning website, and a supply chain.\n\nI filled out an online form and added a short video in my application\n\nThe form included questions like, \"What problem are you solving?\" and \"How big is your market?\" I conveyed most of what I wanted to say about my startup in the application form. For the video portion, I just wanted to show how confident I was as a person. I wore bright colors to help me stand out and tried to speak with confidence.\n\nThe next stage was a 10-minute Zoom call with YC partners and entrepreneurs Jared Friedman, Nicolas Dessaigne, and Surbhi Sarna, whom I would have the opportunity to work with if I was accepted. They asked me about the science behind my company, what I thought about market size, and what motivates me as a founder.\n\nI'd practiced quite a few of my answers with people who had been through YC, so I was prepared, but the interviews are notoriously very short, so I could've said more. When I received the call that I'd been accepted, I was delighted. Ninety percent of companies accepted to YC have cofounders, but I made it through as a solo founder.\n\nWhen I was in YC, I would run my business from home as usual\n\nMy YC experience was virtual, so I completed it while living in Los Angeles. Each week I listened to online talks by successful founders of companies that went through YC like Airbnb and Stripe or experts in fields like SEO. I also connected with YC alumni via Bookface, YC's version of Facebook. I not only had my mentors at YC, but I was also mentored by the peers I was living with.\n\nYou only need to commit a few hours each week to the YC program. It's not a case of taking time off from your startup to attend the course, as they want you to work on your business and accelerate it. Each morning I would get up around 8 a.m., start work, and then have calls with a partner, whether that was Nicholas, Jared, or Surbhi.\n\nThe final part of the three-month course is Demo Day, when you present to more than 1,000 potential investors. A lot of them are former YC founders or partners. It's much less intimidating on Zoom than it is in person. I couldn't even see all the people in the room. While I was sitting in my living room looking at my laptop, I could only see my slides on a screen and me.\n\nPresentations on Demo Day are so short, as each company has just one minute to speak, so it really doesn't require a ton of preparation. What you really have to prepare for is the fundraising that comes from Demo Day.\n\nOver the 3 months you spend at YC, you learn everything from finding customers to fundraising\n\nWhile I'd already raised $400,000 in a preseed round in the summer before I joined YC, the program, especially its coverage of the fundraising process, was still useful to me.\n\nThe first time I fundraised I felt I was just flailing because I didn't have any processes in place. The second time I fundraised was after I'd finished my YC course, and not only was I very intentional about whom I reached out to, but I also set timelines and tracked metrics, like the response rate. In the seed round, which ran from April to June 2022 and stemmed from Demo Day, I raised $4.5 million, and investors included Reddit's cofounder Alexis Ohanian.\n\nMy goal for fundraising was to grow the company and increase staffing levels. When I applied to YC, I was Anja Health's only member of staff. Now we're a team of five.\n\nI still speak to my YC partners regularly. We have a group chat, and I message them on an as-needed basis. I probably could've achieved what I've done without YC, but it would've been a lot harder. In tech and the startup world, your network is your net worth, and YC is a really valuable network.\n\nDid you go through Y Combinator and have a story to tell?

{"text": "US prosecutors recently launched the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Task Force to help recover cryptocurrency customer funds totalling more than $3 billion, in an effort to crack down on illegal cryptocurrency activity.\n\nThis action comes after the Justice Department began a nationwide investigation into the potential criminal misuse of digital assets, including non-fiat currencies, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nThe task force\u2019s mission is to recover customer funds that have been lost due to fraud, theft, or other wrongdoing. The team will take necessary steps to protect customers and stop further losses, while also gathering evidence to bring those who have committed these crimes to justice.\n\nThe task force is the latest effort from the US government to crack down on cryptocurrency fraud. In the wake of increasing customer losses due to illegal activity, the US government has introduced several initiatives that would help fight against these types of crimes.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued several warnings about the risks associated with investing in crypto assets and announced a \u201ccrypto sweep\u201d in July 2020. The sweep involved investigations of 30 crypto trading platforms to identify market manipulation and other types of misconduct.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also stepped in to the crypto space to investigate and enforce the laws protecting investors against fraud. The CFTC has been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency derivatives markets to ensure that the markets operate in accordance with US law.\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has also been active in pursuing fraud and other illegal activities related to digital assets, including the Department's Asset Forfeiture Program. The program works to identify and seize assets and funds related to fraud and other federal crimes.\n\nThe FBI has also weighed in on the crypto fraud problem, launching a nationwide effort to investigate and prosecute those behind these types of crimes.\n\nAs part of the new FTC task force, agents will work to identify, investigate and stop those responsible for taking advantage of consumers and stealing their funds. The task force has the backing of the Justice Department, the SEC, the CFTC, and the FBI, which gives the team significant resources and capabilities to tackle this issue.\n\nThe US government\u2019s efforts to tackle fraud and protect crypto customers are to be commended. As the crypto space evolves, it\u2019s important to ensure that consumers are protected from fraud, while also maintaining a transparent and well-regulated market. \n\nThe FTC Task Force could be a major step forward in helping to protect crypto customers from illegal activity, while also providing a way for customers to recover funds that have been lost. The task force is a positive move for the crypto space, and one that could help prevent future losses for consumers.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Every New Year's Eve, millions of people make resolutions to read more, to spend less or to form some new habit that they are just sure will lead to a more satisfied or productive life. But when they sleep in instead of going to the gym, or impulsively purchase a pricey coat, they can feel defeated and disappointed. Instead of feeling paralyzed by shame, we should strive to experience a sort of \"healthy embarrassment\" Koshin Paley Ellison, a Zen teacher and the co-founder of New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care, said on the podcast Ten Percent Happier this year. \"It's really important to have a humble, healthy embarrassment to realizing how while most of us know what we value and care about, we very rarely actually are behaving in those ways,\" he says. Having healthy embarrassment can help us reach our goals in a way that shame can't.\n\nShame feels 'so personal'\n\nEllison had this revelation about embarrassment while practicing Buddhism's Noble Eightfold Path. One of the eight paths is called Right View. This is a practice in which you try to understand that suffering is a universal experience, and one that we often bring upon ourselves when our actions don't align with our beliefs. Let's say your family has a history of poor cardiovascular health and so you resolve to run twice a week. When you opt to sleep in or watch TV, instead, you might feel like this is a distinctive failure. \"In shame, it's almost like it becomes so personal as if there is something wrong with me personally,\" Ellison says. But in reality, humans have always had a hard time carrying out goals no matter how gratifying they might seem. \"The Eightfold Path was started to be taught almost 2,600 years ago,\" he says. \"So people have been working with this same gunk for at least that long, probably much longer.

La prueba de que en 2022 el mercado laboral ha ganado estabilidad gracias a un aut\u00e9ntico boom de indefinidos que el Gobierno atribuye a la reforma laboral (aunque una parte nada despreciable son fijos-discontinuos, es decir, indefinidos a medias).\n\n2022 cierra con un r\u00e9cord hist\u00f3rico de afiliaci\u00f3n a la Seguridad Social: casi 20,29 millones de trabajadores, muy por encima de los 19,1 millones que hab\u00eda en 2019, antes de la pandemia.\n\nPara alcanzar esa cifra de 20,29 millones, se firmaron 18,3 millones de contratos de trabajo, un 18,7% menos que en 2019. Entonces, en cambio, para crear esos 19,1 millones de empleos hicieron falta 22,5 millones de contratos.\n\n\"En 2022 hemos realizado 9 millones de contratos temporales menos que en 2019, y se han firmado 5 millones de indefinidos m\u00e1s\", explicaba ayer el secretario de Estado de Empleo, Joaqu\u00edn P\u00e9rez Rey, en la presentaci\u00f3n de los datos de paro y afiliaci\u00f3n a la Seguridad Social en 2022.\n\nEsto significa que, para crear a\u00fan m\u00e1s empleo que 2019, se han necesitado 4 millones menos de contratos.\n\nEn otras palabras, por cada nuevo empleo creado en 2022, hicieron falta 0,9 contratos, frente a los 1,17 contratos que hac\u00edan falta en 2019. Que se necesiten firmar menos contratos para crear m\u00e1s empleo es una buena noticia: significa, b\u00e1sicamente, que el empleo que se crea es m\u00e1s estable, por lo que un mismo trabajador no necesita firmar m\u00e1s de un contrato.\n\nP\u00e9rez Rey atribuy\u00f3 este cambio de tendencia a los efectos de la reforma laboral, cuyo objetivo precisamente pasaba por aumentar el empleo indefinido y ponerle coto a la temporalidad.\n\nQue la reforma laboral ha marcado un antes y un despu\u00e9s en la contrataci\u00f3n indefinida en Espa\u00f1a es innegable. Basta con observar c\u00f3mo en el acumulado de 2022 se contabilizaron m\u00e1s de 7 millones de contratos indefinidos, mientras que en 2019 apenas se superaban los 2 millones.\n\nPero no es oro todo lo que reluce, ni conviene pecar de autocomplacencia: de esos 7 millones de contratos fijos, m\u00e1s de 2,3 millones son contratos fijos-discontinuos, una modalidad de peor calidad, al llevar impl\u00edcita cierta temporalidad.\n\nConcretamente, casi un tercio de los contratos indefinidos firmados en 2022 (el 32,7%), eran fijos-discontinuos.\n\nEl fijo-discontinuo es un tipo de contrato indefinido, con la particularidad de que sirve para trabajos que se desarrollan de forma intermitente. Por ejemplo, el empleado de un hotel que s\u00f3lo trabaja en temporada alta. Con este contrato formar\u00eda parte de la plantilla de forma fija, pese a no trabajar todo el a\u00f1o, y la empresa estar\u00eda obligada a llamarle cada vez que inicie su actividad.\n\n\"El fijo discontinuo ha sido la estrella de la semirreforma laboral. Una forma de llamar indefinido a alguien que trabaja por semanas sueltas pero que, a efectos estad\u00edsticos, est\u00e1 contratado\", apunta Joaqu\u00edn P\u00e9rez, secretario general de Uni\u00f3n Sindical Obrera (USO). Seg\u00fan c\u00e1lculos del sindicato, su empleo se ha multiplicado por 15 desde antes de la reforma, con un aumento del 1.478%.\n\nAun as\u00ed, ese v\u00ednculo con la empresa se traduce en que, aunque los fijos-discontinuos sean una modalidad a caballo entre lo temporal y lo indefinido, implican mejores condiciones laborales que las de un contrato temporal.\n\nPero no se trata solo de que 2,32 millones de esos empleados sean indefinidos \"a medias\", sino que es probable que una parte de esa cifra ni siquiera est\u00e9 en activo en estos momentos.\n\nEl problema es que no se facilitan los datos de cu\u00e1ntos de los fijos-discontinuos est\u00e1n en periodo de inactividad, por lo que, a\u00fan contando como empleados fijos, no solo no estar\u00edan trabajando, sino que puede que est\u00e9n buscando otro empleo, y eso cambia significativamente la postal.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Alexis Lafreniere hasn't lived up to the hype with the Rangers. Could the Canucks be a good landing spot? (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nAs the Vancouver Canucks continue to work through a tumultuous season, one name they have their eye on ahead of the March 3 NHL trade deadline is New York Rangers forward Alexis Lafreni\u00e8re, according to Canucks insider Rick Dhaliwal.\n\nLafreni\u00e8re, the first-overall pick in the 2020 NHL Draft, has not lived up to expectations in New York. The 21-year-old has five goals and 12 assists in 37 games this season, and was a healthy scratch in a contest last week. He has 36 goals and 69 points across 172 career games at the NHL level.\n\nThe Canucks are very familiar with Lafreni\u00e8re's game, as current Vancouver assistant general manager \u00c9milie Castonguay used to represent him when she was an agent. Even though Lafreni\u00e8re has underwhelmed, the asking price still figures to be high, per Dhaliwal.\n\nVancouver currently sits sixth in the Pacific Division and finds itself seven points back of a playoff spot as it enters a very difficult portion of its schedule. Acquiring Lafreni\u00e8re would give the Canucks a young, core piece to aid a rebuild or retool. Dhaliwal added the Canucks were similarly interested in 21-year-old Kirby Dach last summer before the Chicago Blackhawks traded him to the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nNew York, on the other hand, holds the first wild-card position in the Eastern Conference and is in more of a win-now mindset. Dhaliwal floated Canucks captain Bo Horvat as a possible piece to head back to the Rangers, which would give New York a dynamic player to slot into its top-six.\n\nHorvat has appeared in a number of trade rumours in recent weeks following reports that the Canucks were looking to move him after he rejected a contract extension. The 27-year-old is on pace for a career-best season as he plays out the final year of a six-year, $33-million pact.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports", "label": "human"}

Covid-19 infections surged this month in mainland China, but there is limited data available publicly. Here are some of the latest policy changes for travelers from China:\n\nSouth Korea\n\nStarting Jan. 2, all visitors to South Korea until the end of the month will need to show a negative Covid test before boarding flights to the country, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said Friday. He said travelers will also need to test for Covid upon arrival in South Korea. It was unclear what would happen to travelers who tested positive after arriving. \"The South Korean government feels the need to take action in order to prevent further domestic spread of Covid as we see a worsening situation taking place in China as the nation eases its restrictions,\" Han said in Korean, according to a CNBC translation. The country will only allow flights from China to land in Incheon and will temporarily halt plans to increase the number of flights from China, Han said.\n\nJapan\n\nBeginning Friday, all travelers from mainland China will need to test for Covid-19 upon arrival in Japan, according to the health ministry. Those who test positive will need to quarantine at a designated facility, the ministry said. Multiple media reports said the isolation period was seven days. The new rules also apply to people who visited mainland China within the seven days prior to arrival in Japan, the health ministry said. But travelers from Hong Kong or Macao are exempt.\n\nStarting Jan. 5, all airline passengers 2 years and older originating from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macao will be required upon departure to the U.S. to show a negative Covid-19 test result from within the last two days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday. The rules apply to people of all nationalities and vaccination status.\n\nwatch now\n\nTesting has decreased across China and it's unclear what variants are circulating on the mainland because genomic surveillance data is also limited, a federal health official told reporters.\n\nTaiwan\n\nFor the month of January, all travelers from mainland China via direct flight or boat will need to test for Covid-19 upon arrival in Taiwan, the local Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday. Those who test positive can quarantine at home, the notice said. The rules do not apply to flights from Hong Kong or Macao.\n\nItaly\n\nAll travelers coming from China to Italy will need to get tested for Covid-19, even if just transiting, the European country's health minister said Wednesday. The minister said the country would also conduct virus sequencing, but did not say what would happen to travelers who tested positive. Health authorities in regions near Milan and Rome said travelers who tested positive would have to quarantine in designated buildings, Reuters reported.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia is not adding restrictions to visitors from China, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday, according to an official transcript of his interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

Las BQ -BQ.1 y BQ.1.1 parec\u00edan imponerse a todas las dem\u00e1s para reclamar una ligera ventaja.\n\nEl resultado ha sido un aumento gradual de casos y hospitalizaciones que nunca pareci\u00f3 alcanzar los puntos \u00e1lgidos de la oleada BA.5 de este verano y que, desde luego, no se pareci\u00f3 en nada al tsunami de enfermedad provocado por la \u00f3micron original hace un a\u00f1o.\n\nPero el viernes, el panel de variantes de covid-19 de los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE.UU. revel\u00f3 un nuevo jugador que pronto podr\u00eda arrasar: XBB.1.5.\n\nLos CDC estiman que la variante XBB.1.5 ha duplicado con creces su participaci\u00f3n en la distribuci\u00f3n del covid-19 cada semana durante las \u00faltimas cuatro, pasando del 4% al 41% de las nuevas infecciones durante diciembre. En el noreste, los CDC estiman que XBB.1.5 est\u00e1 causando el 75% de los nuevos casos.\n\n\"Desde hace unos meses, no hab\u00edamos visto una variante que despegara a esa velocidad\", afirm\u00f3 Pavitra Roychoudhury, directora de secuenciaci\u00f3n de covid-19 en el laboratorio de Virolog\u00eda de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Washington.\n\npublicidad\n\nNuevas restricciones para pasajeros procedentes de China 0:56\n\nVir\u00f3logos y epidemi\u00f3logos afirman que esta subvariante de \u00f3micron tiene caracter\u00edsticas que le confieren el potencial de impulsar una nueva oleada de casos de covid-19 en EE.UU., aunque todav\u00eda no est\u00e1 claro qu\u00e9 magnitud tendr\u00e1 esa oleada y si podr\u00eda enviar a muchas m\u00e1s personas al hospital.\n\nA pesar de la reciente preocupaci\u00f3n por la posibilidad de que una nueva amenaza de covid-19 proceda de la actual oleada de casos en China, expertos se\u00f1alan que XBB.1.5 parece haber surgido en Estados Unidos. Se detect\u00f3 por primera vez en Nueva York y Connecticut a finales de octubre, seg\u00fan GISAID, una iniciativa mundial para catalogar y rastrear variantes del coronavirus.\n\nTrevor Bedford, catedr\u00e1tico de Biolog\u00eda Computacional del Centro Oncol\u00f3gico Fred Hutchinson de Seattle, afirm\u00f3 que XBB.1.5 tiene una tasa de crecimiento similar a la de su primo lejano BA.5.\n\nBedford ha cifrado su n\u00famero reproductivo efectivo -el n\u00famero de nuevas infecciones que se espera que provoque cada persona infectada- en alrededor de 1,6, aproximadamente un 40% m\u00e1s que su siguiente competidor m\u00e1s cercano.\n\n\"Preveo que impulsar\u00e1 una mayor circulaci\u00f3n en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas\", escribi\u00f3 Bedford en un correo electr\u00f3nico. Ese aumento puede no reflejarse en el n\u00famero de casos, se\u00f1al\u00f3, ya que cada vez m\u00e1s personas se hacen la prueba en casa, y sus casos pueden no ser contados a menos que busquen atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica y obtengan una prueba de laboratorio para confirmar sus resultados. \"As\u00ed que yo me fijar\u00eda en las hospitalizaciones en los grupos de edad vulnerables (como las personas adultas mayores) como mejor indicador de la oleada\", escribi\u00f3.\n\nSubvariantes escurridizas\n\nXBB.1.5 es producto de la recombinaci\u00f3n: dos descendientes de BA.2, la subvariante que impuls\u00f3 una modesta oleada de casos en EE.UU. en abril, intercambiaron partes de su c\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico, lo que dio lugar a 14 nuevas mutaciones en las prote\u00ednas de espiga del virus en comparaci\u00f3n con BA.2, y a una nueva subvariante, XBB.\n\nXBB provoc\u00f3 una oleada de casos en Singapur este oto\u00f1o, pero no lleg\u00f3 a ganar mucho terreno en Estados Unidos. Aqu\u00ed, tuvo que competir contra un mont\u00f3n de variantes que circulaban conjuntamente y que hab\u00edan evolucionado de forma independiente algunas de las mismas mutaciones, lo que las hac\u00eda m\u00e1s parecidas.\n\nAun as\u00ed, los cient\u00edficos han estado vigilando de cerca a XBB y sus variaciones.\n\nEl Dr. David Ho, catedr\u00e1tico de Microbiolog\u00eda e Inmunolog\u00eda de la Universidad de Columbia, prob\u00f3 recientemente en su laboratorio virus dise\u00f1ados para tener las espigas de XBB y XBB.1, as\u00ed como BQ.1 y BQ 1.1, contra anticuerpos de la sangre de personas que hab\u00edan sido infectadas, que hab\u00edan sido vacunadas con las vacunas bivalentes original y nueva, y que hab\u00edan sido tanto infectadas como vacunadas. Su equipo tambi\u00e9n prob\u00f3 23 tratamientos con anticuerpos monoclonales contra estas nuevas subvariantes.\n\nDescubri\u00f3 que XBB.1 era la m\u00e1s escurridiza de todas. Ten\u00eda 63 veces menos probabilidades de ser neutralizada por anticuerpos en la sangre de personas infectadas y vacunadas que BA.2, y 49 veces menos probabilidades de ser neutralizada en comparaci\u00f3n con BA.4 y BA.5.\n\nEn t\u00e9rminos de evasi\u00f3n inmunitaria, afirma Ho, estas variantes se han alejado tanto de los anticuerpos que hemos fabricado para usarlos contra ellas como la variante \u00f3micron original se alej\u00f3 de las variantes de covid-19 que la precedieron hace aproximadamente un a\u00f1o.\n\nEl Dr. Ho califica estos niveles de evasi\u00f3n inmunitaria de \"alarmantes\" y dice que podr\u00edan comprometer a\u00fan m\u00e1s la eficacia de las vacunas contra covid-19. Sus hallazgos se publicaron recientemente en la revista Cell.\n\nHo explic\u00f3 este lunes que la evasi\u00f3n de anticuerpos de XBB.1.5 es la misma que la de XBB.1, lo que significa que tiene el potencial de escapar a la protecci\u00f3n de las vacunas y las infecciones anteriores. Tambi\u00e9n es resistente a todos los tratamientos actuales con anticuerpos, incluido Evusheld.\n\nOtro as bajo la manga de XBB.1.5\n\nAdem\u00e1s de su gran capacidad de evasi\u00f3n inmunitaria, XBB.1.5 tiene otro as bajo la manga que parece estar contribuyendo a su crecimiento. Tiene una mutaci\u00f3n clave en el sitio 486, que le permite unirse m\u00e1s estrechamente a ACE2, la puerta que el virus utiliza para entrar en nuestras c\u00e9lulas.\n\n\"La mutaci\u00f3n permite claramente que XBB.1.5 se propague mejor\", escribi\u00f3 en un correo electr\u00f3nico Jesse Bloom, vir\u00f3logo computacional del Centro Oncol\u00f3gico Fred Hutchinson.\n\nEsta mutaci\u00f3n fue se\u00f1alada por primera vez por Bloom, que estudia la evoluci\u00f3n de los virus y las prote\u00ednas virales, como una que podr\u00eda ser importante para la adecuaci\u00f3n viral. Yunlong Cao, de la Universidad de Beijing, la confirm\u00f3.\n\n\"Tiene m\u00e1s capacidad para entrar en las c\u00e9lulas\", afirma Roychoudhury, lo que significa que es m\u00e1s infecciosa.\n\nAun as\u00ed, los expertos afirman que es dif\u00edcil saber qu\u00e9 parte del crecimiento de XBB.1.5 puede atribuirse a las propiedades del virus y qu\u00e9 parte simplemente a la buena sincronizaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa llegada de las vacaciones, durante las cuales es m\u00e1s probable que la gente viaje y socialice, da a cualquier infecci\u00f3n -ya sea gripe, covid-19 o VRS- m\u00e1s espacio para propagarse.\n\n\"La mayor\u00eda de los responsables de salud p\u00fablica habr\u00edan esperado un aumento de los casos de covid-19, incluso antes de que supi\u00e9ramos lo de XBB.1.5\", afirma Andrew Pekosz, profesor de la Facultad de Salud P\u00fablica Bloomberg de la Universidad Johns Hopkins, quien estudia la replicaci\u00f3n v\u00edrica. \"As\u00ed que si el aumento de casos de covid que se est\u00e1 produciendo durante las fiestas se debe a las interacciones sociales que ha tenido la gente o si est\u00e1 relacionado espec\u00edficamente con XBB.1.5 es algo que todav\u00eda no est\u00e1 claro. Ambas cosas probablemente est\u00e9n contribuyendo\".\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los expertos dijeron que, si bien esperan que XBB.1.5 tenga el potencial de causar m\u00e1s enfermedades, no esperan que esas infecciones sean necesariamente m\u00e1s graves.\n\nMirando al noreste, donde se cree que XBB.1.5 est\u00e1 causando la mayor\u00eda de las infecciones, Michael Osterholm, que dirige el Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Pol\u00edtica de Enfermedades Infecciosas de la Universidad de Minnesota, ve motivos para tener esperanza.\n\nOsterholm se\u00f1ala que las dosis de refuerzo actualizadas deber\u00edan proporcionar cierta protecci\u00f3n, incluso contra esta variante tan evasiva desde el punto de vista inmunitario.\n\n\"Siguen proporcionando un nivel de inmunidad que puede que no evite que te infectes, pero que puede tener un impacto significativo sobre si enfermas gravemente y mueres o no\", dijo. \"Ahora mismo, los datos m\u00e1s recientes que tenemos muestran que los que tienen la vacuna bivalente corren un riesgo tres veces menor de morir que los que no la tienen\".\n\nSin embargo, los estadounidenses han tardado en vacunarse. Seg\u00fan datos de los CDC, solo el 15% de los estadounidenses que cumplen los requisitos se ha puesto la vacuna de refuerzo actualizada. Entre los mayores de 65 a\u00f1os, solamente 1 de cada 3 se ha vacunado.\n\nLos expertos tambi\u00e9n se\u00f1alan que, aunque los tratamientos con anticuerpos no funcionar\u00e1n contra esta subvariante, otros antivirales, como Paxlovid y remdesivir, deber\u00edan seguir siendo eficaces.\n\nLas pruebas r\u00e1pidas siguen funcionando, al igual que las mascarillas y la ventilaci\u00f3n y filtraci\u00f3n del aire interior, por lo que, aunque el virus siga evolucionando, sigue habiendo buenas formas de protegerse para no contraer el covid-19.\n\n\"No parece que est\u00e9 causando enfermedades m\u00e1s graves, por lo que creo que hoy circula una situaci\u00f3n muy diferente a la de hace un a\u00f1o\", afirma Osterholm. \"Hay una mayor inmunidad en la poblaci\u00f3n, por lo que no creo que vaya a despuntar\".", "label": "human"}

It found that the number of cases has more than tripled since 2014, with California, Colorado and Washington leading the way.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors are calling for tighter regulation to protect children, saying edible marijuana products are often attractive to young children and can be easily mistaken for candy.\n\n\"We think these numbers reflect the increased availability of recreational marijuana products in these states,\u201d said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe findings come as states look to further regulate and even ban certain forms of the drug, including edibles.\n\nIn California, officials this month proposed tighter restrictions on edible marijuana products, including a ban on candy shapes and packaging that may appeal to children.\n\nGlatter said the study underscores the need for increased awareness of the potential dangers of marijuana edibles and for stronger laws to protect children.\n\nHe warned that edibles could potentially be more dangerous than smoking or vaping marijuana because it takes longer for people to experience the effects of the drug when it\u2019s ingested.\n\n\u201cIngestion of an edible form of marijuana can be more dangerous due to a delay in onset of symptoms,\u201d Glatter said. \u201cVomiting, agitation, confusion and seizure can occur, and severe cases can include more rapid and deeper levels of unconsciousness.\u201d\n\nThe study found that the majority of children who ingest marijuana edibles do not need medical attention. But in some cases, the ingestion can cause serious symptoms, including excessive drowsiness and breathing problems.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors suggested more robust child safety packaging and labels that make it clear the products contain marijuana. They also called for more education about the dangers of accidentally ingesting marijuana edibles.\n\nGlatter urged parents to be aware of the potential dangers of marijuana edibles and to take steps to ensure the drugs are not accessible to children. He said it\u2019s important to properly secure the drugs and to keep them out of reach of children.\n\n\u201cYoung children often cannot distinguish between edible marijuana products and candy or sweets,\u201d Glatter said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that parents store edibles safely, out of reach and locked up in a medicine cabinet, for example.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

These changes are creating new opportunities in the Arctic, from shipping and resource extraction to tourism and research.\n\nThis new activity has sparked a debate about how to balance economic development and environmental protection in the Arctic.\n\nOne of the most visible indicators of the changing Arctic is the increasing number of ships operating in the region. The Arctic has been an historically inhospitable place for ship traffic due to its difficult-to-navigate terrain and treacherous weather. But as the ice melts, more of the ocean is navigable, drawing more ships in search of resources or adventure.\n\nIn 2011, the Northwest Passage was open for more than two months, allowing ships to travel through the passage without the aid of an icebreaker. This created the longest ice-free summer ever, opening up the possibility of a year-round shipping lane.\n\nThe Northwest Passage is not the only shipping route that is opening up in the Arctic. In 2016, the Northern Sea Route, a 6,000-kilometer path along Russia's northern coast, was open for navigation.\n\nIncreasing ship traffic in the region has raised concerns about the potential for accidents, fuel spills, and other forms of pollution. To try to mitigate these risks, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has implemented regulations for vessels operating in the Arctic.\n\nThe regulations include requirements for double-hulled tanks and the use of more fuel-efficient ship designs. They also require vessels to have appropriate insurance and oil spill response plans.\n\nAs more ships travel in the Arctic, they are likely to encounter more icebergs and areas of thin sea ice. To help vessels stay safe, the Canadian Coast Guard has begun using satellites to monitor the region's ice coverage and provide navigational guidance.\n\nThe Arctic is also seeing an increase in natural gas and oil exploration. While these activities may bring economic benefits, they also pose risks. A recent report by the U.S. National Research Council found that oil spills and other forms of pollution could have a long-lasting and damaging effect on the region's marine ecosystems.\n\nClimate change is also making it easier for invasive species to move into the Arctic, threatening the region's wildlife and native species. A recent study found that rising temperatures are increasing the risk of viruses spreading to new areas.\n\nThe changes in the Arctic have raised concerns about the future of the region and the potential effects of climate change. But they are also creating new opportunities, bringing ships, businesses, and people to the region in increasing numbers.\n\nIt is clear that the Arctic is in a state of flux and that the forces of change are only going to accelerate in the coming years. How the region will ultimately be affected is still uncertain, but it is clear that the changes are dramatic and the future of the Arctic is at a critical juncture.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The outlook for corporate earnings in the United States and beyond has been clouded by the economic uncertainty in 2021, and investors have been trying to determine how the rest of 2021, and beyond, will shake out.\n\nThe markets have been surprisingly resilient in the face of so much uncertainty, but earnings season is getting underway for the fourth quarter of 2021 and investors are already beginning to focus on the outlook for 2023 earnings.\n\nA slew of fourth-quarter earnings have been released so far, with most companies beating expectations. But the outlook for 2021 and beyond is less rosy, with analysts warning that earnings could see a sharp drop off in 2023.\n\nThe magnitude of the drop off is still unknown and largely depends on the trajectory of the global economy. With the pandemic still raging in some countries, and the pace of the global recovery uncertain, investors have been trying to gain a better understanding of what 2023 could look like.\n\nThe current earnings outlook for 2023 suggests that earnings could drop off by as much as 5-10%, which would be a sharp contrast to the earnings growth seen in 2021.\n\nOn the one hand, some analysts point to the lingering effects of the pandemic and how businesses are struggling to adapt to the changing environment. On the other hand, there is optimism that the recovery is taking hold in some parts of the world and that this could translate into stronger earnings growth in the second half of the year.\n\nThe evidence so far, however, has been somewhat mixed. Some companies, such as Apple and Amazon, have reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, suggesting that the recovery is taking hold.\n\nAt the same time, there are some companies that have struggled and have lowered their outlook for 2023, signaling that the recovery is still fragile.\n\nOverall, the earnings outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. Most analysts agree that the outlook is likely to remain weak, but the magnitude of the decline is still unknown.\n\nThe majority of the earnings season has yet to play out, so investors should continue to monitor the results of the fourth quarter earnings and the outlook for 2023.\n\nGiven the current economic uncertainty, investors should be cautious and make sure to do their homework before making any investments. They should also consider the potential risks of investing in companies that have lower earnings expectations and should be prepared to adjust their investments as the economy continues to recover.\n\nIn the meantime, the earnings season should give investors more insight into what 2023 will bring and will help them make informed decisions about their investments.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nIt was only a few months ago that Disney's board of directors officially appointed Bob Iger, the entertainment giant's longtime chief executive, as its chairman emeritus. But now, after months of speculation, Disney has confirmed that Iger is back in the hot seat as CEO, and has replaced his protege and former chief Bob Chapek.\n\nThe news, first reported in The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by Disney, ends weeks of rumors about who would helm the iconic media and entertainment company after Chapek's sudden departure in February of this year.\n\nFor a moment it appeared that Iger, who stepped down from the CEO role in February 2020 to become executive chairman and focus on Disney's business strategy and long-term vision, had retired from Disney for good.\n\nBut his return, after a year of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic that decimated Disney's theme parks and studio business, is a major shake-up of the company's leadership.\n\nIn a statement on Disney's website, Iger said he was returning to the CEO role to lead the company through a period of unprecedented change.\n\n\"It is clear to me that the best way for Disney to move forward is with me as its CEO,\" Iger said.\n\nThe move comes at a time when Disney is dealing with the fallout of the pandemic, particularly at its theme parks and movie studio businesses. Revenue at Disney's parks and experiences division, its largest, tumbled 57% in the quarter ended in December due to the pandemic. And revenue at its studio entertainment division, which produces movies and TV shows, tumbled 47%.\n\nWhile the pandemic has taken a toll on the company, Iger's return is a testament to his expertise and the confidence of the board that he can take on the challenges ahead.\n\nIger is a beloved figure at Disney, having served as CEO for more than 14 years. He was a key player in the company's recent acquisitions of Fox's movie and TV studios, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. He was also instrumental in the expansion of Disney's theme parks, launching parks in Shanghai and Shanghai Disneyland, as well as overhauling its flagship Orlando, Fla., resort.\n\nIger's return also has symbolic value. It is a signal that the board of directors is making a commitment to maintain the status quo and the continuity of Iger's leadership style, which includes providing decision-making autonomy to company divisions.\n\nThe board's decision to bring back Iger could be seen as a way to quell growing tensions between the media giant's corporate headquarters and its creative leaders over recent decisions, such as cutting staff and pulling the plug on several tentpole film projects.\n\nIt also is a signal that Disney is determined to stay competitive in the quickly evolving entertainment landscape, where technology and data are increasingly driving the industry.\n\nUnder Iger's leadership, the company has been at the forefront of the trend in both technological advances and data-driven decision-making. Iger, who has spoken of the need to move quickly in an ever-changing world, pushed the company to embrace technology, creating a strong digital presence and investing in streaming, both through Disney's own streaming service, Disney+, and its stake in Hulu.\n\nIn the statement, Iger noted that the company's strength lies in its focus on creating great stories and memorable experiences for its audiences and fans. He also praised Chapek's leadership, noting his \"vital role in setting the company up for long-term success.\"\n\nIt's unclear what Chapek's next move will be, but Iger said he will remain with the company in a consulting role.\n\nIger's return to the CEO role marks the end of an era at Disney and the start of a new one. He will be steering a company that has been transformed by his leadership over the past decade, one that is still trying to figure out how best to respond to the seismic shifts caused by the pandemic.\n\nIt will be up to Iger to ensure Disney remains relevant in a world that is rapidly changing. And with a beloved leader back in the hot seat, fans of Disney can take heart that the future of their beloved company is in the very capable hands of Bob Iger.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CARMAT, a French biotech company, said on Tuesday that its Aeson artificial heart product will form part of an upcoming clinical study in the country, in a significant step towards the potential commercialization of the device.\n\nThe company said the French National Healthcare Security Agency (ANSM) has granted approval for a 15-person clinical trial at four hospitals in Paris, Grenoble, Nantes and Strasbourg. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Aeson artificial heart product in patients with advanced heart failure, with the main objective of assessing the device\u2019s long-term clinical performance and safety.\n\nThe move comes after the European Medicines Agency accepted CARMAT\u2019s filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the Aeson artificial heart in October 2020. The MAA is still under review by the EMA, and if approved, it would be the world's first heart replacement device to receive a regulatory authorization for clinical use in patients.\n\nCARMAT has been working on developing the Aeson artificial heart for over a decade, as part of a goal to create an implantable artificial heart that can replace the native failing human heart. The device is fully implantable and features a hydraulic drive train and lithium polymer batteries to provide the power necessary for it to deliver superior support compared to existing heart-assist devices.\n\nIt features advanced artificial intelligence, with the capacity to monitor and adapt to the individual physiological needs of each patient. The product has two parts: a pump and a battery set, which are designed to deliver superior support over existing heart-assist devices and maintain optimal heart performance and health.\n\nThe device has been tested in a range of pre-clinical trials and was recently used in an 18-patient clinical trial in Europe, which showed promising results. The trial showed that the device was safe and well tolerated, with no reported device-related adverse events, and demonstrated sustained and durable clinical performance.\n\nCARMAT said the clinical study will start in the first quarter of 2021, with the support of the partner hospitals, and will follow the safety and efficacy results of the 15 patients enrolled in the trial. The trial will be the final milestone required for commercialization of the Aeson artificial heart product, and the results from the trial are expected to be announced in 2024.\n\nCARMAT said it will continue working with the medical community and regulatory authorities to ensure that its Aeson artificial heart product is available to patients as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to receive this approval to launch the clinical trial of Aeson,\u201d said Pascal Young, the Chief Executive Officer of CARMAT. \u201cThis milestone marks an important step in the commercialization process of Aeson and we are confident that the data from this clinical trial will confirm the safety and effectiveness of our device.\u201d\n\nThe news comes at a time when there is a growing demand for mechanical devices to treat congestive heart failure, which affects some 20 million people around the world. Many of these devices have been developed in recent years, but none have yet been approved for clinical use.\n\nCARMAT\u2019s Aeson artificial heart is a potential breakthrough for the field, and its potential commercialization could help thousands of patients who suffer from congestive heart failure. The clinical trial will be an important step towards bringing the device to market, and the results from the trial could be a major step forward in the fight against heart disease.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "HAVANA \u2014 The United States Embassy in Cuba is reopening visa and consular services Wednesday, the first time it has done so since a spate of unexplained health incidents among diplomatic staff in 2017 slashed the American presence in Havana.\n\nThe Embassy confirmed this week it will begin processing immigrant visas, with a priority placed on permits to reunite Cubans with family in the U.S., and others like the diversity visa lottery.\n\nThe resumption comes amid the greatest migratory flight from Cuba in decades, which has placed pressure on the Biden administration to open more legal pathways to Cubans and start a dialogue with the Cuban government, despite a historically tense relationship.\n\nThey are anticipated to give out at least 20,000 visas a year, though it\u2019s just a drop in the bucket of the migratory tide, which is fueled by intensifying economic and political crises on the island.\n\nIn late December, U.S. authorities reported stopping Cubans 34,675 times along the Mexico border in November, up 21% from 28,848 times in October.\n\nMonth-to-month, that number has gradually risen. Cubans are now the second-largest nationality after Mexicans appearing on the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows.\n\nThe growing migration is due to a complex array of factors, including economic, energy and political crises, as well deep discontent among Cubans.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Cuban migrants head to the U.S. via flights to Nicaragua and cross by land at the U.S. border with Mexico, thousands more have also taken a dangerous voyage by sea. They travel 90 miles to the Florida coast, often arriving in rickety, precariously constructed boats packed with migrants.\n\nThe exodus from Cuba is also compounded by rising migration to the U.S. from other countries like Haiti and Venezuela, forcing the U.S. government to grapple with a growingly complex situation on its southern border.\n\nThe renewal of visa work at the embassy comes after a series of migration talks and visits by U.S. officials to Havana in recent months, and may also be the sign of a slow thawing between the two governments.\n\n\u201cEngaging in these talks underscores our commitment to pursuing constructive discussions with the government of Cuba where appropriate to advance U.S. interests,\u201d the U.S. Embassy said in a statement in November following an American delegation\u2019s visit to Cuba.\n\nThe small steps are far cry from relations under President Barack Obama, who eased many American Cold War-era sanctions during his time in office and made a historic visit to the island in 2016.\n\nVisa and consular services were closed on the island in 2017 after embassy staff were affflicted in a series of health incidents, alleged sonic attacks that remain largely unexplained.\n\nAs a result, many Cubans who wanted to legally migrate to the U.S. have had to fly to places like Guyana to do so before migrating or reuniting with family.\n\nWhile relations have always been tense between Cuba and the U.S., they were heightened following the embassy closure and the Trump administration\u2019s tightening of sanctions on Cuba.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the U.S. has eased some restrictions on things like remittances and family travel from Miami to Cuba, but has fallen short of hopes by many in Cuba that a Biden presidency would return the island to its \u201cObama era.\u201d\n\nRestrictions on tourist travel to Cuba, and imports and exports of many goods, remain in place.\n\nAlso kindling tensions has been the Cuban government\u2019s harsh treatment of participants in the island\u2019s 2021 protests, including hefty prison sentences doled out to minors, a constant point of criticism by the Biden administration.\n\nCuban officials have repeatedly expressed optimism about talks with the U.S. and steps to reopen visa services. Cuban Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Cossio said in November that ensuring migration through safe and legal pathways is a \u201cmutual objective\u201d by both countries.\n\nBut Cossio also blamed the flight of tens of thousands from the island on U.S. sanctions, saying that \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that a policy meant to depress the living standards of a population is a direct driver of migration.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) made history on Monday when she was elected as the first female president pro tempore of the Senate, making her the first woman to lead the upper chamber of Congress in more than 234 years.\n\nThe election of Murray is the latest milestone in what has been a momentous year for women's advancement in Washington. In January, the 116th Congress became the most diverse in history with more than a third of its members being women, and in November, President-elect Kamala Harris made history by becoming the first female Vice President.\n\n\"It is my great honor to take this office,\" Murray said during a speech on the Senate floor. \"I am humbled to be the first woman to be chosen by this body to hold this position of leadership.\"\n\nThe president pro tempore is a largely ceremonial role with the power to preside over the Senate during the absence of Vice President Harris. The title is typically given to the longest-serving member of the majority party and Murray is currently the longest-serving female senator.\n\nIn her speech, Murray spoke of how her path to the Senate has been an inspiration for generations of young girls in her home state of Washington.\n\n\"I tell my young constituents that if I can do it, so can they,\" she said. \"I want them to know that when you work hard and put your heart and mind into it, you can do great things.\"\n\nMurray also discussed how her election to president pro tempore is part of a greater shift in the Senate. She noted how the chamber has seen a record number of women senators sworn in over the past few years and how the body has become increasingly diverse.\n\n\"We have fought hard to make sure that the leadership of the Senate looks like the people of this nation,\u201d she said. \"When I stand up here today, I am standing up here on behalf of all of us.\"\n\nShe also discussed the importance of continuing to push for more representation in the Senate and other positions of leadership.\n\n\"It\u2019s time to shatter the old boys\u2019 network that has kept women and people of color out of positions of power for far too long,\" she said.\n\nAs president pro tempore, Murray will now have more influence over legislation. She has already indicated she plans to use her new role to tackle long-standing issues such as climate change and protecting reproductive rights.\n\n\"I am determined to make sure my work as president pro tempore reflects my commitment to addressing the most pressing issues of our time,\" she said.\n\nMurray's election is a reminder of just how far women have come in U.S. politics. In the 234 years since the Senate was first established, women were never allowed to take the role of president pro tempore.

{"text": ".\n\nJPMorgan is no stranger to the stock market. Every year, the firm puts out a list of its favorite stocks for investors to consider. This year, the list is no exception. The banking giant has just released its top stock picks for 2023, featuring two stocks that have been stuck in the doldrums for years, but may be ready for a turn-around.\n\nThe first stock on the list is energy giant ExxonMobil. It's been a tough road for ExxonMobil in recent years, with its stock price dropping more than 50% since 2014 due to a combination of low oil prices and a massive restructuring effort. But the company may have finally reached its bottom in late 2020, and JPMorgan believes its turnaround could be just around the corner.\n\nExxonMobil has been investing heavily in new technology and innovative projects that should pay dividends in the long-term. The firm also recently announced a significant asset sale to further reduce its debt burden, which could help set the stage for better performance in the coming years.\n\nThe second pick on the list is Ford Motor Co. It's been a rough few years for the auto manufacturer, as its stock price has tumbled nearly 70% since 2017 due to falling sales and a weak financial position. But JPMorgan believes that the company's recent move to shutter several plants and slash its workforce could set the stage for a dramatic turnaround in the coming year.\n\nFord is also investing heavily in new technologies and other initiatives designed to increase its efficiency and profitability. The company's management has taken several steps to shore up its balance sheet, and its new CEO, Jim Hackett, has already shown a willingness to make tough decisions.\n\nJPMorgan's final pick is Bank of America. The bank's stock has fared better than the other two stocks on this list, but it is still down 25% since 2018. That said, the bank's new CEO, Brian Moynihan, has put a renewed emphasis on cost-cutting and efficiency, which should help its performance in the coming year.\n\nIn addition, Bank of America recently announced a massive stock buyback program and raised its dividend, suggesting that the bank may be able to increase its profitability in the near future.\n\nOverall, JPMorgan's list of stock picks for 2023 is an interesting mix of old and new, featuring some of the best known names in the business as well as a few off-the-radar picks. The banking giant clearly believes that its selections are well-positioned for the year ahead, and with the economy slowly beginning to recover, now may be the right time to make a move on these stocks. \n\nIt should be noted that investments can be risky, and no one should make any decisions without doing their own research and consulting with a financial advisor. But with the right analysis and the right moves, these stocks could be poised for a dramatic turnaround in the coming year.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "With the stock market expected to rally in 2023, analysts at major financial firms are already looking ahead to some of their top growth stock picks for the new year.\n\nThe picks include two electric vehicle (EV) charging companies \u2014 ChargePoint and Blink Charging \u2014 as well as a laundry list of technology stocks, including Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. Analysts believe the two EV charging stocks have the potential to double in 2023.\n\nChargePoint, based in Campbell, California, is the world's largest network of EV charging stations. The company has more than 120,000 charging locations in North America, Europe and Australia, and it has become a key player in the growing EV market.\n\nBlink Charging, headquartered in Miami Beach, Florida, is the largest provider of EV charging services in the U.S. The company owns, operates and maintains a network of more than 21,000 charging points.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America are bullish on both companies and see potential for the stocks to double in 2023.\n\n\"We believe the value of charging networks will become increasingly important as the number of EVs on the road and electricity demand continues to grow,\" the bank's research team wrote in a report. \"We believe the next few years represent a critical inflection point for the EV charging industry, with both ChargePoint and Blink emerging as strong market leaders.\"\n\nThe firm is especially bullish on Blink Charging, which it says could rise as high as $50 per share in 2023, nearly double its current price of around $27 per share.\n\nBank of America also likes a number of large-cap tech stocks for 2023. These include Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which are all expected to post strong results next year as the shift to digital continues.\n\nThe firm's research team is especially bullish on Apple, noting that the company will likely benefit from the roll-out of its 5G iPhones.\n\n\"We remain positive on Apple into calendar year 2023 given the success of the iPhone 12 and accelerating 5G adoption, as well as the potential for growth in wearables, services, and content,\" the report said.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft are also set to benefit from the continued shift to digital, especially in the retail and enterprise software sectors, respectively.\n\nBeyond these three major tech stocks, analysts at Bank of America also like a number of smaller growth stocks. These include Datadog, which provides cloud monitoring services; Shopify, an e-commerce platform; and Zoom Video Communications, a cloud-based video conferencing provider.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley also have a bullish outlook on several stocks for 2023. These include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company; Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise cybersecurity company; and Tempur Sealy International, a mattress and bedding supplier.\n\nThe firm is also bullish on Twilio, an IT infrastructure provider; Aptiv, an automotive parts supplier; and KeyCorp, a regional bank holding company.\n\n\"We view 2023 as a period of sustained growth, with continued rotation into growth sectors, a lack of headwinds, and a higher probability of upside surprises,\" the firm's analysts wrote in a recent report. \"In light of this, we continue to like our picks as a representation of secular growth trends and have added a few new stocks in our model portfolio.\"\n\nThe firm is particularly bullish on Regeneron, which it says could rise as high as $630 per share in 2023, up from around $490 per share currently.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs are also looking ahead to 2023. The firm sees a number of opportunities in the automotive, semiconductor and healthcare sectors.\n\nAmong its top picks are Faurecia, a French auto parts maker; NXP Semiconductors, a semiconductor manufacturer; and CVS Health, a healthcare company. Goldman Sachs also likes streaming service Roku and cloud security company Zscaler.\n\nIn a recent report, the firm said it expects the market to be supported by improving fundamentals, favorable monetary policy and a gradual return to normalcy.\n\n\"We expect the strength of 2023's equity market rally to be more muted than in 2020, though there remain attractive opportunities,\" the firm said in a report. \"We remain optimistic that 2021 could deliver a more favorable outcome than 2020.\"\n\nThe firm is especially bullish on Faurecia, which it believes could rise as high as $45 per share in 2023, up from around $35 per share currently.\n\nOverall, analysts see several opportunities for investors in 2023, with the potential for some of these stocks to double in the year ahead. In particular, the EV charging sector looks set to continue its strong performance, while tech, automotive and healthcare stocks could benefit from the ongoing shift to digital and the gradual return to normalcy.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Prince Harry opened up in a rare, candid interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper about his public life, why he and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, decided to step back from their senior roles in the British Royal Family, and how he's coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex spoke with Cooper on CNN's \"Full Circle\" program, and gave a refreshingly honest assessment of his life. When asked if he had stepped back from the spotlight, Harry said that he still has a role to play but won't be chasing the attention he once had.\n\n\"No, I'm not stepping out of the limelight,\" Harry told Cooper. \"My life has always been under the microscope, and I have to have a responsibility to ensure that my life has purpose and is about making a positive difference.\"\n\nHe added that he had a responsibility to the monarchy and to all of those who look up to him. Harry also said that part of his decision to take a step back from his duties in the British Royal Family was to protect his family.\n\n\"We all know what the British tabloids can be like, and that was a major part of the decision-making process,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to step back to protect my family and my wife. It's something that we never thought we'd have to do, but here we are.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan recently moved to California with their son, Archie, and Harry said he's been able to connect more with his family and with nature in the new environment.\n\n\"This move has been a real blessing in disguise,\" Harry said. \"It has allowed me to be able to connect with nature, my family and the people around me. For me, it's been a great opportunity to really focus on what matters and to live a more normal life. I'm still able to work and do the things that I'm passionate about, but I can also be with my family and have time for myself.\"\n\nHarry also spoke about his philanthropic work, particularly his involvement with the Invictus Games, an international Paralympic-style multi-sport event for wounded, injured or sick armed service personnel and veterans founded by the Duke in 2014. He explained that it was a way for those who have been affected by war to feel empowered and focus on their recovery.\n\nThe Duke said that Invictus was one of his best moments in public life, and also spoke candidly about his struggles with mental health.\n\n\"I think a lot of people are afraid to acknowledge their mental health issues because they don't want to be looked at differently,\" he said. \"That was a fear that I had to overcome. I had to be brave enough to take the first step and to talk about it because I wanted to break the stigma around it and encourage people to get the help that they need.\"\n\nHarry said he is now in a much better place mentally, and has benefited from being able to step back from his former life in the British Royal Family and focus on what's important.\n\n\"I'm happy now,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm really content, and I've been able to really focus on what matters and the things that make me happy. I'm just trying to be the best version of myself that I can be and make a positive difference in the world.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex also spoke about how he and Meghan are currently working to create a better world for their son, Archie.\n\n\"We want to make sure that Archie grows up in an environment where he's surrounded by love and kindness and compassion,\" he said. \"It's our responsibility as parents to make sure that the world is a better place for the next generation, and that starts now with us.\"\n\nWhen asked what he would tell his younger self if he had the chance, Harry said he would emphasize the importance of being present.\n\n\"You don't have to please anyone,\" he said. \"My advice would be to stay in the moment and be true to yourself.\"\n\nHarry's thoughtful conversation with Cooper ended with a reminder that he still cares deeply about his former life as a member of the British Royal Family and the work he did there.\n\n\"I'll always be contributing in some way, shape, or form,\" he said. \"That's never going to change.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Faces of Fentanyl gallery of photos of fentanyl victims are seen at the DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, Thursday, December 8, 2022.\n\nDrug overdose deaths among adolescents surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, driven overwhelmingly by illicit fentanyl, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMonthly drug overdose deaths nearly tripled among adolescents ages 10 to 19 during the first two years of the pandemic. Deaths rose from 31 in July 2019 to a peak of 87 in May 2021 and then fell to 51 in December 2021.\n\n\"Although deaths appear to have begun declining in late 2021, they are still alarmingly higher than in 2019,\" the authors wrote in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which published Thursday.\n\nMore than 2,200 adolescents overdosed during the 2\u00bd year period, 96% of whom were teenagers ages 15 to 19. Fentanyl was involved in 84% of the deaths while opioids of any type were involved in 91%.\n\nFentanyl deaths among adolescents nearly quadrupled from 21 in July 2019 to a peak of 78 in May 2021 and then declined to 44 in December 2021.\n\nAbout 70% of the victims were boys and 30% were girls. Some 60% of those who died were white, 21% were Hispanic and 13% were Black.\n\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid that's up to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It's used as a prescription drug in the U.S. to treat people suffering from severe pain after surgery. But illegally manufactured fentanyl, often consumed as a pill, has become an increasingly common cause of overdose deaths.\n\nThere was evidence that 25% of adolescent overdose deaths may have involved counterfeit pills that often resemble OxyContin or Xanax but frequently include fentanyl as well. This is likely an underestimate because pills present at the scenes weren't always tested, according to the study.\n\n\"Whether adolescents intended to take legitimate pharmaceutical medications or were aware pills were counterfeit is unclear,\" the authors wrote.\n\nAbout 41% of those who overdosed had a previous history mental health issues. Some 24% had mental health treatment before, 19% were diagnosed with depression, and 15% had a prior history of suicidal or self-harm behavior.\n\nThe authors of the CDC study said its crucial to educate teenagers on the dangers of fentanyl and to expand access to naloxone, a drug that can reverse an overdose. Teens should also be educated about the potential presence of illicit fentanyl in pills that may resemble prescription drugs.\n\nIf you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.", "label": "human"}

La notizia, che ha scioccato il mondo intero, \u00e8 stata data dal principe stesso in una intervista con l'emittente francese BFMTV: \"Voglio che mio padre e mio fratello siano di nuovo nella mia vita\".\n\nA seguito di questo annuncio, il principe Harry ha annunciato di essere pronto a fare tutto il necessario per riconciliarsi con i suoi familiari, e che questa \u00e8 una cosa molto importante per lui. Inoltre, il principe ha espresso il desiderio di poter contare sull'appoggio del suo padre e del suo fratello nel corso di questo processo.\n\nHa, inoltre, ricordato che ha cercato invano di riavvicinarsi a suo padre e a suo fratello sin da quando ha lasciato il suo ruolo come membro della famiglia reale e si \u00e8 trasferito negli Stati Uniti.

{"text": "Salesforce (CRM) laid out a cost-cutting plan on Wednesday that is a step in the right direction for the banged-up Club holding. In a regulatory filing, the software maker said it would cut 10% of its workforce and shutter some offices. This will result in charges between $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion, with $800 million to $1 billion booked in Salesforce's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, ending Jan. 31. Salesforce's move comes about two months after activist firm Starboard Value disclosed a stake and outlined what it sees as a \"significant opportunity\" to improve CRM's profitability as sales growth slows down. Salesforce's newly announced restructuring to lower expenses will help accomplish that. The Club's take \"The bottom line is that this was needed,\" Jim Cramer said Wednesday. \"It was pushed by Starboard, who has a big position. I know that Starboard would've liked double that [number of layoffs] because that's how bloated they think that Salesforce became.\" Jim said he won't rule out the possibility of more job cuts. \"If sales are weaker, you could see another round.\" Investors reacted favorably, with Salesforce shares up more than 3% on Wednesday, significantly outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq on the session. Salesforce is the latest tech company to slash headcount as business slows down from Covid-fueled growth and recession fears mount. Smaller tech firms including startups and ride-hailing service Lyft (LYFT) have announced job cutbacks . Fellow Club holding Meta Platforms (META) laid off more than 11,000 employees late last year, and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 also a Club stock \u2014 has cut workers in select divisions with plans for more reductions this year . Salesforce in November let go of hundreds of employees , CNBC reported at the time. Wednesday's actions will affect more than 7,000 workers. The San Francisco-based company, co-founded by Marc Benioff, had 73,541 employees at the end of January 2022, according to its annual report. \"As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that,\" Benioff wrote in a letter to employees. He is soon to be the sole CEO again when co-CEO Bret Taylor leaves at the end of the month. Taylor's departure was announced Nov. 30 alongside Salesforce's fiscal third-quarter earnings . The Club and Wall Street more broadly have increasingly wanted to see tech companies take a more measured approach to expenses and a sharper focus on profits. With revenue growth harder to come by in an uncertain economic situation, aggressive approaches to hiring and spending that characterized much of the past decade are no longer appropriate. Times have changed. Instead of low-interest rates and a multiyear economic recovery, the Federal Reserve is extremely hawkish and a recession may be on the horizon. \"I do think that [Salesforce] got bloated. They still have good growth, but people felt their gross margins weren't that good. This should flow right to the bottom line,\" Jim said. While he noted that Meta has already embarked on large-scale job cuts, he predicted that other tech CEOs may soon follow Benioff's lead, assuaging investor worries. \"The other guys need to do it, and if they don't do it, they're going to see stocks going lower.\" Wall Street's take Wall Street analysts anticipated the cuts. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin \u2014 who maintained his overweight, or buy, rating on Salesforce shares \u2014 estimated the job cuts alone could reduce Salesforce's operating expenses by at least $1.5 billion per year. \"We are not surprised by the restructuring plan unveiled this morning given the rising macro risks, commitment to driving profitable growth and margin expansion, and increasing pressure to drive change from shareholders and activists,\" Bracelin wrote in a note to clients. Raymond James analyst Brian Peterson said Wednesday's announcement adds clarity to the pledge Salesforce outlined at its investor day in September , when management said it targeted a 25% adjusted operating margin in fiscal 2026. \"The news further cements CRM's commitment to margin expansion, which was the key reason we made the stock our top pick in September 2022,\" the analyst wrote, while reiterating his \"strong buy\" call on the stock. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Bret Taylor's departure from Salesforce was announced in November. An earlier version misstated the month.

{"text": "The first half of 2023 will ring in a volatile stock market as two more rate hikes are expected.\n\nMorningstar says the market is currently trading at a 16% discount relative to fair market value.\n\nOn the opposite end is energy, trading at a 12% premium over the firm's fair value.\n\nInvestors are coming out of 2022 with a weary attitude after the stock market spent the last year taking back most of the gains from the pandemic-era lockdowns.\n\nThe bad news is, the first half of this year will bring with it more volatility, Morningstar predicts. The good news is, some stocks are now trading at deep discounts to the research firm's fair-value estimates \u2014 and there will be room for catch-up in the second half of the year.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the S&P 500 was trading near 3,869, just about where it was before 2020's stock-market crash.\n\nMorningstar says the market is currently trading at a 16% discount relative to fair market value, which is an estimate of the long-term intrinsic value of stocks and is based on 700 stocks that are covered by the firm.\n\nIt's an undervalued territory that's rarely seen, according to a December 31 note from Dave Sekera, the firm's chief US market strategist. In the last 12 years, the market has hit this discount territory only 5% of the time, he noted.\n\nAnd if investors can stomach the short-term volatility that's ahead, it's a great time to grab a few stocks for less.\n\nThe note estimates that there will be two more rate hikes at the beginning of the year before the central bank reverses course and eases monetary policy.\n\nSekera believes the economy will then enter into recovery territory and rebound during the second half of the year.\n\nStocks that were overvalued at the beginning of 2022 are now undervalued. The most undervalued sectors include communication services, which is trading at a 43% discount to fair value estimates, and consumer cyclical, which is trading at a 30% discount. Technology trades at a 19% discount, and real estate at a 15% discount.\n\nSome companies have hit an even steeper discount, like Tesla, which has 129% upside to its fair market value based on a share price of $109, or Meta, which has 122% upside based on its share price of $117.\n\nOn the opposite end is energy, a sector that many investors flocked to for safety as global supply became tight. Today, the firm believes energy is trading at a 12% premium over the firm's fair value estimate. Consumer defensive and healthcare stocks are also overrated and are trading at a slight premium.\n\nBelow is a list of nine undervalued mega-cap stocks that Morningstar has picked out. Each one includes its fair market value price and its Morningstar rating.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On Tuesday, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that would protect same-sex and interracial marriages from discrimination.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine and was passed by Congress with the support of the Biden administration. It is the first federal legislation of its kind to protect such unions.\n\nThe bill, also known as the \u201cLoving v. Virginia\u201d protection act, is named after a 1967 Supreme Court decision that declared Virginia\u2019s law prohibiting interracial marriage to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe new law specifically provides protection against discrimination in government services, education and housing. It states that \u201cNo state or federal government agency, program, or activity shall deny, abridge, limit, or otherwise discriminate against any individual, or class of individuals, on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or interracial or same-sex marriage in any of its policies, programs, or activities.\u201d\n\nIt also forbids any state from denying recognition of a same-sex or interracial marriage lawfully entered into in another state.\n\n\u201cBy finally codifying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision into law, we are ensuring that no one in this nation will ever again be denied the legal protections and freedoms guaranteed by the United States Constitution because of their race or sexual orientation,\u201d Biden said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis legislation stands firmly on the side of justice and equality. And it is an important step forward on the path toward full equality,\u201d he added.\n\nThe law\u2019s passage is seen as a major victory for the LGBTQ community and supporters of interracial marriage. Advocates of the law noted that while the Supreme Court struck down Virginia\u2019s ban on interracial marriage over 50 years ago, the legislation provides much needed legal certainty that such unions will be protected.\n\n\u201cThe passage of this legislation sends a strong message that discrimination on the basis of interracial marriage or sexual orientation will not be tolerated in this country,\u201d said Shannon Minter, Legal Director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis victory is an affirmation that no one should ever have to face discrimination because of who they are or who they love. This is a victory for our entire country and a major step forward in the fight for full equality for all.\u201d\n\nThe bill also includes protections for same-sex couples who are seeking to obtain marriage licenses in states where it is not yet legal to do so. Additionally, it ensures that both parents of children born of same-sex or interracial marriages will be recognized as legal parents in all 50 states.\n\nThe Biden administration has made LGBTQ equality a priority and the president\u2019s administration has taken several steps to support and protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. These include signing an executive order to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, protecting the rights of LGBTQ people to participate in the census, and banning federal contractors from discriminating against LGBTQ workers.\n\nTuesday\u2019s signing of the bill is an additional milestone in the fight for equality and serves to further protect the rights of same-sex and interracial couples.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On December 31, Morphe employees across the country were given the news of their terminations.\n\nIn a move that shocked many, the popular makeup retailer announced that it had fired its entire store staff, including those employed in their stores, call centers, and distribution centers. Many of these employees had been with the company for over a decade. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Morphe decided to take such a drastic action, but speculation is that the company was struggling financially. Morphe had been in talks with an investor who was looking to purchase the company, but the deal fell through last week.\n\nIn the wake of this news, former employees have taken to TikTok to air their grievances and demand answers from Morphe about their sudden terminations.\n\nOne of these former employees, Sarah Abell, posted a video on the video-sharing platform in which she expresses her shock and disappointment at the news. \n\n\u201cI had been working at Morphe for five and a half years,\u201d Abell said in the video. \u201cI had just gotten a raise, and I was doing my best. This was really unexpected.\u201d\n\nAbell also pointed out that she and other employees had expressed concerns about the potential sale of Morphe, but they were never given a satisfactory answer.\n\nIn response to Abell\u2019s video, many other TikTokers expressed their outrage at Morphe\u2019s actions and shared stories of their own employment experiences. \n\nOne user, @caitlynsays, posted a video describing her experience working in the Morphe call center. She said that during her time there, she constantly felt as if her job was undervalued and that her work was taken for granted.\n\n\u201cI worked in a high-stress, low-wage job for about a year and a half,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very disheartening experience.\u201d\n\nIn addition to demanding answers from Morphe, many of the users have called for a boycott of the brand until the company apologizes for its treatment of employees.\n\nThe TikTok videos have also inspired other former employees to come forward and share their stories. One former employee, @thenotoriousemilyy, posted a video in which she described her experience working at the Morphe distribution center. She said that the company had provided her with meager wages and unreliable hours, and that she had gone to extreme lengths to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI was working 10 to 12 hour days just to make it through the week,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way I was able to survive was by working two jobs.\u201d\n\nMorphe has yet to comment on the videos and has yet to apologize to its former employees. Until then, many users are vowing to boycott the brand, and they are encouraging others to do the same.\n\nWith Morphe\u2019s future uncertain and the company\u2019s reputation on the line, it is unclear what will become of the brand or what will happen to the employees who lost their jobs. What is certain, however, is that people are paying attention and that the conversation will not end here.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Abortion pills should be easier to get. That doesn't mean that they will be\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nMore than half of all U.S. abortions are medically induced through a two-pill regimen that requires a prescription but does not involve surgery. And since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, rates are expected to increase.\n\nNow, a permanent rule change by the Food and Drug Administration will allow retail pharmacies to fill prescriptions for the drugs, making the once onerous process of obtaining the abortion pills much easier in states that permit the procedure. But in places with strict anti-abortion bans, pregnant people may still find it challenging to get their hands on the medication.\n\nWhat does the FDA's new rule change?\n\nThe revision by the FDA announced on Tuesday permanently eliminates the requirement of an in-person doctor's visit for a prescription of mifepristone, a drug that stops the hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy in the first trimester. The medication has been approved by the FDA for more than two decades but the only way to get it has been from certified clinics due to safety concerns. Retail chains were specifically barred from dispensing the medication.\n\nThe agency lifted the mandatory face-to-face with physicians at the start of the pandemic, allowing them to prescribe the pill via telehealth appointments. This week the FDA said that after a review, the restrictions were no longer necessary.\n\nMifepristone is used to terminate pregnancies of up to 10 weeks. It works when it is followed up with a dose of misoprostol, usually taken 24 to 48 hours later. The second pill causes the uterus to expel the pregnancy. (Doctors also use both pills during miscarriages to speed things along and minimize infection risk.)\n\nWhere will the pills be available and who will have access?\n\nNow that big pharmacy chains are no longer barred by the FDA from carrying and filling prescriptions for mifepristone, the medication could be available at local drugstores and pharmacy retailers. They can also continue to be sent through the mail after telehealth appointments.\n\nWhile no one is required to carry them, pharmacies that wish to dispense the pills would need to meet certain requirements and receive special certification from the FDA. And, in all cases patients still need a prescription. (They will not be available as over-the-counter medications.)\n\nOn Wednesday, Walgreens said it plans to pursue certification.\n\n\"We intend to become a certified pharmacy under the program,\" Fraser Engerman, a spokesman for Walgreens, told NPR in a statement.\n\nHe added: \"We are working through the registration, necessary training of our pharmacists, as well as evaluating our pharmacy network in terms of where we normally dispense products that have extra FDA requirements and will dispense these consistent with federal and state laws.\"\n\nCVS said it was looking at requirements in states that don't already restrict the drugs for medication abortion.\n\nMedical societies say it's a step forward, especially for people who have been marginalized by the health care system.\n\n\"Many people have difficulty accessing this care because of things like transportation or having time off of work to go to a clinic to get this care so this is really going to open the doors for them,\" Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a member and fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists told NPR.\n\nShe added that the FDA's conclusion that patients are not at an increased risk by not seeing a doctor in-person, might pave the way for providers who may have previously been nervous about seeking certification.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that they will sign on and be able to increase access to their communities,\" Brandi said.\n\nWhat about states that limit abortion pill access?\n\nPregnant people living in states that already limit or ban abortion pill access will likely not benefit from the FDA's new rules.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks state laws and policies surrounding abortion, 29 states specifically require physicians to administer medication abortions. Eighteen of those states have already effectively banned the pills' use in telemedicine by requiring a clinician to be in the room when a patient takes the mifepristone. That means sometimes people have to schedule an initial appointment to get the prescription and if the office or clinic is out of stock then the patient has to return for a second visit to take the pill in front the doctor or clinician.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas outright banned two-pill regimen after seven weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAnti-abortion activists and legislators have driven the push against abortion medication, saying that easing prescription requirements is dangerous.\n\nSue Liebel, director of state affairs for the Susan B. Anthony Pro-life America, an organization that calls itself \"the political arm of the pro-life movement, called the more lax rules \"a disaster waiting to happen.\"\n\n\"It is just super reckless that the FDA would peel back these safety regulations [requiring] an in-person exam. I find it heartless that women's health and safety was not taken into account,\" Liebel told NPR.\n\nShe suggested that as a result, more women \"will wind up in the emergency room.\" But when pressed for data that might show any increases in ER visits since the FDA temporarily lifted the in-person mandate, she was unable to point to recent studies.\n\nLiebel said she expects to hear from lawmakers in the coming days about how they intend to move forward.\n\n\"I think this next policy session is going to be very fascinating,\" she said. \"We're in some new territory here with the decision. t's going to be a mixed bag to be honest with you in terms of what states will try do and see what works.\n\nWhat safety measures are in place to protect patients?\n\nThe Mayo Clinic lists excessively heavy vaginal bleeding and unusual tiredness or weakness among the more serious side effects of mifepristone that would require immediate medical attention. Still, the physicians and medical societies say medical complications are very rare.\n\n\"The people that actually need emergency care after receiving the proposal is less than 1%,\"Dr. Kristyn Brandi of ACOG told NPR.\n\nShe added that forcing patients to get the pills in person does nothing to improve medical treatment or prevent a negative response.\n\n\"I would say that there's absolutely no data that suggests that people are going in waves to seek emergency care after medication and that's because there is a really great track record showing that they are incredibly safe,\" Brandi said.\n\nShe also notes that clinical care is not going to change very much. \"Patients will still be evaluated by experienced clinician. They'll go through counseling. They'll be able to talk about whether or not this is the best choice for them.\"\n\nThe only difference, moving forward she explained, is that in the most dire situations they will no longer have to drive long distances for an exam or wait days to obtain the vital medication. \"They're just going to have much more easy access to it.\"", "label": "human"}

With its intricate and multifaceted look at the two decades, Yellowstone has managed to capture the attention of viewers around the world.\n\nFor those less familiar with the show, Yellowstone offers a veritable cavalcade of characters, each as distinct and interesting as the last. From passionate ranchers to ambitious lawyers to quiet but formidable ranch hands, viewers have been able to explore a world seemingly unchanged since the Wild West days.\n\nTo help you get acquainted with the star-studded cast of Yellowstone and their various roles in the show\u2019s narrative, here\u2019s a comprehensive character guide to the show\u2019s 1883 and 1923 characters.\n\nIn 1883, the series focuses on the Dutton family, a ranching dynasty based in Yellowstone National Park. The head of the family is John Dutton (played by Kevin Costner), a proud and passionate rancher who is determined to maintain his family\u2019s ranching legacy at all costs.\n\nJohn\u2019s son, Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes), is the oldest Dutton child and the adopted son of John. He is a former Marine who returns home from Iraq to take on the role of Yellowstone ranch\u2019s head of security.

But what\u2019s the best thing to do with the extra money? \n\nWhile it may be tempting to splurge on a fancy new car or that dream vacation, financial planner Kathleen Grace says there are smarter ways to use a raise.\n\n\"The best thing to do with a raise is to start budgeting,\" Grace says. \"It\u2019s important to track where you are spending and to have an understanding of what is left to save.\"\n\nHaving a budget also can help you identify areas where you can cut back \u2014 like dining out or going to the movies \u2014 so you can save more.\n\nThe next thing Grace recommends is to start an emergency fund. It\u2019s generally a good idea to have three to six months worth of expenses saved up in case of a job loss or an unexpected medical expense.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to build up your emergency fund for when something unexpected happens, because it\u2019s one of the most important ways to protect yourself financially,\" she explains.\n\nGrace adds that if you already have an emergency fund, you should use your raise to add to it. You also can use some of your extra money to pay down debt or contribute more to your retirement account.\n\nIt's also important to look at the tax implications of your raise. Grace recommends meeting with an accountant or tax professional to make sure you understand your tax bracket and the impact a raise could have on your taxes.\n\n\"Most people don\u2019t understand the tax implications of their raise,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a high tax bracket and have a large raise, you may want to start setting aside some of that money to pay taxes.\u201d\n\nGrace says it\u2019s also important to set financial goals to ensure you\u2019re taking advantage of your raise. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish with this extra money, whether it\u2019s paying off debt, contributing more to your retirement or taking a vacation.\n\n\"If you\u2019re already setting aside money for savings and retirement, then you may want to make some additional investments or purchase something you\u2019ve been wanting for a while,\u201d she says.\n\nThe key is to keep your long-term financial goals in mind and make sure you\u2019re taking advantage of your raise in the most efficient way possible.\n\n\"Having a financial plan is the most important thing,\" Grace says. \"It will help you set goals, track spending and ensure that you\u2019re investing your money in the most productive way.\"\n\nRemember that getting a raise is an exciting time, and if you use it wisely, it can have a lasting impact on your financial future.

{"text": "New York CNN Business \u2014\n\nIn the space of a week, a 30-year-old entrepreneur once hailed as a modern-day J.P. Morgan watched his digital empire, including billions of his own fortune, evaporate in a death spiral that\u2019s shaken the foundations of the trillion-dollar crypto industry.\n\nOn Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried issued a mea culpa: \u201cI f**ked up,\u201d he wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread, apologizing to investors and customers of FTX, the exchange platform he founded in 2019. By Friday morning, FTX said Bankman-Fried had resigned as CEO and that the firm was filing for bankruptcy.\n\nFailures are not uncommon in the murky, largely unregulated world of crypto, but FTX is not your average crypto startup. Its near-collapse this week represents a potential turning point for an industry that many critics say has been given a pass for far too long.\n\nSo, what happened to FTX, and why is the entire crypto space freaking out about it? There are still a lot of uncertainties, but here\u2019s what we know.\n\nFishy finances\n\nLast week, the crypto news website CoinDesk published an article based on a leaked financial document from Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund, Alameda Research.\n\nThe report suggested that Alameda\u2019s business rested on shaky financial footing. Namely, that the bulk of its assets are held in FTT, a digital token minted by Alameda\u2019s sister firm, FTX. That was a red flag for investors, as the companies were, on paper at least, separate. Alameda\u2019s disproportionate holdings of the token, however, suggested the two were much more closely linked.\n\nOn Sunday, the CEO of Binance, FTX\u2019s much larger rival, said his company was liquidating $580 million worth of FTX holdings. That set off a firestorm of draw downs that FTX didn\u2019t have the cash to facilitate.\n\nRivals come together\n\nBy Monday, concerns about Alameda and FTX had bled into the broader crypto market. But Bankman-Fried was defiant, tweeting that FTX and its assets were \u201cfine.\u201d He also sparred with the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, whose tweet had fueled the run on FTX deposits.\n\nThere was clearly bad blood between the two, which is why it shocked the industry when the pair announced a tentative deal Tuesday for Binance to bail out FTX.\n\n\u201cThis afternoon, FTX asked for our help,\u201d Zhao tweeted that afternoon, noting that there was a \u201csignificant liquidity crunch\u201d at the company and that Binance would have to conduct corporate due diligence before going forward with any deal.\n\nAlmost immediately after getting a look at under the hood, though, Binance began to backtrack.\n\nMeanwhile, Bankman-Fried\u2019s personal fortune also tumbled. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Bankman-Fried\u2019s net worth cratered 94% in a single day, from more than $15 billion to just under $1 billion \u2014 the biggest one-day loss ever clocked by the index. (The estimate of his wealth was based on the assumption that Binance would ultimately bail out FTX, where much of Bankman-Fried\u2019s personal assets are held. Which means his net worth may have farther to fall.)\n\nThe flip-flop\n\nOn Wednesday, cryptocurrencies continued to slump as investor anxiety about the FTX bailout spread. Bitcoin and ether, the two most popular tokens, both hit their lowest level in two years.\n\nThe selloff deepened after media reports emerged that Binance was leaning toward walking away from the deal. Sure enough, on Wednesday afternoon, Zhao tweeted a withering assessment of FTX\u2019s problems:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX\u2019s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.\u201d\n\nHe also alluded to allegations of \u201cmishandled funds\u201d and investigations by US regulators.\n\nBinance was out. FTX\u2019s best shot at a lifeline was gone.\n\nDamage control at FTX\n\nThe full extent of FTX\u2019s financial problems aren\u2019t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy.\n\nSince the Binance deal fell apart, Bankman-Fried has been scrambling to raise funds.

But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBloomberg columnist Matt Levine put it another way: \u201cFTX took its customers\u2019 money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, FTX experienced the crypto equivalent of a classic bank run. Customers wanted their money out, and FTX didn\u2019t have it.\n\nIn traditional finance, customers\u2019 funds are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits. The FDIC does not insure stocks or cryptocurrencies, however, leaving the fate of FTX\u2019s customers and investors in question.\n\nOne of those investors was the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan, which said it invested $95 million in both FTX International and its US entity \u201cto gain small-scale exposure to an emerging area in the financial technology sector.\u201d In a statement Thursday, the plan noted that any loss on its investment would have \u201climited impact\u201d as it represents less than 0.05% of its total net assets.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAfter a chaotic week, FTX filed for bankruptcy. In a statement, FTX said John Ray III has been appointed the new CEO and that many exchange employees are expected to stay on to run the firm as it goes through the Chapter 11 process.\n\nRay said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to \u201cassess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.\u201d\n\nRegulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong at FTX, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.\n\nSecurities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, froze some of the embattled exchange\u2019s assets on Thursday. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, according to the Wall Street Journal. (The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.)\n\nThe collapse of FTX is \u201ca loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail,\u201d Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAnd just like we saw with over-the-counter derivatives that led to a financial crisis, these failures can have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden sought to reassure Americans on Friday that the economic recovery was on track, despite rising concerns about the pace of job growth and deepening fears of a double-dip recession.\n\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden, Biden said the U.S. economy was headed to a \"new plateau,\" and that the nation was \"building back better.\"\n\n\"What we\u2019re seeing is an unmistakable evidence that the economy is going in the right direction. We\u2019re headed to a new plateau,\" Biden said.\n\nHe pointed to a number of economic data points that he said showed progress in the job market and other economic indicators, including a decrease in unemployment from 10.2 percent in December to 8.4 percent in January, as well as a steady increase in the number of jobs created.\n\n\"We\u2019ve added more than 8 million jobs since I took office just two months ago,\" Biden said, noting that this was the \"most job creation in any two-month period on record.\"\n\nThe president also noted the passage of the American Rescue Plan, which included $1.9 trillion in aid to help individuals and businesses weather the economic storm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the plan had already provided relief to millions of families, as well as billions in small business aid.\n\nBut Biden also warned that while the U.S. economy had shown signs of improvement, the recovery was not yet complete.\n\n\"There are still millions of Americans who are out of work and can't pay their bills. Too many families are struggling to make ends meet,\" he said.\n\nTo help the economy continue to grow, Biden proposed a number of additional measures, including an infrastructure package and measures to invest in advanced manufacturing and research.\n\n\"This is a time when we should be investing in our people and infrastructure to create jobs and grow the economy, not cutting,\" he said.\n\nHe also said it was time to address the growing income inequality that has been a consequence of the pandemic.\n\n\"The pandemic has widened the gap between the wealthiest Americans and those struggling to get by. It\u2019s time to close this gap,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president also said he would work with Congress to pass legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and implement a national paid leave policy.\n\nThe Biden administration is facing increasing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to act decisively on the economy, with a growing sense of urgency among lawmakers and business leaders that the recovery may be stalling.\n\nInvestors and economists are beginning to worry that the impact of the pandemic is still too deep for the current recovery to last.\n\nBut Biden sought to quell such concerns, stressing that the U.S. was \"headed to a new plateau\" in the recovery and urging the public to remain confident in the nation's prospects.\n\n\"Now is the time to look to the future with confidence and faith in our nation\u2019s ability to rise again,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve faced so many challenges, but we will rise again.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nChinese search giant Baidu said on Wednesday that it has expanded its autonomous-driving robotaxis to three cities in China and claims that its services are now able to rival traditional ride-hailing services in certain areas.\n\nThe company said it has deployed 100 robotaxis in Beijing and 200 in Guangzhou, as well as in its home city of Beijing. Baidu has now rolled out self-driving robotaxis in over 11 cities since launching the service in 2019.\n\nThe expansion comes amid increased competition in the ride-hailing space in China. Last year, Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s dominant ride-hailing firm, announced plans to develop its own self-driving vehicles.\n\nBaidu said its robotaxis, named Apolong, can complete a journey in 40 minutes in Beijing and just over 50 minutes in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The company said the routes are customized to match road conditions, vehicle capacity, and customer needs.\n\nBaidu claims its robotaxis have already outperformed traditional ride-hailing services in certain parts of the cities where it has launched the service. The company said its Apolong robotaxis have been able to operate in major urban roads during rush hour, with some of its routes even surpassing the speed of traditional vehicles.\n\nThe company has been testing its robotaxis for more than two years, and recently announced that it has completed over 300,000 autonomous-driving kilometers in China. Baidu also plans to launch its robotaxis in other cities, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, this year.\n\nThe move comes as the Chinese government has sought to boost the development of autonomous-driving technology. Earlier this year, China announced plans to invest US$15 billion (100 billion yuan) in developing and testing autonomous-driving technology over the next five years.\n\n\u201cThe rapid advances in autonomous driving technology have created huge opportunities for the transportation industry and we\u2019re committed to playing our part in making sure China is at the forefront of this revolution,\u201d Baidu CEO Robin Li said in a statement.\n\nThe company said it is currently working with more than 20 automakers to deploy its self-driving vehicles on their vehicle platforms. Baidu has also entered into partnerships with local and international governments to explore ways to further its autonomous-driving initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe are working with companies, municipalities, and countries around the world to bring our autonomous driving technology to cities and countries of all sizes,\u201d Li said.\n\nBaidu\u2019s expansion of its robotaxis is the latest move by a Chinese tech giant to further its involvement in the self-driving space. Earlier this year, tech giant Tencent and automaker Geely announced plans to launch an autonomous vehicle joint venture.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission announced a proposed ban on \u201cno-poaching agreements\u201d between employers, arguing they are a \u201csignificant restraint of trade\u201d that harm workers by reducing wages.\n\nThe move could have far-reaching impacts on companies in the US and help shift the balance of power back to workers, who have become increasingly disadvantaged in the face of expanding corporate power and declining labor unions.\n\nUnder the proposal, companies would no longer be allowed to sign agreements that would prevent their workers from taking jobs at competing companies. The agency estimated that lifting the restrictions could give US workers an additional $300 billion in wages each year.\n\n\u201cFor too long, no-poaching agreements have deprived workers of the freedom to move from job to job, reducing their wages and limiting their career opportunities,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a press release. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action today will help restore competition among employers and provide a critical opportunity for workers to improve their economic prospects.\u201d\n\nThe proposal would prohibit companies of any size from making and enforcing \u201cagreements not to solicit, recruit, hire, or otherwise compete for the services of each other\u2019s employees.\u201d This includes agreements between employers in the same industry, as well as those between companies in related industries.\n\nThe agency estimates that workers in the US currently make up to 10 percent less than they otherwise would have if these restrictive agreements were not in place. In addition, the ban would likely benefit lower-paid workers, as the agency noted that \u201cno-poaching agreements disproportionately harm lower-paid workers, who generally have fewer job options.\u201d\n\nThe proposal will now be subject to a 60-day public comment period before it is formally approved by the FTC. If the ban is passed, companies that violate it could face steep financial penalties, including potential civil litigation.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how effective the FTC\u2019s proposed ban on no-poaching agreements will be in improving wages for US workers. While the agency\u2019s proposal is certainly a step in the right direction, it\u2019s unclear how much of an effect it will have on actual wages. That said, the proposed ban could go a long way toward restoring the balance of power between employers and employees, and the additional $300 billion in wages each year would be a welcome boon for many Americans.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "It was a holiday travel nightmare for Southwest Airlines as hundreds of flights were delayed and thousands of passengers were stranded on tarmacs for hours. But analysts are still predicting that Southwest will remain America's favorite budget airline despite the meltdown.\n\nThe airline, which operates more domestic flights than any other U.S. carrier, hit turbulence in the days after Christmas when flights from busy airports like Los Angeles International, LaGuardia and Dallas-Fort Worth International were canceled. In some instances, passengers were reportedly kept on planes for up to eight hours waiting for take off.\n\nSouthwest is one of the top airlines in the country in terms of customer service and ratings, and in December it was voted America's favorite budget carrier in an online survey. Despite the problems over the holidays, analysts say this isn't likely to change.\n\n\"Southwest has built a loyal customer base that has stuck by the airline for years,\" said George Hobica, founder of airfarewatchdog.com, a website that tracks airline industry trends. \"The problems with the holiday travel meltdown are unlikely to damage their brand long-term.\"\n\nAnalysts point to the airline's customer-friendly policies, such as not charging extra fees for checked bags and its industry-leading 24-hour cancellation policy, as the reasons behind its enduring popularity.\n\n\"Southwest understands the value of customer service,\" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner of Airline Weekly, a publication that covers the industry. \"They are good at customer relations, even when something goes wrong, which is why they have been so successful.\"\n\nSouthwest recently surpassed Delta as the top airline in customer satisfaction in a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.

{"text": "NASA has discovered a fascinating phenomenon: astronauts appear to age more slowly than the rest of us. While this effect only appears to be relevant for very extended stays in space, research is underway to understand the cause of the aging difference and if any similar effects could be recreated here on Earth.\n\nWhen astronaut Scott Kelly went to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2015, he and his twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, embarked on a grand experiment. Over the course of a year, Scott would live on the ISS while scientists on Earth monitored and compared the two brothers\u2019 biology. They were the ideal sample size: They have the same genes and virtually the same environment and lifestyle. \n\nThe results, published in 2019, hinted at a connection between long-term spaceflight and slowed aging.\n\nNow, researchers at the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) are beginning to understand the phenomenon in detail and are trying to figure out what\u2019s causing it. \n\nOne of the most promising theories is that the microgravity environment of space causes a delay in the aging process. On Earth, gravity constantly compresses and pulls on our cells and tissues, which causes wear and tear on our body, leading to aging. But in the microgravity environment of space, this wear and tear doesn\u2019t happen, giving astronauts more time to stay younger. \n\nResearchers are also investigating whether space radiation plays a role in slowing aging. Astronauts in space are exposed to different kinds of radiation, some of which can damage cells and increase the risk of cancer. However, one particular type of radiation may actually have anti-aging benefits by activating cellular repair processes and reducing inflammation. \n\nOther researchers are looking at the psychological benefits of living in space, including reduced stress and improved mental health. These can help protect astronauts from the ravages of aging. \n\nThe researchers are also interested in whether a space diet could have anti-aging benefits. Most astronauts eat pre-packaged, highly-processed food, which may have fewer preservatives and other chemicals than regular Earth-based food. And the lack of Earth\u2019s gravity can affect how food is digested, potentially leading to a more healthy diet that reduces the effects of aging. \n\nDespite the promising research, there\u2019s no guarantee that any of the theories will hold true in the long term. After all, humans have not yet been in space long enough to be sure of the effects of the space environment on the aging process. \n\nFor now, the best way to slow the aging process on Earth is to lead a healthy lifestyle, including eating right and exercising. But understanding how the space environment affects aging could help scientists discover new ways to slow the effects of aging here on Earth.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that space travel could become a viable option for extending our lifespans in the future. If researchers can understand the mechanisms behind the slowed aging effect, astronauts may be able to stay in space for even longer periods of time and enjoy the anti-aging benefits. \n\nNASA and ESA researchers will continue to investigate the aging process in space and look for ways to extend the amount of time astronauts can remain in space. If their work is successful, we could have a better understanding of how to slow the effects of aging for everyone, not just astronauts.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced changes to the packaging of Plan B emergency contraception to clarify that it is not an abortion pill. The packaging change, which was announced on Tuesday, was made in response to an online petition signed by more than 300,000 people that asked for the labeling to be updated to dispel misinformation about the drug's ability to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nThe FDA acknowledged the safety and effectiveness of Plan B in a statement, saying: \u201cPlan B is an FDA-approved contraceptive drug product that can help prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse. The label on the product clearly states that it is not effective in terminating an existing pregnancy.\u201d\n\nPlan B, which is a form of emergency contraception, is typically used within 72 hours of unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy. It is available without a prescription to women and men aged 17 and up, and with a prescription to those aged 16 and under.\n\nThe updated packaging will feature the following message on the front of the box: \u201cPlan B is not an abortion pill.\u201d The message will also be included in the drug's labeling.\n\nThe FDA's statement comes after several studies showed a widespread misunderstanding about what Plan B does. According to the results of a 2015 survey of 1,500 women, 35 percent of those who had used emergency contraception thought it would terminate a pregnancy. A separate survey of 500 women in 2018 found that one in three believed the same.\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Law Center, which filed the petition to the FDA in October of this year, applauded the agency\u2019s decision in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe are thrilled that the FDA has taken swift action to ensure that women can trust that Plan B emergency contraception does not end a pregnancy,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe organization also noted that the labeling change is an important step toward protecting women\u2019s reproductive health. \u201cWomen deserve accurate information about the safety and efficacy of all contraception,\u201d it said.\n\nThe FDA said that the labeling change was made in response to the petition, but also in recognition of the need for reliable and accurate information about Plan B. \u201cWe strive to ensure the accuracy of information about our products to ensure that the American public has access to safe and effective medications,\u201d said the agency.\n\nThe agency said it is continuing to work to ensure that consumers have access to reliable information about all FDA-approved drugs, including Plan B.\n\nThe labeling change comes as the Trump administration is in the process of rolling back Obama-era rules that gave women access to Plan B without a prescription. The Department of Health and Human Services proposed a rule earlier this year that would limit access to emergency contraception for women aged 15 and younger. The rule has not yet been finalized.\n\nWhile the FDA\u2019s decision to update the packaging of Plan B is a welcome step, it is important to remember that access to the drug is still restricted in many states. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 16 states require that a prescription be obtained in order to access Plan B.\n\nIn addition to updating Plan B packaging, the FDA has also recently made changes to the labeling of certain over-the-counter drugs to ensure that consumers have access to accurate information about the products. In September, the agency updated the labeling of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, to include new warnings about the potential for serious kidney problems.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision to update the labeling of Plan B is a welcome move that will help ensure that consumers have access to accurate information about the drug. It is important that all Americans have access to reliable and accurate information about the medicines they are using, and the FDA\u2019s action is a step in the right direction.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "in Iran\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has hinted that the country\u2019s longstanding laws mandating women to wear hijab could be subject to change.\n\nIn a speech broadcast across the nation on Friday, Khamenei said that the country should take a \u201cflexible approach\u201d towards dress codes for women and girls, in the interest of \u201cpreserving Islamic values and Iranian identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important that Iranian women preserve their veil, but they should not be forced to,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cIf we want to promote Islamic values and our Iranian identity, then we should be more flexible in our approach to hijab.\u201d\n\nThe speech comes as Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic is facing growing pressure from international human rights organizations over its compulsory dress codes. Hijab laws in Iran are some of the most restrictive in the world and since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, women have been required to wear a full veil, or hijab, at all times in public.\n\nThe speech is viewed as a sign that Khamenei is pushing for a softer stance on the country\u2019s strict dress codes.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Leader\u2019s message was an acknowledgement of the fact that the country\u2019s mandatory dress codes have become increasingly unpopular,\u201d said Ali Vaez, the Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt was also a signal that he is open to loosening the laws, albeit with caution.\u201d\n\nThe current laws are incredibly restrictive and women have long complained about the lack of flexibility in the laws. Last month, more than 60 Iranian women publicly declared that they would no longer comply with the laws, citing the extreme physical and psychological toll it has taken on them. The gesture was met with a swift and harsh response from the government.\n\nThe government\u2019s hard-line stance on the issue has been further compounded by a growing number of activists who are protesting the hijab laws, calling on the government to repeal them altogether.\n\nThe government is clearly aware of this rising tide of discontent, and Khamenei\u2019s speech was likely an attempt to address this.\n\nKhamenei\u2019s speech was met with a mixed reaction from women\u2019s rights activists. Some are cautiously optimistic about the possibility of greater freedom, while others are concerned that the government is only trying to placate the public and that little real progress will be made.\n\n\u201cThe speech was a positive step in the right direction, but it is too soon to tell how serious the government is about loosening the hijab laws,\u201d said Masoumeh Rastgou, a women\u2019s rights activist in Tehran. \u201cThe government has made similar gestures before, only to backtrack. We need to see concrete steps being taken.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen if Khamenei\u2019s speech will lead to any real changes in the country\u2019s hijab laws. But for now, many women in Iran are cautiously hopeful that the government will finally take meaningful steps to address this long-standing injustice.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In my family, there's ALWAYS drama during the holiday season. And I know I'm not the only one \u2014 recently, I saw a post on the Am I the Asshole subreddit about an unfortunate incident that went down at a woman's Christmas dinner, and I was stunned.\n\nCarrie Bradshaw looking shocked\n\nDarren Star Productions / Via giphy.com\n\nIn case you're unfamiliar with the Am I the Asshole? subreddit, it's a space where people can post about their interpersonal conflicts, to which other users can then respond and determine who the \"asshole\" is in the given situation.\n\nBasically, this woman told a dinner guest they could leave after they made a scene about a box of tampons in the bathroom, and now, she's wondering if she's in the wrong. Here's the full situation, as told by the woman, u/purplegreencarrot\n\n\"I (F28) have been with my boyfriend (M32, Ian) for three years. We\u2019ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (M26).\"\n\nKlaus Vedfelt / Getty Images\n\n\"Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they\u2019ve been together for three months), and we agreed \u2014 the more the merrier. His girlfriend Naveah (F28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8-year-old son (that we didn\u2019t know was coming).\"\n\n10'000 Hours / Getty Images\n\n\"She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom. She came out shrieking with a box of my tampons in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it\u2019s within reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it).\"\n\nMoaimage / Getty Images\n\n\"She was going off about it being disgusting, and how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on. I looked at her in disbelief. I couldn\u2019t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons \u2014 has she never been in a shop?\"\n\nAnna Blazhuk / Getty Images\n\n\"Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are, but if she\u2019s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally \u2014 her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.\"\n\n\"Jake didn\u2019t come back, but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue, but I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through.\"\n\nFrederic Cirou / Getty Images/PhotoAlto\n\n\"Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?\"\n\nI don't know about y'all, but my reaction to that story was something like this:\n\nBritney Spears with her jaw dropped\n\nSyco Entertainment / Via giphy.com\n\nMany redditors came to the woman's defense, and decided that the brother's girlfriend was the asshole, including one person who goes by u/iron_red\n\n\"NTA \u2014 this stranger came to your house and insulted you. She\u2019s hardly a member of the family after three months of dating your boyfriend\u2019s brother,\" they said.\n\n\"If she was genuinely concerned about her child seeing the tampons, then she wouldn\u2019t have walked out waving them in the air and screaming.\"\n\nSomeone else who goes by u/eregyrn gave the woman some advice on how to handle the situation:\n\n\"OP's best course of action at this point is to sit [her boyfriend] down, and explain that she is really not under any obligation to be yelled at and insulted for \u2014 well, for anything in her house, really, but especially not for something so innocuous,\" they reasoned.\n\n\"The guest is NOT always right. There are social expectations of guests and how they should behave, as well. A host does not have to just tolerate any old behavior from a guest, and especially not behavior like that.\"\n\nAnother person with the username u/Doubtful_Desires had an amazing suggestion for OP:\n\n\"Omg invite her to next year's Christmas and have a whole freaking tree done up with tampon ornaments! Petty revenge ftw!\"\n\nAnd finally, someone who goes by u/Echinoderm_only suggested something similar:\n\n\"Wrap her gift in the empty tampon box.\"\n\nSo, there you have it. I really hope this woman follows one of the last two pieces of advice.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The owner of a fancy London hotel is fighting back against short-seller Carson Block\u2019s claims it inflated the value of its properties. It could stage a better defense with cash than with words.\n\nLuxembourg-based group Vivion, which owns German office property and chic hotels like the Sanderson, was accused on Dec. 14 by Block\u2019s firm Muddy Waters of overstating the worth of its real estate, under-reporting vacancy rates and distributing too much cash to shareholders. While Vivion\u2019s equity is unlisted, Muddy Waters was betting against its debt. The price of bonds due in 2024 fell to 72% of face value after Block\u2019s report, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nVivion contends that Muddy Waters has overestimated the number of vacant properties, and that its shareholders have put cash in the company in recent years, not taken it out. Moreover, it claims to have 722 million euros of funds. If so, though, Vivion could always step up its purchase of its own debt at the current low prices. That would show confidence, net a profit and hurt anyone betting against it.

{"text": "Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff told employees in a Slack message on Friday that the company's newest hires aren't being productive enough, and he asked for feedback as to why that's the case.\n\n\"Are we not building tribal knowledge with new employees without an office culture?\" he asked in a message viewed by CNBC. He said he was \"asking for a friend,\" a phrase people often use on the internet to humorously reveal their curiosity about a topic. The message included an emoji showing a smiling face with a halo hovering over it, suggesting innocence.\n\nBenioff's companywide message addresses what's become a hot-button issue in Silicon Valley. Since the arrival of Covid sent workers home almost three years ago, companies have been trying to reimagine a future workplace that allows more employee flexibility than in the past. Some businesses have allowed employees to work from anywhere permanently.\n\nSalesforce, the biggest private employer in San Francisco, was among the first tech companies to tell its workforce they didn't have to come back. Last year, Salesforce acquired communications app Slack, and Benioff said people can work very effectively from their homes. Salesforce said it would let teams decide how much time they would be in office.\n\nBut Benioff may be recognizing some of the challenges remote work presents. On Friday he highlighted an issue that he said was affecting employees who joined Salesforce this year and last. Salesforce's headcount grew by 32% in the past year, and last month it cut hundreds of jobs.\n\nA Salesforce spokesperson declined to comment on Benioff's message but sent a statement on the company's policy.\n\n\"We have a hybrid work environment that empowers leaders and teams to work together with purpose,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"They can decide when and where they come together to collaborate, innovate, and drive customer success.\"\n\nBenioff is contending with slowing revenue growth as the economy weakens, and a thinning of the upper ranks within Salesforce. Last month, the company said Bret Taylor would be stepping down from his position as co-CEO in January. He'd just been promoted to share the top job with Benioff a year earlier. And days later, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield announced his departure.\n\nHere's the full text of Benioff's Slack post:\n\nHow do we increase the productivity of our employees at salesforce? New employees (hired during the pandemic in 2021 & 2022) are especially facing much lower productivity. Is this a reflection of our office policy? Are we not building tribal knowledge with new employees without an office culture? Are our managers not directly addressing productivity with their teams? Are we not investing enough time into our new employees? Do managers focus enough time and energy on onboarding new employees & achieving productivity? is coming as a new employee to salesforce too overwhelming? Asking for a friend. (Im leaving this open ended to get the broadest level of response.)\n\nThe message prompted a variety of comments.\n\nSome reacted with an emoji stating \"THIS\" alongside an up arrow. Others chose emojis that read \"WFH\" or \"citation needed.\" Dozens went with a standard emoji known as thinking face.\n\nBenioff chimed in again in the responses.\n\n\"Asking hard questions of employees (and customers and each other) for their answers is one of the most effective ways to get answers as a leader today,\" he wrote. \"It's why we bought Slack because there is no better way to ask questions and crowd source answers quickly. Already today we have almost 500 replies to these questions \u2014 amazing and incredibly useful!\"\n\nHe was displeased that his message found its way to the press, ultimately ending up on Twitter.\n\n\"I hope you will agree it is also disappointing that our private conversations here were almost immediately given to the public media,\" he wrote. \"I wonder how do we reinforce that Trust is our highest company value? How do we demonstrate the power of Trust and Transparency without an immediate public disclosure. It gets to the heart of who we are at salesforce.\"\n\nHis responses were shared with CNBC.\n\nWATCH: Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff on Bret Taylor's departure from the company", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nBrazil\u2019s former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, emerged from prison a hardened reformer determined to tackle poverty and inequality after serving nearly two years in jail on corruption charges.\n\nThough Lula was released from prison in December, 2019, his time served set him on a path that profoundly reshaped the country\u2019s politics and put the spotlight on Brazil\u2019s extreme wealth disparities.\n\nAfter winning the Workers\u2019 Party (PT) presidential nomination in November 2020, Lula revived Brazil\u2019s progressive spirit and hitched it to his mission of reducing poverty.\n\nHis vow to fight corporate greed and inequality, coupled with his promises of greater economic growth, resonated with the country\u2019s working class.\n\nLula\u2019s relentless advocacy for social justice and the defense of the impoverished has been carried out with a level of energy and determination that has never been seen before in Brazilian politics.\n\nIn his first year in office, Lula pushed a series of measures aimed at tackling poverty, including the provision of free school meals and healthcare access to the poor, as well as cash transfers to the unemployed. \n\nIn addition, he launched a \u201csocial housing\u201d initiative to provide affordable housing to low-income families.\n\nBut Lula\u2019s greatest victory has been his fight against Brazil\u2019s corporate elites.\n\nHe has increased taxes on the wealthy, enacted measures to boost wages for workers, and pushed for greater regulation of big businesses.\n\nThe government has also cracked down on banks and other financial institutions that have been accused of exploiting the country\u2019s poor.\n\nIn short, Lula has been able to make sweeping changes to Brazil\u2019s social and economic landscape.\n\nAnalysts attribute his success to a fierce determination to tackle poverty and inequality, as well as a willingness to embrace innovative solutions to address Brazil\u2019s economic woes.\n\nIt is an agenda that is both pragmatic and progressive, and one that has not been seen in Brazil since the era of the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d under the leadership of Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the 1990s.\n\nIn his first year in office, Lula has been able to move Brazil\u2019s economy out of recession and restore its lost dignity.\n\nBut it is too early to tell whether Lula will be able to sustain these positive gains in the long run.\n\nThere are many challenges still to be overcome, including political infighting and economic pressures.\n\nNevertheless, Lula\u2019s story stands as a testament to the power of conviction and the potential of a single individual to achieve meaningful change in a country struggling with entrenched corruption and inequality.\n\nThe former president\u2019s determination to fight for social justice and the defense of the impoverished has earned him a place in history, and his legacy of reform and progress will be felt for years to come.", "label": "machine"}

Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce are among those that have made similar changes. HP, for its part, is responding to a deterioration in computer sales. At first the Covid pandemic brought a PC buying frenzy as people rushed to work and play from their homes.

{"text": "It\u2019s no secret that the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest diets available. It\u2019s high in lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and whole grains. It has been linked to improved health and longevity, reduced risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer, and improved cognitive function. It\u2019s not a fad diet\u2014it\u2019s a diet that\u2019s been around for centuries, and it\u2019s been proven to have a wide range of health benefits. So, it\u2019s no wonder why it has once again been named the No. 1 best diet for 2023 by US News & World Report.\n\nNow that you know the diet is the best of the best, here\u2019s what you need to know about following a Mediterranean diet:\n\nDO: Eat mostly plant-based foods\n\nA key component of the Mediterranean diet is a focus on plant-based foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. This includes items like olive oil, avocados, and nuts, as well as foods that are packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Eating a variety of these foods each day will provide your body with essential nutrients, help control your weight, and protect you from chronic diseases.\n\nDON\u2019T: Forget about protein\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the Mediterranean diet is largely plant-based, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to go without animal proteins. Lean meats like chicken, fish, and turkey are all part of a healthy Mediterranean diet. Lean meats are a great source of protein, which can help keep your body strong, boost your energy levels, and maintain healthy blood sugar levels.\n\nDO: Eat healthy fats\n\nWhen it comes to fats, the Mediterranean diet focuses on healthy fats like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. These healthy fats can help you feel fuller for longer, as well as provide your body with essential fatty acids. Healthy fats are also important for proper heart, brain, and joint health.\n\nDON\u2019T: Eat processed foods\n\nProcessed foods are high in calories and low in nutrients, and they\u2019re not part of a healthy Mediterranean diet. Processed foods include items like white bread, refined grains, snack foods, candy, and soda. These are all foods that should be avoided when following a Mediterranean diet.\n\nDO: Enjoy moderate amounts of dairy\n\nModerate amounts of dairy are also part of a healthy Mediterranean diet. Dairy products are a great source of protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients. Look for low-fat or fat-free options like yogurt, cheese, and skim milk.\n\nDON\u2019T: Forget about exercise\n\nAlthough a healthy diet is important for maintaining a healthy weight, exercise is just as important. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or strength-training. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight, improve your heart health, and boost your mood.\n\nBy following these do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, you can enjoy the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet without compromising on taste or nutrition. With its focus on healthy proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, the Mediterranean diet is an excellent choice for those looking to improve their health and well-being in 2023.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Lyft CEO Logan Green (R) and President John Zimmer (2nd R) speak before the Nasdaq opening bell celebrating the company's initial public offering (IPO) on March 29, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nLyft said Thursday it's cutting 13% of its workforce, impacting all teams.\n\nIn an email to employees obtained by CNBC, CEO Logan Green and President John Zimmer pointed to what they called \"a probable recession sometime in the next year\" and rising rideshare insurance costs. But Lyft is not currently changing the guidance it gave last quarter.\n\nShares of Lyft were slightly negative Thursday. Shares have fallen almost 68% year-to-date, bringing its market cap under $5 billion.\n\nLyft said it has just over 5,000 employees.\n\nGreen and Zimmer said in the email that the layoffs \"were based on deprioritized initiatives, an effort to reduce management layers, broader savings goals, and, in some cases, performance trajectory.\"\n\nFor laid-off workers, Lyft promised ten weeks of pay, healthcare coverage through the end of April, accelerated equity vesting for the Nov. 20 vesting date and recruiting assistance. Workers who had been there for more than four years will get an extra four weeks of pay, they added.\n\nLyft is not the only tech company to announce cuts or a hiring freeze recently. Netflix, Spotify, Coinbase, Shopify and most recently payments company Stripe have announced layoffs. And Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta have also taken measures to bring their expenses in check.\n\n\"We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,\" Green and Zimmer wrote. \"We need 2023 to be a period where we can better execute without having to change plans in response to external events \u2014 and the tough reality is that today's actions set us up to do that.\"\n\nHere's the full email from Green and Zimmer:\n\nTeam, We just sent an invitation for everyone to join us for an all-hands at 11:00 am PT to share some tough news. Despite efforts to avoid this day, we've made the difficult decision to lay off 13% of the team. Additionally, we are pursuing a divestiture (sale) of our first-party vehicle service business, and in that case we do expect most of those team members will be offered roles from the acquiring company. We know today will be hard. To help provide initial context, we want to share how we made this decision, how we're supporting departing team members, and what to expect over the coming days. What's happening There are several challenges playing out across the economy. We're facing a probable recession sometime in the next year and rideshare insurance costs are going up. We worked hard to bring down costs this summer: we slowed, then froze hiring; cut spending; and paused less-critical initiatives. Still, Lyft has to become leaner, which requires us to part with incredible team members. The layoffs impact every organization in the company, and were based on deprioritized initiatives, an effort to reduce management layers, broader savings goals, and, in some cases, performance trajectory. We are confident in the overall trajectory of the business. It was important to take these proactive actions to ensure we can accelerate execution, stay focused on the best opportunities to drive profitable growth, and deliver strong business results in 2023 and beyond. Support for departing team members We understand the real impact this decision has on departing team members. Lyft will offer support to departing team members: \u00b7 10 weeks of pay. \u00b7 Healthcare coverage through April 30, 2023, including access to Modern Health. \u00b7 Accelerated equity vesting for the November 20 vesting date. \u00b7 Recruiting assistance, including coaching sessions on resumes and interviews. Team members with 4+ years with Lyft will receive an additional four weeks of pay. Moving forward Our priority today is taking care of departing team members, who for many of us are also friends. To those team members, although we know no words are sufficient, thank you for everything you have done for the Lyft community, mission, and business. We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy. We need 2023 to be a period where we can better execute without having to change plans in response to external events \u2014 and the tough reality is that today's actions set us up to do that. It's our responsibility to take ownership of these decisions and, in the end, protect the future we're building for the drivers and riders we serve.

{"text": "AMD announced today that it has identified the cause of an unexpected thermal issue on its recently-released Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards.\n\nThe problem was first reported by users on Reddit last week, when many users suddenly noticed that their cards had started running hot under gaming conditions and were reaching temperatures of up to 85 degrees Celsius (185 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nAMD quickly issued a statement, saying that it was aware of the issue and was working to investigate it. After taking input from users who had encountered the issue, AMD began to identify the issue, and today they were able to announce that the root cause is not enough water flow in the card.\n\nIn a statement on the official AMD forums, the company said that a \u201cthermal issue has been identified on some AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards due to an insufficient cooling system water flow.\u201d\n\nAMD went on to explain that, in their investigation, they had identified that \u201ca small number\u201d of the cards were running too hot due to too little water being available for the heatsink, which was resulting in temperatures that were higher than intended.\n\nAMD has acknowledged that the cause of the issue was \u201cnot with the product itself\u201d, but with \u201cthe setup provided by certain partners\u201d.\n\nTo fix the issue, AMD has said that users should ensure that their water cooling system is running optimally, with adequate water flow and coolant temperature.\n\nThe company has also offered to provide a replacement water cooling system to any customer who has purchased an affected Radeon RX 7900 XTX card.\n\nAMD has not yet revealed the identity of any affected partners, but the company has said that the issue only affects a \u201csmall\u201d number of users, so those with Radeon RX 7900 XTX cards should be mostly unaffected.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unfortunate that this issue had to be addressed so soon after launch, it\u2019s reassuring to see that AMD is taking action to ensure that any affected users are not left with a suboptimal experience.\n\nThe company has also said that it will continue to investigate the issue and work with partners to identify and address any similar thermal issues.\n\nWe hope that any affected users can quickly get their cards running optimally again and that AMD can resolve this issue quickly and efficiently.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBringing vibrant energy to the translation from book to musical to screen, \u201cRoald Dahl\u2019s Matilda the Musical\u201d lands on Netflix as a rewarding example of the perilous practice of building such efforts around children. Of course, it helps that the young star, Alisha Weir, is terrific, aided by wonderful turns from Emma Thompson and Lashana Lynch, extending what have already been good years for both.\n\nDahl\u2019s story about a little girl with absentee parents and unusual powers, sent to a boarding school run by the abusive, kid-hating Miss Trunchbull (Thompson, under a version of super-villain makeup), is certainly dark, even by the author\u2019s standards. But as adapted for the stage by Tim Minchin, who wrote the songs, and directed here by Matthew Warchus, who has nicely opened up the staging in cinematic fashion, it\u2019s a polished and fun alternative to less attractive holiday activities, like dealing with your family.\n\nPerhaps the silliest controversy involved questions about Thompson donning a \u201cfat suit,\u201d when her Trunchbull makeover is as much about making her fearsome and imposing \u2013 befitting the character\u2019s glory days as an Olympic athlete \u2013 as her girth.\n\nLest anyone forget, Thompson also previously buried herself under unflattering prosthetics in \u201cNanny McPhee,\u201d and lustily portrayed a villain in Disney\u2019s \u201cCruella.\u201d In a year when she\u2019s already delivered a standout performance in the low-key Hulu movie \u201cGood Luck to You, Leo Grande,\u201d her scene-stealing exploits offer a reminder of just how delicious she can be when cutting loose in this fashion.\n\nEmma Thompson, as Miss Trunchbull, and Alisha Weir in \"Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical.\" Dan Smith/Netflix\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a school. It\u2019s a prison,\u201d Matilda is told when she arrives at Crunchem Hall, a foreboding establishment where the cruel headmistress sees her mandate as crushing kids, not educating them. Fortunately, the girl wins over friends with her defiant attitude and finds an adult ally in Miss Honey (Lynch, the mousy antithesis of her \u201cThe Woman King\u201d role), who immediately recognizes that Matilda is special.\n\nThe song and dance numbers take full advantage of the wider template that movies allow, with kids leaping in every direction on the centerpieces \u201cRevolting Children\u201d and \u201cMiracle,\u201d as well as the more soulful \u201cWhen I Grow Up.\u201d\n\nTo call \u201cMatilda\u201d \u201cmiraculous\u201d would be taking things too far, but the movie joins a long tradition of kid-centric musicals (invariably turned into fodder for school plays), from \u201cOliver!\u201d to \u201cAnnie,\u201d in a way that nicely bridges the gap between the 1996 movie and this music-infused take.\n\n\u201cMom says I\u2019m a good case for population control,\u201d the mistreated Matilda sings early on.\n\nWhile the ranks of musicals brought to the screen probably does merit some family planning, \u201cMatilda the Musical\u201d offers a sprightly demonstration that there\u2019s always room for another good one.\n\n\u201cMatilda the Musical\u201d premieres December 25 on Netflix.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Jim Cramer has been calling the shots on Wall Street for decades, but it appears he's still got plenty of tricks up his sleeve.\n\nThe Mad Money host gave his blessing to communication services stocks this week during a CNBC interview. The sector, which includes companies like Facebook, Google and Netflix, has been a Wall Street darling over the last few years.\n\nBut Cramer isn't the only one who sees value in these stocks. Market analysts have argued that communication services stocks offer a unique combination of growth and safety, making them an attractive long-term buy.\n\nHere are three communication services stocks that Jim Cramer has personally endorsed for the upcoming year:\n\n1. Google (GOOGL)\n\nGoogle has been one of the most successful stocks of the past decade, and it has enjoyed an even more impressive ride since its parent company, Alphabet, went public in 2014. Google's stock has gained more than 63% since its IPO, and the company has consistently posted impressive revenues and profits quarter after quarter.\n\nCramer has long praised Google for its ability to make money in multiple ways, from search advertising to the sale of content and hardware. He believes the company is well-positioned to continue its strong performance, and he recently upgraded it to a Buy rating on his Mad Money show.\n\n2. Apple (AAPL)\n\nAnother stock that Cramer has frequently praised is Apple, the world's most valuable company. Apple has been one of the most reliable performers in the tech sector, and its stock has gained almost 800% since its IPO in 1980.\n\nCramer sees Apple as a safe bet for the long term, thanks to the company's massive cash hoard, strong brand loyalty and potential for continued innovation. Apple's upcoming 5G iPhone launch could provide a significant boost to the company's growth, and Cramer expects the stock to continue its upward trend.\n\n3. Netflix (NFLX)\n\nNetflix is one of the most successful growth stocks of the past decade, and it has gained more than 600% since it went public in 2002. The company is one of the leaders in the streaming video market, and it has been able to rapidly expand its user base and offer a wide variety of content.\n\nCramer believes that Netflix is well-positioned to continue its impressive growth, and he recently recommended the stock on his show. Netflix is expanding into new markets and developing more exclusive content, and Cramer believes that the stock could double in the next few years.\n\nThese three stocks have been recommended by Jim Cramer and other Wall Street analysts for the upcoming year. All three companies offer impressive growth potential and a unique combination of safety and returns. With all this in mind, investors may want to take a closer look at these communication services stocks before making any investing decisions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "McDonald's and KFC, two of the largest fast-food chains in the world, have pulled out of Russia following a military incursion into Ukraine by Vladimir Putin's government.\n\nThe companies, part of Yum Brands, which also owns Taco Bell, announced their exit from the region on Thursday following a week of hostilities between the two nations.\n\nThe two U.S.-based companies had been operating in the region since the 1990s, with both chains proving popular with locals. But after Putin's government ordered forces into eastern Ukraine, the companies said they no longer felt comfortable operating in the region.\n\nIn a joint statement, the companies said:\n\n\"In light of the current situation in Ukraine, we have decided to close our restaurants in Russia. We are making every effort to support our staff in this difficult time and will be providing them with appropriate assistance as needed.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"We recognize the importance of serving customers in Russia, but the safety of our staff and customers is our priority and we believe that this is the right decision for the moment.\"\n\nThe move is the latest example of how businesses, particularly those based in the United States, are being forced to reconsider their presence in Russia.\n\nIn the wake of the crisis, many other companies have taken similar steps. For example, the French hotel chain Accor, which operates the Ibis chain of hotels, recently said it would suspend its operations in the region.\n\nBut while McDonald's and KFC are leaving, one U.S.-based fast-food chain is still operating in Russia \u2014 Domino's Pizza.\n\nDomino's, which has been in the region since 2010, operates over 200 stores in the country and is one of the largest pizza chains in Russia.\n\nIt has not yet announced any plans to leave the region, but it is unclear if the company will be able to continue operating if the situation in the region continues to worsen.\n\nDomino's did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt's not just fast-food chains that have felt the fallout from the conflict. Many other companies are reconsidering their operations in the region, too.\n\nGoogle, for example, recently announced it was pulling its YouTube service from Russia in response to increasing censorship in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Visa and MasterCard have suspended their processing of payments in the region due to sanctions imposed by the U.S.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate, it seems likely that other companies could follow McDonald's and KFC and exit the region. \n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to the remaining companies operating in the region, including Domino's, but the current situation is making the future uncertain.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges have been experiencing dramatic shifts in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fall of derivatives exchange FTX has caused industry consolidation and led to the emergence of a single leader, Binance, which now accounts for two-thirds of all centralized crypto trading volumes.\n\nThe cryptocurrency trading landscape has been in flux since late last year. FTX, a high-profile derivatives exchange, launched in April 2020 and quickly gathered a large customer base. But in late October 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought a lawsuit against FTX, alleging violations of securities laws. This led to a sell-off in FTX's stock and the closure of the exchange in December 2022.\n\nThe departure of FTX from the crypto markets marked a significant shift in the competitive landscape. Exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken moved quickly to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the sudden void in the crypto markets, launching new products and competing for market share.\n\nThe surge in demand for cryptocurrency services caused a massive spike in trading volumes on centralized exchanges. According to the latest figures from CryptoCompare, total crypto exchange volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 hit $286 billion, up 125% from the previous quarter and 254% higher than the previous year.\n\nAs exchanges jockeyed for position, Binance emerged as the clear leader. The world's largest crypto exchange by trade volume captured 66% of total trading activity in the fourth quarter of 2022, a substantial increase from its average of 57% in the third quarter. Binance's total trading volume jumped by a staggering 144%, to $191 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nIn second place was Coinbase Pro, which grabbed a 12.2% market share of trading volumes, up from 8.3% in the previous quarter. Coinbase was followed by Kraken, Huobi Global, and OKEx, which rounded out the top five exchanges.\n\nThe surge in volumes has given Binance an unassailable lead in the crypto markets, with the exchange now accounting for nearly a third of all crypto trading activity.\n\nThe rise of Binance has been aided by its aggressive expansion efforts. Over the course of the fourth quarter of 2022, the exchange introduced new products, including perpetual futures, options, and credit cards, as well as rolling out new crypto pairs and coins. Binance also attracted more institutional investors and enabled them to access more markets.\n\nThe consolidation of the crypto markets following the fall of FTX has also been a major boon to Binance. By providing a reliable, secure, and well-regulated exchange, Binance has become the go-to choice for a wide range of users.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Binance's dominance of the crypto markets will persist into the coming year. Other exchanges are likely to make aggressive moves to challenge Binance's lead, but the exchange has a strong position and an impressive record of success. Time will tell if Binance can maintain its position as the crypto kingpin of the future.", "label": "machine"}

He was 90.\n\nNASA spokesman Bob Jacobs confirmed Cunningham\u2019s death to The Associated Press but did not immediately provide further details. Cunningham\u2019s wife, Dot Cunningham, said in a statement that he died Tuesday but did not say where or provide a cause of death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCunningham was one of three astronauts aboard the 1968 Apollo 7 mission, an 11-day spaceflight that beamed live television broadcasts as they orbited Earth, paving the way for the moon landing less than a year later.\n\nCunningham, then a civilian, crewed the mission with Navy Capt. Walter M. Schirra and Donn F. Eisele, an Air Force major. Cunningham was the lunar module pilot on the space flight, which launched from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, on Oct. 11 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda.\n\nNASA said Cunningham, Eisele and Schirra\u2019 flew a near perfect mission. Their spacecraft performed so well that the agency sent the next crew, Apollo 8, to orbit the moon as a prelude to the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969.\n\nThe Apollo 7 astronauts also won a special Emmy award for their daily television reports from orbit, during which they clowned around, held up humorous signs and educated earthlings about space flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was NASA\u2019s first crewed space mission since the deaths of the three Apollo 1 astronauts in a launch pad fire Jan. 27, 1967.\n\nCunningham recalled Apollo 7 during a 2017 event at the Kennedy Space Center, saying it \u201cenabled us to overcome all the obstacles we had after the Apollo 1 fire and it became the longest, most successful test flight of any flying machine ever.\u201d\n\nCunningham was born in Creston, Iowa, and attended high school in California before enlisting with the Navy in 1951 and serving as a Marine Corps. pilot in Korea, according to NASA. He later obtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in physics from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he also did doctoral studies, and worked as scientist for the Rand Corporation before joining NASA.\n\nIn an interview the year before his death, Cunningham recalled growing up poor and dreaming of flying airplanes, not spacecraft.\n\n\u201cWe never even knew that there were astronauts when I was growing up,\u201d Cunningham told The Spokesman-Review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter NASA, Cunningham went on to work in engineering, business and investing, and became a public speaker and radio host.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThroughout the bitter winter, during rain and snow, Jon Vaughn has alternated between sleeping in a tent or a campervan outside former University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel\u2019s house.\n\nA former University of Michigan and NFL football player, Vaughn is one of more than 1,000 people \u2014 mostly men \u2013 who says they were abused by athletics doctor Robert Anderson, who worked for the university from 1966 to 2003 treating students across sports including football, track, and wrestling.\n\nAnderson, who died in 2008, subjected students, 90% of whom were men, to \u201csexually abusive conduct\u201d and invasive exams, including unnecessary genital and rectal examinations, according to a 2021 independent report commissioned by the university. Many of Anderson\u2019s victims were Black \u2013 and survivors say this has played a part in why the abuse was allowed to continue for decades.\n\nIn his roles at the university, including director of its health service, team physician for the athletic department and a clinical instructor at the university\u2019s medical school, Anderson abused men and women from different racial backgrounds, undergraduate and graduate students, student athletes \u2013 including a two-time Super Bowl champion and former world-class wrestler \u2013 and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, the report found.\n\nThe university missed numerous opportunities to stop him over his 37 year long career, it concluded.\n\nThis month the university announced a $490 million settlement with over a thousand victims of Anderson\u2019s alleged sexual abuse, pending approval by the Michigan Board of Regents and the claimants.\n\nDr. Robert E. Anderson worked for the University of Michigan from 1966 to 2003. He died in 2008. Robert Kalmbach/Bentley Historical Library University of Michigan/AP\n\nBut despite the settlement, the University is still facing calls to take responsibility for its role in the abuse, which spanned more than three decades \u2013 as well as the university\u2019s failures to address alleged present day sexual misconduct and abuse by and of students and university staff.\n\nVictims say that despite knowledge of Dr. Anderson\u2019s predatory behavior, U of M failed to take any action, and instead chose to continue enabling Dr. Anderson\u2019s abuse of vulnerable young men until his voluntary retirement in 2003.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve shown that over the last half century\u2026 [they\u2019re] uninterested in student safety as a priority,\u201d Vaughn, who played for U of M from 1988 to 1990 said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve shown the inability to police themselves on a consistent basis, as pertains to sexual assault,\u201d he said.\n\nSchlissel \u2013 who was fired this month from his position as President following an anonymous complaint suggesting that he \u201cmay have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee\u201d \u2013 has apologized for Anderson\u2019s \u201ctragic misconduct,\u201d and said in a statement that the university is committed to resolving victims\u2019 claims.\n\nBut Vaughn, 51, who was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and has been protesting for more than 100 days says he will continue to sleep outside the university president\u2019s house until the University of Michigan addresses historic and alleged present day abuse, after realizing how \u201cacute\u201d issues of sexual assault, violence and rape are on campus.\n\nVaughn is also one of many involved in hundreds of individual lawsuits and a class-action lawsuits filed against the University and the Board of Regents by survivors.\n\nBlack men treated differently\n\nThe allegations against Anderson mirror those against disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar at Michigan State University and Richard Strauss at Ohio State University. They too were doctors who abused their trusted positions to sexually exploit college students and athletes.\n\nWith more than a thousand people \u2013 mostly men \u2013 coming forward to say they were abused by Anderson, attorneys representing the victims say it may be the largest case of sex abuse by a single person in the US. The scale of the alleged abuse surpasses that at Michigan State, Ohio State, and similar incidents at other US universities.\n\nBut the case has received nowhere near as much media coverage as that of the abuse of Nassar.\n\nA disproportionate number of the victims are African American, Vaughn told CNN.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the world right now is ready to complete that spectrum of the face of abuse and include African-American men,\u201d Vaughn told CNN.\n\nAttorney Mike Cox, who is representing 174 victims in confidential federal court mediation with the University of Michigan told CNN that some 40% of the 1000 Anderson victims are African American men.\n\n\u201cWe have not done a formal analysis because all are victims and viewed equally in that sense. But clearly the amount of African American victim survivors is much, much higher than their numbers in American society,\u201d Cox told CNN over email.\n\nBlack Americans represent just 13.4% of the American population.\n\nThe percentage of African American survivors is also \u201cdramatically higher\u201d than their percentages as part of the UM student base, Cox said.\n\nThe University of Michigan agreed to work toward a goal of 10% African American enrollment by 1973, but did not reach this goal: Black student enrollment had declined by 1987 to 5.3% of the student body from the high of 7.7% in 1976 and never reached the 10% goal targeted by administrators in the early \u201970\u2019s.\n\nFrom the 1980s until 1996, there was a 10% increase in African American student enrollment. However, efforts to increase African American enrollment to reflect the Michigan state\u2019s 14% Black population have been unsuccessful, according to the university.\n\nVaughn said it took years for him to even recognize what had happened to him as abuse, and that in communities of color, \u201cfor men to even discuss their abuse is seen as a weakness. In those communities, you\u2019re forced to be tough and strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting to have a voice, just typically in this country, for over 400 years, we\u2019re constantly and have historically been marginalized, or dehumanized in so many ways. So I really think those two factors create this perfect storm,\u201d he said.\n\nJon Vaughn says he will continue his protest at the university.

This case is overlooked in part because of that,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u201cI think our society looks down on men who are sexually abused, let alone big, strong, athletic, Black men who are sexually abused, compared to female survivors of abuse,\u201d Stinar added. \u201cBecause they have this societal influence that asks men: How can they allow themselves to be sexually abused?\u201d\n\nRebecca Wanzo, professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Washington University, St. Louis, told CNN that race plays a significant part in whether or how violence and abuse is reported by the media.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have someone who\u2019s the face of something that they [the media] put forward, or seems like an ideal victim that people want to tell a story about, historically, that is something that can really affect the ability of a story to travel,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis, she said, is often an issue when it comes to reporting issues like sexual abuse and murder.\n\n\u201cSystemic violence often tends to get less attention, which is why violence against people of color, systemic violence in general, in terms of class and other factors, isn\u2019t reported,\u201d she said.\n\nRacist stereotypes\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a language to talk about Black as rapeable in the US, because the racist stereotypes of Black men as the rapist and as violent stops us from looking at data that\u2019s been collected by the CDC for the last decade,\u201d Tommy Curry, professor of philosophy and personal Chair of Africana Philosophy and Black Male Studies at The University of Edinburgh told CNN.\n\nNearly 1 in 5 (19.4%) non-Hispanic Black men have experienced contact sexual violence \u2013 which includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual contact \u2013 in their lifetime, according to the CDC\u2019s National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010-2012, which is the latest published data broken out by race or ethnicity.\n\nSocial psychology data shows \u201cBlack men are always perceived as being taller, more aggressive, or violent, more prone to conflict, more athletic than they actually are,\u201d Curry said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s those social perceptions that have been linked to forms of dehumanization \u2013 likening them to apes, sorts of primal beasts and animals \u2013 that fit into how we think of Black men, both as athletes and as kind of super predators, as superhuman.\u201d\n\nAttendees add their signatures to a board in support of survivors of sexual abuse at a vigil outside the home of outgoing University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel October 13, 2021 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nFormer gymnast Trinea Gonczar, who testified against Larry Nassar, told CNN that in her work supporting victims of sexual abuse, she has learned \u201cthat most men, no matter what, if they\u2019ve been assaulted, they won\u2019t report based on more shame.\u201d\n\nNassar, the longtime doctor for the USA Gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges, and was also sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.\n\nGonczar has been spending time with Vaughn in his protest to show solidarity with abuse survivors at the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cIn my case, as a privileged woman, my perpetrator is in jail, we received a settlement. I\u2019m White, and I come from an expensive, per se, sport: you have to have money to have to be in that sport,\u201d Gonczar said.\n\nGonczar now works as director of development at the Avalon Healing Center, which provides support for victims of sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to learn that I am a privileged, White person, and all abuse is not the same,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are several reasons why Black men choose not to report abuse, Curry told CNN.\n\n\u201cWe know from interviews with Black male victims that it\u2019s not only the pressures of not being believed \u2013 but it\u2019s also being perceived as the aggressor,\u201d he explained.\n\nCurry said that his research had shown that in domestic violence cases, Black men would stay in situations of abuse, or they would not report victimization.\n\n\u201cThey fear that the police or the criminal justice system or society is going to view them as the perpetrator and they\u2019ll be criminalized even harsher than the kinds of abuse and violence that they suffer,\u201d Curry said.\n\nWhen Black men report that they have been victimized by others, \u201cdifferent stereotypes activate\u201d, Curry added.\n\n\u201cA lot of racists would say, \u2018No, he was really the aggressor, he tried to rape me, I wouldn\u2019t rape a man. It wasn\u2019t me. This person was violent or aggressive, or he\u2019s a drug dealer, a thief.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll these racial stereotypes are utilized to undercut the credibility of Black men who are victims in ways that other groups don\u2019t have to deal with,\u201d he said.\n\nConditions that enable abuse\n\nAttorney Stephen Estey told CNN that Anderson was easily able to take advantage of his victims. \u201cSome of these men, they came from the inner city [which had] not the best healthcare in the back of the day,\u201d Estey, who represents some 80 survivors, said.\n\n\u201cSome of them never had a physical [examination], and so they didn\u2019t know what a physical should have been. And Dr. Anderson would tell them, if you want to play football, it\u2019s part of the process,\u201d Estey told CNN.\n\nWanzo said that a nationwide commitment to protecting athletic programs \u201cparticularly makes Black people vulnerable in the US because they are disproportionately often in some of these programs.\u201d\n\nAnderson first served as a University Health Services doctor and was moved to the Athletic Department in 1981 after \u201ccredible reports of misconduct\u201d were relayed to the then Assistant Vice President of Student Services Thomas Easthope in late 1978 or 1979, according to the WilmerHale report.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they switched him out of general care to the athletic program as if they [athletes] were sort of disposable people says a lot about how the institution thought about how to deal with the problem person: they value athletics as institution, but the people who participate in athletics and make some money are disposable.\u201d\n\nVaughn told CNN that there are a \u201cnumber of dynamics\u201d aside from race that help perpetuate \u201cthis culture of abuse in sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is the athlete\u2019s dedication to this specific sport, and the overwhelming trust that they tend to have in their coaches and trainers because of the focus that it takes to be successful in sport,\u201d Vaughn said.\n\nCoaches and medical staff are often the most powerful people in a child and student athlete\u2019s life, he added.\n\nIf sports create the perfect conditions for abuse, then institutions are failing to regulate themselves, survivors say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the institutions that are protecting their brands, and the position that they hold within that sport, because they really want that sport to be a catalyst for their financial gain instead of taking concern about their sports doctors who are actually predators,\u201d Gonczar, a gymnast who was treated by Nassar for 15 years, and who estimates that she was molested some 856 times, said.\n\nA number of the women said they had reported Nassar\u2019s abuse previously but that the systems of authority, including USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Michigan State University, did not take their concerns seriously.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not enough has changed,\u201d Gonczar said.\n\n\u201cIn the US it\u2019s taking so long to just simply get these big institutions to be aware and to be willing to be accountable and transparent, and to have people in the leadership roles that are willing to facilitate that,\u201d Gonczar warned.\n\nCampus abuse between students ongoing issue\n\nThe University of Michigan finalized a new sexual and gender based misconduct policy in September, but critics say abuse and assault between students and by university staff still isn\u2019t being dealt with well enough.\n\nVaughn said that since he has been protesting, he has been approached by students who have told him of their own experiences of sexual assault and abuse at the university.\n\nThere were 157 allegations of sexual assault reported to the University\u2019s Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, according to its yearly report.\n\nThe University\u2019s Division of Public Safety and Security, which records incidents reported to the DPSS, law enforcement agencies and campus security authorities, described 18 on campus rapes and 31 reports of fondling not associated with Anderson in 2020.\n\nSome 106 reports of sexual assault were made to the University\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC) in 2020, down from 151 in 2019 and 168 in 2018.\n\nVaughn says he has spoken to students who feel harrassment is still a problem at the university. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nThere were 77 reported instances of sexual harassment and 57 reports of stalking, according to the University\u2019s Division of Public Safety and Security, which provided the data as \u201cadditional information regarding crime reports on campus.\u201d\n\nCampus enrollment in 2019 stood at 48,090 students, and 47,907 enrolled in 2020.\n\n\u201cAll the reporting agencies within the university have essentially failed all the students and all the student athletes, because they\u2019ve done nothing to support in any consistent manner, or protect in any consistent manner,\u201d Vaughn said.\n\n\u201cProfessors have said if you support or even help report a student\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s like a career suicide,\u201d he added.\n\nSome 42.4 percent of Michigan students said they had experienced at least one type of harassing behavior since entering school, and more than a quarter (26.9 percent) of undergraduate women reported nonconsensual sexual contact, according to a campus climate survey regarding sexual misconduct.\n\nOut of women who say they experienced harassment, 8.9 percent of Michigan undergraduates reported the person was a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker compared to an average of 4.8 percent of undergraduates and across the 33 schools surveyed in the overall survey, which looked at responses from a total of 181,752 students from 33 colleges and universities.\n\nSome 31.8 percent of graduate or professional Michigan students reported their harasser to be a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker, compared to an average 16.5 percent in the overall survey.\n\nVaughn has slept in a tent and later, a trailer, to protest at the University over issues of sexual abuse and assault. Courtesy Jon Vaughn\n\nVaughn has been protesting through harsh conditions at the University of Michigan. Courtesy Jon Vaughn\n\nThe overall survey found that the 33 schools surveyed, more than half of undergraduate women (59.2%) and transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary students (65.1%) reported experiencing at least one harassing behavior.\n\n\u201cI speak to a lot of students, many of them feel like with the assaults that have happened to them, that the university has not been able to deal with it properly,\u201d Charlie Kolean, chairman of Michigan Students Against Sexual Assault told CNN.\n\n\u201cTypically, a case will not be criminally referred. And additionally, a lot of survivors from assault, they don\u2019t want to go through the university\u2019s process reporting the assault, because it is fairly arduous,\u201d he added.\n\nEmma Sandberg, a former student and founder of activism group Roe v. Rape told CNN: \u201cOverall, it is very difficult to be a survivor at U of M. The sexual assault prevention center doesn\u2019t provide any real resources, university leadership has engaged in sexual misconduct themselves, and those who go through the all-consuming Title IX process are traumatized by it and rarely receive justice, support, or validation.\n\n\u201cWe need a supportive center for survivors, not just a preventative one, and we need more effective prevention methods at all levels,\u201d Sandberg, who graduated in in 2021, said.\n\nIn addition to Anderson, at least five current and former university professors and officials have faced accusations of sexual harassment or abuse in the last few years.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Rick Fitzgerald, associate vice president of Public Affairs and Internal Communications at the University of Michigan said: \u201cWe encourage every incident of misconduct to be reported and we take action,\u201d pointing towards the university\u2019s annual report for further details.\n\n\u201cSAPAC has a 30-year history of supporting and advocating for survivors of sexual misconduct, through a range of supportive services, based on individual needs,\u201d he said, pointing towards the university\u2019s confidential resources for students and staff.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe University of Michigan always has taken sexual misconduct seriously and we have been increasing our efforts steadily,\u201d and that a Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center has been on campus for almost 40 years.\n\nFitzgerald added that any case that involves criminal behavior is \u201cfirst turned over to police and the ECRT investigation is put on hold so that criminal activity can always be addressed first.\u201d\n\nVaughn wants the university to overhaul its approach to misconduct.\n\n\u201cYou cannot only celebrate parts of your history, you must deal with your entire history in order to root it out and change that culture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause the longer you ignore it, the more you perpetuate it and the more it empowers other predators, because they\u2019re watching the lack of discipline, or consequences for serial predators and rapists that then gives others the green light to make those decisions and prey on young men and young women.\u201d\n\nCo-lead class counsel attorney E. Powell Miller told CNN his team is seeking \u201cclass action relief for reforms, policies and procedures to prevent an Anderson problem from occurring again.\u201d\n\nAttorney Jonathan Selbin, co-lead class counsel in a class action suit against the University, told CNN: \u201cWhile paying money to the victims is a critical first step, U of M must also commit to system-wide changes that bring all of the stakeholders together to reform the campus and institutional culture and prevent abuses like this from ever occurring again.\u201d\n\nVaughn wants the university to create programs that empower students to report instances of sexual violence, and strengthen mechanisms to protect students.\n\nLast July, the university announced revisions to how it will address sexual misconduct, including the creation of a new office with \u201csignificant\u201d new resources for support, education and prevention. The office was launched in August.\n\n\u201cI knew that there was nothing that I could do in my protest to change what happened to me. But we could uncover the truth here at Michigan, and also make this place safer for now, and in the future, so that these atrocities don\u2019t continue to happen,\u201d Vaughn said.\n\n\u201cWe want to change the narrative, as well as the culture. So until that\u2019s done, I won\u2019t be leaving.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "into Law\n\nAt last, President Joe Biden has signed a historic same-sex marriage bill into law, ending a long struggle for LGBTQ+ Americans to gain federal recognition of their marriages.\n\nFor decades, LGBT+ activists have fought for their right to marry, facing legal and cultural barriers. In recent years, several states have legalized same-sex marriage, but the federal government had not officially recognized it. Now, with President Biden signing the bill into law, this has finally changed.\n\nThe new law makes it possible for same-sex couples to be legally married and recognized by the federal government. This recognition will have important legal and financial implications, granting same-sex couples the same rights and benefits enjoyed by opposite-sex couples.\n\nThe new law also takes a strong stance on transgender rights, protecting individuals against discrimination and reinforcing the right to gender-affirming health care. The bill also bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in housing and public accommodations.\n\nThe passage of this historic bill marks a major victory for the LGBT+ community, one that has been many years in the making. Advocates and activists have long pushed for the legalization of same-sex marriage and the protection of LGBT+ rights. President Biden signing the bill into law is a tangible victory for their efforts.\n\nSupporters of the law were quick to praise its passage. \u201cToday marks a huge milestone in the history of the LGBT+ rights movement,\u201d said Sarah McBride, the National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cThis law not only grants same-sex couples the legal recognition they deserve, but also sends a strong message that discrimination of any kind is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe president himself was also enthusiastic about the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cIt has been long past time that we take a stand against discrimination and bigotry,\u201d President Biden said. \u201cToday I am proud to sign a bill that protects the rights of LGBT+ Americans and ensures they have the same rights and privileges as everyone else in this country.\u201d\n\nThe passage of the same-sex marriage bill is a historic moment in America\u2019s struggle for LGBT+ rights. This law will finally grant same-sex couples the federal recognition they have long deserved, and serves as a powerful reminder that discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated. President Biden should be commended for his commitment to advancing LGBT+ rights, and for signing this important bill into law.", "label": "machine"}

Jassy's message came the same day Salesforce (CRM) said it would slash 10% of its workforce while Vimeo (VMEO) cut headcount by 11% in its second wave of reductions.\n\nAnd it's not just tech workers being let go.\n\nGoldman Sachs is reportedly hashing out plans to part ways with up to 4,000 bankers any day now, according to a year-end audio message from CEO David Solomon to staff last week.\n\nThis year's layoff announcements come as U.S. companies grapple with inflation, higher interest rates, and a deteriorating economic environment that has prompted both needed and precautionary cost-cutting \u2014 especially after many over-hired during the post-pandemic boom in 2021.\n\n\"Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,\" Jassy said in his message to Amazon staff. \"Companies that last a long time go through different phases.

{"text": ", and hope\n\nHomelessness in San Francisco has become a growing problem in recent years, with an estimated 8,000 people currently without homes. Many homeless people have struggled with homelessness for years, with limited resources to escape their situation. With no permanent shelter, they are forced to turn to the streets, begging for money and facing danger with every step.\n\nOn a sunny Friday morning in downtown San Francisco, a group of homeless people gathered to share their stories. Their voices were filled with frustration, survival, and hope. One woman, Sonya, tearfully told of how she had been homeless for five years. Despite having a job, Sonya said that she could never seem to get ahead, always falling one step behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard out here,\u201d said Sonya. \u201cLiving on the streets means constantly looking over your shoulder, and there\u2019s a constant fear of being robbed or attacked. I\u2019m always trying to find food and places to sleep. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, Mary, said that she had been living on the streets for almost two years. Mary was determined to get back on her feet and find stable housing, but with limited resources, she was struggling to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI get a few meals a day at a shelter, but it\u2019s hard to find other help,\u201d said Mary. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on the streets, I feel like no one sees me or cares about me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m invisible.\u201d\n\nThe homeless people gathered in the park shared stories of despair, but they also spoke of hope and resilience. Many of them had started small businesses or had found employment, despite the difficult circumstances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a victim,\u201d said one man. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor. I\u2019ve been homeless for six years, but I refuse to give up. I\u2019ve been able to build a successful business and I\u2019m determined to keep pushing forward.\u201d\n\nThe participants agreed that the current system was not working and that more had to be done to help the homeless population. They called on the government to take action and provide more housing and social services.\n\n\u201cWe need more housing,\u201d said one woman. \u201cWe need more jobs and services that are available to homeless people.\u201d\n\nThe participants were aware that these were long-term solutions, but they were determined to make their voices heard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our lives,\u201d said one man. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to make sure the government is listening and doing something to help us. We can\u2019t be invisible anymore.\u201d\n\nThe hope that these homeless people had was inspiring, but it was also heartbreaking. While the people gathered in the park had the courage to fight for a better future, many more people in San Francisco were still suffering from homelessness and poverty.\n\nDespite their struggles, the homeless people in San Francisco hoped that their stories and pleas for help would be heard, and that the government would finally take action to end the homelessness crisis.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The NBA world is a buzz after a powerful dunk by Boston Celtics' Robert Williams III caused a 35-minute delay in their game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night.\n\nThe incident happened in the fourth quarter, with the Celtics leading by 18 points and only 3:15 remaining in the game. Williams, known for his powerful dunks, rose up and slammed the ball home with authority, bringing the Boston fans to their feet in wild celebration.\n\nBut it was then that the unexpected happened. The entire arena went quiet and the sound of a loud crashing noise was heard, with some speculating that the dunk had somehow caused a power outage. \n\nAs it turns out, the dunk didn't cause the power outage, but did shake the arena in such a way that it caused some damage to the arena's power cables, which were running beneath the floor. As a result, the game had to be delayed until the cables could be repaired, causing a 35-minute delay in the game.\n\nThe Celtics went on to win the game, but the delay seemed to take a bit of the wind out of their sails, and many in the Boston camp were not happy with the delay.\n\n\"It's not very often you can put the blame on one player for a delay in the game,\" said Celtics coach Brad Stevens. \"But it seems like Robert's dunk was to blame here. I'm sure Robert feels a bit embarrassed about it, but it's just something that happened.\"\n\nWilliams himself seemed to take the delay in stride, saying that he was sorry for any inconvenience caused, but that he was just trying to make a big play for the team.\n\n\"I was just trying to be aggressive and make a play for the team,\" said Williams. \"I didn't expect the dunk to cause a delay, but I'm sorry if it did. I'll try to be more careful next time.\"\n\nThe NBA also commented on the incident, with a league spokesperson saying that they would be looking into the incident to ensure that such delays do not happen in the future.\n\n\"We understand that such delays can be extremely disruptive to a game, and we take any such incident seriously,\" said the spokesperson. \"We will review this incident to ensure that all safety measures are being followed and that no similar delays occur in the future.\"\n\nThe incident has reignited the debate about whether or not dunks should be allowed in the NBA. Some argue that such powerful plays can cause undue damage to the arena, while others argue that such plays bring a sense of excitement to the game and should be allowed.\n\nFor now, the debate will likely continue, but one thing is for sure: Robert Williams III will always be remembered for causing a 35-minute delay in an NBA game due to one powerful dunk.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "For the fourth time, Republicans have failed to elect a new leader in the House of Representatives. This comes after President Donald Trump urged them to name Kevin McCarthy to the post, but the GOP has refused to heed the President's call.\n\nThe latest development comes as a huge blow to Trump and McCarthy, who was looking to become the first non-incumbent speaker since Republican Newt Gingrich in 1995.\n\nIn the latest vote, McCarthy failed to get the support of 218 members of the Republican Party, who needed to back him to get him elected. This means that the House has once again failed to find a leader, as the Republicans remain without one for the fourth time in the last four years.\n\nMcCarthy, who is the current House Minority Leader, was seen as the most likely candidate for the speakership. Trump had urged Republicans to back him and on Wednesday tweeted: \"Kevin McCarthy should be elected Speaker of the House. He's got the experience, the talent, and the work ethic. Let's go Kevin!\"\n\nHowever, despite the President's endorsement, McCarthy failed to get the support of the Republican Party. This has put a further damper on the already tense relations between the GOP and Trump.\n\nIt is unclear why McCarthy failed to get the necessary backing from the Republican Party. Some have speculated that it may be due to his close ties to the President, with many in the GOP rejecting Trump's views on certain issues.\n\nOthers have suggested that McCarthy's lack of experience as Speaker may have been a factor. With the GOP facing a highly competitive election season ahead, many Republicans may have felt that electing an untested speaker could have put them at a disadvantage.\n\nThe failure of the GOP to elect a speaker is a major blow to Trump, who had hoped that McCarthy would be able to provide him with a majority in the House. The President had hoped that with McCarthy in the Speaker's chair, the GOP would have been able to pass legislation more easily.\n\nHowever, with the House once again without a leader, Trump and the GOP must now find another way to make progress in the coming months.\n\nAlthough the failure to elect McCarthy has been a setback for Trump, it does not necessarily mean that he will be completely without allies in the House. Although the majority of Republicans voted against McCarthy, it appears that there are still members who are willing to work with the President.\n\nIn the meantime, the Republicans will need to focus on finding a way to move forward without a speaker. With the election season around the corner, it is likely that the GOP will need to put aside their differences and find a way to work together if they are to succeed in the upcoming polls.", "label": "machine"}

The United States and its Asian allies flew dozens of fighter jets over waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday in a show of force as their diplomats discussed a coordinated response to a possibly imminent North Korean nuclear test.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Biden administration announced Thursday that it is sanctioning three people for their work in developing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile-related programs for North Korea.\n\nThe Treasury Department designated Workers' Party of Korea officials Jon Il Ho, Yu Jin and Kim Su Gil for their \"major roles in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's development of weapons of mass destruction.\" Treasury added that these officials \"personally attended numerous ballistic missile launches since at least 2017.\"\n\nThe Biden administration said that the sanctions were coordinated with South Korea and Japan. Thursday's sanctions follow a similar move taken by the European Union in April.\n\n\"Recent launches demonstrate the need for all countries to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, which are intended to prevent the DPRK from acquiring the technologies, materials, and revenue Pyongyang needs to develop its prohibited weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile capabilities,\" said Brian Nelson, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a release.\n\nThe sanctions follow renewed North Korean ballistic missile tests. So far this year, Pyongyang has launched eight intercontinental ballistic missiles and carried out 60 ballistic missile tests.\n\nIn October, North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles. One of those traveled 2,800 miles, a distance that puts the U.S. territory of Guam within its trajectory, before splashing down into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe provocative Oct. 5 test prompted late-night calls from White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan to his Japanese and South Korean counterparts. President Joe Biden condemned the missile test in a phone call with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and discussed ways to \"limit North Korea's ability to support its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs,\" according to a White House readout of the call.\n\nThe test, the first in five years to fly over Japan, was answered with a volley of U.S. and South Korean missiles. At the time, the Pentagon said that the four missiles were launched into the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nUnder Kim Jong Un, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near Guam.\n\nSince 2011, Kim has launched more than 100 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than what his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a period of 27 years.", "label": "human"}

The U.S. and several of its allies in the region have challenged those claims and stepped up patrols of the waterway.\n\nMonday\u2019s incident, which follows the Dec. 13 encounter, appeared to be the latest episode in the long-running competition between the two powers.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter visited the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the South China Sea and vowed to continue operating in the region without hindrance from China.\n\nThe Chinese statement said on Wednesday that \u201cthe U.S. has been making a series of close-up surveillance and reconnaissance activities against China, gravely threatening the safety of China\u2019s coastal defense facilities and ships and planes of China\u2019s naval and air forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is extremely dissatisfied about this,\u201d it said.\n\nThe U.S. has regularly denied any accusation it is trying to contain China\u2019s rise.\n\nThe two countries also remain at odds over a U.S. law signed by President Barack Obama last week that includes tougher rules on exports to China.\n\nChina has long held the U.S. is trying to contain its rise.\n\nBeijing has complained that the law amounts to a \u201cpursuit of hegemony\u201d and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Tuesday that Beijing was \u201cstrongly dissatisfied\u201d with the U.S. action.\n\nHowever, Lu also said the tensions between the two countries \u201cdo not necessarily mean confrontation and conflict.\u201d\n\nHe urged the U.S. to \u201clook at and treat China\u2019s development in an objective and fair way and act responsibly.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the increasing tensions between the two powers could escalate further in the coming year unless both sides can find ways to reduce the risk of a serious clash.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 year-end bonuses are set to be lower than expected, leading to a great deal of finger-pointing as to who is to blame.\n\nThe New York-based investment banking giant has long been known as a place where employees are well-compensated and hard work is rewarded. But this year, Goldman\u2019s year-end bonuses are set to be far lower than what many employees were expecting, leading to accusations that the firm\u2019s management was responsible for the dip in payouts.\n\nThe investment bank had already warned its employees earlier this year that its bonuses would be lower than normal due to the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. But even still, the cuts have been particularly acute, with some reports saying that some employees have had their bonuses slashed by as much as 50%.\n\nThe cause of the reduced bonuses is multifaceted. First, Goldman Sachs\u2019 profits have taken a hit this year due to the pandemic and the economic slowdown it caused. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs has also been involved in legal proceedings regarding claims that it mismanaged employee retirement funds. While Goldman has denied these accusations, the legal battle has still had an impact on its profits and affected the size of its year-end bonuses.\n\nHowever, Goldman\u2019s employees are not the only ones pointing fingers at the firm\u2019s management for the reduced bonuses. Some investors have accused Goldman\u2019s top brass of focusing too heavily on short-term returns rather than long-term stability, which has led to the lower bonuses.\n\n\u201cGoldman\u2019s management has allowed short-termism to take precedence over long-term sustainability,\u201d said one Goldman shareholder. \u201cThe bonuses that Goldman\u2019s employees receive are a reflection of this short-term thinking.\u201d\n\nOthers have accused Goldman of hoarding cash in order to prop up its stock price, rather than investing in its employees and paying out higher bonuses. Still, other critics have said that Goldman has simply mismanaged its profits and could have paid out more generous bonuses if it had been better stewards of its money.\n\nGoldman Sachs, for its part, has defended its actions and pointed out that the size of its year-end bonuses was in line with the industry average.\n\n\u201cThe bonus pool is set each year after careful consideration and deliberation, and this year\u2019s bonus pool is consistent with industry norms,\u201d the firm said in a statement.\n\nDespite these claims, however, Goldman\u2019s employees are still likely to be disappointed with the size of their bonus. This is particularly true for those who were expecting large bonus payouts to compensate for the pay cuts and layoffs the firm has instituted in recent years.\n\nThe disappointment of Goldman\u2019s employees is sure to be shared by shareholders, who will be watching closely to see how the firm performs in the future. If Goldman\u2019s profits suffer and its bonuses remain low, then investors may start to question the management team\u2019s strategy.\n\nBut for now, Goldman Sachs\u2019 employees will have to cope with the reality of lower year-end bonuses and the scrutiny that comes with them.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "of 2022.\n\nIt was the fourth quarter of the year 2022, and stock markets have seen a few big changes since the start of the year. After an uneven start to the year, markets have recovered, and fourth quarter has seen a surge in stocks due to economic optimism.\n\nAs investors look to the end of the year, it is important to review which stocks have been the best and worst performers in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nOne of the best performing stocks of the fourth quarter was Apple Inc., the tech giant whose stock surged nearly 25% from the start of the fourth quarter. Apple\u2019s stock had been underperforming earlier in the year due to concerns about its smartphone business, but its robust product lineup and market expansion initiatives helped boost the stock in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnother tech stock that saw a strong performance was Microsoft, which rose nearly 22% from the start of the fourth quarter. The stock benefited from strong sales of its gaming console, Xbox, and solid sales of its Office software suite. Microsoft also made headlines in the fourth quarter as it launched a new healthcare venture with Walgreens to expand its reach in the digital health space.\n\nIn addition, energy stocks also saw strong returns in the fourth quarter. ExxonMobil was one of the best performing energy stocks, rising more than 15%. The company\u2019s strong earnings report and its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint helped the stock gain momentum.\n\nIn the retail sector, Walmart saw a strong fourth quarter with its stock rising more than 12%. The retailer benefited from strong holiday sales, fueled by demand for its e-commerce offerings. Walmart also announced a major restructuring of its business model to focus more on digital commerce, which analysts believe helped drive the stock higher in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite the gains in many stocks, there were some that underperformed in the fourth quarter. Alibaba Group, the Chinese tech giant, saw its stock fall nearly 10% from the start of the fourth quarter. The company faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, including the U.S.-China trade war, the weakening of the Chinese economy, and a regulatory crackdown on its Ant Group unit.\n\nTesla, the electric vehicle maker, also underperformed in the fourth quarter, declining more than 9%. The company\u2019s production problems at its Fremont plant in California have weighed on the stock, as has its lofty valuation relative to other automakers.\n\nIn the financial sector, Goldman Sachs\u2019 stock declined nearly 8%. The bank was hit by weak performance in its investment banking business, as well as weak trading revenues. Analysts expect Goldman Sachs to continue to face headwinds in the near term as the U.S. economy remains weak.\n\nFinally, in the biotech sector, Gilead Sciences\u2019 stock declined more than 7%. The company\u2019s experimental drug for treating cystic fibrosis failed to meet its clinical endpoints, and its stock tumbled as a result.\n\nOverall, the fourth quarter was a strong period for stocks, as the U.S. economy started to recover from the pandemic. With the Biden administration pushing for additional stimulus measures and an improving economic outlook, the markets are expected to remain positive in the near term. As investors look to the end of the year, these are some of the stocks that stood out in the fourth quarter of 2022.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Club holding Honeywell (HON) is a diversified industrial giant that's well-positioned to weather a potential recession in the U.S. next year, according to Bank of America. And we largely concur, given Honeywell's strong backlog across a range of products and its exposure to the resurgent aerospace industry. Investors are increasingly turning their attention to the possibility of a recession next year, aided in part by the Federal Reserve's high interest rates meant to combat inflation. But defensive names like Honeywell, an industry leader across aerospace, energy and automation, among others, makes tangible products \u2014 and profits \u2014 that should allow it to grow even amid a worsening economic climate. Bank of America on Monday chose Honeywell as one of 7 top industrial picks for 2023, calling the conglomerate a \"top-tier operator.\" The other picks included Fortive Corp (FTV), Dover Corp (DOV), Emerson Electric (EMR), General Electric (GE), PTC Inc (PTC), APi Group (APG) A diversified manufacturing behemoth whose products include airplane engines, industrial chemicals and carbon-capture technology, Honeywell has consistently demonstrated its profitability despite supply chain constraints, high inflation and global conflict. In the third quarter, Honeywell's equivalent of an adjusted operating income margin expanded by 60 basis points year-over-year , to 21.8%. \"The company has strong pricing power... and has offset supply chain shortages and Russia-related headwinds,\" BofA analysts wrote in a research note. \"Management expects to grow revenues and earnings in 2023 even in an economic downturn,\" they added. Honeywell is also benefiting from the recovery of aerospace and oil-and-gas end markets in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, along with a $29.1 billion order backlog, according to BofA. \"The company has delivered robust incremental margins [year-to-date], which we forecast improving in 2023, as an improving supply chain allows for additional volume growth,\" the analysts wrote. The Club take We believe Honeywell can perform well in 2023 due to its strong backlog of multifaceted products, coupled with continued customer demand. We also see its product volume improving as supply chain disruptions ease. The aerospace industry is still in recovery mode from the pandemic, but is expected to have a solid 2023. More people are traveling, and flight hours are increasing from a few years ago, bolstering our belief that Honeywell can outperform even in an economic slowdown.

{"text": "Bank of America analysts said this week there are several stocks every investor must own for 2023. The bank said these companies are attractively valued and well positioned, even in a deteriorating macroeconomic climate. CNBC Pro combed through Bank of America research to find its top stocks to own this year. They include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wallbox , Radian Group, Tapestry and Starbucks. Starbucks Shares of the global coffee chain are up 6% already in 2023, but analyst Sara Senatore says clients should buy the stock now. Bank of America says China reopening is a positive catalyst likely to send Starbucks shares higher. \"Now that China has largely abandoned its zero-Covid policy, SBUX appears poised to benefit from China's long awaited economic reopening...,\" she wrote. Senatore says the timing of this tailwind is unknown, but the overhang has been removed with the lockdowns in China largely over. Sales levels should recover to \"~60-70% of normalized levels in 2023,\" Senatore wrote. Starbucks has the \"brand, scale, [and] tech\" to position for a \"strong rebound\" she went on, adding that the digital opportunity is especially robust. \"SBUX's transitory China challenges and U.S. margin pressure create a particularly attractive buying opportunity,\" she said. Tapestry The owner of Coach and Kate Spade is firing on all cylinders, according to analyst Lorraine Hutchinson. Shares are up more than 25% over the last six months and Bank of America calls Tapestry one of its best ideas for 2023. \"Coach has posted three consecutive years of successful average unit retail gains by adding content to the products, cutting choice count by 40%, reducing promotions and making smarter use of discounting,\" Hutchinson said, referring to the average selling price of a product. Bank of America sees a long runway for higher pricing, noting that there's been no obvious pushback from consumers. Hutchinson also says Tapestry's profit margin outlook looks \"positive.\" \"TPR's long-term gross margin target of 71% looks very achievable, if not beatable,\" Bank of America said. Add in consistent free-cash flow and the stock deserves a long look from investors, Hutchinson wrote. \"Tapestry remains a top pick given our view of its sustainable pricing power and solid capital return plan,\" she said. Wallbox Shares of Barcelona-based Wallbox are down 70% over the last year, but analyst Marianne Bulot and team say it's time to buy the dip. After the underperformance, Bank of America says it's bullish on the electric vehicle charging company's prospects for growth, particularly in the United States. Even as electric vehicle sales lag globally, the pace of adoption in the U.S. continues to pick up year over year, according to Bulot. \"We forecast the North American region will account for [circa] 21% of the group sales in 2022, c40% in 2026 & c48% in 2030,\" she said. The bank said \"political ambition means opportunity,\" particularly with respect to last year's passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. With a price target of $11 per share, the stock's valuation is just too \"attractive\" to ignore at these levels, she wrote. \"Strong growth prospects, position in the U.S. and continued gross margin strength sets Wallbox well apart from its peers,\" Bulot wrote.

{"text": "Markets are grappling with recession fears and the prospect of sticky inflation. Market veterans have been warning that stubbornly high inflation could trigger a recession this year. And some predict that earnings-per-share estimates have further to fall. But there's a way to protect your portfolio \u2014 buy shares in companies with resilient margins, Goldman Sachs said in a recent note. Gross margin is one closely watched profitability metric. It can be used to determine a company's pricing power (in other words, its ability to maintain or raise prices without reducing demand), making it particularly important in times of inflation. CNBC Pro screened FactSet for stocks expected to have gross margins of more than 50% this year, and predicted to rally by the same magnitude. They also got a \"buy\" from at least 40% of analysts who cover them. These are 10 global stocks under the MSCI World index that meet those criteria. A few stocks in the screen stood out for the high analyst expectations they got on all three criteria. Cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks were two of them. Palo Alto's CEO earlier said it was seeing tailwinds from customers looking to slash costs in the worsening economy. While CrowdStrike said earlier in December that new earnings growth had slowed , some investors were still optimistic on the stock. Josh Brown and Cathie Wood snapped up more of the stock , with Brown saying he views CrowdStrike as a long-term prospect. More than 80% of analysts covering those two stocks gave them a buy rating. And on the whole, analysts expect both firms' gross margins to grow by more than 70% in 2023, according to FactSet. Wall Street has been particularly bullish on the cybersecurity sector this year even amid a volatile market. Two stocks in the list stood out not just for high expected gross margin growth and upside, but also for receiving a buy rating from all analysts who cover them, according to FactSet. They are Hong Kong-listed firms \u2014 shipping company SITC International Holdings and real estate services firm ESR Group . Match Group , which operates online dating platforms such as Tinder and Hinge, made the list. Analysts have been bullish on the stock, with KeyBanc Capital Markets and Piper Sandler giving it an overweight rating in December notes. KeyBanc noted that Tinder continues to lead the market in terms of its share of downloads in both North America and globally. \"Specifically, Tinder has more global monthly downloads than Bumble and Hinge combined. We view this as a good demonstration of Tinder's global scale and believe the brand will likely be the largest beneficiary of favorable trends in FX given international exposure,\" KeyBanc analysts wrote. With travel resuming, online travel platform Expedia received one of the highest projections of gross margin growth in the year ahead from analysts \u2014 at about 85%, and 51% average upside, according to FactSet.

{"text": "Solar panels are set up in the solar farm at the University of California, Merced, in Merced, California, August 17, 2022. Nathan Frandino | Reuters\n\nGenerating electricity to power homes and businesses is a significant contributor to climate change. In the United States, one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Solar panels and wind farms can generate electricity without releasing any greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power plants can too, although today's plants generate long-lasting radioactive waste, which has no permanent storage repository. But the U.S. electrical sector is still dependent on fossil fuels. In 2021, 61 percent of electricity generation came from burning coal, natural gas, or petroleum. Only 20 percent of the electricity in the U.S. came from renewables, mostly wind energy, hydropower and solar energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Another 19 percent came from nuclear power.\n\nThe contribution from renewables has been increasing steadily since the 1990s, and the rate of increase has accelerated. For example, wind power provided only 2.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1990, doubling to 5.6 billion in 2000. But from there, it skyrocketed, growing to 94.6 billion in 2010 and 379.8 billion in 2021. That's progress, but it's not happening fast enough to eliminate the worst effects of climate change for our descendants. \"We need to eliminate global emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050,\" philanthropist and technologist Bill Gates wrote in his 2023 annual letter. \"Extreme weather is already causing more suffering, and if we don't get to net-zero emissions, our grandchildren will grow up in a world that is dramatically worse off.\"\n\nAnd the problem is actually bigger than it looks. \"We need not just to create as much electricity as we have now, but three times as much,\" says Saul Griffith, an entrepreneur who's sold companies to Google and Autodesk and has written books on mass electrification. To get to zero emissions, all the cars and heating systems and stoves will have to be powered with electricity, said Griffith. Electricity is not necessarily clean, but at least it it can be, unlike gas-powered stoves or gasoline-powered cars. The technology to generate electricity with wind and solar has existed for decades. So why isn't the electric grid already 100% powered by renewables? And what will it take to get there?\n\nThe economics of power generation\n\nEconomics play a big part. First of all, renewables have only recently become cost-competitive with fossil fuels for generating electricity. Even then, prices depend on the location, Paul Denholm of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory told CNBC. In California and Arizona, where there is a lot of sun, solar energy is often the cheapest option, whereas in places like Maine, solar is just on the edge of being the cheapest energy source, Denholm said. In places with lots of wind like North Dakota, wind power is cost-competitive with fossil fuels, but in the Southeast, it's still a close call. Then there's the cost of transitioning the current power generation infrastructure, which was built around burning fossil fuels. \"You've got an existing power plant, it's paid off. Now you need renewables to be cheaper than running that plant to actually retire an old plant,\" Denholm explained. \"You need new renewables to be cheaper just in the variable costs, or the operating cost of that power plant.\" There are some places where that is true, but it's not universally so. \"Primarily, it just takes a long time to turn over the capital stock of a multitrillion-dollar industry,\" Denholm said. \"We just have a huge amount of legacy equipment out there. And it just takes awhile for that all to be turned over.\"\n\nIntermittency and transmission\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to a 100% renewable grid is the intermittency of many renewable power sources. The wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine \u2014 and the windiest and sunniest places are not close to all the country's major population centers.\n\nWind resources in the United States, according to the the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nThe solution is a combination of batteries to store excess power for times when generation is low, and transmission lines to take the power where it is needed. Long-duration batteries are under development, but Denholm said a lot of progress can be made simply with utility-scale batteries that store energy for a few hours. \"One of the biggest problems right now is shifting a little bit of solar energy, for instance, from say, 11 a.m. and noon to the peak demand at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. So you really only need a few hours of batteries,\" Denholm told CNBC. \"You can actually meet that with conventional lithium ion batteries. This is very close to the type of batteries that are being put in cars today. You can go really far with that.\" So far, battery usage has been low because wind and solar are primarily used to buffer the grid when energy sources are low, rather than as a primary source. For the first 20% to 40% of the electricity in a region to come from wind and solar, battery storage is not needed, Denholm said. When renewable penetration starts reaching closer to 50%, then battery storage becomes necessary. And building and deploying all those batteries will take time and money.\n\nSolar resources in the United States, according to the the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nTransmission lines are another limiting factor. \"We have been able to build a fair amount of wind and solar without adding new transmission, but we're really kind of running up to the limits, especially for wind, because there's not a whole lot of transmission located in the places in the country where it's super windy,\" Denholm said. \"So we absolutely do need to build more transmission to tap into those super-high quality wind resources, particularly in the middle of the country.\" The transmission system in the U.S. is built for the electricity capacity that is already on the grid, and building new transmission lines that run hundreds of miles can take anywhere from 10 to 15 years, John Moura, the director of reliability assessment at the North American Electric Reliability Corp., told CNBC. \"The type of transmission we're talking about here are 1,000 [or] 2,000 miles long, large projects.\" Currently, when a utility wants to add electricity to the existing grid, it has to pay for the upgraded transmission line and for the interconnection, which is where multiple local grids are brought together. Those grid upgrades are expensive, and the permit process is slow. Several components of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed in November 2021 gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission much stronger permitting authority, transmission line analyst Rob Gramlich told CNBC. Still, some key rule changes did not get across the finish line. There was no transmission tax credit included in this year's Inflation Reduction Act, and efforts by Sen. Joe Manchin, D.-W.Va., to reform permitting have so far failed to pass. \"Transmission was not meaningfully addressed in the 117th Congress. There is a lot of unfinished business on the transmission front, for sure,\" Gramlich told CNBC. Putting transmission lines underground is another option, but that's prohibitively expensive. \"Your classical old-school, large overhead transmission lines are pretty much the only thing that we are likely to see at least in the next decade or two,\" Denholm said.\n\nLand requirements? Not that big a deal\n\nOne commonly cited worry is that going 100% renewable will require massive tracts of land covered with solar panels or wind farms. But \"that is definitively not the challenge,\" Moura said. It would take a total of 0.84 percent of U.S. land to support an entirely renewable-powered energy system, Stanford professor Mark Jacobson told CNBC. By comparison, the fossil fuel industry takes up 1.3 percent of U.S. land. \"Offshore wind, tidal, and wave power do not take up any new land. Rooftop photovoltaic does not take up any new land,\" he said. So really, the only new land required would be for solar facilities run by utilities, and for wind turbines on land. But many people are reluctant to embrace a new way of doing things when they can't see what the future will look like, and when maintaining the status quo is the path of least resistance, according to Griffith, the mass-electrification advocate \"The biggest barrier is a lack of imagination,\" Griffith told CNBC in a video interview from Australia, where he currently lives. \"So everyone is like, 'Well, I'm not quite willing to do this, because I don't know what it's going to look like. And maybe it's going to be terrible.'\" So what would a 100% renewable-powered world look like, according to Griffith? \"It's going to look like every house has solar on its roof. There'll be solar over every parking structure. Some roads will probably have a solar panels elevated down the middle of the road. And every time you go driving in the countryside, you'll see some wind somewhere on the horizon,\" Griffith said. \"And otherwise, the future is going to look a lot like it does.\"\n\n'The right thing to do is not the easy thing to do'\n\nFirm and consistent rules from the federal government are another shortcoming in the U.S., and that comes down to politics. \"In Norway, you can't buy a gasoline vehicle after 2025. That creates a huge amount of market certainty. Everyone knows when it's going to happen, what you have to do,\" Griffith said. The Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022 was chock full of incentives to push renewables forward, but it didn't put any firm sunsetting dates on fossil fuel generation. \"It doesn't really clearly send a signal to the utilities that, 'No, you can't install natural gas networks to heat homes anymore. No, you can't do this or that or the other.' So I think more regulatory, legislative certainty would help America a lot,\" said Griffith. Until then, its going to continue to be cheaper and easier to keep doing things the same old way.\n\nSaul Griffith's electric home in San Francisco. Photo courtesy Saul Griffith\n\nGriffith lived in the U.S. for more than two decades and built an all-electric home in San Francisco starting in 2014. It took him eight years and cost an estimated extra $80,000 compared to building a traditional home, he said. \"There's sort of that inertia and red tape and at every single level the system,\" Griffith said. \"And then even after I finished and build that house, it's hard to turn on. There are people who are really skilled at maintaining a digital electric house, [but] there's no software that makes it easy yet. There's a couple of startups working on it. ... It's like the early days of the cellphone.\" Even incremental repairs are harder to do with an all-electric home. \"If you call a contractor and say, 'I'd like to install an induction cooktop, I'd like to get take the gas out of the kitchen,' the contractor is probably going to tell you, 'You're crazy, buy natural gas instead.' Or if you call them at midnight and say, 'My water heater's gone, can you please replace it with an electric heat pump,' which would be the right choice for climate and even for economics, the contractor will be like, 'No, no, no, I'll have a natural gas one there in the morning, but the heat pump will take me six weeks,'\" Griffith said. \"So we've got a skills and capacity and supply chain shortage on all of these things, which means that the right thing to do is not the easy thing to do,\" he said. In Australia, more than 30 percent of homes have rooftop solar and it's \"the cheapest energy that humanity has ever had,\" Griffith said. In the U.S., only about 1 to 2 percent of homes have rooftop solar. \"In America, it's more expensive than electricity from the grid. That's a regulatory and a workforce training problem in the U.S.\" For instance, in Australia, Griffith said he can call 10 companies and get 10 quotes for rooftop solar the next day at 65 cents per watt. In California, rooftop solar cost him $5.80 per watt. Even given the higher cost of living in San Francisco in general, \"it shouldn't be 10 times more expensive than in Australia,\" he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Saul Griffith's electric home in San Francisco. Photo courtesy Saul Griffith\n\nIt's his view that in the U.S. it all comes down to regulation and preserving the status quo. \"America thinks it's all about free markets and anti-regulation, but really, it's the most over-regulated, most f----- up energy market in the world,\" Griffith said. For example, many utility companies provide both electricity and gas to their customers in the U.S. \"One of their businesses is in conflict with the other and they haven't resolved that,\" Griffith said. \"So we're still handicapping electric solutions versus natural gas solutions.\" For all of this to change, he said Americans will have to see a better alternative actually working outside of the U.S. \u2014 and then push politicians and private industry to do better at home. \"You just got to show that this works somewhere. And once you've done that, that might unlock America's full political paralysis,\" Griffith said. In the U.S., the successful pitch for rooftop solar will revolve more around escaping utility bills and rebelling against utilities and governments, than it will around saving the Earth, Griffith added. Given those economic and political realities, he said it's more likely that rooftop solar will first take off in more conservative states like Texas or Florida. \"It'll be a company named Liberation Solar \u2014 it will be the largest solar installer in the U.S.\" he said, perhaps only partly in jest.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German gas imports in 2022 fell by 12.3% from the previous year, data from the country's energy regulator showed on Tuesday, as rising demand from France and the Netherlands helped to offset a drop in Russian supply.\n\nThe Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway (BNetzA) said in its annual report that German imports of natural gas dropped to 72.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) in the year ending in December 2022, compared to 82.3 bcm the previous year.\n\nIt attributed the decline mainly to lower deliveries from Russia, which accounted for nearly 70% of German gas imports in 2021 and fell by 17% over the course of the year.\n\nRussia is a major gas supplier to Germany, as well as other European countries. The country is dependent on Russia for a large portion of its gas supplies, but in recent years, it has been actively diversifying its energy sources.\n\nIn particular, Norway has increasingly become a more important supplier for the country. Norway\u2019s share of German gas imports rose to 22.2% in 2022 from 19.2% in 2021, according to the BNetzA.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands and France emerged as significant sources of gas imports for Germany. Imports from the Netherlands, Germany's closest neighbor, were up 17.4%, while imports from France were up by more than 18%.\n\nThe increase in imports from the Netherlands and France helped compensate for the fall in Russian imports and, in turn, help meet the growing demand for gas in Germany.\n\nThe amount of gas imported to the country is expected to increase over the coming years. By 2025, the BNetzA expects German gas imports to reach around 75 bcm and to continue to rise.\n\nThe rise in demand, the regulator said, will be driven mainly by the country\u2019s industry and households, and also by the increasing number of renewable energy sources in Germany, which rely on gas for back-up generation.\n\nAnalysts said the figures show that Germany has made progress in diversifying its energy sources and is becoming less reliant on Russian gas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that Germany is becoming less dependent on Russian gas and that it is diversifying its sources,\u201d said Carsten Mueller, an energy analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\n\u201cThe more German companies and households are able to access alternative sources of gas, the better positioned they will be to protect against potential supply disruption from Russia and other sources,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BNetzA report also showed that Germany imported most of its gas in liquefied form. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) made up 44.8% of German gas imports in 2022, while pipeline gas accounted for the rest.\n\nIn addition, the BNetzA said that imports of gas from North Africa and the Middle East, which are expected to be a major source of gas for the region in coming years, remained marginal in 2022.\n\nThe data suggest that Germany is becoming more open to importing gas from other parts of the world, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that Germany is open to sourcing gas from other parts of the world,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Alexander Kolesnikov. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Germany and other European countries to diversify their energy sources to ensure energy security and maintain an adequate supply of gas.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

REUTERS/Rodolfo Buhrer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRASILIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's 580-day stretch behind bars imbued him with a renewed sense of social justice, the leftist's allies and confidants said, convincing him of the need to prioritize ending poverty over boosting profits.\n\nLula was sworn in on Sunday for an unprecedented third term, capping a dramatic turnaround for one of the world's most enduring political leaders, who first ran for president in 1989.\n\nJailed for graft in 2018 - the year right-wing former President Jair Bolsonaro was elected - Lula's convictions were overturned in 2019, allowing him to oust Bolsonaro in October's election.\n\nAs he strives to unite a nation riven by economic woes, a bruising pandemic and Bolsonaro's far-right populism, Lula is looking to his prison days for inspiration, allies and confidants told Reuters.\n\nHe learned from three failed presidential bids to tone down his leftist ideals and make peace with Brazil's powerful private sector during his 2003-10 presidency. But Lula 3.0 plans to double down on fighting poverty, ending hunger, and attacking racism, allies said, while also rewarding loyal Workers Party (PT) jail visitors with key cabinet positions.\n\n\"Prison reinforced the sense that he has a duty above all to the poor in Brazil,\" said Tarso Genro, a former PT governor of Rio Grande do Sul and a close Lula associate. \"He went to prison strong and came out stronger.\"\n\nThe more ideological Lula who emerged from jail in 2019 should not be a cause for concern, friends and allies said. He is still the same pragmatist who honed his powers of persuasion as a union leader in the Sao Paulo auto plants of the 1970s, they added.\n\nLula aides have encouraged comparisons with former South African leader Nelson Mandela, who spent over a quarter of a century behind bars as an opponent of the country's apartheid.\n\nBut many on Faria Lima, the so-called \"Brazilian Wall Street,\" who fondly recall the business-friendly Lula of the early 2000s are holding their breath, worried that increased social spending and a loyalist cabinet will damage Brazil's fiscal credibility and usher in a new era of graft-stained statism.\n\n\"The initial reaction to Lula 3.0 on Faria Lima is not favorable,\" said economist Andre Perfeito, referring to the market dip after Lula's spending proposal was announced. \"Many investors bet on Bolsonaro winning and they almost got it right, so it is natural they are not happy.\"\n\nRecent cabinet appointments - including PT leader Fernando Haddad as finance minister - have also troubled some investors.\n\nLula also recently named PT stalwart and economist Aloizio Mercadante as head of national development bank BNDES, which during previous PT governments lent billions of reais to projects consumed by allegations of waste and graft, though bank officials have said they were transparent.\n\nLula's spokesman Jose Chrispiniano said the president supported fiscal responsibility and believes that strengthening the economy is the best way to combat poverty.\n\n\"He does not see any contradiction between caring for the poorest and promoting growth. On the contrary, he thinks caring for the poor and giving them the opportunity to work and consume is what generates sustainable growth,\" he told Reuters.\n\nREADING BEHIND BARS\n\nLula's new-found social awareness was ignited by reading books on race, slavery and hunger behind bars, as well as biographies of Fidel Castro and Nelson Mandela, according to his website. He also perused \"Lulismo in crisis,\" a critical review of his movement and its missteps by his former press secretary Andre Singer.\n\nIt was augmented by his relationship with Rosangela da Silva, or Janja, a PT activist 20-years his younger whom he married on release and who looks set to be a key political player. Lula became a widower when his first wife Mariza died the year before he went to jail.\n\nJanja - who helped organize Lula's election certification and Sunday's inauguration, as well as advising on cabinet choices - was among hundreds of PT true-believers who camped outside his prison in the southern city of Curitiba.\n\n\"Good morning, President Lula,\" his devotees would chant as the day began, followed by \"Good night, President Lula,\" as he went to bed.\n\nFrom his 15-square-meter cell on the third floor of the Federal Police headquarters in Curitiba, Lula set about reorganizing the PT and managing his legal defense. It was there he planned the failed presidential campaign of Haddad, a regular visitor who lost to Bolsonaro in 2018.\n\nWhen he left prison, Lula was determined to set the record straight on his imprisonment and said he wanted to be re-elected to clear his name in the people's court. He called his imprisonment a political witch-hunt, fabricated by the right to keep him from running in 2018.\n\nAnother close aide, PT Senator Humberto Costa, said Lula matured politically in jail.\n\n\"What drove him to run again was the need to leave his mark, not just politically but historically, by bringing lasting change to Brazil,\" Costa said.\n\nReporting by Anthony Boadle and Lisandra Paraguassu in Brasilia, Paula Arend Laier in Sao Paulo Editing by Gabriel Stargardter, Aurora Ellis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

In Europe, those funds acquired assets worth $41.7 billion in the first seven months of 2022 \u2013 more than double the previous year\u2019s total \u2013 propelled by deals like Veolia\u2019s (VIE.PA) takeover of French water and waste management rival Suez.\n\nEven so, investors are becoming more selective about their infrastructure bets. The as yet unexplained Baltic explosions exposed the fragility of marine infrastructure, senior bankers and investors told Reuters Breakingviews. Corrosive seawater can quickly make a submarine gas pipeline unusable. And damage from war is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nThe rising cost of insuring against cyberattacks will also dull the appeal of telecoms networks and power grids. The premium to insure commercial property against hackers rose 27% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2022, well above the average increase of 7% for all lines of insurance, according to a survey by The Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers.\n\nThe need for infrastructure remains strong, though. The urge to make the world a cleaner place means building and upgrading power infrastructure in both developed and developing countries. Assets like electricity grids, which are critical for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, will remain attractive to investors and financiers. Yet they too are potentially exposed to sabotage, as demonstrated by the attacks on two electric substations in North Carolina in early December.\n\nPressure to establish energy security at home also means governments will want to own key infrastructure assets, regardless of the financial incentives. Germany, for example, took gas storage facilities from private Russian hands and is looking to take control of Dutch power-grid operator TenneT\u2019s local subsidiary, Reuters reported on Nov. 30. If private investors conclude some infrastructure assets have lost their appeal, states will step in.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nFollow @LJucca on Twitter\n\n(This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2023.

TotalEnergies and Equinor said in September they had spotted unusual drone activity near their offshore energy installations.\n\nMore than 40,000 customers lost electrical power in North Carolina on Dec. 4 after what local authorities described as a \u201ctargeted attack\u201d.\n\nMacquarie said in November it had raised 12.6 billion euros from investors to invest in core infrastructure such as electricity grids, gas pipeline and water facilities.\n\n(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Orthodox Christmas is traditionally celebrated by many on Jan. 6 and 7.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin's press service, Putin made the announcement in response to an earlier call by the leader of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, for guns to go silent over the Orthodox holiday.\n\n\"Due to the fact that a large number of citizens of the Orthodox faith live in several areas of the conflict zone, we call on the Ukrainian side to observe a ceasefire and allow them to visit Christmas Eve services, as well as those on the day of the birth of Christ,\" said a statement posted to the Kremlin website.\n\nPatriarch Kirill has been an avid supporter of the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine \u2014 including telling Russian soldiers that dying for the cause would \"wash away all sins.\" His support of the Russian military has divided the world Orthodox faithful.\n\nIn May, the Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church formally broke with the Moscow Patriarch over his open support of the war \u2014 a move that Ukrainian officials noted in condemning the cease-fire offer.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church \"is not an authority for global Orthodoxy & acts as a 'war propagandist,'\" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak tweeted. \"Thus, ROC's statement about 'Christmas truce' is a cynical trap & an element of propaganda,\" he concluded, using an abbreviation for the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nOthers accused Russia of planning to use any break in fighting to rearm in preparation for future assaults.\n\n\"Let's let the Orthodox believers go to church on Christmas. They declare a truce and, at the same time, sit and reload their rockets. Bastards,\" wrote Boris Filatov, the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, in a Telegram post.\n\nIn Washington, President Biden told reporters, \"I'm reluctant to respond to anything Putin says. And I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and New Year's. And, I mean, I think he's trying to find some oxygen.\"\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters, \"Our concern ... is that the Russians would seek to use any temporary pause in fighting to rest, to refit, to regroup and ultimately to to re-attack. And so in that sense, it can't be considered a cease-fire if the intent is to train their fire with even more vengeance, with even more ferocity, with even more lethality against the people of Ukraine. If Russia were truly serious about peace, about ending this war, it would withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of Ukraine. That is what constitutes an end to this war.\"\n\nThe White House announced Thursday that the U.S. will send Bradley infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine, and Germany will send Marder infantry fighting vehicles plus an additional Patriot air defense battery.\n\nEven in Russia, there were few signs the cease-fire could be anything more than a temporary halt in the fighting.\n\nIn a call with Putin earlier in the day, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked the Russian leader to implement a unilateral cease-fire to support efforts to end the war.\n\nIn response, Putin repeated Russian demands that Ukraine accept Moscow's recent annexation of four regions of Ukraine before \"serious dialogue\" could begin, according to a Kremlin readout of the exchange.\n\nRussia's annexation moves have been widely condemned as illegal, and Russian forces have failed to maintain control over the territories.\n\nUkraine maintains that peace can be only achieved when Russian forces leave the occupied territories \u2014 including Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nTwo months after Elon Musk laid off half of Twitter\u2019s workforce, some employees affected say they have yet to receive any formal severance offer or separation agreement.\n\nOne former Twitter employee told CNN that they had expected to receive some information from the company by Wednesday, the last official employment date for many workers affected by the first wave of layoffs under Musk based on state and federal notice period regulations.\n\nAs of early Thursday, however, the former employee said they had yet to receive any documents related to a severance agreement or offer. Other laid-off employees tweeted similar remarks this week, including one who said they had \u201cnever even seen a severance letter let alone been offered severance.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney representing hundreds of former Twitter employees, confirmed that her clients who were hit by the Twitter layoffs in early November also had yet to receive any severance information as of Thursday. \u201cThere was some anticipation that they would be sent yesterday, but we haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Kevin Ready, the spokesperson, said of the severance agreements.\n\n\u201cYesterday was the official separation date for thousands of Twitter employees, and after months of chaos and uncertainty created by Elon Musk, these workers remain in the lurch,\u201d Liss-Riordan said in a Thursday statement.\n\nThe employee concerns come as Musk scrambles to cut costs at the company he bought in October for $44 billion, including a significant amount of debt. After laying off half the company in early November, Musk continued cutting and pushing out additional employees, including by requiring anyone who remained to sign a pledge committing to \u201chardcore\u201d work.\n\nThe company was recently sued by a commercial landlord and a private flight company alleging Twitter has failed to pay bills. And The New York Times last month reported that Twitter was considering denying laid off employees their severance as a cost-cutting measure, citing people familiar with the talks among company leadership, adding to the sense of uncertainty for affected workers.\n\nTwitter, which cut much of its public relations department as part of the layoffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the claims it has not offered or paid any severance. At the time of the layoffs, Musk promised that \u201ceveryone exited was offered 3 months of severance,\u201d a time period that appears to include the 60-days advanced notice Twitter was obligated to provide.\n\nA report by Fortune on Thursday afternoon, citing an unnamed source familiar with the situation and screenshots viewed by the publication, said that Twitter planned to send severance agreements to affected employees on Thursday, although it was unclear exactly when they would go out. The severance agreements were set to provide laid off US employees with one month\u2019s base pay and would include a provision requiring employees to waive participation in pending lawsuits against the company, according to the report.\n\nLiss-Riordan has filed four proposed class action lawsuits against Twitter on behalf of employees affected by layoffs, with claims including that Twitter backtracked on promises to allow remote work and consistent severance benefits, as well as complaints related to alleged disability and gender-based discrimination. She has also filed three claims against Twitter with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees. Liss-Riordan said Thursday that she has also filed another 100 demands for arbitration against Twitter on behalf of former employees, after filing an initial 100 last month.\n\nLast month, the employees represented by Liss-Riordan scored an early win in court when a judge ordered Twitter to inform laid-off employees of the pending lawsuits before asking them to sign any separation agreements that include a release of legal claims.", "label": "human"}

MARTIN KEEP/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUNITED24\n\nSvitolina was born in Odessa, a strategically important port city which has been blockaded by Russian forces since the invasion.\n\nShe then moved to Kharkiv when she was 12 years old and says she felt helpless when watching the fierce fighting which has continued to rock the eastern city.\n\nAged 16, Svitolina left Ukraine to pursue her sporting ambitions but always had her country in her heart. She\u2019s proud of her roots and smiles when recalling moments from her childhood that helped form such a strong bond with Ukraine.\n\nShe\u2019s now channeled that love into her own foundation \u2013 which encourages children to learn life lessons through tennis \u2013 and that of UNITED24, an organization set up by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with the aim of raising funds for medical supplies, defense and eventually the rebuilding of the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nSvitolina was recently named an ambassador and spoke to Zelensky, who tasked her with uniting the sporting community and maintaining awareness.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the moments I was most stressed, and even entering the tennis court I was not that stressed,\u201d Svitolina said, speaking about her Zoom call with the president and her fellow ambassador, Ukrainian soccer great Andriy Shevchenko.\n\n\u201cBut he was very kind and his speech was very motivating [\u2026] what he does, it takes a lot of courage.\n\n\u201cHe just explained what Ukraine really needs these days and how he sees the situation in Ukraine right now.

And that\u2019s why I try to, you know, to focus a little bit on my foundation, on the UNITED24, just to have a mission that I can help in anyway.\u201d\n\nWhile she has no motivation to return to tennis yet, she has the long-term goal of representing her country in the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nShe knows, perhaps more than most, just how unifying sport can be in times of such heartache and hardship, as demonstrated by the Ukrainian soccer team\u2019s powerful World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for people to give some different kind of information because, to be fair, I don\u2019t understand 100% what is really happening in Ukraine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is very, very tough for people to go through hell every single day.

The authors wrote that \"it had become clear that William was anxious about Harry's relationship with Meghan.\"\n\nThe book claims that William told Harry: \"Don't feel like you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.\"\n\nThe brothers reportedly had a heated argument about Meghan, and during this argument, William allegedly \"physically attacked\" Harry and \"knocked him to the floor\".\n\nPrince William has yet to comment on the claims made in the book, but a Kensington Palace spokesperson has said: \"This book does not represent the position of the Royal Family.\"\n\nThe alleged altercation between the brothers is said to have occurred in 2019 and was the first major hint of a rift between the brothers. It is believed the quarrel was sparked over the way the Prince of Wales was handling his engagement to the former Suits actress.\n\nAt the time of their engagement announcement, Harry and Meghan held an interview and it is believed William was concerned that they were putting too much emphasis on their love story and not enough on their charity work.\n\nThe book claims the brothers were \"at odds\" and that William was worried that the public were being shown too much of Harry's life with Meghan.\n\nThe revelations in the book are likely to raise eyebrows and the fact that Prince Harry has made the claims in his own autobiography will no doubt stir some strong emotions among royal fans.\n\nThe book also reveals details of other fallouts between the brothers, including a disagreement over the christening of Prince Louis, Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from royal duties, and Prince Harry's refusal to be drawn into the debate around who would walk his wife down the aisle when she married Prince Harry in 2018.\n\nThe book is due to be released on August 11 and has already been billed as the most comprehensive, authoritative and intimate account of the Sussexes' life and decision to step back as senior royals.\n\nThe authors also claim to have obtained exclusive access to the couple and their inner circle of friends, and as a result, this book promises to be an insightful and revealing look at the life of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe palace has not yet commented on the claims made in the book, but it is expected that a statement will be released once the book is published.\n\nThis is not the first time Prince Harry has spoken out about his relationship with his brother.

Moscow has denied the allegations and instead argued that it is providing humanitarian assistance to civilians in the east.\n\nIn addition to the cease-fire, Putin called for the release of all prisoners of war, the restoration of Ukraine's full sovereignty and territorial integrity and the creation of a buffer zone along the Russian-Ukrainian border.\n\nIn response to Putin's statement, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he welcomed the cease-fire but added that it must be followed by a \"political process\" for a lasting peace.\n\nThe European Union also welcomed the cease-fire and said it was a step in the right direction but that the details of the agreement still needed to be clarified.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been a major source of tension between Russia and the West, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Moscow in response to its actions in Ukraine.\n\nThe cease-fire could potentially lead to an end to the conflict, but experts warn that much work still needs to be done to secure lasting peace in Ukraine.\n\nOnly time will tell if the cease-fire will hold, but for now, it is a sign of hope that Christmas could bring an end to the suffering in Ukraine.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "As the end of the year approaches and New Year\u2019s resolutions begin to fill our minds, many of us start to consider our lives and how to best plan for our future. Among the thoughts of what we can do to protect ourselves and our family, life insurance is often considered.\n\nFor those who are in search of a reliable and comprehensive life insurance policy, American Family Insurance offers an excellent option. Their life insurance plans come with many great benefits and features, so we wanted to take a closer look in this review. Read on to learn more about what American Family Insurance can offer you and your family.\n\nAmerican Family Insurance Life Insurance Overview\n\nAmerican Family Insurance offers life insurance plans ranging from term to permanent coverage. These policies are designed to help protect you, your loved ones and your finances. American Family Insurance is also committed to providing its customers with exceptional customer service and helping them understand the process of obtaining life insurance coverage.\n\nAmerican Family Insurance provides both traditional and contemporary life insurance plans. For the traditional plans, these plans are based on the whole life model and are designed to help you build up cash value over time. These policies can help you pass on valuable benefits to your heirs, such as helping to pay for college tuition, medical expenses and more.\n\nThe contemporary plans are designed to provide coverage and protection for a set term or period of time. These plans are often preferred by those who are looking to cover only a specific debt, such as a mortgage loan.\n\nAmerican Family Insurance Life Insurance Benefits\n\nAmerican Family Insurance life insurance plans come with a variety of benefits, including:\n\n\u2022 Flexible payment options: Customers can choose the payment frequency that best meets their needs, with options that include monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annually.\n\n\u2022 Competitive rates: American Family Insurance provides some of the most competitive rates in the industry, so customers can get the best coverage for the best rate.\n\n\u2022 Family discount: Customers may be eligible for a family discount if multiple family members are insured through American Family Insurance.\n\n\u2022 Free life insurance reviews: American Family Insurance offers free life insurance reviews to help customers better understand their policy and make sure they are getting the coverage they need.\n\n\u2022 Tailored coverage: Customers can customize their coverage to ensure they have the coverage that best meets their needs.\n\n\u2022 Online access: Customers have 24/7 access to their life insurance policy and can easily track their payments and make changes to their coverage.\n\n\u2022 Discounts: American Family Insurance provides discounts for certain groups, such as those over the age of 50.\n\n\u2022 Optional riders: Customers have the option of adding additional riders to their policy, such as accelerated death benefits and children\u2019s coverage, to their policy to provide additional coverage.\n\n\u2022 Financial advisors: Customers have access to experienced financial advisors who can help them make the best decision when it comes to selecting a life insurance plan.\n\nIn addition to the above benefits, American Family Insurance also offers death benefits that can help provide for your loved ones in the event of your death. These benefits include a one-time lump sum, which can be used to pay for funeral expenses or other debts.\n\nAmerican Family Insurance Life Insurance Coverage\n\nAmerican Family Insurance offers a wide range of life insurance coverage options to meet the needs of its customers. Customers can choose from term, whole, universal and variable life insurance policies.\n\nTerm life insurance policies provide coverage for a set period of time, usually between 10 and 30 years. During this period, if the insured person dies, the policy pays a death benefit to the beneficiary.\n\nWhole life insurance policies offer coverage for your entire life. These policies also build up cash value over time and often offer additional benefits, such as a death benefit and living benefits.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies are more flexible than traditional policies and offer adjustable premiums and death benefits. These policies also accumulate cash value that can be used for retirement income or supplemental life insurance.\n\nVariable life insurance policies are similar to universal policies but are more complex. These policies offer the ability to invest in stocks, bonds and other securities and provide both death benefits and the ability to accumulate cash value over time.\n\nHow to Purchase American Family Insurance Life Insurance\n\nPurchasing life insurance from American Family Insurance is a simple process. Customers can get a free life insurance review by calling 1-800-507-6827 and speaking with an experienced financial advisor.

{"text": ".\n\nWith one week left in the regular season, the Chicago Bears' hopes of making the playoffs have taken a major hit. On Tuesday, news broke that rookie quarterback Justin Fields had suffered a hip injury and was expected to miss this week's matchup with the Minnesota Vikings. As a result, veteran backup Nathan Peterman is expected to start for the Bears on Sunday.\n\nThe news about Fields came as a surprise as he had been playing well as the Bears' starting quarterback over the past few weeks. Fields had taken over from Mitchell Trubisky as the team's starter in Week 11 and had been instrumental in helping the Bears win three of their last four games. Heading into the Week 16 showdown with Minnesota, the Bears were 7-7 and were in the midst of a three-way tie for the seventh and final spot in the NFC playoffs.\n\nFields' hip injury is a major blow to the Bears' playoff hopes, as the rookie had been playing very well in recent weeks. He had completed 67 percent of his passes and had thrown for 931 yards and four touchdowns in his five starts. He had also been a major threat on the ground, rushing for two touchdowns and 221 yards.\n\nWithout Fields under center, the Bears will have to rely on Nathan Peterman, who signed with the team earlier this season after the injury to starting quarterback Nick Foles. Peterman has only seen action in one game this season, completing 4-of-6 passes for 38 yards in relief of Foles against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe news of Fields' injury comes as the Bears are set to face off against the Vikings in a pivotal Week 16 matchup. With a win, the Bears would put themselves in position to make the playoffs for the first time since the 2018 season. But with Peterman starting at quarterback, the team's chances of doing so seem slim.\n\nThe Bears are still hopeful that Fields will be able to play on Sunday despite the injury, but it seems unlikely that he will be ready to go in time. With the playoffs still within reach, the Bears will have to hope that Peterman can pull off a miraculous upset victory to keep their playoff hopes alive.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Workday said on Tuesday that co-CEO Chano Fernandez is leaving the company and being replaced by Sequoia Capital's Carl Eschenbach, a former VMware executive and member of Workday's board.\n\nEschenbach will serve alongside Aneel Bhusri, who co-founded the company in 2005. Workday said Eschenbach is expected to become the company's sole CEO after January 2024, when Bhusri will move to the role of executive chair.\n\nWorkday shares fell 2% in extended trading after the announcement. The stock is down 37% this year.\n\nBhusri started Workday, which sells cloud-based human resources and financial software, with Dave Duffield and has since run the company with different co-CEOs for multiple periods. Bhusri and Duffield shared CEO responsibilities from 2009 to 2014, when Duffield stepped down. Bhusri became a co-CEO again in 2020 with the appointment of Fernandez, a former SAP executive who joined Workday in 2014.\n\nBefore Workday, Bhusri held leadership roles at PeopleSoft, which Oracle acquired in 2005 for $11.1 billion.\n\nEschenbach has spent close to seven years at Sequoia, sitting on the boards of cloud software companies Zoom , Snowflake and UiPath , which were all in the firm's portfolio.

{"text": "Apple's once-unimaginable market capitalization fell below $2 trillion Friday, a sign that the red-hot rally in technology stocks may finally be coming to an end.\n\nThe stock was down 4.4%, or $14.34 a share, at the open of trading Friday and has now fallen more than 20% from its September high of $133. The decline put Apple's market cap below $2 trillion for the first time in months, at $1.99 trillion.\n\nThe sell-off started in mid-December, when investors began selling Apple shares after news of a software bug that could potentially cause iPhones to be slower. That bug was eventually fixed, but the sell-off continued, and Apple's stock has fallen steadily in the weeks since.\n\nThe sell-off appears to be part of a broader market correction, as investors have become increasingly nervous about the sustainability of the technology sector's meteoric rise. The Nasdaq Composite Index is down more than 4% this week, and more than 6% from its August high.\n\nThe sell-off has been felt across the tech sector, with many other tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet all seeing their stocks decline in recent weeks.\n\nThe sell-off has raised fears of a broader economic slowdown. Tech stocks have been seen as a barometer of the economy, so if they're falling it's seen as a sign that the economy is slowing down.\n\nBut, despite the market sell-off, Apple still has a lot going for it. The company is the world's most valuable publicly-traded company and it has a strong portfolio of products, from the iPhone and iPad to the Mac and Apple Watch.\n\nApple is also continuing to invest in new products and services, such as its upcoming AirPods Max and its Apple Card credit card. These new products could help Apple continue to grow in the coming years.\n\nDespite the current market sell-off, Apple still has the potential to remain one of the world's most valuable companies. The company's management team has proven itself time and time again to be able to weather market downturns, and they have the track record and resources to continue to do so.\n\nFor now, however, the market is reacting to Apple's recent share price decline and investors are watching to see what Apple does next. If the company can successfully weather the current sell-off, then its market cap could once again rise above $2 trillion.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In Its Final Season\n\nWhen Random Acts Of Flyness made its debut on HBO in 2018, it was instantly celebrated as an essential representation of the Black experience. With its innovative blend of sketch comedy, short films, and music videos, the series championed African-American artistry, exploring stories of trauma, identity, and what it means to be Black in America. \n\nNow in its final season, creator and star Terence Nance is pulling out all the stops to showcase the creativity of Black people everywhere. From conversations on Black culture to conversations with community activists and powerful spiritual leaders, the show has covered a wide range of topics from spiritual advice and intimate relationship dynamics to pop culture and politics. \n\nAnd now, in the fourth and final season, Nance has shifted his focus to a more macro level. Rather than focusing on individual stories of Black people, Nance is utilizing the power of television to remind viewers of the collective impact of Blackness on American culture. \n\nOne episode that is particularly effective in accomplishing this is \u201cWhat We Believe.\u201d The episode follows two young Black women as they explore the art, beauty, and power of African-American spirituality. \n\nThe women visit several places of worship and speak to spiritual leaders who provide insight into their beliefs, values, and practices. From the African Yoruba traditions of Santeria and Haitian Vodou to the revolutionary Muslim concepts of the Five Percenters, the episode demonstrates the many religious beliefs held by African-Americans, while highlighting the importance of incorporating spirituality into daily life. \n\nNance also shines a light on the importance of Black love and romance. In the episode \u201cSomething That You Need\u201d he follows three couples who, through their stories, remind viewers of the power of committed relationships. While one couple is dealing with infidelity, another must overcome family pressure in order to be together, and the third is stuck in a toxic cycle of arguing.\n\nThe show also pays homage to Black culture in \u201cA Night of Ecstasy and Reflection,\u201d an exploration of underground performance spaces in the late 90s. This episode highlights the works of several influential African-American artists such as Big Freedia, who paved the way for the bounce music genre, and Esthero, who introduced spoken-word into R&B music. \n\nThe episode celebrates their work and explores how these artists, and their art forms, have influenced popular culture today. From gospel-inspired hip-hop to modern-day soul and R&B music, Nance paints a picture of the breadth and depth of Black musical creativity. \n\nThroughout Random Acts Of Flyness, Nance encourages viewers to think about the importance of Black culture and its influence on American society. By presenting stories from a variety of perspectives and backgrounds, he hopes to demonstrate that African-American contributions can, and should, be respected and celebrated. As he puts it, \u201cAll we ask for is a seat at the table.\u201d \n\nWith its final season, Random Acts Of Flyness has provided a powerful and meaningful platform for African-American stories and artistry, firmly establishing itself as an essential and invaluable contribution to the TV landscape. As Nance notes, \u201cWe\u2019re here to stay.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

Jon Tester of Montana and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both of whom sponsored the bipartisan bill, as well as Acting VA Secretary Dr. Richard Stone and other veterans service organizations.\n\n\"Our veterans made the promise to serve, and we must keep our promise to them,\" Biden said in his remarks at the White House. \"This bill helps us keep that promise, by delivering overdue benefits to those who have been exposed to toxic burn pits and other environmental exposures during their service.\"\n\nThe VA estimates that nearly 3.5 million veterans were potentially exposed to environmental hazards during their service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many developed cancers, respiratory illness and other chronic illnesses.\n\nThe House and Senate both passed the HAVEN Act, which was supported by lawmakers in both parties, with overwhelming bipartisan majorities earlier this summer.\n\n\"It was essential that both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, worked together and put party lines aside to make sure our nation\u2019s heroes get the care they deserve and need,\" Biden said.\n\nThe bill expands benefits and resources to veterans who suffer from diseases linked to burn pits and other environmental exposures, including PTSD, respiratory illnesses, cancers and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIt also provides a new priority system for veterans in the VA healthcare system, allowing those diagnosed with illnesses linked to environmental exposures to access specialty health care and services more quickly.\n\nThe bill also ensures that veterans are not financially responsible for medical treatment for their burn pit illnesses.\n\n\"We've got to make sure our veterans get the very best care and services that our nation can provide, and the HAVEN Act is a major step forward in that effort,\" Tester said in a statement after the president signed the bill.\n\n\"It will provide a much-needed safety net to veterans and families dealing with the effects of toxic exposures, giving them access to quality healthcare, quality benefits and economic security,\" Sinema said in a statement.\n\nThe legislation also expands the definition of burn pits to include open-air burnings, which are known to contribute to illnesses.\n\nAnd for the first time, the bill will provide disability ratings for veterans with \"latent illnesses\" \u2014 which are illnesses that are the result of environmental exposures but may not show symptoms for years.\n\n\"This law is not a silver bullet, but it\u2019s a major step forward,\" Biden said. \"It\u2019s long overdue and it will go a long way towards making sure that those who served their nation in war, can rely on their country when they come home.\"", "label": "machine"}

The blame game at Goldman Sachs.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n\nWhen things were going good, Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon could seemingly do no wrong. Last year, thanks to a booming M&A market and a favorable trading environment, life was good at the elite Wall Street bank.\n\nSure, there were some signs of trouble within Goldman's consumer business, as Insider reported at the time, but who could be bothered worrying about that. Everyone \u2014 even the juniors \u2014 was making money!\n\nFast forward to today and boy are things different. The M&A market has been about as quiet as a church mouse, the consumer division is on its last legs, layoffs have hit the bank, and the juniors are getting worked to the bone again.\n\nAs if all that wasn't bad enough, word has come down that bankers shouldn't get their hopes up about year-end bonuses. And while most banks plan on handing out lighter payouts, Goldman's are shaping up to be considerably smaller compared with last year.\n\nBut, considering the amount of external factors at play \u2014 rising interest rates and a slumping economy \u2014 and the fact that 2021 was such a banner year, I'm sure everyone will take this in stride. After all, their base compensation is far and above what the average American can dream of making. Right?\n\nNot quite.\n\nInsider's Dakin Campbell and Emmalyse Brownstein report that the finger pointing internally is already starting ahead of what is set to be a brutal bonus season.\n\nSome insiders are blaming investment bankers, who enjoyed extra-large payouts in 2021 thanks to a record year in M&A but now aren't being asked to bear the brunt of the lower bonuses despite a lack of deal flow.\n\nHowever, the true target internally, according to Dakin's and Emmalyse's reporting, is Solomon and his failed push into consumer banking.\n\nAs Dakin and Emmalyse point out, the real risk here is defection. Traditionally, the end of bonus season marks the beginning of people-moves season, as folks start considering new gigs. A lower-than-expected bonus only adds fuel to that fire.\n\nWe won't have to wait long to see how things shake out. Fourth-quarter and full-year earnings will come in mid-January, followed by an investor day scheduled for the end of February.\n\nClick here to read more about the turmoil at Goldman ahead of bonus season.\n\nIn other news:\n\niStock; Vicky Leta/Insider\n\n2.

{"text": "Sea levels are rising steadily each year as the planet warms.\n\nMelting ice could collapse suddenly, raising sea levels abruptly.\n\nThese melting glaciers and ice sheets are the ones scientists are watching most closely.\n\nThe Earth's ice is, rightly, often in the news. As the planet and its oceans warm, our so-called cryosphere is quickly melting away.\n\nThere are two factors that lead to sea level rise: the water expanding as it gets warmer and added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers.\n\n\n\nMelting ice that could tip sea level rise into catastrophic levels\n\nSource: NASA Ice Viewer\n\nChart: Annie Fu/Insider\n\nWhile it's easier to plan for a steady sea level rise, scientists are very concerned about what would happen if huge chunks of ice collapse and abruptly change sea levels.\n\nHere are the sites around the world scientists are keeping a close eye on, and why they are important, according to Alex Brisbourne, a Glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey, and Theodore Scambos, an Antarctic researcher at the University of Colorado.\n\nGlaciers\n\nGlaciers will be the first to go.\n\nThough they will contribute comparatively little to sea level rise \u2014 adding about a foot to global mean sea levels if they melt completely \u2014 glaciers outside of Greenland and Antarctica have been the main contributors to higher seas over the past century, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nCatastrophic collapse \u2014 Columbia Glacier in Alaska\n\nGlaciers took centuries to freeze over, but they can disappear in a few years. When they start breaking apart, that triggers a negative feedback loop: the meltwater warms the glacier, which creates more meltwater.\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe Columbia Glacier in Alaska is one of the most recognizable examples of rapid glacier collapse. This glacier has almost completely disappeared today.\n\n\"It's an example of how this will play out for many coastal glaciers,\" Scambos told Insider in an email.\n\nAlbedo \u2014 Presena Glacier in the Alps, Europe\n\nGlaciers are not only important because they store water away from the oceans. Because they are light-colored, they bounce back a lot of light back into space. This effect, called the albedo of the ice, is crucial because it keeps sunlight from warming the earth.\n\nA man walks on pink-colored snow, supposedly due to the presence of colonies of algae of the species Ancylonela nordenskioeldii from Greenland, at the Presena glacier near Pellizzano, July 4, 2020. Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images\n\nScientists studying the albedo of the glaciers have discovered a peculiar effect of the melt. Colorful glacial and snow algae have been growing in the glacier meltwater, creating pink and purple spectacles on the ice, like at the Presena Glacier in the Alps. The problem is that reduces the albedo of the glacier, which again encourages warming and melting.\n\nFreshwater \u2014 Hindu Kush Himalayan glaciers, Central Asia\n\nGlaciers are also a vital source of freshwater. Over a billion people living in central Asian countries rely on the Hindu-Kush Himalayan glaciers for drinking water, and scientists discovered recently that these glaciers are rapidly declining, causing concern.\n\nA general view of the Chiatibo glacier in the Hindu Kush mountain range on October 16, 2019 in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhunkwa Province, Pakistan. Pool /Samir Hussein/WireImage / Getty\n\n\"It's gonna peak in around 2050. Beyond that point, you start to get less melt,\" AB said.\n\nGeopolitical experts are concerned this dwindling resource could cause tensions in neighboring countries.\n\nGreenland and Antarctica\n\nThe ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are essentially humongous glaciers that cover the poles. They contain most of the freshwater on the Earth's surface.\n\nThe Antarctic ice sheet is much bigger than the ice sheet on Greenland. If they were to melt totally, the Greenland ice sheet would contribute about 23 ft to the sea levels, while the Antarctic ice sheet holds enough ice to raise sea levels by 58 feet. Of course, this isn't predicted to happen for centuries.\n\nThe other big difference is that the Greenland ice sheet rests on solid land above sea level, whereas much of the Antarctic ice sheet is below sea level, which makes it more vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures.\n\nGreenland\n\nGreenland is currently melting about twice as quickly as the Antarctic ice sheet, per the IPCC.\n\nAs the atmosphere around the North Pole warms, any ice below about 2,000 meters altitude (about 6,500 feet) is at risk of collapsing, said Brisbourne.\n\n\"The problem here is that as you melt, you're thinning the ice and that brings more ice below 2,000 meters,\" he said.\n\nThis is happening over the entirety of the Greenland ice sheet, as can be seen in this NASA animation.\n\nThe Ilulissat glacier, also known as Jakobshavn, is a glacier that scientists are following closely on the west coast of Greenland, where the ice sheet is melting more quickly.\n\n\n\nIlulissant Glacier, also known as Jakobshavn\n\nIce flows through ice sheets like very slow rivers. Carried by its weight, the ice falls from the top of the glacier to the lowest point. In a perfect equilibrium, there's enough snow fall to replenish the ice sheet, but that balance comes out of whack when the ice is melting away too quickly, snowfall is not sufficient, or rain is falling instead of snow.\n\nWhen this happened, the ice sheet beings to thin and the glaciers at the edge of the sheet retreat, as can be seen below.\n\nAntarctica\n\nThe Antarctic ice sheet, found at the South Pole, is about eight times bigger than the Greenland sheet.\n\nBecause so much of this ice sheet is below sea level, it is much more affected by the temperature of the ocean, which has been warming.\n\nScientists break down this ice sheet into three parts: the peninsula, west Antarctica, and east Antarctica.\n\nAntarctic Peninsula \u2014 Larsen-A and -B\n\nThe peninsula is much more affected by the temperature of the atmosphere than other areas of the Antarctic, Brisbourne said.\n\nIn 2002, scientists watched helplessly as an ice shelf called Larsen-B collapsed into the ocean in a matter of weeks.\n\nBetween January 31 and April 13, 2002, about 500 billion tonnes of pack ice and snow disintegrated into the ocean.\n\nThis was less than a decade after another ice shelf in the area, Larsen-A, also disintegrated.\n\nIce shelves don't contribute to sea level rise when they melt. Because they float, they occupy the same volume in the sea, whether they are frozen or melted, just like an ice cube doesn't raise the water level in a glass when it melts.\n\nHowever, ice shelves stabilize the glaciers and ice sheets that are behind them. Without their ice shelves, the Larsen-A and -B glaciers started melting much more quickly, releasing three times more ice into the ocean than they did before.\n\nLarsen-B's collapse was likely caused by melt ponds, Brisbourne said.\n\nMeltponds appear when the warming atmosphere causes meltwater to accumulate at the surface of the ice. As they grow, their weight cracks the ice and can lead to the collapse of the ice shelf, a process called hydrofracturing.\n\nMelt ponds seen from above. NASA Earth Observatory/Courtesy of the MABEL team\n\nBecause there wasn't much ice in the Antarctic peninsula to start, losing these ice shelves did not change global sea levels much.\n\nBut these losses are seen as \"the canary in the coal mine\" for Antarctica, said Brisbourne.\n\nWest Antarctica \u2014 The Doomsday (Thwaites) glacier and Pine Island\n\nScientists are much more concerned about west Antarctica. The ice sheet in West Antarctica rests on bedrock under sea level, meaning it is much more vulnerable to the warming of the ocean.\n\nWest Antartic ice flows through several glaciers, including the Pine Island glacier, the Dodson glacier, and the Thwaites glacier. These act as buffers between the ice sheet and the warming oceans.\n\nScientists are really concerned that Thwaites is holding on \"by its fingernails\", giving it its nickname \u2014 the \"doomsday glacier.\" The ice sheet in front of Thwaites is crackling and it is thought the glacier could collapse within the decade.\n\n\"We think that potentially if we lose Thwaites area, this whole west Antarctica ice sheet part of Antarctica could follow,\" said Brisbourne.\n\nThat could add up to 10 feet to global sea levels.\n\nBut there's still hope.\n\nPine Island was collapsing more quickly than Thwaites, but it slowed down, Brisbourne said. What scientists hadn't expected is that the ice sheet would catch on a small island off the coast of Antarctica, which has slowed the speed of its collapse.\n\nEast Antarctica \u2014 Conger Ice Shelf\n\nThe east side of Antarctica is thought to be fairly stable.\n\n\"East Antarctica is a bit more like Greenland in that it sits above sea level. So it's not been influenced much by the warming ocean and the atmosphere hasn't warmed as much,\" said Brisbourne.\n\nEast Antarctica has enough ice to raise sea levels by about 52 meters altogether, so if it were to collapse, it'd be fairly catastrophic. But Brisbourne says scientists don't expect that to happen for a very very long time.\n\nStill, scientists were stunned to see an ice shelf called Conger collapse on the east side of Antarctica earlier this year. Conger was not under surveillance by most scientists. Indeed, Brisbourne said most of his colleagues had never heard of it.\n\n\"It's a very small ice shelf and it is fed by a glacier that drains a very small area. So in terms of the contribution sea level rise, it's actually gonna be very small,\" he said.\n\n\"But again, it's one of these warning signs that in this area we're starting to see processes that we know have affected other parts of the continent and led to a fairly dramatic loss of ice,\" said Brisbourne.\n\nOther effects of ice melt\n\nThere are more indirect effects of the melting ice on sea level rise.\n\nArctic sea ice\n\nEvery winter, water in the Arctic ocean freezes over, capping our planet in white over the winter and receding over the summer.\n\nBut the expanse of that white cap in the winter has been getting smaller every year.\n\nAn animation the minimum size of the Arctic sea ice measured each year since 1979. NASA Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nBecause this ice is already in the sea, it won't raise the sea level if it melts. But, like the glaciers, its declining reflective albedo contributes to more warming within the atmosphere.\n\nPermafrost \u2014 Russian Tundra\n\nPermafrost, ground that is meant to stay frozen throughout the year, doesn't directly contribute to sea level rise when it thaws. But as the ground gets warmer, pools of water called thermokarsts start forming.\n\nThese are full of methane, a potent climate-worsening gas. It's not clear how much these pools could contribute to climate change.\n\nLocal sea level variation\n\nGlobal mean sea level rise is only a snapshot of the whole picture.\n\nBecause sea levels are influenced by the local environment, the sea level rise can be much higher locally than it is on a global scale.\n\nThe east coast of the US, for instance, is due to have higher sea levels than the west coast, in part because of the slowing gulf stream.\n\nLocal gravity variation \u2014 Antarctica's gravity pull\n\nGravity is another important consideration when it comes to sea level rise.\n\nIce sheets are so big that they can pull water towards them, raising sea levels locally, Brisbourne said.\n\nIf Greenland melts, \"sea-level rise will be greatest in the southern hemisphere, and if Antarctica melts then sea-level rise will be greatest in the northern hemisphere,\" wrote Pippa Whitehouse, a glaciologist from Durham University, in a blog post.\n\nThe glaciers are also weighing down the planet, squishing the Earth's crust at the poles.\n\nThat pressure will disappear when the ice sheets melt, which will influence the rotation, shape, and gravity of the Earth. This effect, called post-glacial rebound, has already started to appear. A study published in 2021 found that melting glaciers had already led to a small wobble of the Earth's axis.", "label": "human"}

The Wi-Fi-only Edge, with an already-announced price of $399.99, will be available starting Jan. 26. The Edge features a Qualcomm Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 processor with a Kyro CPU and Adreno GPU, a 6.8-inch 2,400-by-1,080 144Hz AMOLED screen, Wi-Fi 6E, and comes with the Razer Kishi V2 Pro clip-on controller. It will be exclusively available through Razer.com and at RazerStores(Opens in a new window).\n\nIf you want the 5G Edge, you'll have to go through Verizon for it. The device (which is otherwise identical to the Wi-Fi version) takes advantage of Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband mmWave service for the highest speeds and lowest latency available. Since mmWave is relatively short-range and works best with line-of-sight, the 5G Edge also supports sub-6 midband 5G, which is slower but more reliable over longer distances.\n\nThe 5G Edge will retail for $599.99 from Verizon, but the provider is offering a promotion that cuts the tablet down to $359.99 with the addition of a new line, or $179.99 with the purchase of a new 5G smartphone.\n\nAlso at CES, meanwhile, Razer expanded its Blade gaming laptop line with two new 16- and-18-inch screen sizes.

{"text": "It's been a strange year for the stock market. Stocks have soared despite record losses for companies large and small. But beneath the surface, there is a disturbing trend that has only become more evident in the last few months. \n\nEarnings estimates are falling fast. \n\nAnalysts are widely forecasting that 2020 earnings for the S&P 500 will drop 10%, a nearly 8% drop from when estimates began the year. It's a stark contrast to the stock market, which has gained more than 8% since January.\n\nThis bad combination of rising stocks and falling earnings estimates is causing some concern among investors and strategists.\n\n\"It's really a weird mix we have going on right now,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \"What we're seeing is that while stocks are trading near all-time highs, earnings estimates are falling.\"\n\nAnalysts say the dichotomy is due to a number of factors. Most notably, the stock market has been buoyed by extremely accommodative monetary and fiscal policy. Companies have been able to tap into an array of liquidity options to keep them afloat.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed earlier this year, provided an additional financial lifeline to businesses of all sizes, as well as tax breaks and other measures to offset some of the impacts from the pandemic.\n\nBut while the stock market has received a boost from this government support, the economy is still being hurt by the virus. According to Bank of America, U.S. GDP contracted 32.9% in the second quarter of this year.\n\nThe economic downturn is taking a toll on corporate earnings. While some companies, such as Apple and Amazon, have reported strong profits in the last quarter, many more have either reported losses or seen their profits shrink. \n\nEarnings estimates have been falling all year, but the pace of the decline has accelerated in recent months. Analysts are now forecasting that 2020 earnings for the S&P 500 will drop 10%.\n\nThe outlook for 2021 is even worse. Analysts are now expecting earnings to fall by nearly 18% in 2021. The sharp declines suggest that companies will continue to feel the impact of the pandemic for some time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that analysts often underestimate the impact of economic downturns on corporate earnings, so their estimates could end up being worse than expected.\n\nThe disconnect between stocks and earnings is setting up a risky situation for investors. With earnings estimates falling and stock prices still rising, investors need to be aware of the risks they are taking on.\n\n\"The market is at a crucial inflection point right now, where stocks are continuing to rise but earnings estimates are quickly falling,\" said Hogan. \"It's a dangerous combination, and investors need to be careful as they enter the fourth quarter.\"\n\nAlthough the outlook is gloomy, there is hope that the economy will start to recover in 2021 as the vaccine rollouts get underway and more stimulus is passed. \n\nStill, the current environment presents a difficult situation for investors. Stocks are rising, but earnings estimates are falling fast. It's a bad combination that could spell trouble for investors if the trend continues.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Good riddance, 2022. Tuesday officially marked the start of a new year on Wall Street, and while there is no guarantee 2023 will be a great one for stocks, for now it's nice to turn the page on the worst year since 2008 . After recently highlighting Club holdings that analysts tapped as their top picks for 2023, we wanted to take the Street's temperature on our stocks in a different way. So, we screened our portfolio to find the holdings that are rated buy or overweight by at least 75% of relevant analysts, and also have a 15% upside to those analysts' average price target based on where the stock closed on the final trading day of 2022. These are the 10 stocks that match our specific criteria, according to data from FactSet, in order from the highest-to-lowest percentage of buy or overweight ratings: Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL) Microsoft (MSFT) Halliburton (HAL) Walt Disney (DIS) Humana (HUM) Wells Fargo (WFC) Salesforce (CRM) Constellation Brands (STZ) Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Amazon Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 92% Upside to average price target: 60.9% Analysts expect Amazon to bounce back in a big way after shares tumbled nearly 50% last year. We've continued to stay invested in the ecommerce and cloud-computing giant, but have been clear about what we need to see from management in the coming months \u2014 namely, more robust discipline on costs. That's key for Amazon shares to make a meaningful move higher in the face of growing recession fears. Alphabet Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 92% Upside to average price target: 40.1% Like with Amazon, the Street continues to stand with Google parent Alphabet, despite a 39.1% decline in its share price in 2022. Similar to Amazon, we want to see Alphabet rationalize its hiring and spending because its main source of revenue \u2014 advertising \u2014 remains pressured by mounting economic headwinds. Microsoft Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 92% Upside to average price target: 22.2% Microsoft \u2014 the third mega-cap tech stock to make the list \u2014 is also well-liked by analysts following a year in which shares tumbled nearly 29%. Microsoft is one of the best-run companies out there, which allows us to see through any near-term macroeconomic challenges and focus on its long-term growth prospects, particularly in enterprise cloud computing. We may be looking to book some profits if the stock climbs toward the $300 level, after ending 2022 around $240 per share. Halliburton Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 86% Upside to average price target: 16.8% Halliburton was a big winner last year, climbing 72% in 2022, and the vast majority of analysts who cover the company believe it can go even higher, even if gains are more muted this year. While day-to-day oil price fluctuations may at times test our conviction in our energy investments \u2014 West Texas Intermediate crude closed down more than 3.7% Tuesday \u2014 Halliburton's multiyear growth story remains intact. We also believe it boasts pricing power, a key attribute for this current economic environment . Walt Disney Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 82% Upside to average price target: 37.7% Analysts expect some magic to return to Disney following a miserable 44% slide in 2022. We hope so, too, now that Bob Iger is back as CEO . Iger should help steady the ship, especially on Disney's money-losing streaming side. Humana Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 80% Upside to average price target: 19.5% Humana is the only Club holding besides Halliburton to post share gains in 2022 and land on Tuesday's top-10 screen. Many of the same factors that fueled Humana's outperformance last year, with the stock rising 10.4%, are still relevant and explain why we added to our position in the health insurer earlier Tuesday . Those reasons include a lack of economic sensitivity and limited exposure to the strong U.S. dollar . Wells Fargo Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 79% Upside to average price target: 30.9% Despite fears of a U.S. recession on the horizon, most analysts view Wells Fargo favorably. The bank's shares outperformed the S & P 500 last year, falling only 13.9% compared with the index's roughly 19% slide. Even as we await the full dissipation of the regulatory cloud that hovers over Wells Fargo , it's one of the best-capitalized banks in the U.S. and poised to benefit from higher interest rates. Salesforce Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 78% Upside to average price target: 47.2% Add Salesforce to the list of beaten-up tech stocks that most analysts expect to recover in 2023. Salesforce shares fell almost 48% last year, a steep decline we admittedly didn't expect. We'll be looking to see if the value-creation potential that activist investor Starboard sees in Salesforce starts to materialize in 2023, while Mark Benioff resumes his prior role as sole CEO . Constellation Brands Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 78% Upside to average price target: 18.8% The maker of Corona and Modelo beer also held up much better than the S & P in 2022, declining only 7.7%. We still believe Constellation's business should prove relatively durable in an economic slowdown, and added to our position right before the holidays. Advanced Micro Devices Percentage of analysts with a buy/overweight rating: 76% Upside to average price target: 35.7% Of the 10 stocks on this list, AMD saw the biggest decline in 2022. The chipmaker's shares sank 55%. However, most analysts expect its fortunes to improve this year, after having been weighed down by soft demand in end markets like PCs. The chip industry does not seem to be out of the woods yet , but we're continuing to back AMD over the long term. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

{"text": "On the night of November 18th, skywatchers will be treated to a remarkable celestial show, as the moon moves across the face of the Sun in what is known as a total lunar eclipse. This particular eclipse will be especially noteworthy, as it is being heralded as the \u201cvoting eclipse\u201d.\n\nThe phenomenon will be visible from every continent in the world, as well as from much of the United States. During the eclipse, the moon will be completely eclipsed by the sun, appearing red or orange in color due to the filtering of the sun\u2019s light through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. While the exact timing of the eclipse will vary by location, the total eclipse is expected to peak at 8:27 pm PST.\n\nFor many, the total lunar eclipse is seen as a reminder of the importance of voting, particularly in an election year as contentious as this one. Many have taken to social media to encourage others to make sure they get out and cast their ballots, even if they can\u2019t view the eclipse directly.\n\nThe eclipse is being heralded as the \u201cvoting eclipse\u201d for good reason. During the last total lunar eclipse in the United States, in January 2019, the percentage of registered voters who participated in the 2018 midterms was the highest it had been in decades.\n\nThis year, millions of Americans are determined to make their voices heard by casting their ballots in the upcoming November election. The voting eclipse will serve as a reminder that voting is an important way to make sure that their voices are heard and their values are reflected in the policies and decisions of the United States government.\n\nFor those that want to take part in the celestial spectacle of a total lunar eclipse, but can\u2019t make it outside in person, there are plenty of ways to experience the event virtually. The Virtual Telescope Project will be providing a live stream of the eclipse on their website, while Slooh will be streaming their coverage of the eclipse through their app. The Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles will also be providing a live stream of the eclipse.\n\nIn addition to the live streams, stargazers can find plenty of resources online that can help them understand and experience the eclipse, including interactive maps, educational videos, and guides to the best viewing spots. There are even virtual eclipse parties, where people can join in the eclipse fun and celebrate the importance of voting.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an amateur stargazer or a seasoned professional, the November total lunar eclipse is sure to be a memorable event that should not be missed. For those unable to view the eclipse in person, there are plenty of ways to experience the event remotely, while reminding themselves of the importance of voting.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "For the Bills' Damar Hamlin, this NFL season was an opportunity to 'cherish'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Timothy T Ludwig/Getty Images Timothy T Ludwig/Getty Images\n\nDamar Hamlin had dreamed so long of playing in the NFL that when he was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 2021, he said he'd still be happy even if his only contribution was as a water boy.\n\nThe scouting report on the star defensive back from the University of Pittsburgh said he had great instincts and a nose for the ball, but that he was undersized and perhaps a bit slow.\n\nAs a result, Hamlin had fallen all the way to the sixth round, where the Bills picked him up as the 212th overall pick.\n\nHamlin didn't mind.\n\n\"I'm willing to do whatever just to be a contributor on the team, man. I don't care if it's I gotta pass out water at halftime,\" he said to reporters after the draft. \"No matter what it is, I'm willing to do it. I don't got no pride.\"\n\nHamlin, 24, has started 13 games for the Bills this season, including Monday night's tragic matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, where a seemingly routine tackle in the first quarter apparently caused him to go into cardiac arrest. He remains in the ICU at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, according to team officials.\n\nBefore Monday, the 2022 season had been a bittersweet ride for Hamlin, filled both with the opportunity of a lifetime and uncomfortable reminders of the perils of football.\n\n\"It feels so surreal. Like I can't even describe it. But I cherish it every second that I can, every second of every day,\" Hamlin said in a Bills media interview last fall.\n\nIn his first season, Hamlin didn't see the field much. The Bills depth chart was too full of Pro Bowl-caliber defensive backs like Tre'Davious White and Micah Hyde.\n\nYet Hamlin saw that as a positive, he would say later.\n\n\"Me and my family, we all seen it as the perfect opportunity to be able to come in and learn,\" he said in a Bills media interview in November. \"Some rookies, they have the pressure of having to get out there right away. And they might burn their wick short because they might not be ready for their moment.\"\n\nInstead, his chance would come in 2022.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joshua Bessex/Getty Images Joshua Bessex/Getty Images\n\nA pair of injuries sidelined teammates but opened the door for Hamlin\n\nBefore Hamlin's collapse in Monday night's game, a different Bills player was rushed off the field in an ambulance after an injury.\n\nThat was in September, when cornerback Dane Jackson took a gruesome-looking hit to the head and neck during a tackle in a game against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nHamlin and Jackson have known each other since they were children and have described each other as brothers. They played together for years at the University of Pittsburgh. When Hamlin was drafted by the Bills, he called it a \"dream come true\" to be reunited with his friend.\n\nHamlin watched as Jackson laid on the field receiving medical attention before being loaded on a stretcher and driven away.\n\nAnother Bills defensive back, Micah Hyde, was injured later in the same game. That meant it was time for Hamlin, who'd appeared on just two defensive snaps the week before. He put on his helmet and played most of the game's remaining minutes at safety.\n\nIn the locker room afterward, Hamlin told reporters it was \"real tough\" to come into the game so soon after watching a friend need medical attention. \"Because it's real-life stuff going on. Life is bigger than football,\" he said.\n\nJackson was later diagnosed with a minor neck injury and was cleared to play in October. But Hyde was ruled out for the season, and Hamlin has started every Bills game since.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joshua Bessex/Getty Images Joshua Bessex/Getty Images\n\n\"I cherish it every second that I can\"\n\nAfter that, Hamlin had seemed to take every opportunity to count his blessings, even as he racked up tackles, playing time and attention from fans and the media.\n\nAsked by a Bills reporter in November if there was any emotion between him and Jackson over the events of the season so far, Hamlin replied, \"Honestly, it's every day.\"\n\n\"Even just walking in the building first thing in the morning, you're feeling sleepy, you ain't charged up for the day,\" he and Jackson would build each other up, he said, reminding the other \"that we are where we wanted to be in the exact moment we wanted to have it.\"\n\nTo have an opportunity to play in the NFL, and to do so alongside Jackson after his frightening September injury, was a \"super blessing,\" Hamlin said.\n\nEarlier that month, Hamlin recounted, the Bills defensive backs had joined hands in a weekly group prayer. He and his old friend Jackson were standing at each other's sides.\n\n\"I just grabbed his hand a little bit harder, because you never know when the last day could be that you're getting to experience something like this,\" he said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Ukraine Rings in the New Year Under Russian Attack\n\nThe New Year has begun in Ukraine, but while the country is hoping for a better 2021, it will also begin the year under a prolonged attack from its neighbor and former superpower, Russia.\n\nRussian aggression against Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began a war in eastern Ukraine. This has included the build-up of troops and armaments along Ukraine's borders, regular provocations by Russian forces, cyber-attacks, and recently, the release of captured Ukrainian sailors, who had been in Russian custody since a 2018 incident in the Black Sea.\n\nIn response to the aggression, Ukraine has implemented a number of reforms to strengthen its security and promote its efforts towards European integration. It has also sought international support for its defensive efforts, although Russia has shown little sign of relenting in its campaign.\n\nThe past year saw little progress in resolving the conflict, with both sides unwilling to make any concessions. With the Biden administration set to take office in Washington, however, there is some hope that the US will be more willing to assist in resolving the crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainians are preparing to face another year of uncertainty, while they wait and see what the New Year brings. For now, they will continue to do what they can to prepare for the coming year, and hope that 2021 will bring some progress towards peace.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, the start of the New Year marks the continuation of a conflict that has already dragged on for too long. As they prepare to face yet another year under Russian attack, Ukrainians hope that the coming months will bring an end to the conflict, and a chance for peace and stability in the region.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has sought to use 2021 as an opportunity for reform and renewal, including increasing security measures, improving infrastructure, and fostering closer ties with the West. However, these efforts could be in vain unless Russian aggression is addressed.\n\nFortunately, there are signs that the international community is willing to step up its support for Ukraine. The US and European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia and have provided military assistance, while the UK and other nations have offered diplomatic support.\n\nThese measures have not been enough to end the conflict, but they have provided Ukraine with a valuable source of support. As the international community rallies around Ukraine, it is hoped that 2021 will bring the necessary diplomatic progress to bring an end to the crisis.\n\nUltimately, however, it will be up to the Ukrainian people to determine the course of the conflict. As they prepare to face another year under Russian attack, Ukrainians must continue to unite against the aggression, and remain hopeful that 2021 will bring progress towards peace.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "After estranged British Prince Harry and his brother Prince William appeared together after their grandmother\u2019s death last September, it may have seemed like the feuding royals would put the worst of their differences behind them. Not so fast.\n\nIn a shocking new revelation, Harry has alleged that William once physically attacked him over the former\u2019s marriage to Meghan Markle, according to the Guardian, which obtained a prerelease copy of Harry\u2019s forthcoming memoir in which the incident is reportedly detailed. The allegation represents the latest dramatic twist in the yearslong saga of the couple\u2019s acrimonious split from Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe Guardian reported on Thursday that a passage in Spare, which publishes January 10, asserts that in 2019 William showed up at Harry\u2019s home in London and \u201cknocked\u201d the younger prince to the floor during a heated conversation.\n\nThe book, believed by royal watchers to be a juicy tell-all of Harry and Meghan\u2019s dealings with the House of Windsor, has been kept closely under wraps by publisher Penguin Random House before it\u2019s set for worldwide release next week.\n\nSince their public stepback from royal duties in 2020, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have spoken out on their struggles within the so-called Firm, including dealing with mental health woes, British media vitriol, and alleged racism within the monarchy\u2019s circles. The Palace has steadfastly refused to comment on the couple\u2019s claims.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the newest allegation Harry has brought to light.\n\nHow does Harry describe what happened in London in 2019?\n\nBased on Harry\u2019s account, as reported by the Guardian, he and his brother had an argument at Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace. William had come over \u201cpiping hot\u201d to talk about Harry\u2019s \u201cwhole rolling catastrophe\u201d of his relationship with Meghan, as well as their issues with the British press, which has been critical of their marriage.\n\nWilliam allegedly called Meghan \u201cdifficult,\u201d \u201crude,\u201d and \u201cabrasive,\u201d to which Harry replied that his older brother was parroting false media narratives. Harry accused his brother of \u201cacting like an heir,\u201d and the two exchanged insults.\n\nAccording to the account, William claimed he was only trying to help, to which Harry then replied: \u201cAre you serious? Help me? Sorry \u2013 is that what you call this? Helping me?\u201d\n\nThat remark purportedly angered William, so Harry went to the kitchen to get him a glass of water. Harry retells that William, who was tailing him, set down the water and then \u201ccame at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all happened so fast. So very fast,\u201d Harry reportedly writes in his memoir. \u201cHe grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dog\u2019s bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.\u201d\n\nHarry reportedly writes that William urged him to hit back, but he refused. According to the story, William left the cottage though he returned shortly after to apologize; then he left again but not before saying that Harry did not \u201cneed to tell Meg about this\u201d\u2014referring to the altercation.\n\nMeghan is said to have later discovered the \u201cscrapes and bruises\u201d on Harry\u2019s back, which prompted him to disclose the fraternal quarrel to her.\n\nWhat to know about Harry\u2019s memoir, Spare\n\nThe book\u2019s title references the concept of a firstborn royal child being in line to inherit the throne, while subsequent children represent merely backups should something happen to the eldest. In the U.K., William, who is 40, was born the \u201cheir,\u201d while Harry, who is 38, has thus always been a \u201cspare.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Harry\u2019s resentment of this second-tier status \u201cis the unifying theme of his book, through chapters on his childhood, his schooling, his career as a royal and in the British army, his relationship with his parents and brother and his life with Meghan through courtship, wedding and marriage to their own experience of parenthood.\u201d\n\nIn a press release, Markus Dohle, CEO of Penguin Random House, calls Harry\u2019s memoir \u201ca remarkably moving personal journey from trauma to healing.\u201d\n\nProceeds from Spare\u2019s sales will go to British charities, according to the publisher\u2019s website.\n\nHow is Harry promoting the book? What else has he said?\n\nThe Duke of Sussex did two TV interviews in the lead-up to the book\u2019s release: one with British broadcaster iTV, the other with news program 60 Minutes on CBS. Both interviews are set to air Sunday.\n\nIn a snippet of the iTV interview, Harry told British journalist Tom Bradby, \u201cI would like to get my father back. I would like to have my brother back,\u201d referring to King Charles III and William. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel as though it\u2019s better to keep us somehow as the villains.\u201d\n\nIn a clip from his upcoming 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper, Harry says he and his wife would have liked to live a private life since they moved to Canada and then California, but he accuses Buckingham Palace of planting disparaging stories against them. \u201cThere becomes a point when silence is betrayal.\u201d\n\nThe interviews come on the heels of the December release of a six-part documentary series by and about Harry and Meghan on Netflix. The show, which set the record for Netflix\u2019s most-viewed documentary premiere, highlights the rift between Harry and his family, particularly William. \u201cThe saddest part of it was this wedge created between myself and my brother,\u201d Harry says in one episode, \u201cso that he\u2019s now on the institution\u2019s side, and part of that I get. I understand\u2014that\u2019s his inheritance.\u201d\n\nThough Harry may have been destined to be the spare, however, with his words and the stories he\u2019s decided to reveal, he\u2019s proven to be anything but.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "prospects \n\nGeneral Motors has overtaken Toyota as the top automaker in the United States, according to the latest figures released by the Automotive News Data Center. With total sales of 3.2 million vehicles in 2021, GM has taken the crown from the Japanese automaker, which had held the title since 2011.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted the auto industry over the last year, but GM was able to remain relatively unscathed, thanks to a strong lineup of cars, trucks, and SUVs, as well as a focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations. GM is also the largest producer of electric vehicles in the United States and is in the process of rolling out its new \u201cUltium\u201d battery platform, which should help it remain competitive in the years ahead.\n\nToyota, meanwhile, has also been affected by the pandemic and its sales in 2021 dropped by more than 8%. The company is banking on the new \u201cCorolla Cross\u201d SUV and \u201cMirai\u201d hydrogen fuel cell vehicle to help boost sales in the coming year, as well as its expanded lineup of hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe news from GM and Toyota signals the start of a new era for the auto industry, as both companies are now in the race to launch electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. GM is expected to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, while Toyota is targeting 30 new electric and fuel cell vehicles by 2030.\n\nThe competition for electric and fuel cell vehicles is only going to heat up in the coming years, as automakers continue to make investments in the technology. The Biden administration is also pushing for increased investments in the sector and has set a goal of having 10 million electric vehicles on the road by the end of 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, the auto industry is already looking ahead to 2022, which could potentially be another banner year for the sector. With sales expected to be higher than pre-pandemic levels, automakers are confident that they will be able to continue the strong sales they have seen in recent years.\n\nGM\u2019s strong performance in 2021 is a sign of the company\u2019s newfound strength, as well as its preparedness for the future. With electric vehicles, new models, and cost-cutting measures, the company appears to be well-positioned to take advantage of the industry\u2019s recovery.\n\nToyota, meanwhile, has made some significant changes to its strategy and is now looking to become a global leader in both electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The Japanese automaker has already made substantial investments in electric and fuel cell technology, and is now setting its sights on being a leader in the sector.\n\nThe competition between GM and Toyota is only going to heat up in the coming years, as the two juggernauts battle for the title of top automaker in the United States. With both companies investing heavily in electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the auto industry could be in for an exciting future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "every time\n\nWall Street's 'free lunch'? A simple holiday trade that tends to beat the market every time\n\nIt's the middle of December, which means it's the time of year when the markets get a holiday lift. And while the reasons for the seasonal bump are varied, many investors are looking for the most profitable way to take advantage of it.\n\nEnter the so-called \"Santa Claus rally,\" a stock market phenomenon that has been known to reliably reward investors each year. The Santa Claus rally is typically defined as the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year, when stock prices tend to climb higher than expected.\n\nThe rally has been a reliable annual trend, dating back to 1972. Over that time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has seen an average return of 1.5%, compared to the S&P 500 index's average of 1.1% over the same period.\n\nSo, what's behind this holiday boom? As with any market movement, there are multiple contributing factors. One primary driver is the fact that many investors have already closed out their positions for the year, meaning that there is less trading activity which, in turn, can cause prices to rise. Additionally, portfolio managers who are behind on their performance for the year may use this opportunity to try to boost their numbers at the end of the year, which can lead to buying activity.\n\nThe Santa Claus rally can also be attributed to the \"January Effect,\" which suggests that the stock market tends to start the year off on a high note as investors look ahead to the future with optimism. Finally, there is the prospect of taxes and regulations, which may be delayed until the beginning of the new year, leading investors to buy stocks ahead of potentially unfavorable changes.\n\nDespite the seemingly reliable nature of the Santa Claus rally, it should be noted that there can be exceptions to the trend. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the stock market in 2020, resulting in the longest bear market in history. As such, investors should approach the holiday period cautiously and understand that past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nThat said, there are a few strategies that can help investors make the most of this seasonal trend.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to understand the underlying fundamentals of any stock and make sure that the company is in a solid financial position. Furthermore, with much of the market movement likely to be driven by sector-specific activity, it may be a good idea to look for stocks that are tied to sectors which typically see a seasonal increase in activity.\n\nIn addition, consider broad market-based ETFs to gain exposure to a variety of sectors and stocks. This approach can help investors to diversify and mitigate risk while still taking advantage of the Santa Claus rally.\n\nLastly, investors should be aware that even though the rally can deliver returns, they may not be especially large. As such, investors should not expect huge gains, but rather focus on capital preservation during this period of heightened volatility.\n\nBy applying some of these simple strategies, investors may be able to take advantage of the Santa Claus rally and enjoy a profitable holiday season.", "label": "machine"}

You can breed these animals to make hybrids, with rarer ones yielding more zoo coins which can then be cashed out into IRL money. It sounded enticing in theory but was an apparent rug pull in practice, as members of Paul\u2019s team (though not Paul himself) sold their coins early to make millions while Paul\u2019s ardent fans and early investors lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Coffeezilla\u2019s reporting. Based on his three-part series, CryptoZoo seemed to be a sham.\n\nRead More: YouTuber: Logan Paul\u2019s NFT \u2018Game\u2019 Is A Big Crypto Scam\n\nLogan Paul opted to remain silent during much of Coffeezilla\u2019s reporting and posting, but not anymore! On January 3, Paul uploaded his response to Coffeezilla\u2019s investigation on YouTube, saying he would \u201cdefend himself with facts\u201d while hurling cutting insults like saying that Coffeezilla is continuing \u201cto morph from an investigator to a gossip channel\u201d and calling him the \u201cKeemstar of crypto in finance.\u201d Oof, that one stings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, in his response video, Paul focuses on what he calls three \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d in Coffeezilla\u2019s reports. The first point was about the CryptoZoo developer who fled to Switzerland with the game\u2019s source code and held it hostage for $1 million dollars. Paul drags Coffeezilla for having kept the individual anonymous and calling him \u201cZ\u201d in his reports. Turns out this developer\u2019s name is Zach Kelling and, according to Paul, he has \u201cmultiple felonies\u201d related to armed robbery and obstructing the legal process.\n\nIn his video, Paul displays papers purporting to be official documents from the Johnson County Court in Kansas referencing Kelling\u2019s alleged criminal charges. (Kotaku couldn\u2019t independently verify these facts and the Johnson County District Court rep for the Records Office said that \u201cthere were no public records\u201d for Zach Kelling.) Paul brings this up to cast aspersions on Kelling\u2019s character and to insinuate that the things Kelling said in Coffeezilla\u2019s videos\u2014that he had 30 engineers working under him and was burning $50,000 a week on the CryptoZoo project\u2014are completely false. According to Paul, he only had three engineers, not 30.\n\nPaul then admits that, yep, he sure did work with this \u201cunsavory individual,\u201d but frames the error as one of being too trusting, saying \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I get for trusting the team that I relied on to vet and manage\u201d the hiring process. He describes former CryptoZoo lead developer Eddie Ibanez as a \u201ccon man who fooled billionaires, the Mormon Church, the owner of the New York Yankees, and now me.\u201d\n\nHe then casts aspersions on yet another one of Coffeezilla\u2019s sources, a man named Emilio who Coffeezilla interviewed for his reports. Paul suggests that Coffeezilla should have been aware that Emilio was an untrustworthy individual who was previously involved in two rug pulls, and thus a poor source for his reporting. Paul also takes a moment to challenge Coffeezilla\u2019s claim that eggs in CryptoZoo cannot be hatched, saying \u201cone second of research\u201d would have proven otherwise and showing footage of the game\u2019s eggs \u201chatching\u201d to reveal pictures of elephants, ducks, and other animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, Paul hones in on a recorded phone call Coffeezilla had with Paul\u2019s manager, Jeffrey Levin, parts of which were then used in Coffeezilla\u2019s reports, supposedly without Levin\u2019s permission. According to California laws under the invasion of privacy, it is illegal to record a conversation without all parties\u2019 consent because it\u2019s a two-party consent state. This is the stickiest point in Paul\u2019s litigious threat if they find themselves in court.\n\nLogan Paul\n\n\u201cAlthough you didn\u2019t verify any backgrounds, substantiate any evidence, took multiple criminals\u2019 words as truth, and broke laws, you still published the defamation,\u201d Paul says before asserting that multiple \u201cbad actors\u201d have been removed from the project, and that he and his manager Jeff \u201cmade no money and will never make any money on CryptoZoo. In fact, we only lost money trying to pick up the pieces.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLogan Paul ends his video by assuring viewers that CryptoZoo is still coming, in defiance of Coffeezilla\u2019s claims that it\u2019s not actually being made. He also threatens Coffeezilla with legal action for the \u201cdefamation,\u201d saying he will need a good lawyer. However, Paul\u2019s still open to having Coffeezilla appear on his podcast, Impaulsive.\n\nKotaku reached out to Paul for comment.\n\nIn a brief email exchange with Kotaku, Coffeezilla reiterated what he said on Twitter about Paul\u2019s response. He said a full reply is coming \u201cwhen I organize my thoughts\u201d while trading blows with Paul online over the minutiae of the year-long investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact Logan is suing me instead of the criminals and con men he hired says it all,\u201d Coffeezilla said. \u201cHe took zero accountability. Zero apologies. He just wants to save his own reputation.\u201d\n\nAs for Zach Kelling, Coffeezilla said he just learned of Kelling\u2019s supposed past legal battles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose \u2018legal battles\u2019 were from the early 2000's (2001 I think?),\u201d he said. \u201cIf Logan\u2019s standard of character is to dig back years to judge people by their lowest moment, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a battle he\u2019ll win. Regardless, I have no stake in whether Zach Kelling is good or bad. I didn\u2019t hire him. My job as a journalist is to reach out to all parties. Logan had accused Zach of stealing his code. I reached out to Zach and got his story and then reached back out to Logan and his manager in response. Logan and his manager chose to not comment and then get upset when I quote the guy they hired.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for how Paul\u2019s response is being received, some online are mocking his tactic of pointing out that, whether intentionally or not, he hired fraudsters and scammers to work on CryptoZoo. In a reaction video, Twitch streamer Hasan Piker pauses amidst Paul\u2019s claims to say, \u201cNot a single person thinks that any of the people involved in this situation are good people. You hired \u2018em, ya fuckin\u2019 idiot!\u201d Piker goes on to call Paul\u2019s claims in the video \u201ccompounding the Ls.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s definitely one way to look at it.", "label": "human"}

Influencers are constantly looking for new ways to spruce up their content, and furniture serves as the perfect way to do that.\n\nDespite the recent trend of influencers declining products that have been gifted to them and vowing to only showcase items they've purchased with their own money, furniture remains a hot item in the influencer world. The reason being, people like to see content that looks like it's being created in a person's home, and furniture provides the perfect backdrop for that type of content.\n\nOne influencer who's doing especially well in the furniture department is fashion, beauty and lifestyle influencer, Kate Berlyn. Her Instagram feed is full of photos of herself in various rooms of her home, showcasing furniture and other decor from her sponsors.\n\n\"I love to show off the new pieces I've bought for my home,\" Berlyn said. \"Furniture is one of the most visually pleasing aspects of my home, so when I'm creating content, I want to make sure it looks its best.\"\n\nBerlyn isn't the only influencer who's turned to furniture as a way to spruce up her content. Many lifestyle and fashion influencers use furniture to show off their personal style and make their content look more polished and professional.\n\nOne such influencer is interior design enthusiast, Maria Vasiljeva. She uses her Instagram page to showcase the latest trends in furniture and home decor, often partnering with furniture companies to give her followers a closer look at the latest pieces.\n\n\"I love helping my followers find new ways to spruce up their homes,\" Vasiljeva said. \"The latest furniture pieces are a great way to add some personality to a space, and I'm always on the lookout for the newest trends to share with my followers.\"\n\nBut it's not just influencers who are enjoying the furniture trend. Companies are also taking advantage of the trend, partnering with influencers to promote their products to a larger audience. For example, furniture company, Williams-Sonoma, is partnering with lifestyle influencers to help promote their products.\n\n\"We love working with influencers to show off our furniture in an authentic and engaging way,\" said Andrea Bontempi, head of marketing at Williams-Sonoma. \"It's an incredible way to get our products in front of an engaged and passionate audience, and it's been incredibly successful for us so far.\"\n\nIt's clear that furniture is still a hot item in the influencer world, despite the fact that many influencers are shying away from \"gifted\" products.

{"text": "Elon Musk\u2019s latest comments about Twitter employees sparked controversy and could make waves in the health and tech industries.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO claimed on Twitter that he had been told Twitter employees had a Slack channel dedicated to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House\u2019s chief medical advisor. The channel was allegedly called the \u201cFauci Fan Club.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s tweet came just days after Fauci criticized the tech industry, including Musk himself, over its lax response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci had said that tech companies had not done enough to combat the spread of the virus, and had been slow to release reliable data on their effectiveness in the fight against it.\n\nThe news of the Slack channel was quickly picked up by media outlets, and it was reported that a Twitter spokesperson had denied Musk\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cThis is not accurate,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe have no knowledge of a Slack channel called the \u2018Fauci Fan Club\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut Musk has continued to stand by his claim, tweeting on Wednesday that \u201cWhat can I say, the Fauci Fan Club is real.\u201d\n\nThe news of the alleged Slack channel has provoked a strong reaction from both the health and tech industries.\n\nHealth experts have accused Twitter and other tech companies of engaging in \u201cpandemic deniers\u201d by not taking a more active role in fighting the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cIt is especially concerning that this kind of behaviour is occurring within an industry that should be working hard to contain the pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cTech companies should be acting as responsible partners in the fight against the virus and this kind of behavior is a step in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, tech industry insiders have accused Musk of making a baseless accusation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see why Musk would be so sure of his claim unless he had inside knowledge,\u201d said Aaron Weisman, a former executive at Twitter. \u201cGiven his recent comments, it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s using this as a way to take a shot at the tech industry. It\u2019s a dangerous tactic that can have serious repercussions.\u201d\n\nThe news of the Slack channel has also raised questions about Twitter\u2019s internal culture. The company has long been known for its open and collaborative culture, but this latest incident could point to a darker side to the company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know the exact reasons why there may have been a \u2018Fauci Fan Club\u2019 at Twitter,\u201d said Carol Vaness, a tech industry consultant. \u201cBut it does raise some red flags about the company\u2019s internal culture. It\u2019s essential for Twitter to do an internal investigation to ensure that the company is not engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the news of the Slack channel could be seen as a wake-up call for the tech industry. It serves as a reminder that tech companies must be accountable for their actions and must be mindful of the impact that their actions can have on public health.\n\n\u201cTech companies must take their responsibility to fight the pandemic seriously,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cThey must be willing to collaborate and share data in order to develop effective strategies to combat the virus. They also must take a stronger stance against pandemic deniers and make sure that they are not condoning or facilitating such behavior.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

Manchester Museum/Julia Thorne\n\n\"It's a subtle distinction, but it's an important one,\" Campbell Price, a curator at the Manchester Museum in the UK, said.\n\n\"This idea that the spirit returns to the body, or in some sense animates the body, is not as explicitly articulated as you might imagine,\" Price said in an interview with Insider.\n\nThe Manchester Museum will explore this approach in the upcoming \"Golden Mummies of Egypt\" exhibition, which opens in February. Price wrote a book accompanying it.\n\nA picture of the Golden Mummies of Egypt is shown. Manchester Museum\n\nOne of the arguments to support this theory is that mummies of some of the prominent ruling classes do not seem much concerned with preservation.\n\nKing Tutankhamun's body, for instance, was found stuck to the bottom of his coffin.\n\n\"It's almost as if, to read modern accounts, the mummification was botched, the ancient Egyptians didn't know what they were doing, and thus he wasn't well preserved,\" said Price.\n\nUnder the alternate theory, \"producing a lifelike image, recognizable image, actually was never the intention in the first place,\" Price said\n\nAn ancient drawing of Osiris and Isis are shown. Manchester Museum/ Julia Thorne\n\nAncient Egyptians saw statues as godly.\n\n\"It seems that there's the world of the living and people who go about their daily lives. And then there's the world of images and representation, statues, reliefs, and paintings. That is not just an idealized version of Egypt \u2014 it's an image of gods, a kind of a statue world,\" Price said.\n\nThe archaeological record suggests ancient Egyptians anointed statues of gods with oils and perfumes. They also sometimes wrapped them in linens, so it could be the bandages were thought to confer some sort of divinity.\n\nBy putting organs in canopic jars \u2014 jars adorned with the heads of gods \u2014 during the embalming process, Egyptians may have intended to imbue them with the godly spirit of the deceased royal, Price said, rather than keeping them handy for the afterlife.\n\nThe mask of King Tutankhamun, which was found to have been damaged and glued back together, is seen at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Reuters\n\nHowever, not everybody agrees that the preservation aspect of mummification should be cast away.\n\n\"The physical preservation of the body was extremely important. There's no question of that,\" Stephen Buckley, an archaeologist and analytical chemist at the University of York, told Insider.\n\nSome mummies do indeed look statue-like, such as Tutankhamun, Amenhotep III, and Akhenaten.\n\nBut others, Buckley said, like Thutmose III, Thutmose IV, Amenhotep II, and Queen Tiye were mummified to look more \"sleep-like,\" which suggests a closer concern with the physical body inside.\n\nThe imagery included some imperfections, \"perhaps so the soul could recognize themselves and therefore have a 'home' to return to periodically,\" he said.\n\nBuckley conceded that mummification was not only about preservation, but said that discounting it completely would be \"to miss the point.\"\n\nThe sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun in 1922. The photo also shows Egyptologist Howard Carter, left, with an unidentified man. Apic/Getty Images\n\nBut if Price is right, then how did we get it so wrong?\n\nIt may come down to the Victorians and their ideas of life after death.\n\n\"A lot of what we say when we describe ancient Egypt is less about what actually happened in ancient Egypt and more about the assumptions of Victorian upper-middle-class white, cisgender, bearded men,\" Price said.\n\n\"As so often those interpretations stuck and they were repeated and repeated and repeated,\" Price said.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of unthinking to be done.\"", "label": "human"}

This metric, known as the second-week drop, is often used as an indicator of whether a film will have longevity at the box office or may fizzle quickly.\n\nFilms that fall less than 50% are expected to have solid, long runs, while those that top 70% are likely to see ticket sales continue to sharply decline as the movie fades from the public eye.\n\n\"The second-weekend drop for 'Avatar: The Way of Water' puts it right in the zone of where it needs to be as this performance will set the tone for the ongoing box office journey for the film,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nBox office analysts noted that cold winter weather and storms during the Christmas weekend likely led to slower ticket sales domestically.\n\nAdditionally, international ticket sales continue to thrive. The second-week drop for markets outside the U.S. and Canada was 43.9%.

{"text": "For decades, readers have celebrated the classic whodunit \u2014 the suspenseful, puzzle-packed tale in which a smart detective pits his or her wits against a criminal genius, seeking to uncover the killer.\n\nBut two new novels suggest that this venerable formula is ripe for reinvention \u2014 to the delight of mystery fans. Dutch author Gerbrand Bakker's The Detour and British writer Wyl Menmuir's The Many are both set in isolated, rural places with an air of timelessness. And the stories in each are driven not by the desire to solve a crime but rather by the searching curiosity of their protagonists.\n\nThe Detour, which is set in the Welsh countryside, begins when a 70-year-old Dutch academic named Henk drives over the Severn Bridge, intent on investigating a peculiar rumor. It seems that his grandfather, Jos, left Holland 70 years earlier, and that he's never been heard from since.\n\nIn a tale that's part detective story, part meditation on the vagaries of memory and the way that time erodes the meaning of certain moments in our lives, Henk quietly uncovers bits and pieces of Jos' past. As the riddles add up, he finally learns where his grandfather has been all these years \u2014 and finds an answer to a mystery that he's been pondering for decades.\n\nThe Many is an even more ambitious story, drenched with the uncanny atmosphere of its Cornish seaside village setting. Through an unspeakable crime, an anonymous narrator has been reduced to a hollow man, unable to process his own pain.\n\nHis search for the truth leads him on a nightmarish journey through a series of strange encounters. One conversation leads to another, like a game of twisted pick-up sticks, until our narrator discovers the enigmatic connection linking everyone in the village \u2014 and how it is linked to him.\n\nBakker and Menmuir have crafted page-turners that carry the freshness of Gothic literature. Both novels unleash a fantastic atmosphere in which the secrets of the past finally catch up with the present \u2014 although nothing is resolved in a tidy package.\n\nRather, these two authors take the whodunit and re-imagine it as a canvas for their own novelistic vision.

Screenshots of the post appear to have been originally posted to Facebook by a user named Samantha Cole, and subsequently circulated on Twitter when they were re-posted by a user named DraggerOfLiars.\n\n\"I debated on how to do this a million times and still not sure if it's right or not,\" Meachen wrote in a Facebook post. \"I almost died again at my own hand and they had to go through all that hell again.\" She told members of the group that she was \"in a good place now and I am hoping to write again,\" concluding with a bizarre salutation: \"Let the fun begin.\"\n\nBoth former colleagues and internet observers have reacted to the chain of events in apoplectic posts.\n\n\"I was horrified, stunned, livid, and felt like I'd been kicked in the gut and the chest at the same time,\" wrote a woman named Samantha Cole, a fellow author and former acquaintance of Meachen's.\n\nIn her post, Cole said Meachen created another Facebook pseudonym, TN Steele, so she could continue posting amid the suicide hoax. In a DM exchange with Meachen on Tuesday, Cole questioned whether the author even had a daughter. Meachen insisted she did and said she came clean because \"I simply want my life back.\"\n\nWhile the TN Steele account belongs to a \"want to be author, wife, office manager, and all-around goofier\" in Georgia, Meachen's Amazon bio says she's a \"wife, mom, meme, and friend\" who lives in southeastern Tennessee with her husband of 24 years, their two cats, and four snakes.\n\nWhile outrage continues to run rampant on Twitter, for some the lie is less shocking than it is plainly painful.\n\n\"Today is the fourth anniversary of my brother's suicide,\" wrote the Twitter user RelativelyMe in response to DraggerOfLiars' thread. \"I'd give everything I have for him to magically appear again...This is repugnant.\"\n\nMeachen didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "George Santos, the acting attorney general of the United States and the highest ranking law enforcement official in the country, has come under fire this week in an ongoing investigation into his financial dealings, connections to the Russian government and interactions with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe investigation, which is being spearheaded by U.S. Attorney John Durham, has raised alarms in Congress and beyond as to Santos\u2019 possible involvement in various matters, including Trump's 2017 firing of former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nSantos, who has served as attorney general since 2017 and is expected to serve for another four years, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, saying he is \"innocent of any wrongdoing.\"\n\nThe investigations into Santos by Durham and other federal prosecutors have so far only focused on his financial and legal connections, not his work as attorney general or his involvement in the firing of Comey or Trump's other controversial actions.\n\nBut the investigations into Santos have reignited calls from some lawmakers for more oversight of the Department of Justice and more scrutiny of Santos' conduct.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has publicly urged the DOJ to investigate whether Santos has interfered with investigations into Trump, saying the allegations \"are of grave concern.\"\n\n\"The AG, as the head of the Department of Justice and its principal law enforcement officer, is obligated to ensure that all law enforcement activity is conducted lawfully, ethically and properly,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate minority leader, has called on the DOJ to examine any potential political interference in criminal investigations by Santos or his office.\n\n\"As the head of the Justice Department, the Attorney General has a special responsibility to ensure that all criminal investigations are conducted independently and free from political interference,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"We need to make sure he is held accountable if he fails to meet these high standards.\"\n\nDurham's investigation into Santos' dealings with Russia is reportedly one of several special investigations launched under Durham's supervision. But despite the uproar over the investigation, it's unclear whether the probe will actually lead to any action or even any criminal charges against Santos.\n\nUnlike some other high-profile investigations, such as the one involving former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, the probe into Santos has not been publicly confirmed by the Department of Justice or anyone else in the federal government.\n\nAnd while Durham is reportedly casting a wide net in his investigation of Santos, it's possible that any potential charges or criminal actions will be limited to the financial and legal matters already being examined by his team.\n\nUltimately, it's likely that the special investigations will take time to complete. But in the meantime, it's increasingly apparent that for all of the political bluster and finger pointing, the investigations into George Santos are warranted, if not a sure thing.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nAfter nearly a decade of a more transactional approach to the U.S.-China relationship, President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a more nuanced stance toward China during his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, focusing on a broad range of topics from economic practices to security concerns. \n\nThe meeting, expected to be the first since Biden was elected in the 2020 election, has yet to be officially announced, but sources close to Biden's transition team tell CNBC the two world leaders will likely meet within the first few months of 2021. \n\nThe meeting, which could take place either in the United States or in China, will likely center on a wide range of issues that the two countries have often clashed over in recent years.\n\nAccording to one former Obama administration official and another from the Trump administration, who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity, Biden will likely bring up economic issues related to China\u2019s practices, namely what the U.S. and Europe have called \u201cpredatory capitalism.\u201d\n\nThese practices, which have been widely criticized by both the U.S. and Europe, include the forced transfer of technology, preferential market access and subsidies.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration is likely to take a much firmer stance on Chinese economic practices and make sure it is enforcing U.S. laws,\u201d the former Obama official told CNBC.\n\nIn addition, the Biden administration will likely make some progress on geopolitical issues, including Taiwan and its relationship with China and Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\n\nTaiwan has long been a point of contention between the U.S. and China, with the former recognizing the island nation as an independent state, and the latter recognizing it as part of China\u2019s territory.\n\nBiden is expected to make it clear during the meeting that the U.S. will not interfere with Taiwan\u2019s internal affairs and that the status quo will be maintained.\n\nFinally, the Biden administration is expected to make a point about Russia\u2019s ongoing aggression in Ukraine and its involvement in the war there.\n\nThe president-elect has already stated his opposition to the aggression, and it is likely he will reiterate it in the meeting with Xi.\n\n\u201cChina has been mostly silent on the conflict in Ukraine, but this will be an opportunity to send a strong signal to Russia to cease its aggression in the region,\u201d the former Obama official said.\n\nAs the U.S. and China prepare for a new era of engagement between the two nations, the meeting between Biden and Xi is a critical first step in setting the tone for the future of U.S.-China relations.\n\nBiden\u2019s approach is expected to be far different than that of President Donald Trump\u2019s, which saw the U.S. and China become increasingly hostile.\n\nThe two leaders will also likely discuss several issues, such as climate change, public health, and cybersecurity, that are of global importance but have also been points of contention in the U.S.-China relationship.\n\nThe meeting between the two leaders is expected to be a critical step in setting the stage for a constructive and cooperative relationship between the two nations, one that is focused on dialogue, collaboration, and diplomacy.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Chicago Bears have had their fair share of quarterback issues over the past several years, and it appears as though they may be ready to move on from their current QB, Justin Fields. Reports have surfaced that the team is exploring potential trade options for the former Ohio State star, who has been with the team since the 2021 NFL Draft. It would be an epic mistake for the Bears to part ways with Fields and it could have severe ramifications for their future.\n\nFields was taken by the Bears with the 11th overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and the team was widely praised for the move. Many felt that he could be the franchise quarterback that the Bears had been looking for and that he had the potential to be the long-term answer at the position. However, after a somewhat rocky first year in the league, it appears as though the Bears are already looking to move on from him.\n\nFields had his share of ups and downs in his first season with the Bears. While there were definitely some flashes of brilliance, there were also some issues that the rookie had to work through. His interception numbers were relatively high and he struggled with ball security at times. He also showed a tendency to lock in on one receiver and often held the ball too long in the pocket. Despite this, Fields still managed to throw for 3,371 yards, 31 touchdowns, and just nine interceptions.\n\nHowever, it appears as though the Bears may be ready to move on from him and look for another option. This would be a huge mistake for the team, as Fields has all the tools to be a successful NFL quarterback. He is an accurate passer, has a strong arm, and is a dangerous runner. He also has the intangibles, such as leadership and the ability to thrive under pressure. Moreover, he is still relatively young and has not yet reached his prime.\n\nThe Bears could also find themselves in trouble if they were to trade away Fields. Not only would they lose the potential for a franchise quarterback, but they would also be trading away their future. By trading away Fields, the Bears would be setting themselves up for several more years of quarterback woes, as they would have to find another young quarterback in the draft or sign an aging veteran in free agency.\n\nFurthermore, trading away Fields could have a ripple effect throughout the team. The Bears have been slowly building a talented and deep roster, and trading away their young quarterback could potentially put a stop to their progress. It could also prevent them from making any major moves in free agency, as they would have to dedicate most of their resources to finding a new QB.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Bears would be making an epic mistake if they were to move on from Justin Fields. The team already has a strong and talented roster, and the last thing they need to do is trade away a potential franchise quarterback. By holding onto Fields, they would be securing their future, as he has all the tools and intangibles to be a successful quarterback in the NFL. The Bears need to take a long and hard look at the situation before deciding on any major moves.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee voted unanimously on Tuesday to release a redacted version of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns after an investigation into possible financial wrongdoings by the Trump Organization.\n\nThe decision follows months of investigations and requests for records from Trump\u2019s financials after reports of fraudulent activities by the president\u2019s company. Trump has resisted these efforts and has remained steadfast in his refusal to release any tax documents to the public or Congress.\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee is made up of representatives from both parties and is tasked with the oversight of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The committee voted in a 23-15 bipartisan vote to issue a summons to the IRS seeking six years of President Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns.\n\nThe chairman of the committee, Richard Neal, said that the committee was taking the step of releasing redacted tax records as a result of their investigation. He said that they are prepared to issue a subpoena if necessary, but they are confident that this will not be necessary.\n\nThe documents released on Tuesday are only a redacted version of President Trump\u2019s taxes, meaning some of the more sensitive information is being kept private. This includes the President\u2019s net worth, deductions, and the names of some companies associated with the Trump Organization.\n\nHowever, Democrats on the committee believe that the documents that were released still provide a glimpse into the President\u2019s financial activities. They are particularly interested in any possible connections between the Trump Organization and foreign entities and any possible tax evasion.\n\nNeal stated that the committee is still determined to get more information from the President\u2019s tax records. He believes that by making these documents public, it will become easier to hold Trump accountable and to identify any potential criminal activity.\n\nIt is uncertain if the President will comply with the request for more information. Trump has been adamant in his refusal to release any of his tax information and has already sought to challenge the committee\u2019s actions in court.\n\nNevertheless, the committee\u2019s decision to release some of Trump\u2019s tax records is seen as a positive step towards transparency. The Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is hoping that this move will shed light on any possible misconduct by the President.\n\nWhile the documents that have been released are still incomplete, they are being seen as a victory by Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee. This is the first time that any portion of Trump\u2019s tax returns have been made public and it provides them with more information as they continue their investigations.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For influencers, receiving \"gifted\" items from brands can feel \"excessive and gluttonous,\" one said.\n\nMany decline free products, or if they receive them, they don't always post about them.\n\nBut some items, like furniture and luxury products, can make such a collaboration attractive.\n\nWhen the TikTok influencer Victoria Paris became famous on social media, she began to get so many free products from brands that she felt overwhelmed.\n\n\"A lot of it felt excessive and gluttonous,\" Paris, who has 1.5 million followers, previously told Insider. \"At one point, packages just started showing up that I didn't even approve because companies will sell your address or use it for brands you don't even know about.\"\n\nShe said she started declining most free items, and when she moved across the US last summer, she didn't communicate it to brands so she could avoid being flooded with unwanted public-relations products.\n\nParis' decision fits into a broader effort among some influencers to reduce the number of items they're sent and to ask brands to pay them in cash, as opposed to products.\n\nBut there seems to be at least one big exception to this rule: furniture.\n\nParis and five other influencer-industry insiders said furniture was still a desirable category of products that worked for \"gifted\" collaborations \u2014 or when a brand pays using a product instead of cash.\n\n\"Brands are more inclined to gift higher-price-point items if they know they'll get content out of it,\" Paris added.\n\nCreators and other industry insiders said gifted partnerships that involve furniture \u2014 as well as a few other types of luxury items \u2014 could be mutually beneficial.\n\nCallie Wilson, who has 1 million TikTok followers, said that when furniture or luxury brands offered products in exchange for content, she considered that to be different from \"average gifting\" because the items are higher in value.\n\nAnd when it comes to products that can benefit a creator or make their life easier (like fridges or dishwashers), it's more common for them to accept gifted collaborations, according to Annelise Campbell, the founder and CEO of the marketing agency CFG.\n\nHarley Jordan, a micro influencer with 33,000 Instagram followers and the founder of All Influence Collective, said that while influencers should always strive to get paid when they create content for brands, big-ticket items could be important exceptions.\n\n\"My mattress is gifted, and that was the best gifting collaboration that I've ever done,\" she said. \"It's high ticket, and that'll move mountains.\"", "label": "human"}

I got the exact opposite.\"\n\n\n\nWhile BetterHelp says it's provided beneficial online mental health services to more than three million clients, Hill is among several who said they had issues with the company, according to a recent investigation by the Journal.\n\nBetterHelp, which is owned by publicly traded Teladoc Health, uses algorithms to match patients like Hill to therapists. However, many therapists on the platform aren't accepting new clients or have left the platform entirely, people familiar with the service told the Journal.\n\nThe company says it has 29,900 therapists; they're not employees, but independent contractors paid by the hour, the Journal reported. A BetterHelp spokeswoman told the Journal that the company pays more than the median for a licensed therapist in many places.\n\nAmid the pandemic, BetterHelp, like many online mental-health providers, doubled down on growth. The company's ad budget was increased to hundreds of millions of dollars a year and it spent $64 million on podcast advertising alone during the first 10 months of 2022, according to estimates that the research firm Magellan AI gave the Journal.\n\nAt the same time, the company's process for training therapists is minimal, the Journal reported. A former clinical director at the company told the Journal that therapists were \"treated like Uber drivers.\" The company told the Journal it goes thorough background checks and also relies on state licensing boards, which certify therapists.\n\nMeanwhile, digital mental health startups are a growth area, especially as telehealth has skyrocketed during the pandemic: They received an influx of $4.8 billion in investment over the last year, research and investment firm Rock Health told the Journal.\n\nBut providers have had challenges: Cerebral, another online therapy platform that rode the pandemic wave, laid of 20% of its employees in October and has since made plans to slow growth, Insider reported.

{"text": "Investors are constantly reminded that despite the myriad coins, projects and innovations in crypto, bitcoin may be the only \"safe\" crypto asset to buy. That comes with a big asterisk, however. The price of bitcoin is down more than 60% for the year and volatility remains a key characteristic of the asset. Most of all, however, how to value it is still a mystery to many \u2013 lots of investors are looking at negative returns and the cryptocurrency certainly didn't convince people of its potential as an inflation hedge this year. While many have written off the original vision for bitcoin as digital cash \u2013 in large part because of the volatility \u2013 some investors and developers are still bullish on its potential to improve financial transactions. \"In the same way the dot coms were the shape of the future in 1999,\" said Mike Brock, who leads Block's TBD business. \"It was still filled with froth, vaporware and nonsense speculation. We're seeing the same thing here and a lot of people are getting hurt.\" To that point, investors sticking around the crypto market after the recent FTX blowup are shifting their attention to the utility crypto can provide rather than how they can ride the wave up in the hype cycles of speculative assets. Payments are one way to utilize bitcoin. \"Trading and leveraging is not exactly a first order financial problem,\" said Lyn Alden, founder of macro-focused firm Lyn Alden Investment Strategy. \"The bigger problem overall is that globally, a lot of people do not have access to savings, they do not have access to good payments. That's a much bigger total addressable market and essentially what bitcoin and stablecoins are going to solve.\" Brock added that the froth in the market is \"still irrelevant to the long term success of these technologies. At a fundamental level, they do unlock value and they will provide more capital efficiencies in the markets in the future.\" Block has said little about TBD, which focuses on cryptocurrency and decentralized finance, since CEO Jack Dorsey announced the idea in summer 2021. Rather than putting energy into building yet another crypto exchange, TBD is focused on building a cross-border remittance product, according to Brock. Investors got a chuckle in 2021 after Tesla announced it would accept bitcoin from customers as payment for its electric vehicles and then reversed the decision shortly after, as crypto prices fell. And while Tesla didn't credit the volatility for its reversal, many observers saw it as evidence that the belief in bitcoin's payments capabilities were misguided. Bitcoin's price swings are irrelevant, however, according to Brock. \"Bitcoin's price on any given day \u2014 as a remittance vehicle \u2014 has no effect on us,\" he said. \"Whether the price is $500 or $100,000, the system works the same.\" \"There's a huge premium that bitcoin enjoys today that is largely from speculation,\" he added. \"I do think long-term value of bitcoin will go up because of increasing utility on the network, because it's being used increasingly to power things like international remittance [and] to secure other types of transactions like the digital identity work that we're doing.\" Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. Focused investors may not be buying the big dip in bitcoin yet. Instead, they may be holding on to their assets, with any concerns alleviated by its fixed supply, growing demand and anticipation of long-term returns. Global demand When Russia first waged war on Ukraine early this year, observers and crypto skeptics got a glimpse of bitcoin's potential to serve people where the formal financial system can't or doesn't. Many turned to crypto to safeguard their cash . Ukraine also received many payments and donations made in cryptocurrency amid reports of bank runs and empty ATMs. \"It's not buying coffee at Starbucks, so that may not be relatable to your average American, but it's a real use case,\" Brock said. Block isn't alone in its confidence in bitcoin's payments potential. The group that runs the Lightning Network, a payment protocol built on the Bitcoin network, is committed to making Bitcoin network payments even faster, less costly and more readily confirmed than transactions made directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Strike, which has a bitcoin buying and selling service, is also developing services around remittances, micropayments, tipping and paying merchants and peers in bitcoin. Earlier this month at the AfroBitcoin conference, Strike announced a partnership with a company called Bitnob that aims to use Bitcoin's Lightning Network to improve remittance payments into Africa . \"It's really strange that people have dismissed this feature of Bitcoin,\" said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation. \"The ability to send value from one place to another is one of its most important features and it's something that's emerging all across the world in a really, really big way.\" \"The existing international financial system is permissioned, gated, exclusionary and is often colonial,\" he added. \"Users from country A can very rarely speak to users in country B very easily. There are a lot of fees involved in moving money around the world. Oftentimes in places like Africa, for example, 80% of all inter-African flows go through an American or a European company.\" Bitcoin has also been a lifeline for other groups marginalized or underserved by financial institions such as sex workers , Lebanese freelancers who grapple with hyperinflation and are unable to access their bank accounts, and Afghans suffering a nationwide cash shortage . And while different from consumer payments, a company called Stacks is so optimistic about Bitcoin's transaction capabilities, it's building a smart contracts layer for DeFi, NFTs and other decentralized apps on Bitcoin. Transacting in the U.S. Tyrone Ross Jr., president and founder of financial planning firm 401 Financial, said while investors certainly can think of bitcoin as a store of value, he's most bullish on crypto infrastructure plays like the TBD initiatives at Block. Paying for things with bitcoin is probably unwise in the U.S. because transactions are taxable, he said, but Bitcoin fulfills a need for people who have been turned away from the formal financial system. Ross called it \"the one inarguable use case\" and said it's so far been \"clouded\" by crypto's online casino culture. The Federal Reserve's Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households report issued this spring adds some strength to the argument. It showed lower-income adults (with less than $25,000 in annual income) are more likely to use cryptocurrencies for transaction purposes versus investing. Crypto investors, on the other hand, were \"disproportionately high-income, almost always had a traditional banking relationship, and typically had other retirement savings.\" Some 46% had an income of $100,000 or more. Zooming out, 11% of adults in 2021 held cryptocurrency as an investment, while 2% said they used cryptocurrency to buy something or make a payment in the previous 12 months. Another 1% indicated they used crypto to send money to friends or family. This is a small pocket of the U.S. using bitcoin for payments, but Bitcoin doesn't need 100% of the global population on the network to succeed, according to Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. \"If 5% of the whole population believe in the currency or that the price will go up, it's inevitably going to exist,\" he said. \"The market price is determined by the marginal investment, not by the original investment. So if you still have a small sector of people who like this as a class, you still have people trading in and out of bitcoin.\" Brock said he believes bitcoin will come to be seen as a safe harbor \"around the world,\" as it gains utility in remittances and as an inflation hedge (\"not today, obviously\"). That won't necessarily mean it will replace the dollar in people's everyday lives. In fact, debating the possibility is yet another way many investors miss the point, he said. \"Will Bitcoin be a way that you're paying for your Starbucks coffee next year, in five years, in 10 years? Probably not,\" he said. \"My belief in bitcoin's ability to make a better financial system is not contingent on the failure of the dollar.\"", "label": "human"}

The NFC North rivals will square off in the season finale, with the Bears needing a win to clinch a playoff spot.\n\nThe stakes are high in this game, as the Vikings are fighting for a playoff spot of their own and a win would assure them of a spot in the postseason. The Bears know they will have to be at their best to come away with a win, but that is not the only reason they have been preparing for the game.\n\nThe Bears are trying to end the season with a win and that goal is one they have been striving for since the start of the season. Despite some up and down moments throughout the year, the Bears have battled back from adversity and have a chance to make the playoffs with a win over the Vikings.\n\nThe offense has been led by second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who has shown flashes of brilliance and been the focal point of the offense all season. His ability to make plays with his arm and his legs has been a major reason why the Bears have been able to stay in games and have a chance to make the playoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bears\u2019 defense has been one of the best in the league, as they rank second in points allowed per game and fifth in total yards allowed. The defensive line, led by Akiem Hicks, Eddie Goldman and Khalil Mack, has been a strength, as the group has been able to consistently pressure opposing quarterbacks and shut down opponents\u2019 running games.\n\nThe Bears\u2019 defense will have their hands full with the Vikings\u2019 offense, which features one of the most dynamic duos in the NFL in quarterback Kirk Cousins and wide receiver Adam Thielen. Cousins has been superb this season and is one of the league\u2019s most efficient passers, while Thielen has been a dynamo and is one of the top receivers in the league.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Bears have one of the best running back tandems in the NFL with Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen. Howard has been the workhorse and has been reliable all season, while Cohen has been the spark plug with his elusiveness and ability to make plays in the passing game.\n\nThe Bears have been preparing all week for this game, with the goal of ending the season on a high note with a win and a playoff berth. It will be up to the players to make sure that goal is achieved, and there is no doubt that the Bears will be ready for the challenge on Sunday. \n\nThe Bears and Vikings kick off at noon at Soldier Field, with the winner clinching a playoff spot and the loser heading home for the season. It\u2019s a winner take all scenario, and the Bears know they will have to be at their best to come away with a win and head to the postseason.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "HONG KONG\u2014When Beijing imposed the national-security law on Hong Kong in 2020, its goal was not simply to stifle free expression and lock up dissenters. The idea was to subordinate every institution in the city, leaving the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that granted autonomy to the Chinese territory an empty slogan. Henceforth Beijing would no longer tolerate criticism from Hong Kong, or protests on its streets.\n\nWith the prodemocracy movement of 2019\u201320 effectively crushed, the Hong Kong government and officials in Beijing have found additional uses for the law: to settle old scores and rewrite history. By prosecuting a relatively small number of high-profile cases under the national-security law, the authorities are portraying the movement not as a popular uprising but as a traitorous conspiracy of troublemakers in league with foreign powers. Any plot needs a ringleader, and the authorities believe they have one to fit their narrative: the media tycoon Jimmy Lai.\n\nIn this telling, Lai has been elevated to an omniscient actor\u2014a puppeteer of the unwilling masses who for years used his wealth and publications (notably Apple Daily newspaper), with assistance from the United Kingdom and United States, to dupe the city\u2019s citizens into doing his nefarious bidding. Lai and his newspaper loom large in the most consequential national-security-law cases going to trial. Reams of prosecutorial documents portray him as a scheming \u201cmastermind.\u201d A source close to one trial involving Lai told me that Hong Kong\u2019s national-security officers press suspects on their links to his business, cobbling the suspects\u2019 answers together to fit a predetermined narrative.\n\n\u201cThe police are making the story of Jimmy Lai,\u201d this person, who asked not to be named for fear of police retaliation, told me. The decentralized nature of the 2019 movement is still viewed with paranoid disbelief by those who opposed it. The authorities \u201cdon\u2019t believe that everything came from the ground up,\u201d because they think \u201cthat is impossible.\u201d\n\nRead: Seeking sanctuary in the old empire\n\nAlready, in December, Lai was sentenced to more than five years in prison\u2014a punishment, resulting from a case involving violations of a lease agreement, that one Hong Kong lawyer described to me as \u201cshocking\u201d in its severity. This harsh new sentence builds on lesser ones that Lai was already serving for participation in peaceful protests, yet Lai\u2019s most daunting legal troubles are still ahead. He will go on trial again this year, this time explicitly for violating the national-security law; the accusation of being a chief instigator makes his the most serious of the dozens of people currently charged under the law. Lai\u2019s case has been delayed as the Hong Kong government works furiously to forbid him from being represented by a British lawyer. In November, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, John Lee, asked Beijing to intervene in the matter after the city\u2019s courts ruled against the government\u2019s repeated efforts to force Lai to change lawyers. Shortly before the end of the year, China\u2019s top legislative body decreed that Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive has the power to override the court\u2019s decision.\n\nA conviction for Lai would be a tidy conclusion to Beijing\u2019s blatant exercise in rewriting history. Much as China\u2019s leaders succeeded in recasting the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, their narrative about the 2019 prodemocracy protests will strip agency from the hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers who took part in them. The revisionist history will also absolve the authorities themselves, in both Beijing and Hong Kong, of their numerous failures of governance. Hong Kong\u2019s courts, once lauded for their adherence to common law and judicial independence, will be pressed into serving this narrative.\n\nLai has a story of his own, a personal mythology he has recited countless times for reporters and rapt audiences. After his well-to-do family was stripped of its wealth when Mao Zedong came to power, Lai started his working life before he even reached his teens, carrying passengers\u2019 baggage at a railway station in mainland China. One day, a man whom Lai had helped with his luggage took a chocolate bar out of his pocket and handed it to Lai. When Lai asked the man where he had gotten such a delicious treat, the man said \u201cHong Kong.\u201d The city \u201cmust be heaven, because I\u2019ve never tasted anything like that,\u201d Lai recounted in The Hong Konger: Jimmy Lai\u2019s Extraordinary Struggle for Freedom, a hagiographical documentary released in 2022. Making it to the city became his mission.\n\nThe young Lai arrived in Hong Kong a few years later as a 12-year-old stowaway on a fishing boat. He worked his way up from being a child laborer in a garment factory to becoming a salesman, jetting between Hong Kong and New York City, where he hustled clothing samples by day and partied until dawn at Manhattan nightclubs. On one trip, as Lai has often told, a lawyer he was dining with gave him a copy of Friedrich Hayek\u2019s The Road to Serfdom. Lai credited the book with changing his life, inspiring him to become an entrepreneur freed from the shackles of the state.\n\nIn 1981, he launched his own clothing brand. He called it Giordano\u2014by his account, after a pizza parlor he wandered into one night in New York looking for a cure for the munchies after using marijuana. The Hong Kong\u2013based company soon flourished by selling casual wear in fast-growing consumer markets across Asia.\n\nLai, however, was not content merely to become a multimillionaire. In 1989, as protests gathered momentum in China, he donated tens of thousands of dollars to the student demonstrators who gathered in Tiananmen Square, and he had T-shirts printed that bore images of the student leaders\u2019 faces. After the Chinese authorities crushed the movement, Lai decided he needed a more formal platform for his message and ventured into journalism. He started Next magazine, a weekly publication, and then Apple Daily. The title was an allusion to the biblical tale of Adam and Eve and the tree of knowledge. \u201cAn apple a day keeps the liars away,\u201d an early slogan proclaimed.\n\nRead: Hong Kong\u2019s most brazen arrest yet\n\nThe entrepreneur\u2019s outspoken criticism of the Chinese Communist Party made him an anomaly among the city\u2019s business elites. \u201cFor Hong Kong\u2019s big business leaders, especially those with interests in the colony that extend beyond 1997, allying with Beijing is simply good business,\u201d a reporter at the International Herald Tribune noted in a 1991 article that highlighted Lai and his \u201cunusual\u201d position in the former British colony that was due to be handed back to China. But part of Giordano\u2019s parent company was owned by a Chinese state-controlled enterprise, and Lai said he had no problems with interference from the mainland.\n\nThe congeniality did not last. After Lai wrote a mocking attack on Chinese Premier Li Peng in a 1994 issue of Next, Giordano\u2019s stores on the mainland faced bureaucratic harassment that continued even after Lai resigned from the company\u2019s board and sold the remainder of his stake to focus instead on his media empire. With his publishing ventures, he had, he said, entered the business of delivering \u201cinformation, which is choice and choice is freedom.\u201d\n\nLai\u2019s version of freedom in his publications involved an eclectic, often sensationalist mix: Columns from leading prodemocracy advocates and political investigations ran alongside stories of sex scandals and celebrity gossip. Sometimes, Apple Daily breached journalistic boundaries and became the story itself. In 1998, the paper was obliged to print a front-page apology for its unethical and salacious coverage of a family murder-suicide. On another occasion, a staff reporter was arrested after he was discovered to have been paying police officers for information.\n\nDespite these missteps and setbacks, Lai was undaunted. He refused to be cowed by threats\u2014either from the authorities or from Hong Kong\u2019s elite. He tangled with the city\u2019s tycoons, whom he accused of pulling advertisements from the paper when he made an ill-fated foray into e-commerce. His home and office were firebombed on more than one occasion. Challenged by his own reporters, during a customary yearly interview, about rumors that he had slept with prostitutes before he married (for a second time) in 1991, Lai confirmed the stories, prompting coverage by the International Herald Tribune.\n\nHis vocal support of democracy and his defense of a free press gave Lai international media stature, and made him someone sought out for snappy quotes. The latitude his publications enjoyed became a bellwether for the freedoms that were meant to be preserved in Hong Kong under the agreement concluded in the run-up to the 1997 handover. \u201cWe are afraid, but we don\u2019t want to be intimidated by fear or blinded by pessimism,\u201d Apple Daily had declared in its first edition. For the next two decades, Apple Daily carved out an enviable position in Hong Kong\u2019s bare-knuckle newspaper business, becoming one of the city\u2019s most popular and trusted news sources.\n\nFrom the January/February 2023 issue: I went to Taiwan to say goodbye\n\nLai became a particular darling of the American right, which had long heralded Hong Kong as a pro-business utopia of low taxes and limited welfare where bootstrapping immigrants from the mainland could prosper\u2014just as Lai had. William McGurn, a journalist and later a speechwriter for George W. Bush, became Lai\u2019s godfather when Lai converted to Catholicism in 1997, shortly before the handover. John Bolton, who worked in numerous Republican administrations and served as a national security adviser to President Donald Trump, first met Lai in Hong Kong in the late 1990s. \u201cI was incredibly impressed by Jimmy,\u201d Bolton told me. He \u201creally had a vision for what Hong Kong could be and what kind of society he wanted in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nLai also became friends with the libertarian economist Milton Friedman and accompanied him to China. A vocal proponent of free-market capitalism himself, Lai argued that the U.S. had for too long tried to work with China, rather than confront the country and its leadership. \u201cYou in the West need to have confidence in the superiority of your own system,\u201d he said, when delivering a speech at the Hoover Institution in 2019. \u201cChina is never embarrassed to assert its own values even though these values are rooted in perhaps the most horrible Western export, Marxism. America needs to have the same confidence in its values and its own moral authority.\u201d\n\nThis improbable run as an avatar of press freedom lasted until the morning of August 10, 2020, when more than 100 police officers raided the headquarters of Apple Daily. Lai was escorted through the newsroom in handcuffs after being arrested. Despite the raid, the newspaper continued to publish for nearly a year. But police returned in June 2021, and the newspaper\u2019s bank accounts were frozen. The final edition of Apple Daily appeared on June 24.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s prodemocracy political parties and activists, though often lumped together, span a spectrum of political leanings. And despite doling out money to different prodemocracy groups\u2014donations revealed in 2014 when hundreds of his financial files were leaked\u2014Lai was not universally beloved. Some felt that he was too close to the city\u2019s old guard of moderates, whom younger generations believed had little to show after decades of pushing for incremental change, particularly after the Umbrella Movement limped to an end in 2014. Apple Daily was sometimes criticized for racist and sexist coverage, particularly from its more spirited columnists.\n\nIn 2019, when millions took to the streets and protesters sought international support, prominent activists and prodemocracy lawmakers turned to Washington. Lai capitalized on his Republican connections and had a series of meetings with Bolton, Vice President Mike Pence, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Bolton told me that Trump cared little about Hong Kong, other than being briefly impressed by the size of protests\u2014the city \u201chad joined Taiwan on the list of minor irritants he didn\u2019t want getting in the way of his relationship with Xi Jinping,\u201d Bolton said. Still, these senior Trump officials regarded meeting Lai as important because it showed that \u201cAmerica as a whole was strongly supportive of what the Hong Kongers wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAnne Applebaum: China\u2019s war against Taiwan has already started\n\nBack at home, though, press coverage of the meetings enraged the Hong Kong government. Chinese state-backed media denounced Lai as a traitor who had betrayed the nation in favor of American interests.\n\nAt the same time, Lai faced criticism from activists in the prodemocracy camp. Despite his support for the protests, he was attacked for not backing more radical actions against police misconduct. Tam Tak-chi, a prodemocracy activist with the People Power party, who pleaded guilty to a national-security offense after taking part in an unofficial primary vote in 2020, was one who saw Lai as too conservative. During a recent interview from jail, where he is serving a 40-month sentence for sedition, Tam told me Lai was \u201cnot as progressive\u201d as his own party.\n\nNevertheless, Lai\u2019s activities would soon land him in trouble with the Hong Kong authorities. In 2019, Lai started helping a pair of prodemocracy activists, one of whom was an awkward IT worker from Hong Kong named Andy Li. Li had thrown himself into the 2019 movement and became a key member of a group that aimed to raise awareness of the protests abroad by purchasing newspaper ads. After the success of the campaign and an influx of donations, the group, Stand With Hong Kong, expanded into lobbying and meeting with foreign-government officials. Li, according to people who know him, had a robotic work ethic, seemingly able to grind for days without sleep. A lawyer who represents him declined my request for comment.\n\nIn August 2020, Li was arrested for violating the national-security law on a charge of conspiring to collude with foreign forces. Less than two weeks after his arrest, while out on police bail, Li tried to flee to Taiwan by boat but was apprehended, along with 11 others. According to two people with knowledge of his case, Li flipped and agreed to cooperate with officials in building a case against Lai.\n\nIn August 2021, Li pleaded guilty, as did his co-defendant, Chan Tsz-wah, a paralegal. Police investigating the two had an almost obsessive focus on Lai and the U.S. government, according to one of the two people I talked with who were familiar with the investigation. Documents in the case underscore the point: The bulk of the 30-page summary of facts submitted to the court focuses primarily on Lai. The prosecutors paint him as the \u201cmastermind\u201d of a fundraising-and-lobbying effort that, in reality, was largely a crowdsourced undertaking by activists that began on a popular message board.\n\nThe court documents also almost exclusively blame Lai for pushing the U.S. government to pass legislation aimed at punishing Hong Kong for its loss of autonomy from the mainland, and later to sanction government officials both in the city and in Beijing. The Hong Kong authorities described Lai in court documents as representing \u201cthe highest level of the syndicate\u201d\u2014as though he were a triad boss.\n\nAlthough Lai was involved in Stand With Hong Kong, to portray him as its architect grossly inflates his role, according to the person with close knowledge of one of Lai\u2019s trials. \u201cThey have to have someone who admits to being the mastermind,\u201d this person told me. \u201cJimmy stood out for them: He said a lot of things, he has money,\u201d so, in the eyes of the government, \u201che has to take the responsibility for the whole movement.\u201d\n\nRead: The Hong Kong protesters aren\u2019t driven by hope\n\nLai\u2019s influence on recent U.S. policy making is also exaggerated. Trump, for all his anti-China bluster, was unconcerned with human rights and primarily interested in signing a trade deal with China. A more forceful bipartisan response to the situation in Hong Kong came only after Beijing imposed the national-security law\u2014but even then, Washington held back on the harsher measures advocated by some within the administration. A plan to help Hong Kongers resettle in the U.S. was scuttled by Republican Senator Ted Cruz in December 2020. A temporary order enacted by President Joe Biden to permit extended stays in the U.S. for Hong Kong residents is set to expire next month. Whatever influence Lai had over any of this is probably negligible.\n\nLai is also at the center of a court case against six former Apple Daily staff members, who pleaded guilty under the national-security law in November to charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces. In court documents, prosecutors construe routine editorial meetings and banal newsroom decisions as conspiratorial intent\u2014including material published by the newspaper that prosecutors claim was masquerading as news but was really calling for protests or violence. Again, Lai is portrayed as the ringleader of a plot to elicit foreign interference that would \u201cimpose sanctions or blockade, or engage in other hostile activities against\u201d China and Hong Kong. That prosecutors will call for Lai to receive the maximum penalty, a life sentence, seems a near certainty.\n\nWhat drives the authorities\u2019 fixation on Jimmy Lai, rather than any other prodemocracy figure, is a question that prompts a range of answers. Other candidates for ringleaders and such harsh punishment certainly exist. Joshua Wong, who rose to prominence as a teenage protest leader, has a larger global reach and greater name recognition than Lai. Martin Lee, the genial \u201cgodfather of Hong Kong democracy,\u201d was a regular figure in Washington long before Lai, twice meeting with President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In Hong Kong itself, other activists who vaulted to prominence during the protests are far more popular than Lai.\n\nSteve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies and the author of several books on Hong Kong, told me one theory of the obsession. Beijing understands, he said, \u201cthat logistics is key to eventual success in any competition,\u201d and that cutting off Lai\u2019s ability to provide support to prodemocracy groups was more pressing than silencing politicians shouting slogans. Another theory he offered was that the persecution was simply a scare tactic. \u201cBy treating Lai harshly,\u201d Tsang told me, \u201cthe party will be able to send a clear and powerful signal to dissidents in Hong Kong that none of them can be safe, if all the money and overseas profile Lai has cannot protect him.\u201d\n\nWhen I recently interviewed C. Y. Leung, Hong Kong\u2019s acerbic former chief executive, for another project, he angrily insisted on steering the conversation back to his own expansive and detailed version of the Lai conspiracy. Leung has become extremely jingoistic of late and spoke of Lai with the seething anger of a QAnon follower.\n\nRead: No exit from zero COVID for Xi Jinping\n\nAccording to Leung, Lai has been covertly working with the British government ever since 1997 to split Hong Kong from China. To achieve this, Lai bankrolled the city\u2019s prodemocracy camp to foment a pro-independence revolt. \u201cHe had all the leading opposition politicians in his pocket,\u201d he told me, \u201cand through them he mobilized people and he had his propaganda machinery.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Leung to provide evidence of his claims, he told me that this would be like asking the CIA to unveil its secrets. \u201cOf course I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. Pressed on why, during his five years as chief executive, he did not move to put an end to Lai\u2019s schemes, Leung responded, \u201cWe have to have a legal basis, whatever we do.\u201d In other words, none of Lai\u2019s political activities were illegal before the national-security law passed.\n\nBut with that in place, Beijing has weaponized the courts against its longtime adversaries\u2014just as Chinese state media continues to promote Lai as the poster boy of everything nefarious in Hong Kong. For both purposes, Lai has a sufficiently high profile and is convincingly rich enough to have fomented a subversive uprising; and, amid the nationalist atmosphere that prevails in Beijing, Lai also had highly suspect foreign connections that reached close to the center of power in Washington, particularly during the Trump administration.\n\nBy turning to its old playbook of assigning blame to a hostile force at home backed by support from abroad, the Chinese Communist Party is falling into a trap of its own creation. Given the sentences that Lai is likely to receive for his alleged crimes, Lai could very well be imprisoned for the rest of his life. In looking for a scapegoat, Beijing may find it has created a martyr.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Brasilia, Brazil (CNN) --In an effort to ensure the safety of citizens, Brazil's federal government has announced a temporary gun ban in the country's capital city. The ban, which will take effect starting Saturday, is a direct response to the upcoming inauguration of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nOn Wednesday, the federal government announced that the ban would be in place from Saturday, December 28, 2021, until Saturday, January 4, 2022. According to the decree, all guns, rifles and other firearms must be surrendered to the respective police stations in each municipality by Saturday. The regulation also applies to individuals who own guns for hunting and other recreational activities.\n\nThe ban was announced after a meeting between the Ministers of Justice and the Interior, which discussed the security measures in place ahead of President Lula da Silva's inauguration. Lula is set to take office on January 1, 2022, after defeating his right-wing rival Jair Bolsonaro in the October 2022 presidential elections.\n\nIn announcing the ban, Brazil's Minister of Justice, Nuno Gomes, said it was necessary to ensure the safety and security of citizens in the capital, which is bracing for large-scale protests in the lead-up to Lula's inauguration.\n\n\"We want to make sure that the people of Brazil can enjoy a peaceful transition of power and an inauguration without any violence,\" Gomes said. \"We have seen in the past that firearms can be used to promote chaos and cause people to be hurt or killed.\"\n\nThe ban has received the support of the National Congress, which on Tuesday voted in favor of the temporary gun ban. The congress also authorized the mobilization of military personnel to areas near the presidential palace in Brasilia, where the inauguration is set to take place.\n\nWhile the government has said the ban will only be in place until January 4, it has also hinted that it may be extended, depending on the security situation in the capital.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned with maintaining law and order in the city and will take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the citizens,\" Gomes said. \"It is our responsibility to make sure that nothing interrupts the democratic transition of power.\"\n\nThe announcement of the temporary gun ban has drawn praise from gun control activists and other civil society groups. The organizations, which have long campaigned for stricter gun control laws in Brazil, have lauded the decision as a \"historic step forward.\"\n\n\"This ban is an important first step in the fight to curb gun violence in Brazil,\" said Paulo Rogerio, a spokesman for gun control group Viva Brazil. \"We hope the government continues to take further measures to reduce the prevalence of firearms in the country.\"\n\nThe temporary gun ban is just the latest measure the federal government has taken to ensure the safety of citizens ahead of Lula's inauguration. Earlier this month, the government announced the deployment of 5,000 federal police officers to the capital, in addition to the 9,000 officers already stationed there. The police officers will be responsible for maintaining public order and preventing any potential violent protests.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has urged citizens to remain calm and to respect the democratic transition of power that will take place next month.\n\n\"We must remember that we are one nation,\" Gomes said in a statement. \"It is in our best interest to ensure that the inauguration takes place in a peaceful and orderly manner.\"", "label": "machine"}

Eine der weltweit f\u00fchrenden Recruiting-Plattformen investiert knapp eine Millionen Euro in das Frauenteam des Fu\u00dfballvereins FC Viktoria Berlin. Ein Gespr\u00e4ch \u00fcber diese Partnerschaft mit der Viktoria-Mitgr\u00fcnderin Katharina Kurz und Thorsten Otte, dem Chief Financial Officer von StepStone.\n\nWarum sponsert StepStone einen Frauen-Fu\u00dfballverein aus der Regionalliga? Es geht um Chancengleichheit \u2013 im Profifu\u00dfball wie auf dem Arbeitsmarkt. Das besprechen wir mit Katharina Kurz, Viktoria-Mitgr\u00fcnderin und Chefin der Berliner Craftbeer-Marke BRLO, und mit Thorsten Otte, dem Chief Financial Officer von StepStone.\n\nFrage: Frau Kurz, Herr Otte: Die Recruiting-Plattform StepStone sponsert die Frauenfu\u00dfballmannschaft von Viktoria Berlin. Warum?\n\nThorsten Otte: F\u00fcr uns ist Viktoria Berlin eines der spannendsten Fu\u00dfballprojekte Deutschlands.\n\nKatharina Kurz: Wir wollen mit Viktoria Berlin neue Wege im Frauenfu\u00dfball gehen. Dabei wollen wir nicht nur innerhalb von f\u00fcnf Jahren in der Bundesliga spielen, sondern auch weit \u00fcber Berlin hinaus Strahlkraft entwickeln.\n\nChief Financial Officer von StepStone Thorsten Otte \u00a9StepStone\n\nThorsten Otte: Viktoria Berlin hat sich nicht nur sportlich ein ambitioniertes Ziel gesetzt, sondern auch gesellschaftlich. Es geht um mehr Sichtbarkeit f\u00fcr den Frauenfu\u00dfball. Es geht darum, die Bedingungen f\u00fcr Sportlerinnern zu verbessern. Wir sind \u00fcberzeugt davon, dass Viktoria Berlin als Vorreiter \u00fcber den Fu\u00dfball hinaus wahrgenommen wird.\n\nKatharina Kurz: StepStone will mit uns gemeinsam etwas bewegen. Und das haben wir auch schon. Durch unsere Partnerschaft mit StepStone war es m\u00f6glich, dass zum ersten Mal ein Regionalligaspiel der Frauen im deutschen Free TV \u00fcbertragen werden konnte, das Lokal-Derby gegen T\u00fcrkiyemspor.\n\nThorsten Otte: Ein sehr spannendes Spiel im \u00dcbrigen, das Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer mit einem 2:1 belohnt hat.\n\nFrage: Und wie passt Frauenfu\u00dfball zu StepStone?\n\nThorsten Otte: Die Mission von Viktoria Berlin passt perfekt zu unserem Engagement f\u00fcr mehr Chancengleichheit am Arbeitsmarkt. Denn auch wenn die Unterschiede zwischen M\u00e4nnern und Frauen in anderen Branchen nicht so auf der Hand liegen wie im Fu\u00dfball, herrscht in der Arbeitswelt noch viel Ungleichbehandlung. Das wollen wir \u00e4ndern. Unser Ziel bei StepStone ist ein gerechter Arbeitsmarkt, auf dem jeder Mensch die gleichen Chancen hat. Wir stehen f\u00fcr Fair Play \u2013 im Sport genauso wie im Berufsleben.\n\nKatharina Kurz: Auch wir bei Viktoria haben uns Fair Play auf die Fahne geschrieben. Und dazu geh\u00f6rt selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch die Bezahlung von Sportlerinnen. Im Fu\u00dfball ist der Gender Pay Gap sicherlich noch mal gr\u00f6\u00dfer. In den Bundesligavereinen h\u00e4lt sich dar\u00fcber hinaus hartn\u00e4ckig der Glaube, dass man m\u00e4nnlicher Profifu\u00dfballer gewesen sein muss, um es in den gro\u00dfen Clubs zu etwas bringen zu k\u00f6nnen. Hier findet nur langsam ein Umdenken statt, dabei w\u00e4re genau das bitter n\u00f6tig.\n\nFrage: StepStone gibt seit Anfang 2021 in seinen Anzeigen an, wie viel Geld Bewerberinnen und Bewerber in der beworbenen Stelle verdienen k\u00f6nnen. Inwiefern passt das zu dem Ziel, das sich die Macherinnen der neuen Frauenmannschaft von Viktoria Berlin gesetzt haben?\n\nThorsten Otte: Faire Behandlung f\u00e4ngt schon bei der Bezahlung an. Dass gerade im Fu\u00dfball noch eine gro\u00dfe Ungleichheit herrscht, ist bekannt. Nat\u00fcrlich hat das viele strukturelle Gr\u00fcnde: von geringeren Sponsorengeldern \u00fcber weniger Einnahmen durch verkaufte Tickets bis hin zu weniger professionalisierter Jugendarbeit. Dennoch glauben wir, dass sich hier etwas \u00e4ndern muss \u2013 genau wie am Arbeitsmarkt insgesamt.\n\nViktoria-Mitgr\u00fcnderin Katharina Kurz \u00a9Maria Schiffer\n\nDenn auch hier hat der Gender Pay Gap strukturelle Gr\u00fcnde. Genauso, wie es keine Rolle spielen sollte, ob Frauen oder M\u00e4nner Fu\u00dfball spielen, sollten M\u00e4dchen wie selbstverst\u00e4ndlich eine Karriere als IT-Spezialistin anstreben und M\u00e4nner eine Karriere als Erzieher. Erst wenn jedem Menschen alle beruflichen Wege offenstehen, wird sich der Gender Pay Gap wirklich signifikant verringern. Der erste Schritt ist dabei Transparenz. Und genau die schaffen wir auf unserer Jobplattform, aber auch im Rahmen unseres Engagements bei Viktoria Berlin.\n\nFrage: Und wie entwickelt sich das \u2013 im Fu\u00dfball und im Arbeitsmarkt allgemein?\n\nKatharina Kurz: Das System Fu\u00dfball st\u00f6\u00dft langsam an seine Grenzen. Viele Fans sind desillusioniert. Mehr Vielfalt w\u00fcrde hier viel bringen. Bis zu einer gleichen Bezahlung ist im Fu\u00dfball sicherlich noch ein langer Weg zu gehen. Daf\u00fcr m\u00fcssen wir im ersten Schritt die Aufmerksamkeit f\u00fcr den Frauenfu\u00dfball deutlich und vor allem auch nachhaltig erh\u00f6hen. Die EM hat dieses Jahr schon einige positive Zeichen gesetzt, wie ich finde. Es haben beispielswiese mehr Menschen das EM-Finale der Frauen gesehen als das Vorrunden-Aus der M\u00e4nner bei der WM in Katar.\n\nThorsten Otte: Ich bin sehr optimistisch, dass die Zeichen auf mehr Gleichberechtigung stehen \u2013 auch weil wir es uns einfach wirtschaftlich nicht mehr leisten k\u00f6nnen, auch nur einen einzigen Menschen auszugrenzen. Wir erleben das Zeitalter der Arbeitslosigkeit, in dem immer mehr Menschen in Rente gehen und es gleichzeitig immer weniger Menschen gibt, die neu in den Arbeitsmarkt einsteigen.\n\nFrage: Was kann StepStone als Recruiting-Plattform f\u00fcr Chancengleichheit tun?\n\nThorsten Otte: Jeder Mensch sollte die M\u00f6glichkeit haben, den richtigen Job zu finden. Genau da setzen wir bei StepStone mit unseren digitalen L\u00f6sungen an \u2013 wir bauen sichtbare und auch unsichtbare H\u00fcrden ab. Ein Beispiel daf\u00fcr ist der Gender Bias Decoder, der Personalverantwortliche dabei unterst\u00fctzt, unbewusste Vorurteile bei der Formulierung von Stellenanzeigen zu vermeiden.\n\nFrage: Wie funktioniert der Genderbias Decoder?\n\nThorsten Otte: Studien zeigen, dass sich Frauen von Formulierungen, die eher m\u00e4nnlich kodiert sind wie zum Beispiel \u201ekarriereorientiert\u201c oder \u201eleistungsstark\u201c abgeschreckt f\u00fchlen und sich nicht auf einen Job bewerben. Gleichzeitig zeigen die Daten unserer Recruiting-Plattform, dass es bis zu 15 Prozent mehr Bewerbungen geben kann, wenn man Formulierungen wie diese anpasst. Das ist ein Beispiel daf\u00fcr, wie wir mit wenig Aufwand letztendlich eine gro\u00dfe Wirkung in Sachen Chancengleichheit erzielen.\n\nFrage: Was m\u00fcsste Ihrer Meinung nach passieren, damit sich die Arbeitswelt insgesamt in puncto Chancengleichheit nachhaltig ver\u00e4ndert?\n\nKatharina Kurz: Wir brauchen auf vielen Ebenen Ver\u00e4nderungen. Wir brauchen Vorbilder in allen Bereichen und ein Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis. Wir brauchen Unternehmen, die mutig vorangehen und die Diversity nicht nur als Lippenbekenntnis sehen. Und nat\u00fcrlich brauchen wir auch eine Politik, die diese Ver\u00e4nderungen aktiv begleitet.\n\nThorsten Otte: Ich sehe das ebenfalls als eine gesamtgesellschaftliche Aufgabe. Das geht von der besseren Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf bis hin zu faireren und angemesseneren Bezahlungen.\n\nDas erste Frauenteam des FC Viktoria Berlin \u00a9Michael Romacker\n\nKatharina Kurz: Im Fu\u00dfball m\u00fcsste sich f\u00fcr mehr Chancengleichheit sicherlich die Bezahlung \u00e4ndern. W\u00e4hrend man bei den M\u00e4nnern bereits in der Regionalliga (4. Spielklasse) gut vom Spielergehalt leben kann, haben die meisten Profisportlerinnen in der Ersten Bundesliga noch einen Zweiten Beruf. In der zweiten Bundesliga gibt es oftmals nur eine Aufwandsentsch\u00e4digung, und die Regionalliga (3. Spielklasse bei den Frauen) war bisher absolutes Amateurniveau. Hier w\u00fcnschen wir uns klare Zeichen und Ver\u00e4nderungen.\n\nFrage: Haben Sie in Sachen Fu\u00dfball auch Erwartungen an die Politik?\n\nKatharina Kurz: Es ist zwar sch\u00f6n, wenn der Kanzler nach der EM tweetet, dass er sich zum Thema Equal Pay austauschen m\u00f6chte. Aber hier gibt es strukturelle Benachteiligungen, die wir dringend angehen m\u00fcssen.\n\nFrage: Denken Sie, dass die Partnerschaft von StepStone und Viktoria Berlin dazu beitr\u00e4gt, dass das Thema Chancengleichheit mehr ins Bewusstsein der Menschen r\u00fcckt?\n\nThorsten Otte: Definitiv. Das sehen wir schon an der gro\u00dfen Resonanz, die wir auf das Projekt bekommen haben. Immer mehr prominente Unterst\u00fctzerinnen und Unterst\u00fctzer schlie\u00dfen sich an und auch das mediale Echo ist gro\u00dfartig. All das tr\u00e4gt dazu bei, dass wir mehr Aufmerksamkeit auf dieses wichtige Thema lenken.\n\nKatharina Kurz: Das sehe ich genauso. Plus: Wir haben so wahnsinnig viel Zuspruch f\u00fcr Viktoria erfahren, seit wir mit unserem Projekt an die \u00d6ffentlichkeit gegangen sind. Menschen, die einfach dankbar f\u00fcr dieses Zeichen sind und die die selbstbewusste Art und Weise feiern. Unsere Partner und Sponsoren haben uns nat\u00fcrlich wahnsinnig dabei unterst\u00fctzt, die n\u00f6tige Aufmerksamkeit und auch Legitimation zu bekommen. Wir hoffen sehr, dass wir im Frauensport noch viele Nachahmer finden. Denn: Ein starkes Netzwerk kann so vieles ver\u00e4ndern.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It used to be that cooking at home and avoiding restaurants was the only way to save money on groceries. But in the current economy, it's becoming increasingly difficult to save money in the same way.\n\nThat's why singer Cardi B is making headlines for her new documentary, \"Cookin' With Cardi,\" which looks at the increasing costs of dining out. In the film, she argues that the cost of groceries has gone up so much that eating out is often more affordable than making dinner at home.\n\nFor years, pundits have been pushing the idea that eating out is more expensive than cooking at home. But recent data shows that the cost of food away from home (including restaurants, bars, and cafes) has been rising more slowly than the cost of groceries over the last decade.\n\nAccording to the USDA's Economic Research Service, the cost of food away from home increased by 1.2% in 2018, while the cost of food at home increased by 2.3%. That's a significant difference that could have a major impact on your wallet.\n\nOf course, there are still ways to save money when eating out. Many restaurants offer discounts for certain days or times, or for large groups. If you're dining with friends, splitting the check can be a great way to save money.\n\nBut Cardi B makes a compelling argument for why it's often more affordable to go out than it is to stay in.\n\nFor starters, restaurants often have larger menus that offer more variety than what you would find at the grocery store. Many restaurants also specialize in particular dishes, allowing customers to find something they might not be able to make at home. \n\nIn addition, restaurants are often better prepared and more efficient than home cooks. Since they specialize in their craft, they often have more experience and better knowledge of how to cook a dish just right. This can be especially helpful if you're trying to create a complex dish like a paella or a classic French cassoulet.\n\nFurthermore, restaurants often have access to more interesting ingredients than what you might find at the grocery store. Chefs and restaurateurs can often source local, organic, or hard-to-find ingredients that are impossible to replicate at home.\n\nFinally, the cost of dining out includes more than just the food. Many restaurants also offer a unique experience that includes the atmosphere, the service, and the conversations you have with your friends. While these experiences can't be replicated in your own kitchen, they are a valuable part of any meal.\n\nThere's no doubt that cooking at home can save you money. But with rising grocery costs and a wide variety of restaurant options, it's becoming increasingly difficult to make that argument. \n\nCardi B is right \u2014 eating at home doesn't save you as much money as it used to. Whether you're trying to save some cash or treat yourself to a special meal, there's a lot to be said for the convenience and variety of dining out.", "label": "machine"}

That compared with a loss of $9.4 million, or 17 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a loss of 19 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue fell to $92.4 million in the quarter, compared with the year-ago period's $113.3 million. Analysts had expected $102.7 million.\n\nBeyond Meat said the declines in both its loss and revenue were primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as \"lower consumer demand and increased competitive dynamics in the plant-based meat category, including the launch of competing products by other companies.\"\n\nThe company said it was \"experiencing encouraging signs of recovery and believe our consumer, retail, foodservice and international businesses can continue to recover in the fourth quarter and beyond.\"\n\nBut it added that it was \"in the early stages of a competitive race in the plant-based meat category, and there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected.\"\n\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown said in a statement that the company was \"pleased that our second-quarter revenue exceeded our midpoint expectations and that we generated positive free cash flow.\"\n\n\"We believe this, coupled with the launch of our flagship products into new geographies and channels, positions us well for future growth,\" he said.\n\nShares of Beyond Meat, which have more than tripled this year, were down more than 9% in extended trading.\n\nThe company has been on an aggressive expansion path, with the launch of its Beyond Burger in more than 15 countries and its Beyond Sausage in several countries outside the U.S.\n\nIt has also said it plans to double its research and development team and move into new product categories such as snacks, condiments and seafood.\n\nThursday's results come after Beyond Meat announced a $500 million investment from the private-equity group Kleiner Perkins. That came as Beyond Meat faces increasing competition from companies like Impossible Foods, Nestle and Tyson Foods.\n\nImpossible Foods has a plant-based version of the Whopper, which is sold in more than 8,000 Burger King locations. Nestle has a plant-based version of its signature burgers. Tyson Foods has its own lineup of plant-based protein items, including nuggets, burgers and tenders.\n\nBeyond Meat, which debuted on the Nasdaq in 2019, is seen as one of the companies that has helped fuel the plant-based meat trend. It has a series of plant-based burgers, sausages and ground meat sold in grocery stores and fast-food restaurants across the U.S.\n\nAnalysts have said the sector is still in its early stages and that the current competitive landscape will likely change over the next few years.\n\nIn the third quarter, Beyond Meat said that total retail sales rose 10%, while foodservice sales fell 53%.\n\nDuring its earnings call, Brown said the company had a \"solid quarter,\" despite the pandemic, and the company's results had been \"driven by the strength of our core burgers and sausages.\"\n\nHe also said the company was planning to launch new products in early 2021, including Beyond Beef in Europe and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"We are very optimistic about our future and expect to continue to drive strong growth in the years to come,\" he said.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Migrants seeking refuge in Mexico crowded the nation's government offices in unprecedented numbers on Monday, amid fears that the incoming Biden administration in the United States would make it harder for them to cross the border.\n\nMexico, one of the main transit countries for Central American migrants and asylum seekers on the way to the United States, has seen a surge in recent weeks of people arriving to try to get paperwork for their journey.\n\nSince President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the November presidential election, there have been growing concerns among migrants in Mexico about possible changes to U.S. immigration policy that could make it harder for them to enter the country.\n\nThe Mexican government has moved to accommodate the sudden influx of migrants, converting buildings in some parts of the country into temporary refugee shelters. But long lines have been forming outside of offices of Mexico's National Institute of Migration (INM), which processes paperwork for migrants.\n\nIn Mexico City, the epicenter of the surge, the wait to get an appointment with the INM has been running up to 30 days. Lines of migrants with suitcases, backpacks, and babies wrapped in blankets snaked around the government office in the capital's south-eastern outskirts.\n\n\"We were here three weeks ago and it was full. Now it's more full,\" Francisco Chavez, a Honduran who arrived in Mexico with his wife and two sons a few months ago, told Reuters.\n\nThe migrants said they had been living on the streets or in shelters since arriving in Mexico, and had little or no money to pay for food, medicine, or other basic necessities.\n\n\"We don't know what will happen in the United States but we cannot wait any longer,\" said 23-year-old Evelin from El Salvador.\n\nThe Mexican government said it expected a record number of migrants to arrive in 2021, and said it would continue to provide refuge to those who sought it. Mexico's president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been sympathetic to the plight of Central American migrants, saying his government would provide them with humanitarian assistance.\n\nHowever, the government has also said that Mexico is not a safe country for migrants to transit through and urged them to seek asylum in their countries of origin.\n\nOfficials at the INM said they were doing their best to process the massive number of migrants seeking refuge in Mexico, but acknowledged that it had been a difficult situation.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can. We understand the migrants\u2019 plight, but it's a difficult situation with the limited staff and resources that we have,\" said an INM official who declined to be named.\n\nIn a statement, the Mexican government said that it was providing refugees with the necessary documents and assistance, and urged migrants to respect Mexican laws.\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations have criticized the Mexican government for not doing enough to protect the migrants, saying the situation has become increasingly desperate.\n\n\"Mexico is not providing adequate protection for asylum-seekers. Instead, it is erecting new obstacles to access asylum-related procedures and creating further conditions of extreme vulnerability for people who have fled their homes in search of protection,\" said a statement from the Washington-based Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization.\n\nThe U.S. government has also expressed concern about the surge of migrants at the Mexico-U.S. border. Earlier this week, it warned that it was considering \"all legal options\" to address the situation.\n\n\"Any migration flows that could lead to this type of overcrowding must be addressed in a humane and orderly way,\" the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n\nWith the future of U.S. immigration policy still uncertain, many migrants in Mexico said they were left with little choice but to continue their journey to the United States despite the risks.\n\n\"If I have to pay the 'coyotes' to go, I will. If I die I die. I have no choice,\" said Chavez. \"It's a dangerous journey and we're scared, but it's our only hope.\"", "label": "machine"}

FSOC advised investors to research digital asset firms, as many use unregulated, unregistered and unregistered international platforms to offer securities in violation of federal laws.\n\nThe FSOC also cautioned potential investors to think twice before investing in digital assets. According to the advisory, digital assets are not backed by any government or central bank and, as such, are subject to high levels of price volatility and are not necessarily safe investments. The advisory also highlighted the additional risk posed by the fact that the prices for some digital assets can be easily manipulated by bad actors.\n\nThe financial stability watchdog also warned that cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges are vulnerable to cyberattacks, and urged investors to use caution when sending digital assets to exchanges or third parties.\n\nIn a statement, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the FSOC\u2019s advisory was an important step in protecting consumers from the risks of digital asset investments.\n\n\u201cThe FSOC\u2019s advisory is a critical reminder that digital asset fraud and market manipulation is a serious threat to investors, particularly those on the margins of the financial system. The Treasury Department is committed to strengthening financial system resilience and protecting investors from cybercriminals and other bad actors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe advisory marks the first time the FSOC has issued guidance on the digital asset space. The FSOC said it intends to continue to monitor and assess the risks associated with digital assets and \u201cimplement recommendations to protect investors and ensure the integrity of financial markets.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department also recently issued a warning about the dangers of investment in cryptocurrencies, cautioning investors to be wary of digital assets with no intrinsic value or backed by physical assets, as well as those that rely on anonymity or lack corporate governance safeguards.\n\nThe FSOC\u2019s latest advisory marks a significant step in government efforts to protect consumers from financial risks posed by digital asset investments. It follows a series of recent regulatory moves by various U.S. federal regulators to clamp down on fraud in the space.\n\nIn October, the SEC issued a framework for investment advisers to evaluate digital assets, as well as a statement warning investors about the risk of fraud and market manipulation in digital asset markets. Meanwhile, the CFTC has been actively prosecuting fraudulent schemes involving digital assets, including those involving virtual currencies.\n\nAs the digital asset space continues to mature, authorities will likely continue to enhance their efforts to protect investors and promote the integrity of cryptocurrency markets. In the meantime, investors should proceed with caution and always perform due diligence when investing in digital assets.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "\u201cThe 360\u201d shows you diverse perspectives on the day\u2019s top stories and debates.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening\n\nLast month, the Biden administration released a new plan to address homelessness, which has steadily increased in the United States over the past several years.\n\nThe White House\u2019s strategy centers around a concept known as Housing First, a relatively new approach to homelessness that has shown some significant promise since it was pioneered a few decades ago. As the name suggests, Housing First is built around the principle of providing people with long-term housing before starting services to address their mental health, addiction or other challenges they face. Many anti-homelessness programs require participants to take part in counseling or prove they\u2019re sober in order to receive benefits. Under Housing First, these supports are all voluntary.\n\nWhen Housing First was first attempted in the early 1990s, it represented a sharp departure from what had been the previous consensus on homelessness \u2014 which was built around a so-called treatment-first approach, based on the belief that people needed to achieve a certain level of stability before providing them with housing.\n\nOver the years, there have been several examples of cities that have significantly reduced homelessness using the Housing First strategy. Among the most successful is Houston, where homelessness has dropped more than 60% since 2011 thanks to a program that placed more than 25,000 people in long-term supportive housing. Housing First has helped reduce homelessness in places as diverse as Utah and Georgia, as well as cities in Canada and across Europe.\n\nBut there are also examples of places where Housing First doesn\u2019t appear to have worked. During the past two years, California has spent $14 billion to combat homelessness \u2014 most of it on Housing First programs \u2014 but the number of people living on the street has continued to rise. Growing concerns about homelessness have become a major political issue in a number of liberal big cities in recent years, in some cases prompting local leaders to rely more on police in their response.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nHousing First advocates say providing people shelter with no preconditions is the only way to permanently solve homelessness, rather than simply relieve the harm it causes. They argue that people must have their basic needs met, including shelter, before there can be any opportunity to address their more complex problems \u2014 whether it\u2019s mental health, addiction or unemployment. There\u2019s substantial research to support this view, with a number of studies showing that individuals who are supplied a place to live are more likely to stay off the streets and voluntarily participate in counseling and addiction services than those involved in treatment-first programs.\n\nThough the approach first became federal policy during the George W. Bush administration, many conservatives have come to reject Housing First. Their primary criticism is that failing to require any kind of treatment as a stipulation for housing support allows mental illness and addiction to fester unchecked and may take away the main incentive many people have to seek help in the first place. Some also believe it\u2019s unrealistic to think that cities can afford to supply housing to everyone who needs it.\n\nThere are also those who believe in the principle of Housing First, but see a variety of reasons why it may not work everywhere. One of the biggest challenges, they say, is that there simply isn\u2019t enough housing in many major cities, which can make it prohibitively expensive for local governments to buy up enough homes to make Housing First work. Others say housing alone is not the solution and must be paired with ongoing support services once someone has gotten into a home.\n\nPerspectives\n\nPeople can\u2019t address their problems if they don\u2019t have a roof over their heads\n\n\u201cIt's based on the incredibly basic idea that homelessness \u2014 as the name implies \u2014 is about the lack of a home. Instead of requiring people to sober up or meet other difficult requirements before getting a government-funded living space, Housing First gives people the security of a roof over their heads and then works on getting them sober and into a job. It\u2019s a recognition that shelter is a prerequisite for self-improvement.\u201d \u2014 Noah Smith, Bloomberg\n\nGiving someone a home discourages them from seeking help for their underlying problems\n\n\u201cThe Housing First approach discourages behavioral changes and no longer funds the treatment the homeless need to address their underlying struggles.

{"text": "The first week of 2023 has been full of surprises for the stock market. There have been moves that have taken investors aback and ones that investors have welcomed with open arms. In the first week of the year, it is clear that the market is taking a different shape than what investors were expecting at the start of the year.\n\nTo start, the S&P 500 saw a huge gain in the first week of 2023, rising 6.3% from the start of the year. This was a big surprise and a sign that investors are optimistic about the year ahead. One of the reasons that investors were optimistic was that the market was expecting a continuation of the strong economic growth seen in 2020.\n\nThe second week of the year, however, has seen some more volatility. The S&P 500 has fallen slightly, with the index now down 1.2% since the start of the year. This was due to some concerns about the outlook for the economy and the stock market in the coming year.\n\nWhat is interesting about the market so far this year is the way that certain sectors have been performing. Technology stocks have been one of the biggest winners so far this year, rising nearly 10% since the start of the year. This is likely due to strong expectations for tech companies as they continue to benefit from the growth of digital technology.\n\nEnergy stocks have been another big winner, with the sector rising 8.7% since the start of the year. This is due to the expectation that higher oil prices will drive higher profits for oil and gas companies.\n\nFinancial stocks have been one of the worst-performing sectors, falling 4.4% since the start of the year. This is likely due to concerns about rising interest rates and the potential impact on banks\u2019 profits.\n\nThe overall sentiment of the market is still positive, but investors are beginning to get more cautious as the year progresses. With the market having already shown its hand in the first week of the year, investors are now looking ahead to the rest of 2023 to see if the positive start will continue.\n\nThis caution is likely to lead to investors doing more research before investing in stocks. Investors are likely to be more selective in the stocks they invest in, favoring those with strong fundamentals and growth potential. They are also likely to be more willing to take profits on stocks that have risen rapidly, rather than continue to hold them for long periods of time.\n\nThe first week of the year has been an interesting one for the stock market, and it has shown some signs of what is to come in 2023. Despite the overall optimism, investors should be careful to do their research and be selective in their investments. With the market already having shown its hand in the first week of 2023, investors should be prepared for a volatile year ahead.", "label": "machine"}

The SEC says they are also cooperating with its investigation.\n\nNo incentive to plead guilty\n\nAccording to James Park, a securities fraud expert at UCA Law, Bankman-Fried didn't have many options going into Tuesday's hearing, because of Wang's and Ellison's plea deals.\n\n\"Sam Bankman-Fried was probably not offered a deal because he is likely the main instigator of the fraud, and there is no one higher up that he can testify against,\" Park said. \"He thus had no incentive to plead guilty, and will attempt to leverage his ability to take the case to trial to get a more favorable sentence than is being offered at the start of the case.\"\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested last month in the Bahamas, where FTX is headquartered, at the request of the United States government.

{"text": "As the pandemic has caused many individuals to lose their jobs, it has become more important than ever to update resumes to ensure applicants are maximizing their chances of getting hired. While job seekers may focus on the traditional methods of revamping resumes, a new trend has taken shape that is proving to be beneficial for many.\n\nRecently, many job seekers have been making small tweaks to their resumes that could potentially result in more job callbacks. Specifically, job seekers are recognizing the importance of putting their current volunteer or side projects on their resumes to fill potential gaps in their employment history.\n\nThe idea of making this small tweak to one\u2019s resume is not a new concept, but rather one that has evolved over the last decade. In 2011, a study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that job seekers who included volunteer work on their resumes had a higher chance of securing job interviews. This concept of showcasing volunteer work on a resume has continued to increase in popularity and relevance over the years.\n\nThe reason why volunteer work is so important to include on a resume is because it shows potential employers that an individual is willing to go above and beyond to further their career. Whether it\u2019s a side project, volunteer work or internships, any work that is meaningful and valuable to the employer should be highlighted.\n\nFor those who have been laid off due to the pandemic, including volunteer experience on their resumes could be the difference between success and failure. A few examples of how volunteer experience can be included on a resume include:\n\n\u2022 Participated in a board of directors for a non-profit organization. \n\u2022 Volunteered as an assistant teacher for a school or tutoring program.\n\u2022 Assisted with fundraising initiatives for a charity.\n\nMoreover, for those who are considering changing their career path or industries, volunteering can serve as a great way to gain experience in the new field. By volunteering, individuals can gain skills, enhance their network and build on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to think beyond just volunteering in order to make your resume stand out. For those looking to highlight a gap in their employment, they can put a spin on it by showcasing any side projects they have completed or any online courses they have taken during their period of unemployment. These online activities will demonstrate to employers that the individual is continuing to work on their professional development and is eager to learn.\n\nMoreover, job seekers can include any work-related certifications or professional affiliations on their resume to demonstrate their proficiency in their field. This can include any external certifications from an accredited institute or any professional groups that an individual may be a part of.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember to keep your resume up-to-date. Job seekers should make sure to update their resume after they have added new experiences or certifications, or even after they have removed outdated ones. Moreover, those applying to jobs should ensure that their resume is tailored to the specific job that they are applying to. \n\nUltimately, making small tweaks to your resume can result in more job callbacks. By being mindful of the things that you include on your resume, you can make yourself a more attractive candidate to potential employers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "market\n\n\n\nCanada\u2019s housing market has been under pressure for some time now, with prices reaching all-time highs in some regions and concerns over whether foreign buyers are contributing to the skyrocketing prices.\n\nIn an effort to try to slow the rising costs of housing, Canada\u2019s government has taken an unusual step: a ban on non-Canadian buyers.\n\nThe ban will prevent foreign buyers from buying real estate in the country and will apply to properties valued at or above $1 million (or CAD$1.25 million). It will be in effect from June 10 until December 31, 2021, and will apply to foreign buyers outside of Canada.\n\nThe new ban is part of a larger package of measures aimed at stabilizing the Canadian housing market, which has been spiraling out of control in recent years.\n\nThe move was made in an effort to protect the Canadian housing market from speculative buyers from abroad and to ensure that Canadian citizens have access to affordable housing in their home country.\n\nThe ban comes after other measures have been taken to try to alleviate the housing crisis. For example, Canada recently implemented a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers of residential property in British Columbia, which has been one of the regions hardest hit by skyrocketing prices.\n\nThe new ban is unlikely to bring prices down significantly, as the demand for housing in the country has outpaced the supply. Instead, it is hoped that the new ban will prevent foreign buyers from further driving up prices in the market.\n\nIt should also help ensure that Canadian citizens have a more reasonable chance at purchasing a home. After all, if more non-Canadians can purchase homes, this will drive up prices, leaving it harder for Canadians to afford them.\n\nThe Canadian government is also hoping that the ban will help control inflation and ease the debt burden for Canadian households. By preventing foreign buyers from buying homes, the government is trying to reduce demand in the market and, in turn, bring prices down.\n\nHowever, the ban may not have the desired effect. There is a possibility that it could have a negative impact on the Canadian economy, as it could hurt foreign investment in the country.\n\nAdditionally, the ban could lead to increased speculation and a drop in housing supply. This could potentially reduce the number of homes available to Canadians, thus making it even harder for them to purchase a home.\n\nIn the end, the ban will remain in effect until 2021, at which point the Canadian government will review its effects. If it is not effective in cooling the housing market, more measures may be necessary to ensure Canadians have access to affordable housing.\n\nIn the meantime, the ban is yet another example of the government taking drastic steps to try to fix an issue that has been plaguing the country for some time. Whether or not it is successful remains to be seen, but it is a step in the right direction.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Treasury yield curve has been an interesting animal over the past several months, as investors in the U.S. contemplate the future of Federal Reserve rate policy. \n\nIn recent days, the 10-year Treasury yield has breached the 1.1% mark, while the two-year yield has hovered around 0.1%. On Tuesday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield settled at its highest level in more than a year and a half, closing at 1.14%.\n\nThe move higher comes as the economy continues to improve and investors gain confidence in the recovery. Additionally, rising inflation expectations are boosting the yields.\n\nThe rise in yields has been driven by a combination of factors, including improving economic data, increasing inflation expectations and speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has maintained its target range of 0.00% to 0.25% since the onset of the pandemic. But with the economy improving and inflation expectations rising, some market observers have begun to speculate that the Fed will start to raise rates sooner than expected.\n\nThe question now is, when and how much will the Federal Reserve increase interest rates?\n\nThe Fed has indicated that it will not raise interest rates until full employment has been reached. Many economists have estimated that it could take a year or longer for the economy to fully recover.\n\nBut if inflation expectations continue to rise, the Fed may be forced to act sooner. There has already been speculation that the Fed may start to raise rates as soon as the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe question of how much the Fed will raise rates is also a major factor. Some analysts are predicting that the Fed could move to raise rates by as much as one percentage point over the next 12 months. \n\nIf the Fed were to raise rates by one percentage point, it would mark the biggest single move in rates in the past decade. And it could cause a significant shift in the Treasury yield curve. \n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield is closely watched by investors, as it serves as a benchmark for setting the cost of borrowing across a wide range of investments, such as mortgages and corporate bonds. A steepening of the yield curve, driven by Fed rate hikes, could cause borrowing costs to rise for businesses and consumers. \n\nThe Fed has yet to commit to any specific rate hikes, but there is already speculation that the market could experience a sharp increase in rates in the coming months. \n\nAs investors mull over the potential for rate increases, the Treasury yield curve remains in focus. Any move higher in rates could have a significant impact on borrowing costs, with the effects felt across a wide range of investments. \n\nAt this point, investors are closely watching for any clues from the Federal Reserve that might indicate when and how much interest rates may rise.

{"text": "Most American shoppers say they are willing to pay more for their retail club memberships \u2014 a sentiment that bodes well for Investing Club holding Costco (COST). The survey says ... According to an Evercore ISI survey of more than 2,500 U.S. consumers, more than 80% said they'd be willing to pay a higher annual fee to stay in their shopping clubs, up 25 percentage points from 2015. The survey also found that Americans intend to renew memberships at \"record high levels,\" or more than nine of every 10 respondents. \"We viewed member pushback as minimal and lower than prior year surveys,\" Evercore said, indicating consumers are receptive to fee hikes following increases for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime service in March and Walmart's (WMT) Sam's Club in October. This is a positive readthrough for Costco, which hasn't hiked annual membership prices in several years. In the Evercore survey, Costco was reported as having the \"highest fee inelasticity,\" or consistent demand for its products, even in a deteriorating economy, with 60% of its members willing to pay 10% or more in membership fees. Moreover, an overwhelming 94% of Costco members in the survey said they'll 'definitely' or 'probably' renew their memberships as loyal customers continue to see value in the club model. Those numbers are consistent with renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada at 92.5%, according to Costco's latest quarterly results , which were released earlier this month. The worldwide renewal rate was 90.4%. As a result of the survey findings, Evercore favors Costco for a planned fee increase and the potential for a special dividend sometime next year. The firm kept its outperform, or buy rating, on COST and increased the stock's price target to $540 per share from $530. \"We are boosting our COST base case as a result of today's survey findings, as the company (Costco) appears well positioned to continue compounding as traffic and renewal rates hit record highs, with the added survey insight that a fee hike is likely to be relatively well received by members while boosting earnings growth to double digits,\" analysts at Evercore said. Costco's standard Gold Star Membership costs $60 per year. For an additional $60, customers get the Executive Membership and earn additional rewards and lower prices on certain products and services. Costco's last membership price hike was in June 2017, when the wholesale retailer increased its standard membership fee from $55 to $60 and its Executive membership from $110 to $120. Historically, Costco has increased its membership fee every five years, an anniversary that passed a few months ago. While no formal announcements have been made yet, CFO Richard Galanti said in the company's last earnings report that \"it's a question of when not, if.\" Galanti added during the Dec. 9 call, \"We feel that we're in a very strong position right now. And if we have to wait a few months or several months, that's fine.\" Earlier this year, management said the company has held off raising membership fees as the inflation burden has weighed on consumers. But with decades-high inflation showing signs of cooling as of late, that could support Costco's case to increase fees. Evercore analysts believe Costco could make the announcement in April 2023 Shares of Costco closed up nearly 1% on Wednesday at $462.06 apiece. The stock has dropped 18% year to date, pretty much in line with the S & P 500 's decline in 2022. For the Club, we're sitting on an unrealized gain of nearly 60% gain on stock purchased in 2020. We own 110 shares of COST for a 1.8% weighting in the portfolio. On Dec. 1, we sold 55 shares of COST and lowered it to a 2 rating . Bottom line Positive consumer survey results from Evercore \u2014 which confirmed strong membership renewal rates, as seen in its latest quarter \u2014 signal that any Costco membership fee increases would likely be met with very little resistance from shoppers and could be a catalyst for the stock. That's a position we share, and it aligns with our investment case on the wholesale retailer, which we think is best in class. Consumers are willing to pay more for membership fees because they know Costco has cost-saving deals, offering a strong value proposition unmatched by retail competitors. It's a volume-driven company. As inflation is deteriorating consumer spending power, Americans are seeking refuge in discounts. In a recent interview with Jim Cramer, Costco CEO, Craig Jelinek called the compamy the \"price police,\" because it constantly negotiates prices with its suppliers to get the best deals for its members. Another potential catalyst for Costco stock is the company's likely decision to issue a special dividend, which Evercore thinks could happen in 2023. Costco has more cash sitting on its balance sheet than what it needs to run its business, allowing it to reward shareholders with an additional cash dividend on Costco common stock in addition to its quarterly dividend. The last time Costco declared its special dividend was in November 2020 at $10 per share. The company has issued it four times in the past eight years. While long-term investors in Costco, we know the retailer isn't immune to a slower economy. Overall, we are cautious of the retail sector as macroeconomic headwinds continue to plague consumers, explaining why we prefer value-based stores. Costco is the best among its peers since it delivers durable earnings, record membership renewal rates and returns cash to shareholders \u2014 all while expanding its presence on a global scale.

{"text": "Elon Musk Twitter page seen on mobile with his poll to step down as head of Twitter\n\nTwitter owner and CEO Elon Musk is searching for a new chief executive of the company, sources told CNBC's David Faber.\n\nMusk, who acquired the company for $44 billion in October, has previously said his position as CEO would be temporary. In court in November, Musk said, \"I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO confirmed his plans to step down at Twitter in a tweet Tuesday night.\n\n\"I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams,\" he said.\n\nThe billionaire posted an informal poll Sunday asking Twitter users if he should step down as head of the company, and a majority of the 17 million respondents voted for Musk to leave his post. He said Sunday he would abide by the results of the poll.\n\nTwitter polls are straw polls, which means they are not comparable to professional public opinion research. Malicious bots or inauthentic accounts may also be able to register a response to a Twitter poll.\n\nSources told Faber that Musk's search for a new CEO has been ongoing and began before the Twitter poll was made.\n\nMusk's Twitter takeover has been rocky, as his leadership has resulted in massive staff cuts, a spike in racist hate speech, advertisers fleeing or slashing their spending on the platform, as well as the reinstatement of previously banned accounts.\n\nThe \"Chief Twit,\" as Musk has previously called himself, claims that Twitter usage has reached an all-time high since he took over, and that hate speech impressions have fallen.\n\nThe billionaire's management of Twitter has raised concerns about his other ventures.\n\nMusk has sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares this year to finance the Twitter takeover. He has also pulled in talent from Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Co., including executives, engineers and attorneys, to assist him at Twitter. Musk is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and founder of the Boring Co.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to the chair of Tesla's board, Robyn Denholm, expressing concern that Musk and the board may have violated legal obligations to Tesla shareholders.\n\nThe lawmaker, who has sparred with Musk in the past over the idea of a wealth tax, asked the board to answer specific questions about the alleged misappropriation of Tesla resources and conflicts of interest resulting from Musk's purchase of Twitter.\n\nIn a tweet Monday night, Musk said \"the United States has definitely been harmed\" by having Warren as a senator. A representative for Warren did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson asked SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell whether Musk's \"distraction\" at Twitter might affect SpaceX's work with the space agency, NBC News reported. Nelson said she reassured him it would not.\n\nMusk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "label": "human"}

On Thursday, players were spotted arriving at the facility, though the team has not yet released a practice schedule.\n\nThe chilling sight of Hamlin collapsing, which was broadcast to a North American TV audience on ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d has led to an outpouring of support from fans and players from across the league.\n\nNumerous players \u2014 former teammates and those who didn\u2019t know Hamlin until Monday \u2014 voiced their support, while saying they were shaken by what happened.\n\nColts safety Rodney Thomas made the two-hour drive from Indianapolis to Cincinnati on Tuesday just to be by the side of his former high school teammate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fighter. I know he\u2019s a fighter and there\u2019s no other thought in my mind other than him walking out under his own power,\u201d Thomas said Wednesday.\n\nMinnesota Vikings defensive tackle Harrison Phillips, who spent the previous four seasons playing for Buffalo, had dinner delivered to the hospital for Hamlin\u2019s family and medical staff.\n\nHamlin\u2019s marketing representative Jordon Rooney said Wednesday that the player\u2019s family was buoyed by the words and acts of kindness.\n\n\u201cThey are elated right now,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cDamar is still their first concern. But for them, they always look at how they can turn a somewhat troubling situation into a good one. The bounce back from this, for him and his family is going to be incredible.\u201d\n\nWhat remains unclear is whether the NFL will reschedule the Bills\u2019 game against the Bengals, which has major implications in determining the top spot in the AFC. The playoffs are set to open on Jan. 14.\n\nThe Chiefs (13-3) have a half-game lead over Buffalo (12-3), with the Bills owning the tiebreaker after beating Kansas City this season. The Bengals (11-4) are currently the third seed and have also defeated the Chiefs.\n\nHamlin was hurt in the first quarter when he was struck squarely in the chest while making what appeared to be routine tackle of Bengals receiver Tee Higgins. Hamlin briefly got up and adjusted his facemask before collapsing backward.\n\nHamlin was selected by Buffalo in the sixth round of the 2021 draft out of Pitt. He spent his rookie season limited to special teams roles, and took over the starting safety job in Week 3 in place of veteran Micah Hyde, who remains sidelined by a neck injury.\n\nFans, team owners and players \u2014 including Tom Brady and Russell Wilson \u2014 have made donations to Hamlin\u2019s Chasing M\u2019s Foundation, which had raised more than $7 million by Thursday morning.", "label": "human"}

On Monday (January 2), Russia acknowledged that scores of its troops were killed in one of the Ukraine war's deadliest strikes. Rockets reportedly hit the recruits in Makiivka just after midnight on New Year's Eve. The strike prompted Russian nationalist bloggers to call for commanders to be punished for housing soldiers alongside an ammunition dump.Russia's defense ministry said 63 service personnel were killed. Ukraine's defense ministry had said as many as 400 had died. The air war intensified over the New Year holiday, with Moscow launching an unprecedented third straight night of strikes on January 2nd. Ukraine said it had shot down all Russian drones in the wave of attacks which targeted cities including Kyiv - hundreds of miles from the frontlines. It marks a change in Russian tactics after months in which Moscow usually spaced out such strikes. Russia has turned to air strikes since suffering humiliating defeats on the battlefield in the second half of last year.Ukraine says the attacks have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians.

{"text": "of service.\n\nSenate Democrats bade farewell to their longest-serving member on Thursday, a day before the Capitol\u2019s chaotic breach and siege.\n\nPatrick Leahy, 81, took the floor of the Senate for the last time on Thursday morning to deliver a speech about his nearly half-century of service in the upper chamber of Congress. The Vermont senator is the most senior member of the Senate in terms of time in office, having served for 49 years since his election in 1974.\n\n\u201cI remember I was the youngest Democrat to be sworn in that day, and now I am the most senior,\u201d said Leahy, who was 29 when he first joined the chamber. \u201cIt has been a great honor to serve Vermont and this body, and I want to thank each and every one of you, my colleagues, for your friendship and support over all these years.\u201d\n\nLeahy is known for his work on domestic issues, including his support for the Farm Bill, the Affordable Care Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He has also been a champion of LGBT rights, and has successfully championed legislation that bans employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nLeahy\u2019s career was marked by major political events, including Watergate and the impeachment of President Richard Nixon. He also served as the lead Democratic negotiator for the Supreme Court nominations of Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate honored Leahy with a standing ovation, and several of his colleagues took turns praising him for his service. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted his \u201cimpressive record of progress,\u201d while Minority Leader Mitch McConnell lauded his \u201cfair-minded approach\u201d and commitment to bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cWhether he was a dogged investigator during the Watergate hearings, a tireless champion for the advancement of women, a leader on civil rights and human rights, or an indefatigable guardian of the Constitution and a model of senatorial independence, Senator Leahy has never wavered in his commitment to doing what he believes is right and just,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nLeahy\u2019s final act as a senator was to vote in favor of the article of impeachment against President Donald Trump. He said Thursday that he didn\u2019t regret the decision and urged his colleagues to \u201cstand up and to do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my colleagues, I say, do not be afraid of standing up for what\u2019s right, of standing up for the principles and ideals that we have believed in and held dear for centuries,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cSo, my final message to you is: Listen to your conscience, follow your moral compass, and if something is wrong, have the courage to stand up and speak out.\u201d\n\nLeahy\u2019s departure means the end of an era for the Senate. He was one of the last \u201cold-guard\u201d Democrats from the 1970s and 1980s who still served in the chamber.\n\nHe is set to be replaced by another Vermont Democrat, former governor Peter Shumlin. While Leahy was known as a progressive, Shumlin is seen as a more centrist figure.\n\nLeahy is set to retire from public life. But he said Thursday that he was not done fighting for the causes he has championed over his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not turning my back on any of these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m hoping to be more effective outside this chamber than I am inside.\u201d\n\nLeahy\u2019s retirement from the Senate caps off a remarkable career that spanned nearly five decades and saw the Democrat stand tall and fight hard for causes he believed in. As he said Thursday, Leahy will now take his place in history as one of the longest-serving senators of all time. \n\n\u201cIt has been an enormous privilege and honor to serve in this great body,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cI leave here today knowing that I left my mark on the Senate, and I am thankful for that.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Viele Superm\u00e4rkte und Discounter beginnen das Jahr unter dem Motto Sparen \u2013 und rabattieren sogar ohnehin g\u00fcnstige Eigenmarken. Edeka\n\nZum Jahresstart buhlt der Lebensmittelhandel um Kunden und setzt dabei auf Werbung mit Eigenmarken und aggressiven Rabatten. Und das, obwohl in diesem Jahr noch weitere Preissteigerungen anstehen. So betont Supermarkt Edeka weiterhin seine \u201eDiscountpreise\u201c und rabattiert zum Jahresbeginn die ohnehin g\u00fcnstigen Eigenmarken, w\u00e4hrend der Discounter Lidl aggressiv per Preisvergleich mit Edeka wirbt. \u201eDer ganze Lebensmitteleinzelhandel ist in einem echten Dilemma\u201c, sagt Handelsexperte Gerrit Heinemann im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Business Insider. \u201eWeil er wei\u00df, dass er die gestiegenen Herstellerkosten weitergeben muss \u2013 er das gleichzeitig aber nicht kann, weil die Kunden so stark auf den Preis achten.\u201c\n\nWer ist der G\u00fcnstigste im ganzen Land? Blickt man auf die aktuellen Werbekampagnen im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel, scheint das die wichtigste Frage f\u00fcr das neue Jahr zu sein. Sowohl Superm\u00e4rkte als auch Discounter buhlen dabei wie schon vor Weihnachten mit Rabatten um die Kunden und schrecken auch nicht davor zur\u00fcck, sich mit der Konkurrenz zu vergleichen.\n\n\u201eNeues Jahr, neues Spar\u2019n\u201c, hei\u00dft es beispielsweise in einer Edeka-Kampagne zum neuen Jahr. Die Regionalgesellschaft S\u00fcdwest wirbt mit dem \u201eJanuspar\u201c. Bereits im vergangenen Jahr hatte der H\u00e4ndler den Slogan \u201eIn jedem Edeka steckt ein Discounter\u201c rausgekramt. \u00c4hnliche Werbeplakate waren sogar vor Luxus-Filialen wie der in Berlin Steglitz aufgestellt, in der Kunden an reihenweise Frischetheken unter anderem Austern schl\u00fcrfen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAuch in einem aktuellen TV-Spot wirbt die Edeka Zentrale mit \u201e\u00fcber 7000 Produkten zum Discountpreis\u201c \u2013 und 23 Prozent Rabatt auf Gem\u00fcse- und Sauerkonserven der ohnehin g\u00fcnstigen Eigenmarke \u201eGut und G\u00fcnstig\u201c. Laut der \u201eLebensmittelzeitung\u201c sollen \u00fcber den Januar \u2013 in w\u00f6chentlich wechselnden Kategorien \u2013 weitere Angebote im ohnehin g\u00fcnstigen Preissegment folgen.\n\nDiscount-Versprechen in der Werbung \u2013 aber Preise d\u00fcrften weiter steigen\n\n\u201eDer ganze Lebensmitteleinzelhandel ist in einem echten Dilemma\u201c, bewertet Handelsexperte Gerrit Heinemann die Lage. \u201eWeil er wei\u00df, dass er die gestiegenen Herstellerkosten weitergeben muss \u2013 er das gleichzeitig aber nicht kann, weil die Kunden so stark auf den Preis achten.\u201c\n\nTats\u00e4chlich stehen gerade Superm\u00e4rkte vor Problemen: Durch die drastische Inflation bei Lebensmitteln \u2013 im Dezember 2022 lag sie voraussichtlich bei 20,7 Prozent \u2013 sind Kunden vermehrt zu Discountern abgewandert. Und damit nicht genug: Rewe-Chef Lionel Souque erkl\u00e4rte k\u00fcrzlich, dass von Herstellerseite schon f\u00fcr das erste Quartal 2023 Preiserh\u00f6hungen im Volumen von mehr als einer Milliarde Euro vorl\u00e4gen, die verhandelt werden m\u00fcssten.\n\nLaut dem Handelsexperten Gerrit Heinemann bleiben diese Verhandlungen 2023 ein spannendes Thema. Denn obwohl sie immer ein Machtspiel seien, h\u00e4tten sich die H\u00e4ndler im vergangenen Jahr besonders heftig mit den Markenherstellern angelegt. Und aufgrund der Preissensibilit\u00e4t der Kunden st\u00e4rker die g\u00fcnstigeren Eigenmarken beworben.\n\nDie werden aber ebenfalls von den Markenherstellern produziert. Und das k\u00f6nnten die Hersteller nun als Druckmittel benutzen: \u201eBei den Eigenmarken machen Hersteller kaum Gewinne\u201c, sagte Heinemann im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Business Insider. \u201eDie d\u00fcrften sich also fragen, ob sie die weiter produzieren oder auf die Bremse treten, um Preissteigerungen bei Markenartikeln durchzusetzen.\u201c\n\nProbleme von Discountern kleiner\n\nDiscounter seien hier im Vorteil: So h\u00e4tten die, wie beispielsweise Aldi, f\u00fcr ihre Eigenmarken auch Exklusivhersteller, die ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr sie produzieren, sagt Heinemann. Da schlage das Dilemma nicht ganz so stark durch.\n\nUnd so stecken die Discounter im Preiskampf nicht zur\u00fcck. Der zu Edeka geh\u00f6rende Discounter Netto wirbt zum Jahresstart ebenfalls mit 23 Prozent Rabatt auf Eigenmarken- und Markenprodukte gemischter Kategorien. Au\u00dferdem gibt es unter dem Motto \u201eX-fach sparen\u201c diverse 2-f\u00fcr-1 Aktionen \u2013 und immer wieder Hinweise auf Coupons in der App des Discounters.\n\nLidl attackiert Edeka in Facebook-Werbung\n\nWie schon im Dezember wirbt Lidl im ersten Prospekt 2023 weiter mit dem \u201egro\u00dfen Sparsturz\u201c \u2013 und attackiert mit einer ganzseitigen Anzeige direkt das Discount-Versprechen von Edeka. Zwei Obst- und Gem\u00fcsek\u00f6rbe vom 28. Dezember 2022, einer gekauft bei Lidl, der andere bei einer Edeka-S\u00fcdwest-Filiale im Baden-W\u00fcrttembergischen Eppingen, wie man dem Beschreibungstext entnehmen kann. Der \u201eLebensmittelzeitung\u201c erkl\u00e4rte Lidl, die Filiale sei ausgew\u00e4hlt worden, weil sie repr\u00e4sentativ f\u00fcr eine durchschnittliche Edeka-Filiale sei. Die Werbung werde bundesweit ausgespielt \u2013 und wurde auch auf Facebook ver\u00f6ffentlicht.\n\nPreiskampf zwischen Supermarkt und Discounter \u2013 mit aggressiver Werbung. Lidl\n\nGanze 4,82 Euro sei Lidl g\u00fcnstiger, hei\u00dft es in der Werbung. Beim Blick in den Beitragstext zeigt sich: Zwei Euro Unterschied entfallen schon allein auf ein ganzes Kilo Paprika, das im Warenkorb liegt. Bei der Zucchini ist Lidl sogar 30 Cent pro Kilo teurer. Davon hat man dann allerdings nur 500 Gramm in den Einkaufskorb gelegt. Im Preiskampf scheinen alle Tricks erlaubt.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nFor many companies, 2020 and 2021 were packed with major changes, massive mergers, and significant investments. These changes required PR strategy and flawless execution, a feat that wasn\u2019t achieved without help from the top executive hires in the PR industry.\n\nThe team at PRWeek reviewed a wide range of PR agencies and corporations to identify the top 25 executive hires of the past two years. These hires reflect the growing importance of PR strategy in the changing business landscape, helping companies of all sizes navigate M&A deals and major strategic shifts in a volatile economic environment.\n\nThe first name on the list is Jennifer Montero, who was appointed as global head of public relations for Activision in December 2020. Montero, a former top-level PR executive at Microsoft, is no stranger to managing complex public relations issues, and her hire comes at a time when Activision is going through a major period of transition.\n\nThe next PR executive to join the list is Nathaniel A. Aborn, who was appointed vice president of global communications at McDonald\u2019s in November 2020. Aborn was previously the head of global public relations at Starbucks, and his hire was widely seen as a sign of McDonald\u2019s commitment to improving their messaging and reputation.\n\nAnother executive who made the list is Jen Golbeck, who was hired as chief communications officer at Oracle in January 2021. Golbeck brings a wealth of experience to Oracle, having spent nearly two decades in the communications industry. Her hire was especially notable because she was the first female to hold the position at the company.\n\nIn addition to the corporate hires, the list of top PR executives also includes a few agency hires. Martin Ohlson was hired as global head of brand and communications at Edelman in April 2021. Ohlson\u2019s hire signaled Edelman\u2019s commitment to finding creative solutions to PR challenges in the changing landscape.\n\nThe list also includes a number of individuals who were hired to lead new roles in the PR industry. Jennifer Kerr was named director of global communications at the United Nations in July 2021, while Lily Herman was named executive director of the International Public Relations Association in September 2021.\n\nOther PR executives who made the list include Carrie Adman, who was appointed CMO of Visa in August 2021; Christina Corso, who was appointed senior director of PR at Google in May 2021; and Sonja Neuharth, who was appointed head of marketing and communications at Salesforce in April 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from this list of top executive hires that the PR industry is still booming despite economic uncertainty and the changing business landscape. Companies are investing in PR strategy and execution, and these hires will help them stay ahead of the competition and effectively manage their messaging in the years ahead.", "label": "machine"}

And as is typical for women of color at these conferences, I had to endure input on my choice of attire \u2014 being asked to avoid wearing an ethnic dress (a saree in my instance) \u2014 as well as the casual dismissals of my remarks and the general fawning over \"distinguished white men.\"\n\nMy speech \u2014 in which I cautioned against allowing the industry to be overtaken by massive private equity funds looking for ways to own the future profits of entrepreneurs' ideas and labor in the Global South \u2014 did not sit well with Bill McGlashen, then still a private equity executive. He took a moment of his time on stage to insinuate that elite groups of venture capitalists turned ethical would wield the power of impact investing, not do-gooders like myself looking to equalize the playing field.\n\nThat equation of money with power eventually landed McGlashen in the spotlight when he was sent to federal prison for his role in the Varsity Blues admissions scandal. [ed. note. McGlashen is currently appealing his conviction].\n\nMcGlashen's involvement in both the scandal and the world of impact investing is not merely a coincidence. The same privilege and arrogance that someone like McGlashen displayed is rampant throughout the sector.\n\nIt's colonialism by another name.\n\nPower imbalances matter Impact Investment Exchange; Edited by Kazi Awal/Insider\n\nWith increasing numbers of people seeing impact investing and ESG principles as vehicles for solving some of the world's biggest problems \u2014 such as climate change and inequality \u2014 we can't afford to exclude the very groups that the field was designed to help.\n\nThe geography is lopsided. Today, 79% of impact investing organizations are based in North America and Europe. Only 30% of the volume of impact funds is raised for projects in emerging markets. This means that impact investing in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is coming from the Global North and with it, the power of how impact investing should go.\n\nThese structures of power take on a new significance outside of the US, where money overwhelmingly flows from developed countries to developing countries \u2014 and back out again. It is no wonder that those of us in the Global South are discussing new neocolonialism through impact investing.\n\nIronically, the impact investing space that I helped to create over a decade ago was supposed to counter the very colonial relations that pervaded development aid. The dream was to empower people of color and the Global South with investment so that we could change our shared futures together by investing in each other. While companies like IIX are all about the Global South investing in each other, we are the minority.\n\nFamiliar with how colonialism manifests itself, we work hard and unapologetically against it to balance power asymmetries. With a firm belief that women at the last mile are the backbone of their communities' health, economies, success, and climate action, we continue to roll up our sleeves to put gender equality front and center of everything we do so they can transform their environment, the climate, and the world.\n\nImpact Investment Exchange (IIX)'s Women's Livelihood Bond series - the world's first listed gender-lens, impact investing security \u2014 has to date mobilized over US $78 million from global investors, empowering over 1 million women across Asia Pacific at the last mile to become agents of change and enabling them to maintain sustainable livelihoods.\n\nRecognizing that fostering equity and inclusion at scale requires all hands on deck, IIX has also convened a global coalition \u2013 the Orange Bond Initiative \u2013 to launch the world's first asset class by and for the Global South and the 99%, that will mobilize the multi-trillion bond market for the empowerment of 100 million women and girls as solutions to achieve the UN's 17 SDGs and build a more inclusive, climate-resilient future for all.\n\nTo democratize impact investing, IIX has also developed digital offerings \u2014 a digital impact assessment and verification platform that effectively measures the social and environmental impact of an investment and gives value to the voices of the underserved (IIX Values); and the world's largest crowdfunding platform for impact investing (Impact Partners) \u2014 which will help to address the fundamental challenges the space faces: accessibility, credibility and knowledge.\n\nRecognizing the value of the Global South\n\nOur dedication towards connecting the backstreets to Wall Street through our work is driven by our belief that underserved women and communities need to be liberated. They need their voices heard to make global social justice a possibility.\n\nGiven the residue of our colonial mentality in the Global South, the rich still take their cue from the rich in the Global North, continuing to place them on a pedestal like in colonial days. This is no different to how many of the Royals from the Indian sub-continent readily complied with workings of the British Raj to 'fit' in with the colonial powers, undermining their fellow country people.\n\nWe need to look towards a global future where capital distribution is harmonized for the greater good of the world. Where markets recognize the value of the Global South \u2014 with the nexus of finance and development enabling the financial system to work for the \"99%\" (that represent most of the Global South); and where the rich and backstreets of the South embrace the responsibility to stand united in supporting each other to build an equitable, sustainable future.\n\nIn this world, borders are not drawn, blocks to social innovation are removed and more effective collaborations for inclusive social innovation processes and systems are in place.\n\nTo live up to our promise of using finance for good, we cannot repeat the history of structures that have relied on the labor of people of color to benefit the few. It's not enough to redistribute capital.\n\nDurreen Shahnaz is the founder and CEO of Impact Investment Exchange.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Airline passengers at Brisbane airport in Australia were horrified after being locked in an airport corridor for half an hour on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThe issue occurred when a Melbourne-bound AirAsia X flight departing from Brisbane was delayed due to a technical issue.

{"text": "Alabama, the deep south state, is moving forward with a plan to introduce the use of lethal gas as a means of execution in the state's prison system. This plan has been in the works for years, but it has only been in recent months that the state has started to make serious progress on the proposal.\n\nThe plan calls for the use of lethal gas as a means of execution for people convicted of capital offenses, such as murder and some sex crimes. The gas would be released in a chamber within the prison and would be used to kill the person quickly and with minimal pain. Proponents argue that the use of lethal gas is a more humane alternative to traditional forms of capital punishment, such as lethal injection or electrocution.\n\nThe proposal has been met with some backlash from civil liberties and criminal justice reform advocates, who argue that the use of gas is a barbaric form of execution. They point out that the gas itself is potentially lethal, as it can cause severe burns, asphyxiation, and in some cases even death. They also point out that it is difficult to control the dosage of the gas, meaning that even if it is intended to be used as a humane form of execution, there is still the potential for it to be used as a form of torture.\n\nHowever, the proposal has a strong base of support in the state. A poll conducted by the Birmingham News found that 59% of respondents supported the use of lethal gas as a form of execution. Governor Kay Ivey has also come out in support of the proposal, noting that she believes it is \"a fair and just means of carrying out the death penalty.\"\n\nThe state's Department of Corrections has already begun making plans to make the transition to using lethal gas as a means of execution. The plan calls for the construction of a new execution chamber, which would house the necessary equipment to inject the lethal gas into the chamber and release it into the room where the inmate is being held. The chamber would be connected to an area outside the prison, where the gas would be stored and monitored.\n\nThe move to lethal gas as a means of execution comes as the state is attempting to reduce its prison population in an effort to save money. As a result, the use of lethal gas could provide a more cost-effective means of carrying out capital punishment, as opposed to traditional methods such as lethal injection or electrocution.\n\nAlabama is the latest state to pursue the use of lethal gas as a means of execution. It follows in the footsteps of Missouri, which began using lethal gas in 2017, and Oklahoma, which adopted the practice earlier this year. Both states have faced legal challenges to their use of lethal gas, but the practice has been defended by both state and federal courts.\n\nThe use of lethal gas in the United States is a controversial issue, and the proposal in Alabama is likely to face many of the same legal and ethical issues that were faced in Missouri and Oklahoma. Regardless of the outcome, the proposal has provided a window into the increasingly harsh measures being taken by states to combat crime and reduce prison overcrowding.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, pauses while speaking during an Economic Club of New York event in Midtown Manhattan on October 24, 2019 in New York City.\n\nOf course, while Iger said Disney was all-in on streaming, the reality was it wasn't, and it still isn't. Disney has held on to ESPN as the linchpin of the cable bundle. Today, just as in 2019, ESPN's premier sporting events (its main \"Monday Night Football\" broadcast, for instance), can only be seen on cable.\n\nBut as interest rates rose and Netflix customer growth plateaued earlier this year , the music stopped. Disney+ added 12.1 million subscribers this month and shares tanked. Much of this change in narrative was actually of Disney's own doing, as Chapek (and other media executives) pushed getting to profitability over subscriber growth. Part of that shift was Disney's realization that it likely wasn't going to hit its target of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by 2024. Chapek lowered that bar in August. Disney shares have fallen nearly 40% year to date.\n\nAfter he took over as chief executive, Chapek shifted Disney's corporate structure to better align with a streaming-first world. Iger didn't agree with the way he did it, but the general idea of building up Disney+ by spending billions on new content was in lockstep with Iger's strategy. For a while, that strategy worked. Disney shares surged during the pandemic even as theme parks closed and movies were kept out of theaters. Investors cheered money-losing streaming services as long as they showed hypergrowth.\n\nNow, the Disney board has turned to Iger to come up with a new plan \u2014 or at least to choose a new leader who has one \u2014 over at least the next two years. Reorganizing the company to put \"more decision-making back in the hands of our creative teams,\" as Iger noted in his memo to employees yesterday, is an easy, and necessary, first move. But it's more of a process change than a strategic one.\n\nIger's biggest challenge will be choosing which Disney assets should be sold or spun off in the coming years, said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed partners. This wouldn't be easy for any CEO, but it especially won't be easy for Iger, who built the modern Disney with purpose. He orchestrated deals to buy Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and much of 21st Century Fox.\n\nIger has had many chances in the past to shed cable networks, including ESPN, or broadcast channel ABC and its owned and operated affiliates, or Hulu. He never did in the past, but Greenfield said he thinks he'll have to now.\n\n\"Bob Iger should sit down this weekend and make a list of the assets he wants Disney to keep and the ones he wants to get rid of,\" Greenfield said. \"What does Disney look like over the next five years? What are the assets we need to have? That needs to come first, and every decision after that follows the answer.\"\n\nGreenfield recommended either spinning off ESPN or dramatically cutting costs, including passing on renewing NBA broadcast rights, which will be renegotiated in 2023. He also said he'd try to sell Hulu to Comcast rather than paying Comcast $9 billion or more for the remaining 33% stake in the streamer.\n\nIt's also possible Iger could once again punt these decisions to a successor. If he decides his role is purely a transition CEO, he could focus on finding the next leader of Disney and allow that person to make the big calls in the next two years.\n\nBut that's never been Iger's style. He delayed retirement three times in the past to keep the job. Now he's back again.\n\nIger could have ridden off into the sunset, and he chose to come back \u2014 even after saying publicly \"you can't go home again.\"\n\nThat's probably a sign he has ideas about how to move Disney forward.\n\n\"The old plan can't be the new plan,\" Greenfield said. \"That plan wasn't working. Iger is going to have to make some hard decisions.\"\n\nWATCH: Investor Stephanie Link's bullish case for Disney", "label": "human"}

The incident happened as the group were scouting for possible locations for filming.\n\nThe crew member was followed by a car and eventually accosted by the group, who demanded that the group leave the area.\n\nThe incident led the production team to rethink their plans, and consider switching the shoot to another location in the Western Cape.\n\nThe production company has declined to comment on the incident, but sources familiar with the situation have said that it could have been a case of mistaken identity or mistaken \"turf\".\n\nAccording to locals, the men in the car may have been part of a local gang, which uses intimidation and threats to maintain control over certain areas.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials have said that they are aware of the incident, but that it was not reported to the police.\n\nThe show's production team is now in the process of relocating their planned shoot to another site in the Western Cape - likely one of the poorer areas in the Cape Flats, which the team was hoping to avoid.\n\nThe series, which is currently in production, is being produced by one of the UK's biggest production companies and stars some of Britain's top actors.\n\nThe decision to switch to another location in the Western Cape reflects the increasing concern about safety in some of South Africa's tourist hotspots, and particularly in the Winelands.\n\nGangs are becoming more brazen in their activities in recent years, targeting tourists and their belongings, and often preying on those who are unfamiliar with the area.\n\nThe production team's fears come as police in Franschhoek report an increase in criminal activity in the area, including drug-related crimes, robberies, and even vehicle hijackings.\n\nThe production team's move is also likely to be welcomed by local law enforcement officers, who have long been concerned about the gangs operating in the Winelands.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the production team will be successful in finding a suitable location in the Western Cape, but it is hoped that their decision to take safety seriously and relocate their shoot will go some way to combating gang activity in the area.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "watch now\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's capital city is grinding to a near standstill as Covid controls spread. More and more apartment compounds in Beijing on Friday forbade residents from leaving for at least a few days. That's on top of a growing number of bans on business activity, which have forced gyms to close and restaurants to halt in-store dining. \"This morning most of our 30+ staff reported their communities went into a 7-day lockdown,\" James Zimmerman, partner in the Beijing office of Perkins Coie, said on Twitter Friday. He said a day earlier, the firm had to tell all its employees to work from home. It was not clear how many people were affected at a city level, and to what degree stay-in-place measures were being enforced. Beijing has a population of roughly 22 million.\n\nCovid restrictions have tightened in Beijing while infections keep soaring, prompting lockdowns of communities. Jade Gao | Afp | Getty Images\n\n\"You constantly hear of someone going into lockdown and you have this constant feeling that you're going to be next,\" Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, said Friday. He estimated that about 40% of people in his office area were locked down. Beijing city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Municipal authorities have not announced a city-wide lockdown, and warned it's in a \"critical\" period for controlling the virus. Local infections have surged despite gradual tightening of Covid measures over the last two weeks. Beijing city reported more than 1,800 Covid infections for Thursday, bringing the total for the month to well over 10,000. Other parts of mainland China have reported similar surges in infections \u2014 to a nationwide new daily high of more than 32,000 for Thursday. The central government this month sent an encouraging signal to investors about future reopening by trimming quarantine times, among other changes. But the zero-Covid policy itself didn't change. \"Initially when the [new measures] came out, we did feel somewhat positive. But now, we're finding that interpretation varies widely,\" said Jennifer Birdsong, Chengdu-based member of the EU Chamber's Southwest China Chapter Board. \"There is a great deal of variation in what may be interpreted as necessary lockdown.\"\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Right now, we are also in a situation where bars, restaurants and gyms, all of them [were] closed last night,\" she said, adding that business owners are frustrated by the lack of notice. She said the restrictions mean some workers have had to sleep at factories, only to find they aren't able to get food delivered.\n\nPlunge in road traffic\n\nData show that people in Covid-hit areas are moving around less, willingly or unwillingly. Baidu traffic data showed Beijing has fallen from being the most congested city in all of China to 74th place. Subway ridership in the southwestern municipality of Chongqing plunged by nearly 99% from a year ago, according to a Goldman Sachs report Friday. That in the southern city of Guangzhou fell by about 65% from last year, the report said. Guangzhou, the capital of the export-heavy province of Guangdong, has been hardest hit by this month's Covid wave. Some frustrated residents have even broken through lockdown barriers, local officials said Thursday, according to state media. Only parts of the city have locked down. But businesses are worried and are working overtime to make sure they can fulfill their orders without disruption, said Klaus Zenkel, vice president at the EU Chamber of Commerce in China and chairman of its South China chapter. He said one company in the food industry had to lock down for about a week, and lost hundreds of tons of an unspecified material.\n\nEU Chamber members in Shanghai are moving meetings online and taking other preventative measures, while in the northern city of Shenyang, restaurants and gyms have had to close again, local business representatives said. Overall, the EU Chamber noted Friday a need for greater emphasis on vaccinating the local population. China lags the U.S. and Singapore when it comes to vaccination rates for seniors. Chinese authorities have focused in recent months on using frequent virus testing and more targeted measures in an attempt to control Covid outbreaks while allowing some business activity. \"We will keep pushing papers \u2026 to the [Chinese] administration, because I think they are soul-searching how to deal with this situation,\" Wuttke said. \"China has a zero-tolerance policy and finds it difficult to get itself out of this corner.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Russia\u2019s top security official has warned that the country is gradually being overtaken by a neighboring country, in a move that could threaten Moscow\u2019s stability.\n\nAlexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which is Russia\u2019s main security agency, made the comments during a speech at the Russian Security Council on Monday.\n\nThe neighboring country that Bortnikov referred to is believed to be Ukraine. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, sparking a conflict between the two countries that has continued to this day.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been locked in an ongoing dispute over the peninsula ever since.

The Russian government has long viewed Ukraine as a potential threat to its stability, particularly after the annexation of Crimea.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly accused Ukraine of trying to destabilize the region and has described its military as \u201cdangerous\u201d.\n\nThe situation has been further complicated by the recent fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The conflict has been ongoing since 2014, and has resulted in the deaths of more than 13,000 people.\n\nIn addition, Russia and Ukraine have been involved in a series of disputes, including over natural gas supplies and Black Sea access. These tensions have heightened in recent months, with both sides exchanging threats and accusations.\n\nRussia has been pushing back against the increasing influence of the West in the region, particularly with regards to Ukraine. Moscow has sought to maintain its leverage over its former Soviet republic, while at the same time claiming that Ukraine is a victim of Western meddling.\n\nHowever, Bortnikov\u2019s comments suggest that Russia is now worried about the possibility of being overtaken by its neighbor.

{"text": "On the morning of January 5th, 2023, renowned entrepreneur and CEO Elon Musk sent out a tweet in support of Representative Kevin McCarthy's bid to become the next House Speaker. The message, which quickly went viral, was filled with praise for the Republican congressman and vocal criticism of those who had attacked him in recent weeks.\n\nMcCarthy has been at the center of a leadership battle over the past few weeks, as he seeks to become the first Republican House Speaker since John Boehner left the post in 2015. McCarthy has faced opposition from a faction of moderate Republicans and independent factions of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIn response to McCarthy's candidacy, members of the political opposition have made repeated allegations that he is a \u201cpartisan hack\u201d, and are questioning his competence and experience. McCarthy has defended himself against these allegations, contending that he has a track record of getting things done in Congress, and has a vision for a better America.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s tweet was seen as a powerful show of support for the Republican candidate. It began with a series of praise for McCarthy\u2019s leadership and service, noting his \u201cgreat vision for the future\u201d, his \u201ccommitment to bipartisanship\u201d, and his \u201cstrong record of fighting for the American people.\u201d\n\nThe tweet then shifted to a criticism of McCarthy\u2019s detractors. Musk accused them of \u201ctrying to tear him down for their own partisan goals\u201d, describing their behavior as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cpathetic\u201d. He concluded with a plea for McCarthy\u2019s supporters to stand with him and \u201cshow him that our country is stronger when we work together\u201d.\n\nWithin minutes of being posted, the tweet had gone viral. It was retweeted hundreds of thousands of times and liked by over a million people. The support shown by Musk\u2019s tweet was praised by Republicans and Democrats alike, with many expressing appreciation for its positive tone and message.\n\nOn the same day, McCarthy released a statement expressing his gratitude for the show of support from Musk. He wrote, \u201cI want to thank Elon Musk for his words of encouragement today. I have always sought to serve the American people in Congress, and I am humbled to know that this is noticed and appreciated.\u201d\n\nThe response to Musk\u2019s tweet was seen as a clear sign that the businessman is beginning to play an even greater role in American politics. While he has yet to officially endorse any political candidate, it is expected that his words of support for the Speaker race will have a significant impact on the outcome of the race.\n\nUltimately, it is not yet clear if McCarthy will become the House Speaker, or if another Republican or Democratic candidate will emerge victorious. One thing is certain: no matter what the outcome is, it will be impossible to ignore the impact of Elon Musk\u2019s tweet in this pivotal political moment.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Travelers look at a display board showing cancelled and delayed flights at Orlando International Airport on New Year's weekend, despite thousands of flight cancellations and delays across United States.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation on Monday said it has ordered Frontier Airlines and five foreign carriers to pay about $600 million in refunds to travelers whose flights were canceled or significantly changed by the airlines.\n\nPassenger complaints about refunds from airlines surged early in the pandemic when travel restrictions and concerns over Covid-19 sent travel demand down to the lowest levels in decades.\n\nComplaints about airline refunds accounted for 87% of the 102,560 complaints logged with the DOT in 2020 and about 60% of the 49,958 complaints in 2021. Travelers are entitled to a refund when airlines cancel their flights, but many customers were offered vouchers when airlines slashed flights during the pandemic.\n\nThe DOT and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have vowed to beef up consumer protections against airlines, proposing stricter rules for when travelers are owed refunds. Buttigieg has also sparred with airlines over the causes of a spike in flight delays and cancellations this spring and summer.\n\nFrontier Airlines has been required to pay $222 million in refunds, the Department of Transportation said Monday. The agency fined the ultra-low-cost carrier $2.2 million for delays in paying out the refunds to customers.\n\nFrontier earned a $31 million profit last quarter on $906 million in revenue as travel demand and fares continued their rebound from the depths of the pandemic.\n\n\"It shouldn't take an enforcement action from the U.S. Department of Transportation to get airlines to pay refunds that they're required to pay,\" Buttigieg said on a call with reporters Monday.\n\nHe said there are more investigations underway. Blane Workie, assistant general counsel for the DOT's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection, said on the call that there were no other pending cases over refunds against U.S. airlines.\n\nThe DOT fined Air India $1.4 million, TAP Portugal $1.1 million, Aeromexico and Israel's El Al $900,000 apiece and Colombia-based Avianca $750,000. DOT said those five airlines together had to pay just over $400 million in refunds.\n\nLast year, the DOT fined Air Canada a record $4.5 million over refund delays, more than half of which would go to reimburse travelers.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have vowed to strengthen ties between their countries, as Russian bombardment in Ukraine has resumed in what has been widely described as a dangerous uptick in the armed conflict.\n\nThe two leaders met in Moscow on Wednesday to discuss economic and political issues as Russian and separatist forces have increased their presence on the eastern front, forcing Ukrainian troops to retreat in some areas.\n\nThe talks come at a time of increased global tension and renewed military clashes in eastern Ukraine. Fighting has surged in recent days in the region, which is contested by Russian-backed separatist forces and Ukrainian troops.\n\nThe Russian bombardment, which reportedly involves a mix of airstrikes and artillery fire, has been widely condemned by the United States and European countries.\n\n\"We've seen an alarming deterioration in the security situation in eastern Ukraine,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday. \"Russia's destabilizing activities in Ukraine, including its continued transfer of tanks, artillery, and military personnel to eastern Ukraine, as well as its ongoing bombardment of Ukrainian positions, are intensifying the conflict.\"\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has urged the Kremlin to stop its bombardment and de-escalate the violence, said on Wednesday that he had been in contact with Putin and that the two leaders had \"agreed on a path towards a peaceful resolution.\"\n\n\"I assure you that our country will not surrender and we will continue to protect our freedom and independence,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAt a joint news conference with Putin, Xi described the two leaders' discussion as \"friendly, candid and profound\" and said they had agreed to increase military and security cooperation and to support a political solution to the Ukrainian conflict.\n\n\"At present, the international and regional situation is undergoing profound and complex changes,\" Xi said. \"The development of China-Russia ties conforms to the basic interests of the two countries and is of great significance to safeguarding regional and international peace, stability, and development.\"\n\nXi praised Russia's contributions to regional and global security and said the two countries were committed to deepening their strategic partnership.\n\nPutin, for his part, hailed Xi's visit as \"extremely important.\"\n\n\"I'm certain that it will help us further strengthen the political, economic, military and other ties between our countries,\" he said. \"Our common goal is to increase the effectiveness of our bilateral ties for the benefit of our two countries and the entire world.\"\n\nRussia has consistently denied any involvement in the Ukrainian conflict and insists the violence there is an internal affair. However, the Kremlin has long been accused of stoking the conflict, providing military and financial assistance to the separatists, and illegally occupying Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its role in the conflict.\n\nAs the military clashes in Ukraine continue to escalate, Putin and Xi's vow to strengthen their countries' ties has only deepened international concern.

{"text": "Former US President Donald Trump speaks at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 15, 2022. (ALON SKUY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump defended himself against accusations that his boosting of far-right election deniers cost the GOP dearly in the midterms\u2014saying that actually, the blame lies with the crowd of conservatives that pushed for abortion restrictions with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nEven though, as it turns out, many in Trump\u2019s army of election deniers were also anti-abortion hardliners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault that the Republicans didn\u2019t live up to expectations in the MidTerms,\u201d Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI was 233-20!\u201d Trump wrote, referring to his record on endorsements. \u201cIt was the \u200b\u2018abortion issue,\u200b\u2019\u200b poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those that firmly insisted on No Exceptions, even in the case of Rape, Incest, or Life of the Mother, that lost large numbers of Voters\u200b.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to further attack anti-abortion advocates, suggesting that they didn\u2019t show up for Republicans after Trump and Senate Republicans delivered the Supreme Court votes necessary to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\u201cThe people that pushed so hard, for decades, against abortion, got their wish from the U.S. Supreme Court, & just plain disappeared, not to be seen again,\u201d Trump said. Adding a dig at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been accused of withholding campaign funds from Trump endorsees like Blake Masters in Arizona, Trump said: \u201cPlus, Mitch stupid $\u2019s!\u201d\n\nDuring the 2022 cycle, Trump routinely and repeatedly attacked Republicans who failed to say that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and implored his allies to make election fraud claims central to their 2022 campaigns. Trump scolded Masters following an October debate for not saying the election results were tampered with, saying the Senate nominee was \u201cgoing soft\u201d and comparing him unfavorably to Arizona gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Masters and Lake lost their races, as Sen. Mark Kelly was re-elected and Arizonans elected Democrats, including Gov. Katie Hobbs, to their top three constitutional offices.\n\nBut in addition to being an election denier, Masters also described himself as \u201c100 percent pro-life\u201d during the primary, and backed proposed legislation from top Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham to ban abortion after 15 weeks nationwide.\n\nDemocrats narrowly lost the House in November, but picked up a Senate seat and made huge gains at the state level. Though pundits had predicted that inflation would drive voters to or from the polls in November, exit polling showed that abortion was one of the top issues motivating voters. Young voters also skewed even more Democratic than they did in 2020, according to ABC News\u2014helping to mitigate losses for the party in power.\n\nTrump also endorsed several other Senate nominees who supported the proposed federal abortion ban, including now-Sens. Ted Budd of North Carolina and J.D. Vance of Ohio, who won, and Georgia candidate Herschel Walker, who lost.\n\nAnd in Washington, Trump endorsed Joe Kent, a Republican House candidate in Washington, who then successfully knocked pro-impeachment GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler out of the top-two primary over the summer.\n\nHis general election opponent, Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, made Kent\u2019s far-right views on the 2020 election and abortion part of her campaign strategy, calling him a \u201cdanger to democracy\u201d and attacking Kent during a debate for calling abortion rights \u201cperformative.\u201d Kent, who opposed abortion in all cases except to save the life of a mother, lost in a district that Trump won easily, and that Republicans had held for over a decade.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 On a frosty December morning, Victoria Solomon recounted how San Francisco police had rousted her awake hours earlier, and threatened to take her to jail if she didn't clear out within 10 minutes.\n\nThey tried to force her out of a public area without offering a shelter bed as required by law, Solomon said. At least this time city workers didn't trash her belongings, she said. This would have forced her to find a new tent, bedding and clothes \u2014 not to mention new identification and Social Security cards, as well as a cell phone.\n\n\u201cYou can be as tough as you want on people, that\u2019s not going to magically create a house for them. And they don\u2019t have disappearing powers,\u201d said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco.\n\nIn September, the organization and seven individuals who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless again sued San Francisco for violating the city's own policies regarding providing shelter beds. They also said that city workers have thrown out peoples\u2019 personal belongings such as medication, wheelchairs, prosthetics, laptops and cell phones, against city policy.\n\nSolomon is among an estimated 7,800 people without a home in San Francisco, a city that has come to be seen as an emblem of California's staggering inability to counter the homeless crisis. Homeowners, businesses and local leaders in San Francisco are frustrated with visible signs of homelessness \u2014 which includes public streets blocked by sprawling tents and trash.\n\nSolomon is frustrated too. \u201cWho says I\u2019m not part of the community just because I\u2019m homeless?\u201d she said.\n\nTwo of the sweeps she experienced this year happened in the Castro neighborhood, where she noted that civil rights activists once stood up for marginalized peoples' rights. Now, residents and nearby businesses call the police on her.\n\nThe 34-year-old has been homeless for about a decade. Solomon said she is bipolar and struggles with drug addiction, as well as grief from the deaths of her son and mother a year apart.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe travels lightly \u2014 a rolling suitcase, tent, dog food and two dogs \u2014 and is afraid to leave her belongings unattended. Law enforcement has threatened to take her to jail on an arrest warrant from another county \u2014 which she said was for minor drug possession.\n\nAmid rising rents and a national shortage of affordable housing, more than 100,000 people are living on California\u2019s streets. Hawaii, Oregon, and Arizona are among other western states where more homeless people live outside in cars and tents than indoors in shelters, despite billions spent to curb homelessness, including San Francisco\u2019s $672 million annual budget.\n\nIncreasingly, advocates for people without housing are fighting back in court \u2014 as in the lawsuit filed in San Francisco, where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,000.\n\nAttorneys for the city deny that workers illegally force people to move or throw out personal items, saying there are strict policies that balance individual rights with the need to clean public spaces.\n\nDuring a virtual hearing last week, Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu questioned the city's tactics, given the overwhelming amount of data and eyewitness accounts provided by the coalition. Last week, she temporarily banned San Francisco from clearing homeless encampments.\n\nAcross the country, frustration over the crisis has unified Democratic and Republican leaders in embracing tough-on-homelessness tactics, much to the dismay of homeless advocates and even Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, which has warned against hastily executed encampment closures.\n\nThis year Tennessee made outdoor camping on public land a felony and in Portland, Oregon, the city council voted to create at least three large campsites and to ban all other tent encampments.\n\nIn September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a plan to provide medical care to homeless people with untreated psychosis, even against their will \u2014 and he has literally rolled up his shirt sleeves to join encampment cleanups. Under the program, people struggling with alcohol and opioid addiction won\u2019t qualify for treatment unless they have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder.\n\nThe San Francisco Department of Emergency Management, which houses the Healthy Streets Operations Center that coordinates encampment cleanups, said in a statement that outreach workers talk to unhoused residents beforehand to explain the process and offer services, including shelter.\n\nFrom June 2020 to September 2022, San Francisco carried out 1,200 formal encampment cleanups and outreach workers encountered more than 10,000 people, according to the emergency management department.\n\nThere are also informal requests for homeless people to move, like the one Solomon encountered, so it\u2019s not possible to know the full scale of enforcement actions taken, or threatened to be taken, against people who are homeless.\n\nBusiness owners are fed up, not necessarily with people who are unhoused but the city that ignores them, said Ryen Motzek, president of the Mission Merchants Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a general issue of cleanliness and safety, that\u2019s the No. 1 problem the city faces,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Toro Casta\u00f1o, one of the seven individual plaintiffs, said that without affordable housing, people who are unhoused like him are forced to move from place to place. \u201cWe\u2019ll literally move across the street \u2014 in the other direction,\" he said. \u201cIn a week we might move 14 times. Just from corner to corner to corner.\u201d\n\nIn a court declaration, he said that in August 2020, he was given two hours to leave his tent, but the incident commander declared everything a fire hazard so city workers tossed all of his belongings into a dump truck. He lost his deceased mother\u2019s wedding kimono, MacBook Pro laptop, a battery-powered heater and a bike worth $1,400.\n\nThe outreach team offered him a bed in a congregant shelter, but he declined it for fear of catching the coronavirus. Today, he\u2019s in a hotel room paid for by the city.\n\nAdvocates say that many people who are homeless would rather stay outdoors than in shelters, where they risk contracting coronavirus, as well as encountering abuse or threats of violence. Homeless people who have pets, work night shifts, need mental health services, or have substance use disorders have a difficult time finding a shelter that will take them.\n\nShivering inside a crowded tent, Dylan Miner tried to rest upright. \u201cYou can gain your stuff back, but it takes a lot of work,\" he said. During a recent sweep, he said city workers discarded his mattress and the wood pallets that keep him off the sidewalk \u2014 which was still wet from torrential rain.\n\nMiner, 34, does carpentry, fixes bikes, and resells items he either buys or finds.\n\nThe city placed him in a downtown hotel for 10 months during the pandemic, but when the program shut down he was unable to find new housing. He is not part of the lawsuit, but expressed support for it.\n\nNobody is happy with the status quo response, Friedenbach said. She hopes the lawsuit will catalyze a \"serious transformation\" in how the city treats people who are unhoused.\n\n\u201cThis is really connected to a bigger struggle for dignity,\u201d she said. \"And a bigger struggle for just a recognition of the humanity of folks who are too poor to afford rents.\u201d\n\n\u2014-\n\nAP video journalist Terry Chea contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "their money\n\nMoney managers are hopeful about the stock market in 2023 and they\u2019re making their plans now. This year has been a roller coaster ride with some stocks soaring and others tumbling. But, overall, the stock market has been very volatile, so many investors are feeling cautious. Yet there are those that still believe in the power of the stock market and they\u2019re planning their investments accordingly.\n\nWe asked some of the top money managers how they plan to invest their money in 2023. Here\u2019s what they had to say.\n\nJohn O\u2019Brien, an investment manager at JP Morgan Chase:\n\n\u201cThe stock market will continue to be volatile in 2023, but I am hopeful that it will start to level off and become more stable. I plan on increasing my investments in dividend-paying stocks as well as high-yield bonds. These investments tend to provide more consistent returns, so they will be a safe haven in a turbulent stock market.\u201d\n\nHank Jones, a senior portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments:\n\n\u201cI believe that the U.S. stock market will be a great place to be in 2023. The economy has been steadily improving and it looks like we\u2019re headed in the right direction. With that in mind, I plan on investing more in technology and healthcare stocks. These stocks are usually less volatile than other sectors, and they\u2019re also well positioned to take advantage of the current economic climate.\u201d\n\nDan Mason, a senior strategist at BlackRock:\n\n\u201cThe stock market will certainly continue to be volatile in 2023. That being said, I think it\u2019s still a good time to invest in stocks. I\u2019m bullish on the U.S. stock market, so I\u2019m planning on adding some exposure to growth-oriented stocks. I think that focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and a long-term growth plan will be a great way to capitalize on the upside potential of the stock market.\u201d\n\nMark Burns, a portfolio manager at PIMCO:\n\n\u201cI think the stock market will remain volatile in 2023, but there are still plenty of opportunities for investors to make money. I\u2019m going to be focusing on dividend-paying stocks, as well as stocks of large, well-established companies. These types of investments have the potential to provide steady returns in a market that is still far from being stable.\u201d\n\nRob Schneider, a wealth manager at Morgan Stanley:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting a bit of volatility in the stock market in 2023, so I\u2019m planning on investing in high-quality stocks and bonds. I\u2019m particularly interested in companies that have been able to weather economic downturns and remain profitable. These types of investments are often less risky than the overall stock market, which makes them attractive options in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that money managers are optimistic about the stock market in 2023 and they\u2019re making plans now. Investing in high-quality stocks, dividend-paying stocks, and bonds is a good strategy for managing risk in a volatile market. With the right mix of investments, investors can still make money in 2023 despite the turbulence of the stock market.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It\u2019s been a tough year for Bitcoin (BTC), and its price has dropped nearly 60% from its record high in June. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin has been a total bust for payments.\n\nThough the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility has created some choppy waters for users, Bitcoin and other crypto-backed payment methods have quietly become more popular than ever this year. And experts say the industry could have much more upside if it can find ways to make crypto payments more accessible to merchants and customers alike.\n\n\u201cThe volatility has definitely been an issue, but despite the price drops, we\u2019ve seen a steady and substantial increase in the number of people using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services,\u201d said Jeffery Robinson, head of research at payment processing company PayStand.\n\nIndeed, according to data compiled by Blockchain.com, the number of Bitcoin transactions has grown by over 500% year-over-year since 2020. In December, over 6.7 million BTC transactions were completed globally, compared to 1.2 million in December 2019.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the surge? Robinson says it\u2019s a combination of factors, including an increase in the number of merchants that accept crypto payments and improvements in the speed and security of blockchain-based payments.\n\n\u201cThe popularity of crypto payments has been fueled by improved infrastructure, including faster transaction times and better security measures,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has allowed merchants to accept payments with greater ease and confidence, which has been a major factor in the adoption of crypto payments.\u201d\n\nAnd according to experts, the growth of Bitcoin payments is expected to continue as more mainstream companies embrace the technology. This past summer, for instance, PayPal announced that it would begin allowing customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency via its app. And other companies, such as Square, have also jumped into the fray, with its Cash App offering similar services.\n\nThese developments suggest that the cryptocurrency space is entering a new era. While the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may still be volatile, the technology behind it is becoming more robust and user friendly. This could pave the way for mainstream adoption in the near future, and many experts are optimistic that this could be the start of something big.\n\n\u201cI think we are on the cusp of seeing a very significant expansion in the use of crypto for payments and other transactional purposes,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cAs more companies adopt the technology, more consumers will become comfortable with the idea of using cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services. And this could lead to a real revolution in how people pay for things.\u201d\n\nBut despite the optimism, there are still challenges ahead. Volatility remains a major hurdle and one that has made merchants and customers wary of using crypto as a form of payment. And while progress is being made in making crypto payments easier and more secure, the industry still has a long way to go.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a challenge for merchants to securely store and accept payments with Bitcoin or other crypto assets,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cBut the technology continues to evolve, and I believe that if the industry can continue to address these challenges, we will eventually see a more mainstream adoption of crypto payments.\u201d\n\nFor now, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain a gamble in the payments space. But despite the 60% price drop and the uncertain waters ahead, many experts believe that the long-term outlook for crypto payments is still bright. If the industry can continue to make improvements and increase adoption, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could become an everyday payment option.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Emergency overnight shelter opens in former Oak Park rectory\n\nOak Park, IL \u2013 After months of searching for a suitable site to open an emergency overnight shelter, the Village of Oak Park announced today the opening of a new facility in the former rectory of St. Mary\u2019s Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe rectory, which has stood empty for many years, is being leased by the Village from St. Mary\u2019s Church and will be used to house individuals and families in need of emergency overnight shelter. The new shelter is the first of its kind in the Village, and will provide basic amenities such as beds and bathrooms to those in need.\n\nThe rectory, which is located at 1645 N. Harlem Ave., was selected for the project due to its close proximity to the Oak Park Train Station and its large, open floorplan, which allows for adequate space to comfortably accommodate those seeking shelter.\n\nThe shelter, which is being funded by the Oak Park United Way, will have a staff of five employees who will work 24 hours a day to provide support and a safe place for individuals and families in need of emergency overnight shelter. The staff will also provide assistance in finding permanent housing solutions and support services such as health and mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and financial assistance.\n\nThe shelter is part of an effort by the Village of Oak Park to address the homelessness issue in the community, an issue which has been increasing in recent years. According to a report from the Oak Park Human Services Department, the number of people who are either homeless or in need of temporary housing assistance has grown by 19% in the last three years.\n\n\u201cThe new emergency overnight shelter is an important step in our effort to address the increasing number of people in need of shelter in our community,\u201d said Village President Anan Abu-Taleb. \u201cIt is our hope that by providing this resource to those in need, we can help them transition to permanent housing and get the support services they need to become self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nThe shelter will also provide a place to store personal belongings during the day and serve as a venue for job searches and other activities to help individuals and families in need get back on their feet.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to St. Mary\u2019s Church for providing us with this space,\u201d said Assistant Village Manager for Social Services Marisa May. \u201cThis is a unique opportunity for us to provide temporary housing for our most vulnerable residents and to begin helping them find permanent housing and supportive services that will enable them to move forward and become self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nThe shelter will open its doors tomorrow, January 5th, and is expected to accommodate up to 40 people at any given time.

She was just starting out, and I was already a star,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cI guess they were worried about the age difference between us, or something.\u201d\n\nStamos also said that he and Bell \u201creally hit it off\u201d on set and that they\u2019re still close friends today.\n\n\u201cI think we could\u2019ve had a lot of fun together in the movie, but they thought it would be too confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nStamos and Bell, who both star in the popular series \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d have been longtime friends. The two even took a picture together at the Emmys in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe love we have for each other is real,\u201d Stamos said.\n\nThe actor and comedian said that he has no hard feelings towards Disney for the decision and thinks they made the right call.\n\n\u201cI understand where they were coming from, and I respect their decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure if we had been together in the movie, it would have been a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe full episode of \u201cArmchair Expert\u201d featuring Stamos is available now on all major podcasting platforms. Fans of Stamos and Bell can also watch the 2010 Disney movie \u201cYou Again\u201d on Disney+.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On Tuesday night, subscribers of the popular streaming service FuboTV were left outraged when the company was hit with a cyberattack during one of the most watched sporting events of the year \u2013 the World Cup semifinal match.\n\nFuboTV, which is a streaming service that provides sports, news, and entertainment programming, saw their service go down as viewers were watching the match between Argentina and Brazil. The service was down for hours, leaving many viewers upset and confused.\n\nThe attack on the service was confirmed by FuboTV CEO David Gandler. Gandler stated that the company was working with law enforcement to investigate the attack, and that the company was \u201ccommitted to restoring the service for our customers as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe company was able to restore the service shortly after the match ended, but not before thousands of customers had posted on social media about the outage. Many customers expressed their frustration with the service, especially those who had paid for a subscription to watch the match.\n\nThis is not the first time that FuboTV has been targeted by cybercriminals, as the company has previously been targeted by hackers in 2018 and 2019. The company was also targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2020, which resulted in temporary service disruptions.\n\nThe cause of Tuesday\u2019s attack is still unknown, but FuboTV stated that they are taking measures to prevent similar attacks in the future. The company said that they are now \u201cutilizing the latest technologies and industry-leading security practices\u201d to protect their customers.\n\nFuboTV has grown to become one of the most popular streaming services in recent years, as it provides a wide variety of sports and entertainment programming. The service has also become increasingly popular among cord-cutters who are looking to save money by switching to an all-streaming service.\n\nGiven the increased popularity of the service, it is not surprising that cybercriminals have taken an interest in attacking FuboTV. It is likely that the company will need to continue to invest in security measures to ensure that their customers are not disrupted by future cyberattacks.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced an agreement Wednesday to pay $50 million to resolve a New York investigation into lapses concerning its anti-money laundering and know-your-customer practices.\n\nThe company said it would invest an additional $50 million to improve those programs.\n\nOne of the few crypto exchanges headquartered in the United States and regulated by state financial statutes, Coinbase saw explosive growth during the pandemic as the price of bitcoin soared to more than $60,000. But by the end of 2021, Coinbase had a backlog of more than 100,000 unreviewed transaction monitoring alerts and 14,000 customers requiring enhanced due diligence procedures, according to New York regulators.\n\n\u201cCoinbase failed to build and maintain a functional compliance program that could keep pace with its growth,\" Adrienne Harris, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, said in a statement. \"That failure exposed the Coinbase platform to potential criminal activity requiring the Department to take immediate action including the installation of an Independent Monitor,\u201d she said.\n\nThe agency cited two examples of how Coinbase's lapses led to real consequences. In one instance, a former Coinbase customer who had been criminally charged with crimes related to child sexual abuse material conducted suspicious transactions potentially associated with illicit activity on the exchange. Authorities said that activity occurred for more than two years before Coinbase discovered it.\n\nAnother customer was able to fraudulently identify as an employee of an unnamed corporation. Having separately gained access to that corporation's bank account, the customer was able to transfer $150 million of its funds into a Coinbase account, convert the funds into crypto and deposit the proceeds into the customer's personal crypto wallet. (Eventually, Coinbase discovered the activity and with the help of law enforcement recovered the funds.)\n\nIn a statement on its website, Coinbase acknowledged the multimillion-dollar settlement and outlined other steps it was taking to address the lapses.\n\n\"We view this resolution as a critical step in our commitment to continuous improvement, our engagement with key regulators, and our push for greater compliance in the crypto space \u2014 for ourselves and others,\" it said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It looks like James Cameron's highly anticipated sequel Avatar: The Way of Water could be headed for an enormous opening weekend at the box office. According to industry estimates, the film, which is set to hit theaters on December 17, is projected to bring in around $175 million in its opening weekend.\n\nThis would be the highest opening weekend gross for any movie, beating out Avengers: Endgame, which had a $357.1 million domestic opening. Avatar: The Way of Water is the sequel to the highest-grossing film of all time, Avatar, which earned over $2 billion worldwide.\n\nThe estimates for Avatar: The Way of Water are strong, especially given that it's been 11 years since the original film was released. Cameron has assembled an impressive cast for the sequel, including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver, who returns as Dr. Grace Augustine.\n\nThe highly anticipated movie has already made headlines with its groundbreaking use of motion capture technology, which was developed by Weta Digital, the same studio that created the special effects for the original Avatar. The movie is also being released in 3D and IMAX formats, which will likely bolster ticket sales even further.\n\nAdditionally, Avatar: The Way of Water is being released on streaming services, such as Disney+, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, on the same day as it opens in theaters. This could potentially give it a boost at the box office, as people who want to see the movie at home may still opt to buy tickets for the theater.\n\nThe movie has received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its impressive visuals and the performance of its cast. The film has an 84 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, which is sure to be a draw for moviegoers.\n\nWith Avatar: The Way of Water set to open on December 17, we will soon find out how it fares at the box office.

{"text": "I never go grocery shopping when I'm hungry. People who do are more tempted to buy unhealthy comfort snacks and packaged goods, rather than whole, nutritious and satisfying options. I'm very intentional about what I put in my body. So as a nutritional psychiatrist and author of \"This Is Your Brain on Food,\" people often ask me what they should always stock their kitchen with to keep their brains sharp and focused \u2014 at any age. To make my grocery list easy to remember, I created the acronym BRAIN FOODS: B : Berries and beans\n\n: Berries and beans R : Rainbow colors of fruits and vegetables\n\n: Rainbow colors of fruits and vegetables A : Antioxidants\n\n: Antioxidants I : Include lean proteins and plant-based proteins\n\n: Include lean proteins and plant-based proteins N : Nuts\n\n: Nuts F : Fiber-rich foods and fermented foods\n\n: Fiber-rich foods and fermented foods O : Oils\n\n: Oils O : Omega-rich foods\n\n: Omega-rich foods D : Dairy\n\n: Dairy S: Spices\n\n1. Berries and beans\n\nBlueberries, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries are all excellent berry choices. Make sure to eat ripe berries soon, since they don't last long (even in the fridge). At times of the year when fresh, ripe berries aren't available, frozen berries are fine as long as they don't have added sugar or other additives. Beans, legumes and lentils are also healthy and inexpensive sources of nutrients and vitamins. They're also easy to prepare and can be a side dish or an appetizer.\n\n2. Rainbow colors for fruits and vegetables\n\nFrom red cabbage to radicchio to green and yellow bell peppers, buying vibrantly colored veggies will help expand your palate and maximize the range of nutrients that are beneficial to your brain. The same applies to fruits. Apples, pineapples, kiwis and citrus all come in a wide variety of colors. Just be careful not to overdo it with sweet fruits like grapes and mangoes. The most important color of all is green. My favorites are arugula, romaine, Bibb lettuce, endive and bok choy.\n\n3. Antioxidants\n\nDark chocolate is a great source of antioxidants, as long as you stick to the extra dark stuff that doesn't have added sugar. Many vitamins are crucial antioxidants, and you can get them from a broad range of dietary sources. If you're considering taking any sort of multivitamin supplement, I recommend checking with your doctor first.\n\n4. Include lean proteins and plant-based proteins\n\nWell-sourced lean poultry, seafood, pastured eggs and grass-fed beef are good choices to ensure you are getting plenty of protein and the essential amino acids that your brain needs to function well. For plant-based sources of protein, organic tofu, tempeh, beans and lentils can be enhanced with spices for flavor.\n\n5. Nuts and seeds\n\nNuts and seeds have healthy omega fats and oils that will help sharpen your brain. They also have key vitamins and minerals, like selenium in Brazil nuts. Seeds like flax, chia and hemp are perfect options, too I recommend eating about a quarter-cup or two ounces daily, either as a snack, or added to your salad or vegetable side dish. Or you can throw some into a homemade granola or trail mix that contains much less sugar and salt than store-bought versions.\n\n6. Fiber-rich foods and fermented foods\n\nFiber is important for your gut health, can help keep your weight in balance, and decreases inflammation in the entire body. Some high-fiber foods include artichoke hearts, quinoa, edamame, berries and pears. Fermented foods like kefir, miso, and kimchee are also great for your brain and gut since they're a natural source of active cultures bacteria, and have been shown to lower inflammation.\n\n7. Oils\n\nWhile you want to avoid an excess of saturated fats and unhealthy oils like the kinds used for frying, you want to ensure you're getting enough healthy fats from sources like olive oil, avocados and oily fish. Even with healthy fats, be aware of portion size and try not to eat too much. All fats are calorie dense.\n\n8. Omega-rich foods\n\nImportant brain-boosting omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish like salmon, mackerel, and tuna. Plant-based foods like chia seeds, Brussels sprouts, walnuts and flaxseeds are also rich in omega-3s.\n\n9. Dairy\n\nIf you eat dairy, yogurts and kefir with probiotic cultures can do wonders for your gut, thanks to all the helpful bacteria and protein they contain. Grass-fed dairy products are better options for your brain, too. Remember that certain conditions, like ADHD, can be aggravated by dairy, so be aware of how it affects you.\n\n10.

Dijo que las cuestiones partidarias en torno a la pol\u00edtica fronteriza y migratoria empa\u00f1an las discusiones sobre c\u00f3mo manejar la migraci\u00f3n y los cruces en la frontera.\n\n\u201cEs importante retroceder y ver el panorama general\u201d, dijo Biden, citando el deseo de los inmigrantes de buscar su propia versi\u00f3n del sue\u00f1o americano.\n\npublicidad\n\nLos anuncios y la visita a la frontera representan un aumento en la atenci\u00f3n presidencial sobre un tema que se est\u00e1 convirtiendo cada vez m\u00e1s en una responsabilidad pol\u00edtica para Biden. Fue criticado implacablemente por los republicanos e incluso por algunos dem\u00f3cratas del distrito fronterizo por no abordar los niveles r\u00e9cord de cruces del \u00faltimo periodo.\n\n\u201cSi los republicanos m\u00e1s extremos siguen haciendo demagogia con este tema y rechazan las soluciones presentadas, me queda una sola opci\u00f3n\u2026 hacer todo lo que pueda por mi cuenta para tratar de cambiar la atm\u00f3sfera\u201d, dijo.\n\nDijo tambi\u00e9n que el proceso que acaba de presenar \u201ces ordenado, seguro y humano, y funciona\u201d, dijo Biden.\n\nEl presidente reconoci\u00f3 a su vez que los pasos que estaba tomando no eran suficientes para remediar el problema, pero los enmarc\u00f3 como parte de un esfuerzo por usar sus poderes ejecutivos en el manejo de la creciente crisis.\n\n\u201cEstas acciones por s\u00ed solas que voy a anunciar hoy no van a arreglar todo nuestro sistema de inmigraci\u00f3n, pero s\u00ed pueden ayudarnos mucho a manejar mejor lo que es un desaf\u00edo dif\u00edcil\u201d, dijo.\n\nLos anuncios se dan antes de la primera visita de Biden como presidente a M\u00e9xico, donde discutir\u00e1 temas migratorios con el presidente de este pa\u00eds, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. El Gobierno de Biden se est\u00e1 apoyando en M\u00e9xico y otros pa\u00edses del hemisferio occidental para dar protecciones temporales a los migrantes que han huido de sus pa\u00edses de origen.\n\n\u201cTodos deber\u00edamos reconocer que mientras Estados Unidos sea la tierra de la libertad y las oportunidades, la gente intentar\u00e1 venir aqu\u00ed\u201d, dijo Biden. \"Y eso es lo que hicieron muchos de nuestros antepasados. Por eso no sorprende que vuelva a suceder hoy. No podemos impedir que la gente haga el viaje, pero podemos exigirles que vengan aqu\u00ed de manera ordenada\".\n\nEl domingo en Texas, Biden llegar\u00e1 al epicentro del problema. El Paso comenz\u00f3 a ver niveles r\u00e9cord de llegadas de migrantes hace unas semanas, cuando la ansiedad por el fin programado de la regla de salud p\u00fablica pand\u00e9mica de la era Trump conocida como T\u00edtulo 42 llev\u00f3 a miles de migrantes a entregarse a las autoridades fronterizas o a cruzar a la frontera ilegalmente en un per\u00edodo muy corto de tiempo.\n\nEl T\u00edtulo 42 permite a las autoridades de inmigraci\u00f3n expulsar r\u00e1pidamente a algunos migrantes a M\u00e9xico. La pol\u00edtica estaba programada para levantarse el mes pasado, pero un fallo de la Corte Suprema mantuvo la regla vigente mientras contin\u00faa la pelea legal en los tribunales.\n\nBiden dijo que quer\u00eda esperar hasta conocer el resultado de las maquinaciones legales del T\u00edtulo 42 antes de viajar a la frontera, pero acus\u00f3 a los republicanos de jugar juegos pol\u00edticos. \u201cNo se han tomado en serio esto en lo absoluto\u201d, dijo.\n\nLos anuncios que Biden hizo este jueves reflejan que su Gobierno se prepara para el fin del T\u00edtulo 42, junto con la implementaci\u00f3n de una serie de programas para gestionar la oleada de inmigrantes que ha coincidido con el fin anticipado de la regla.\n\nEl Gobierno ahora aceptar\u00e1 hasta 30.000 migrantes por mes provenientes de Nicaragua, Cuba, Hait\u00ed y Venezuela bajo un programa de libertad condicional humanitaria dirigido a esas nacionalidades. Aquellos que no vengan a EE.UU. bajo ese programa podr\u00e1n ser expulsados a M\u00e9xico bajo el T\u00edtulo 42, que permanece vigente luego de una orden de la Corte Suprema el mes pasado.\n\nLos inmigrantes de esos pa\u00edses que deseen llegar a los Estados Unidos primero deber\u00e1n presentar una solicitud desde sus pa\u00edses de origen, incluso a trav\u00e9s de una aplicaci\u00f3n en sus tel\u00e9fonos, antes de emprender el viaje. Deben tener un patrocinador estadounidense y, si son aprobados, pueden viajar en avi\u00f3n.\n\nLos funcionarios del Gobierno promocionaron previamente el programa de libertad condicional para Venezuela luego de su implementaci\u00f3n a fines del a\u00f1o pasado, atribuyendo a la pol\u00edtica una ca\u00edda en los cruces fronterizos de venezolanos. Durante meses, los funcionarios consideraron expandir el programa a otras nacionalidades, lo que finalmente culmin\u00f3 con el anuncio de este jueves.\n\nLas autoridades dijeron que los anuncios est\u00e1n destinados a enviar un mensaje a los inmigrantes de que deben solicitar la entrada a Estados Unidos antes de salir de sus pa\u00edses de origen, y que eludir el proceso resultar\u00e1 en su expulsi\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cMi mensaje es este: si est\u00e1 tratando de salir de Cuba, Nicaragua o Hait\u00ed, o tiene planeado comenzar un viaje hacia Estados Unidos no lo haga, no se presente simplemente en la frontera\u201d, dijo Biden. \u201cQu\u00e9dese donde est\u00e1 y haga la solicitud legalmente.

{"text": "In a thrilling matchup for the national championship of college football, defending champion University of Georgia Bulldogs faced off against an unexpected opponent, the TCU Horned Frogs. For the second year in a row, the Bulldogs had reached the championship game, but this time around, they faced a tough matchup.\n\nDespite finishing their season with an impressive 11-2 record, the Horned Frogs of Texas Christian University entered the game as a significant underdog. Nevertheless, the game promised to be a thrilling affair, with the Bulldogs looking to repeat their success of the previous season and the Horned Frogs aiming to write their own Cinderella story.\n\nThe Bulldog faithful descended upon the gleaming new Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, where the championship game was set to be contested. After pregame festivities and ceremonies, the two teams took the field, eager to write their own history.\n\nThe Horned Frogs\u2019 Cinderella run had been led by sophomore quarterback Max Watson, who had been dazzling defenses with his potent combination of arm strength and decision-making. His star wide receiver, AJ Robinson, was also a major reason for TCU\u2019s success.\n\nOn the other side, the Bulldogs were lead by experienced senior quarterback Lane Brown, who was coming off a successful regular season. Brown had also been supported by a strong running game, as the Bulldog ground attack had gained over 2,500 yards throughout the season.\n\nAs the game began, the Horned Frogs quickly got on the scoreboard with a touchdown pass from Watson to Robinson, to take the early lead. However, the Bulldogs answered with a field goal and, late in the first half, the score was knotted at 7-7.\n\nThe score would remain the same heading into the fourth quarter and, with the game in the balance, both teams surged forward. After trading scores, the Bulldogs finally emerged triumphant, with Brown connecting on a long touchdown pass to the Bulldogs\u2019 star wide receiver, Cameron Colbert, to clinch the win.\n\nIn a spectacular finish to the college football season, the University of Georgia Bulldogs had secured back-to-back national championships and had written their own piece of history in the process. However, despite the loss, TCU had also accomplished something remarkable, defying expectations to reach the championship game in the first place.\n\nIn the aftermath of the game, both teams were praised for their performances, and their players feted as heroes. For the Bulldogs, the victory was one of the most impressive in college football history, while the Horned Frogs had proven that anything was possible in the game.

{"text": "The concept of renting out your home as a form of hospitality has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks in part to the rise of the now ubiquitous platform, Airbnb. But while the idea of a rental home is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness, the reality of the experience can be quite different. Travelers are now finding themselves facing extra tasks and duties beyond what they paid for - including doing the laundry, mowing the lawn, and taking out the trash - even after paying a hefty cleaning fee.\n\nIn recent months, travelers have taken to social media to share their experiences with an Airbnb stay that came with added chores. The tweets, screenshots, and stories shared paint a picture of a travel experience where guests feel taken advantage of and overwhelmed by the added work outside of their paid duties.\n\nThe complaints have ranged from shallow tasks, such as putting out trash cans or setting up dishes, to the more arduous, such as mowing the lawn and taking out the trash. Some travelers report having to take out the trash, even after paying a hefty cleaning fee that\u2019s upwards of $125. While some of these added chores are simply the rule of thumb when renting an Airbnb, more often they are a manipulation of travelers who are hoping to get a little extra help cleaning up the space. \n\nIn some cases, travelers have even shared messages from the Airbnb host - many of which have been deemed condescending or exploitative - asking them to perform certain tasks during their stay. For example, one traveler shared a screenshot of a message from their Airbnb host, asking them to do the laundry and take out the trash during their stay. These messages can be seen as a form of emotional labor for the host, or an attempt to get the most out of their guests without having to pay additional money.\n\nAnd it's not just Airbnb hosts who are taking advantage of their guests' labor - some travelers are even reporting incidents where they were asked to perform chores by Airbnb managers. In an interview with Business Insider, one traveler recalled an incident in which a manager asked them to mow the lawn and take out the trash, despite having paid a hefty cleaning fee. It's not only offensive, it can also be a safety hazard, as many travelers report feeling uncomfortable doing tasks they\u2019re not familiar with, such as mowing the lawn. \n\nThe complaint has been widely echoed on the social media platform, with many travelers sharing their own tales of their Airbnb woes. Some travelers shared that they are now feeling betrayed by the platform, particularly after spending a hefty fee - sometimes as much as $125 - only to be asked to take out the trash and mow the lawn.

{"text": "China state media has sought to downplay the severity of a recent wave of COVID-19 infections in the country, amid concern from the World Health Organization (WHO) about rising cases worldwide. \n\nOn Tuesday, the WHO will hold a meeting to discuss the global pandemic, with China\u2019s National Health Commission and other global health bodies to attend.\n\nChina is one of the few countries that have managed to bring the spread of the virus under control, but the recent resurgence of COVID-19 has prompted the WHO to sound the alarm.\n\nHowever, in an apparent attempt to alleviate international concerns, state media outlets in the country have sought to emphasize that the current wave of infections is mild in comparison to the first wave in the Spring of 2020.\n\nThe official Chinese newspaper, People\u2019s Daily, has published several articles over the last few days that have sought to downplay the seriousness of the recent wave. In one article, the newspaper wrote that \u201ccompared with the first wave, this second wave of the pandemic is much milder.\u201d\n\nAnother article argued that the current wave of infections was not as \u201cdevastating\u201d as the first wave and said that \u201cthe current epidemic situation is generally controllable.\u201d\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency has also sought to paint a rosy picture of the situation, quoting a Chinese health official as saying that the country had \u201cmaintained effective control of the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe effort to downplay the severity of the recent wave of infections is likely intended to alleviate concerns from the WHO and other global health bodies as they prepare to meet to discuss the pandemic. \n\nAt the meeting on Tuesday, the WHO will be discussing how best to tackle the current wave of infections and how to respond to the increasing reports of new variants of the virus.\n\nChina has been criticized by some global health experts for its response to the pandemic and its lack of transparency over the spread of the virus. \n\nHowever, China\u2019s National Health Commission has defended the country\u2019s approach, stating that it had taken \u201ctimely and decisive\u201d action to contain the virus.\n\nThe Commission has also insisted that the country had \u201cstrengthened international exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in its response to the pandemic. \n\nThe WHO has praised China for its efforts in curbing the spread of the virus, with Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that the country had \u201csucceeded in protecting its population\u201d and was \u201cleading the world in tackling the pandemic.\u201d\n\nDespite the progress that has been made in containing the spread of COVID-19 in China, the WHO has urged countries to remain vigilant and to continue to take precautions such as masks and social distancing.\n\nThe organization has also said that countries should be prepared for the possibility of a third wave of the virus. \n\nAs the world awaits the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, China will no doubt be hoping that the international community will recognize its progress in controlling the pandemic and that its recent wave of infections will be viewed in a more positive light.", "label": "machine"}

Kevin McCarthy has lost six rounds of voting for House Speaker as of Wednesday night.\n\nBut McCarthy \u2014 or the 20 Republican holdouts \u2014 don't appear close to conceding.\n\nHere are five ways the battle for House Speaker could potentially end.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Kevin McCarthy, who failed to win a majority after six rounds of voting. The GOP's slim majority in the House means McCarthy needs the support of nearly all Republicans to become speaker.\n\nBut the group of Republicans protesting McCarthy doesn't appear to be giving in, and how exactly the whole ordeal will end is up in the air.\n\n\"If you can imagine a scenario where both sides are able to claim victory, that's the one you'd probably put your chips on,\" Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies Congress and US politics, told Insider. \"But it's not clear what that looks like.\"\n\nHere are five potential ways the battle for House Speaker could end, with or without McCarthy assuming the position.\n\nMcCarthy gives GOP holdouts what they want\n\nThe group of lawmakers opposing McCarthy has made a number of demands that they would like to see in the new Congress, including rules changes that would give more power to individual members.\n\nMcCarthy tentatively agreed to some, including expanding the rights of members to \"motion to vacate the chair,\" which would essentially allow a handful of members to force a chamber-wide \"no confidence\" vote for the speaker. But some Republicans want the motion to be expanded even further to allow one member to force such a vote, as was the case before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi weakened the motion in 2019.\n\nIt's unclear what other concessions McCarthy could make to shore up support from those opposing him. But some, including Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, have suggested there's little McCarthy could do to earn their vote.\n\nMcCarthy bows out and a consensus speaker is selected\n\nAfter six votes, McCarthy seems set on becoming speaker. But it's possible the representative from California could withdraw if \"he thinks he can't win or he sees support eroding with additional votes,\" Kosar said.\n\nIt's unclear how long McCarthy would be willing to draw out the voting, but his support has dwindled slightly since the first vote on Tuesday when only 19 Republicans voted against him.\n\nDuring the final vote on Wednesday, 20 Republicans voted for Rep. Byron Donalds.\n\nMcCarthy cuts a deal with Democrats\n\nMcCarthy could theoretically come to a deal with Democratic leadership in which some members of their party cross lines and support his bid for speaker. However, thus far Democrats have not signaled any willingness to step in.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday if Democrats could intervene, Rep. Nancy Pelosi said: \"This is a problem of their own making. This is called leadership. They should be able to work it out. Don't put this at the Democrats' doorstep.\"\n\nCooperating with Democrats could also hurt McCarthy in the long run.\n\n\"The Freedom Caucus response will be, 'Oh my God, Kevin McCarthy schemed with Democrats,'\" Kosar said, adding the Democrats could also hold it over on McCarthy that they had to do him a favor because he couldn't become speaker without them.\n\nMembers stop showing up as the vote drags on, lowering the majority threshold\n\nMcCarthy needs to win a majority of the present members' votes in order to be elected speaker. That means if some members stop showing up, which becomes more likely the longer the voting drags on, he could potentially be elected speaker even without the support of his whole party.\n\nHouse changes the rules to push McCarthy through\n\nThe House could also in theory change the rules of voting for speaker. For instance, McCarthy could make a motion to say that only a plurality is needed to become speaker, meaning whoever gets the most votes would become speaker even if they do not earn a majority of votes.\n\nIf such a motion passed, that could scare enough Republicans into backing McCarthy in order to avoid a Democrat becoming speaker. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the House Minority Leader for the Democrats has consistently been getting 212 votes.\n\nKosar said such an outcome was \"fanciful,\" although technically possible.", "label": "human"}

Rapid allows each player 15 minutes + 10 seconds additional time per move, starting from move 1 while Blitz is three minutes per player per game, with two seconds additional time per move.\n\nCarlsen secured his fourth Rapid title on Wednesday, half a point ahead of Germany\u2019s Vincent Keymer.\n\nHe then made a dramatic entrance to Round 1 of the World Blitz Championship, running through the playing hall and arriving at his board two minutes and 30 seconds late, still dressed in a tracksuit.\n\nHe still went on to win the match, with just 30 seconds on the clock.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, the Blitz title is very important because it\u2019s [won in a tournament with] more rounds\u2026 As far as the classical championship [goes] I won it but it wasn\u2019t dear enough to hold on to.\u201d\n\nThe USA\u2019s Hikaru Nakamura had led the tournament after Day 1 but he eventually finished second overall, under pressure from Carlsen.\n\n\u201cWhile he is used to winning tournaments he\u2019s never won this one,\u201d Carlsen said afterwards in a press release. \u201cWhen he started a bit shakey, then I knew I had a chance.\u201d\n\nHowever, Carlsen too faced pressure as he suffered two defeats at important moments \u2013 to Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi and Alexey Sarana.\n\nBut he held on to eventually seal victory by a point ahead of Nakamura and Armenia\u2019s Haik M.

{"text": "It has been a long and hard fought battle for the LGBTQIA+ community in Texas. For decades, the community has dealt with oppressive policies and laws that have pushed them to the sidelines of society. Recently, their battle has become even more pressing as Texas schools have begun to remove LGBTQIA+ books from their libraries.\n\nToday, the Department of Justice announced that it has opened an investigation into the Texas school system for \u201cviolations of federal law and possible civil rights violations\u201d related to the removal of LGBTQIA+ books from its libraries.\n\nThe announcement comes after several years of mounting pressure from the LGBTQIA+ community and its supporters. Earlier this year, the American Library Association (ALA) released a report that highlighted the situation in Texas and said that over the past decade, nearly 200 books depicting LGBTQIA+ characters or themes had been removed from school libraries in the state.\n\nThe ALA has since launched a nationwide campaign calling for an end to the censorship of LGBTQIA+ literature in public schools. In response, the DOJ opened its investigation into the Texas school system.\n\nIn a statement released today, Attorney General Merrick Garland said, \u201cNo one should be denied access to information because of who they are or whom they love. The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that all individuals can access information free from discrimination and oppression.\u201d\n\nThe investigation is expected to be a lengthy one, as the DOJ is looking into whether or not the school district\u2019s actions constitute a violation of federal civil rights law. In particular, the DOJ will be looking into whether or not the school district engaged in discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ community and whether or not it violated the federal law that prohibits schools from discriminating based on race, religion, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\n\nIf the investigation finds evidence of civil rights violations, the DOJ could take legal action against the school district and even seek to have it pay damages to students who were harmed by the removal of LGBTQIA+ books.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time when the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community are under constant attack by the current administration. In recent months, the Trump administration has rolled back protections for transgender people, implemented a ban on transgender people serving in the military, and tried to limit LGBTQIA+ couples\u2019 ability to adopt children.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s investigation into the Texas school system could be a major step forward in the fight for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community and a sign that the government is willing to take a stand against discrimination.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to note that the DOJ is still in the early stages of its investigation, and it is unclear how long it will take for it to reach a conclusion. However, the fact that the Department of Justice is taking this matter seriously is a sign of hope for the LGBTQIA+ community that their voices are finally being heard.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The highly-anticipated sequels to Avatar, James Cameron's science fiction blockbuster, have been hit with criticism from some Indigenous groups.\n\nThe sequels, which will be released in 2025 and 2027, have come under fire from Indigenous people in the US, Canada, and New Zealand. They claim that the movie perpetuates a \u201cwhite savior\u201d narrative, in which white people come to the aid of Indigenous people in dire need.\n\nThe first Avatar movie was set on a planet populated by the indigenous Na\u2019vi people. The story follows a human military group that attempts to take control of the planet for its resources. The main character, Jake Sully, helps the Na\u2019vi fight back, and ultimately allies with them.\n\nAvatar was widely praised for its visuals and storyline, and was the highest-grossing film of all time until Avengers: Endgame surpassed it in 2019. It was also the first movie to earn more than $2 billion worldwide.\n\nHowever, some Indigenous activists have pointed out that the movie uses Indigenous people as props to further the white characters\u2019 journeys. They argue that while Avatar may have helped make some people more aware of Indigenous issues, it isn\u2019t a true representation of the cultures and struggles of Indigenous people.\n\nIndigenous activist Crystal Echo Hawk of the IllumiNative organization told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cIt\u2019s great to have representation, but it\u2019s not enough to just have a token Indigenous character or presence. We need meaningful, nuanced and accurate stories about us to make change.\u201d\n\nOther Indigenous activists have also voiced their concerns about the sequel. In an open letter, the New Zealand Maori Council said, \u201cWe feel these images and portrayals of Maori, and of Indigenous people generally, are unhelpful at best and offensive and destructive at worst.\u201d\n\nThe letter calls on Cameron to \u201cseek ways to collaborate with local Maori communities in the production of the sequel\u201d and to \u201cacknowledge and understand the deep-seated cultural and religious issues around representations of Maori people.\u201d\n\nThe letter also requests that the film avoid \u201cdegrading imagery\u201d such as war dances, hakas, and other Indigenous cultural elements.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Cameron responded to the criticisms, saying \u201cWe acknowledge and respect the concerns of the Indigenous community, and we are taking steps to ensure our production is an opportunity for dialogue, education, and positive representation.\u201d\n\nThe director said he was working with a team of advisors from the Indigenous community to ensure that the sequels are \u201cauthentic and respectful to the Indigenous cultures\u201d featured in the movies.\n\nCameron added that he hopes the sequels will \u201chelp raise awareness about the struggle of Indigenous people in the US, Canada, and New Zealand, and will help promote understanding, reconciliation, and healing.\u201d\n\nThe first Avatar sequel is expected to be released in December 2025. Until then, we'll have to wait to see if Cameron and the Indigenous advisors he is working with can make a movie that truly honors the culture and history of the Indigenous people it seeks to represent.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Sleep isn't getting the respect it deserves.\n\nIt's no wonder that for years, some of us have thought of sleep as something of a luxury, something we can get by without. After all, why would you choose to get eight hours of rest when there's so much to do?\n\nBut in recent years, scientists have made huge strides in understanding the importance of sleep and its impact on our overall health, wellbeing, and longevity. And, as a result, sleep deprivation has become a real public health crisis.\n\nNow, a new crop of startups and entrepreneurs are looking to tackle the problem head on.\n\nLeading the charge is Dr. Robert Rosenberg, a former sleep doctor who has started a $5 billion venture called Insomnia Ventures. His mission is simple: to bring a new approach to the treatment of insomnia and to promote better sleep for everyone.\n\nRosenberg has assembled a team of world-renowned scientists and specialists from around the world to help develop innovative treatments for insomnia. At the heart of the company is the idea that sleep is an essential component of our health, and that understanding the biology behind it is key to unlocking the door to better health and longevity.\n\nThe company's first product is a digital health platform that combines sleep monitoring and tracking, cognitive behavioral therapy, and sleep coaching. Insomnia Ventures also plans to develop more sophisticated digital therapies that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.\n\nRosenberg believes his team's approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we look at and manage insomnia. He notes that more than 90 million adults in the United States suffer from insomnia, and the condition is linked to increased risk of depression, hypertension, and heart disease, among other serious health concerns.\n\nIn the future, Rosenberg hopes Insomnia Ventures can help put an end to the stigma around sleep, and he envisions a world where sleep is just as important as other health concerns like nutrition and exercise.\n\n\"The key to making an impact is understanding the biology and physiology behind sleep,\" Rosenberg says. \"We are doing things that have never been done before in this space and that gives us a huge opportunity to make a difference.\"\n\nThe company has already garnered interest from some of the top investors in Silicon Valley, as well as major healthcare players like UnitedHealth Group and Sanofi.\n\nRosenberg is optimistic that in the next few years, Insomnia Ventures can make a real impact on how we treat and think about sleep. With more investment, the company could eventually reach a point where it's helping to solve the global sleep crisis.\n\n\"We want to be part of the solution,\" Rosenberg says. \"Our mission is to make sure people get the sleep they need and deserve.\"", "label": "machine"}

In the same period, operating income was down nearly 50% from the same period in 2019, and the company's stock price has declined more than 75% since the start of the year.\n\nThe announcement came just a day after Bed Bath & Beyond said it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company or other \"strategic restructuring transactions.\"\n\nThe announcement sent shockwaves through the stock market, as the stock plummeted 22% in after-hours trading to an all-time low of just $2.86 per share. The stock had already been suffering, having dropped nearly 60% in the previous month alone.\n\nThe company's statement also hinted at the possibility of bankruptcy, warning that if its efforts to secure financing were unsuccessful, it could be forced to restructure or liquidate its assets.\n\nAnalysts and investors were quick to point out that the news was yet another sign that brick-and-mortar retail is struggling to survive in the age of e-commerce.\n\n\"This is a very clear signal that the traditional retail model is no longer working,\" said David Blitzer, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services. \"The days of having a large physical retail presence have come to an end.\"\n\nThe news was also a blow to the company's employees, who have endured more than a year of layoffs and pay cuts. More than 4,000 jobs have been cut since the beginning of the pandemic and the company is currently facing a lawsuit from former employees who claim they were laid off without cause.\n\nThe retailer has also been struggling to compete in an increasingly competitive market. In recent months, the company has closed dozens of stores and has struggled to keep up with the changing demands of shoppers. The company also faces competition from big-box retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, who are able to offer shoppers a larger selection of products at lower prices.\n\nAs of this writing, Bed Bath & Beyond's stock price is down more than 80% since the start of the year.

The move was aimed at easing some of the costs of prolonged monetary stimulus.\n\nA Nikkei report on Saturday that the BOJ was considering raising its inflation forecasts in January to show price growth close to its 2% target this year and next has only fueled speculation that the world's most dovish major central bank may well step back from its ultra-loose policy.\n\nAll this leaves the yen - you guessed it - as one of the most favored trades early in 2023. MUFG says that even after the recent rebound, the yen is still \"deeply undervalued,\" which leaves scope for further gains. Pictet has a year-end dollar/yen forecast of 125, implying a further gain in the value of the yen of 4% from current levels.\n\nJapanese authorities stepped into the market in September to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998 and again in October, when it weakened to a 32-year low of 151.94 per dollar. The benefit of hindsight suggests they just needed to hold out a little longer for the yen's recovery.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nAs U.S. markets reopen after Monday's holiday, focus will likely shift back to the outlook for inflation and monetary policy. The minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting are out on Wednesday and the December non-farm payrolls report is due on Friday.\n\nThe closely-watched U.S. jobs data alone means the first trading week of 2023 is unlikely to be dull.\n\nThere's plenty going on elsewhere too.\n\nChina's factory activity shrank at a sharper pace in December, as surging COVID-19 infections disrupted production and weighed on demand after Beijing largely removed anti-virus curbs, a survey showed on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. stock futures point to a strong open for Wall Street shares , , European shares were more than 1.5% higher (.STOXX) while London's blue-chip rallied over 2% (.FTSE) to its highest since last June.\n\nClearly, yen traders are not alone in wanting to leave a bruising 2022 in the past.\n\nKey developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday :\n\n- U.S. December final PMI due for release.\n\n- UK manufacturing ends 2022 on a low as orders shrink.\n\n- Brazil markets tumble on Lula's first full day in office.\n\n- Inflation in key German states eases for second month.\n\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Susan Fenton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"text": "Maria Claudia \u201cCloclo\u201d Echavarr\u00eda has always known the treasures that her native Colombia holds. Though she was educated in Switzerland, has lived in London, and now resides in Milan, Cartagena has remained her family\u2019s base. So when the announcement of Echavarr\u00eda\u2019s engagement to Prince Josef-Emanuel of Liechtenstein was made last July, there was little doubt that a very Colombian wedding would be in store. The bride, co-founder of former talent incubator/fashion consultancy S\u00ed Collective, has dedicated herself to raising the profiles of Latin American designers, and her wedding, a weeklong, three-destination affair, was no exception. \u201cIt was important to me to keep the team as local as possible, and to be able to truly offer our guests a taste of the best of Colombia,\u201d Echavarr\u00eda says. \u201cColombians are so proud of our country, and we want people to see and experience everything it has to offer.\u201d Here\u2019s how the couple celebrated across three cities.\n\nCartagena\n\nChiqui de Echavarr\u00eda created a tropical paradise in her home\u2019s courtyard, adding a mural of vines and fresh orchids (Colombia has over 4,000 species). Maureen M. Evans Iraca palm place mats, napkin rings, and bread baskets were made by local artisans for Casa Chiqui, while the family plates were hand-painted in Medell\u00edn. Maureen M. Evans\n\nAmong the first to receive a call: childhood friends and designers Esteban Cort\u00e1zar and Edgardo Osorio. Cort\u00e1zar, despite having created many a wedding dress, had never designed one for a wedding in Cartagena. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most romantic cities, and it has always inspired me. You\u2019re walking down the street and it\u2019s like you\u2019re in a Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez novel,\u201d says Cort\u00e1zar, who had the idea of fashioning the dress from antique linens in order to stand up to the Caribbean heat, appeal to the bride\u2019s passion for sustainability, and feel sufficiently grand for a royal wedding.\n\n\u201cCloclo has impeccable taste, but she\u2019s also a down-to-earth girl, so I wanted to create something that would command attention,\u201d he says. \u201cI envisioned her as the Princess of Cartagena, a mix of both worlds, because she\u2019s lived all over the world but she\u2019s always been in touch with her roots.\u201d The grandeur of the church, the 16th-century Iglesia de San Pedro Claver, called for a long train, which was created in part by joining four enormous, early-1900s curtain panels found in Paris\u2014pushing the bride out of her usual flats and into skyscraping platforms by Osorio, founder of shoe brand Aquazzura. Osorio embellished the pumps with remnants from the dress fabric.\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nCustom platforms by Aquazurra. Maureen M. Evans The couple\u2019s rings sit atop invitations by Crystal Ochoa and a headpiece by Magnetic Midnight. Maureen M. Evans\n\nAfter the ceremony, guests rode chivas (distinctly Colombian open-air buses) through dense crowds hoping to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds as they emerged to the sounds of traditional drummers and dancers, whose white cotton dresses echoed the bride\u2019s. The dancers were \u201ctotally a surprise to Josef, which shows on his face in many of the photos!\u201d Echavarr\u00eda says. \u201cCloclo was absolutely sure she wanted to have the reception at home,\u201d says her mother, legendary hostess Evelia \u201cChiqui\u201d de Echavarr\u00eda, who started planning last summer. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my God, I have to get all the orchids now, so that they\u2019ll flower in March.\u2019\u201d Flower they did, complementing the lush garden Chiqui has been cultivating for decades. And when she decided that the space still wasn\u2019t quite green enough for her liking? She hired an artist to paint vines on the white walls and ceiling.\n\nAfter the dinner, catered by Juan Felipe Camacho of restaurant Don Juan, and the cake, a coconut and mamey pie by Cartagena\u2019s Pasteler\u00eda Mila, musicians playing vallenato got the party started, followed by a salsa band and DJ Carlos Mejia. The Echavarr\u00edas\u2019 parties are legendary, but knowing a full day at the beach awaited them, most of the guests retired before dawn.\n\nBar\u00fa\n\nThe day after the ceremony, guests decamped to the Echavarr\u00edas\u2019 Bar\u00fa house for a bounty of Colombian fruits and juices and live music on the beach. Maureen M. Evans Cloclo, above with Josef-Emanuel, collaborated on a minidress with designer Diego Guarnizo, crocheted by Colombian artisans with shell embellishments. Maureen M. Evans\n\nBar\u00fa, a small island where the Echavarr\u00eda family has a thatched-roof beach house, feels a world away, making it the ideal spot for guests\u2014including the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and family, handbag designer Carolina Santo Domingo, and Princesses Maria Laura and Luisa of Belgium\u2014to unwind after the previous day\u2019s festivities. Echavarr\u00eda arrived in a hand-crocheted minidress created with costume and set designer Diego Guarnizo (it was decorated with shells at her mother\u2019s boutique, Casa Chiqui) and a bikini designed with Cali-based Juan De Dios. \u201cI wanted to highlight artisans and smaller brands that might not be as internationally recognized,\u201d Echavarr\u00eda says. \u201cThis has always been central to my work and something I believe in strongly, beyond it being a professional endeavor.\u201d Later, she changed into a Gabriela Hearst dress, with Casa Chiqui earrings and a headpiece by her cousin Lucia\u2019s brand, Magnetic Midnight.\n\nBogot\u00e1\n\nThe bride wore an embroidered ivory silk dirndl with a pale pink silk brocade apron by friend Annina Pfuel\u2019s brand Annina Dirndl, as well as Aquazzura espadrilles. Maureen M. Evans Another costume change saw the bride don a Swiss coat by her friend, designer Olivia Schuler-Voith, whose brand, Lokomotive, launches this fall. Maureen M. Evans\n\nA few days\u2019 break before the celebration\u2019s wrap-up in Bogot\u00e1 gave guests ample time to explore Colombia. A country house owned by Echavarr\u00eda\u2019s aunts stood in for an Alpine setting as guests donned tracht (traditional garments of German-speaking countries) and explored a fruit and flower market created by Guarnizo. The Alpine-style table linens\u2014created in collaboration with illustrator Crystal Ochoa, a former S\u00ed Collective director\u2014featured yellow embroidered butterflies, reminiscent of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s symbol of love, hope, and peace. The motif recurred throughout the week, in the invitations and even fluttering around events. \u201cThe whole process felt like working with friends,\u201d Echavarr\u00eda says. \u201cFrom putting together my looks, to developing the graphics and choosing the vendors, it felt like I was tapping into my network of loved ones.\u201d\n\nA family house in the hills was the setting for an Alpine-inspired post-wedding send-off.

The agreement, which is being hailed as a win for both sides, follows weeks of tense negotiations and, in some cases, contentious work stoppages.\n\nThe tentative agreement was announced late Thursday night between the Federation of American Hospitals and the United Nurses Union, a coalition of nurses and hospital staff who have been negotiating since late November.\n\nThe agreement, which covers more than 4,000 nurses at seven hospitals in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, provides wage increases, job security and other benefits for nurses. The agreement also provides for a mechanism for resolving future labor disputes.\n\nThe agreement was hailed as a victory for the nurses, who had sought wage increases, improved job security and better working conditions. They also wanted to ensure that their hospitals would provide a safe working environment for all nurses.\n\n\"This agreement is a victory for nurses across the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area,\" said Martha Hagen, president of the United Nurses Union. \"The nurses have stood united throughout these negotiations and refused to accept any concessions that would have undermined our ability to care for our patients.\"\n\nThe agreement comes after weeks of protests and picketing by nurses and hospital staff, as well as the mobilization of community members and the involvement of local, state and federal lawmakers.\n\n\"We are thrilled that nurses have reached an agreement that is going to improve the lives of thousands of nurses and their families,\" said Washington D.C.

{"text": "In a move that could have wide reaching implications for how companies are tackling age restrictions for their services, Pornhub has become the first major streaming video platform to require viewers in the state of Louisiana to verify their age with a government ID.\n\nThe change comes in response to a recent law passed in the state of Louisiana that will require streaming video platforms to verify viewers in the state are over the age of 18. The law will go into effect on January 1, 2024 and will apply to anyone in the state that accesses or attempts to access \u201csexually oriented material.\u201d\n\nThe law also requires that companies that stream \u201csexually oriented material\u201d keep records of all viewers who access the material and be able to verify their age with a government-issued ID.\n\nIn response to the new law, Pornhub has launched a new age verification system that will require viewers in Louisiana to provide their date of birth and a valid form of identification. The system will also require viewers to provide a valid e-mail address in order to complete the age verification process.\n\nPornhub is one of the most popular streaming video sites on the internet, boasting over three billion visits a month.

Mondaire Jones penned an opinion piece criticizing Republican-appointed judges' \"unrestrained use of nationwide injunctions\" to block Democratic policies. For example, federal Texas Judge Mark Pittman \u2014 appointed by former President Donald Trump \u2014 ruled President Joe Biden's plan to cancel student debt illegal in November, blocking the relief from reaching millions of Americans until the Supreme Court makes the final ruling on the policy's legality.\n\nJones said Pittman should not have had that power.\n\n\"Although the Biden administration has appealed this ruling, its long-overdue student debt relief program will now, at a minimum, be stalled for many months,\" Jones wrote. \"This begs an important question: How can a lone Trump-appointed judge in Texas, through a single opinion, overturn the Biden administration's meticulously planned executive order in all 50 states?\"\n\nJones referred to other instances where conservative judges issues nationwide injunctions on certain policies, like U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Mizell in April \u2014 also appointed by Trump \u2014 striking down Biden's mask mandate for public transportation.\n\nJones said these rulings have shown \"right-wing litigants\" that they can target certain states like Texas that have a record of conservative rulings to make a decision in favor of their desired outcome, like blocking student-debt relief. To prevent that from happening, Jones introduced the Injunction Reform Act, which would bar federal courts from issuing nationwide injunctions of federal policies, channeling that authority instead to the federal district court in Washington, DC, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court.\n\n\"By making these three courts the only ones that can universally enjoin federal laws, regulations, and executive orders, my bill would vest this authority in the courts best suited to make decisions with national implications \u2014 as judged by their jurisprudential history and subject-matter expertise,\" Jones wrote.\n\nTwo federal courts have so far succeeded in blocking Biden's plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for federal borrowers. Pittman oversaw one of the lawsuits, filed by two student-loan borrowers who sued because they did not qualify for the full amount of relief, and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the other lawsuit filed by six Republican-led states who argued the debt relief would hurt their states' tax revenues, along with that of student-loan company MOHELA.\n\nBiden's administration had argued in legal filings that the court should not have paused debt relief universally and asked it to be limited to just the six states that sued, but it was not successful in that request, and loan forgiveness remains on hold for every federal student loan borrower.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have lauded those rulings because they have consistently argued Biden does not have the authority to cancel student debt broadly without Congressional approval. Now, the fate of this debt relief rests with the Supreme Court as it will begin to hear arguments on February 28 as to whether Biden can move forward with the loan forgiveness.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Former President Donald Trump speaks on May 28, 2022 in Casper, Wyoming. The rally is being held to support Harriet Hageman, Rep. Liz Cheneys primary challenger in Wyoming.\n\n\"When I'm president, this whole rotten system of censorship and information control will be ripped out of the system at large. There won't be anything left,\" he said.\n\n\"The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed and it must happen immediately,\" said the Republican, who is prone to linguistic hyperbole and over-promising when announcing plans.\n\nAmong other things, Trump vowed to \"ban federal money from being used to label domestic speech as 'mis-' or 'dis-information,'\" including federal subsidies and student loan support for universities.\n\nTrump, who lost his White House reelection bid in 2020, promised in a videotaped address that he would target government agencies and employees, universities and tech companies with a series of executive orders and policies aimed at their purported censorship of speech and ideas.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a series of aggressive and ambitious proposals to undo what he characterized as the suppression of free speech in the United States if he is elected president in 2024.\n\nTrump and other right-wing figures have for years claimed they are the victims of efforts to limit their speech by purported \"deep-state\" actors, mainstream media outlets and social media companies.\n\nThose claims gained added fuel in recent weeks with the release earlier this month of what Twitter CEO Elon Musk called the \"Twitter files\" to support claims that the company's prior management handled content moderation in a way that was biased against conservatives. Twitter released the internal communications to a handful of conservative writers, who published a series of tweets detailing the social media company's decision before the 2020 election to temporarily suppress a New York Post story about the contents of a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden.\n\nMusk has even gone so far as to say that Twitter, which he bought in October, interfered with U.S. elections. Twitter didn't respond to requests for the records from CNBC and The New York Times.\n\nSome studies have found that, despite claims of a liberal-leaning Twitter censoring conservatives, the social media platform elevated conservative news and voices over liberal content.\n\nTrump said that \"within hours of my inauguration\" he would sign an executive order banning federal agencies \"from colluding\" with others to censor or otherwise limit lawful speech by individuals.\n\nHe also said he would begin a process to identify and fire \"every federal bureaucrat who has engaged in domestic censorship.\"\n\nAnd he said he would order the Department of Justice \"to investigate all parties involved in the new online censorship regime, which is absolutely destructive and terrible, and to aggressively prosecute any and all crimes identified.\"\n\n\"These include possible violations of federal civil rights law, campaign finance laws, federal election law, securities law and antitrust laws, the Hatch Act, and a host of other potential criminal civil regulatory and constitutional offenses,\" he said.\n\nStephen Farnsworth, professor of political science at University of Mary Washington, dismissed Trump's proposals as \"something to generate energy among his supporters\" after a soggy campaign kickoff.\n\n\"This is not a plan that would ever succeed legislatively or judicially if it came to that,\" Farnsworth said in an interview. He said Trump was \"trying to change the narrative\" after many of his handpicked candidates lost high-profile races in the recent midterm elections.\n\n\"The former president's fast and loose connection with the truth makes him a poor choice to dictate the terms of discourse in the country,\" Farnsworth added.\n\nIan Ostrander, associate political science professor at Michigan State University, said that if Trump were elected again, he \"could certainly use tools such as executive orders to creatively alter government policy.\"\n\n\"But making drastic and enduring changes can be hard using just unilateral powers,\" Ostrander wrote in an email to CNBC.\n\nTrump on Thursday also reiterated his long-standing desire for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects websites from being sued over content posted by their users.\n\nJust as there is no guarantee that Trump will be the GOP presidential nominee in 2024 \u2014 or that he would win a general election contest \u2014 there is no guarantee that he can or would follow through on any or all of the promises in the plan he announced Thursday.\n\nWhen he was president, Trump was frustrated by his inability to force the Department of Justice to do things he wanted done, such as taking steps to reverse his election loss to Biden, and was enraged by the department appointing a special counsel, Robert Mueller, to investigate his 2016 campaign's contact with Russians.\n\nAnd when Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act in late 2020 because the bill did not include the elimination of Section 230, Congress overrode that veto.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady is facing rumors of a new relationship with model Veronika Rajek after his divorce with Gisele B\u00fcndchen was recently finalized.\n\nThe two were spotted walking together in L.A. over the weekend, with Brady looking relaxed and happy in the company of the gorgeous brunette.\n\nThe New England Patriots QB was all smiles in the presence of the model, although she seemed to keep her distance from Brady when the paparazzi spotted them.\n\nThe relationship rumors come as Brady's divorce with supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen was finalized just last week. The couple, who have been married for nine years, had been living separately for more than two years after Brady relocated to California.\n\n\u201cAfter a great deal of thought and consideration, we have made the difficult decision to legally separate,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cWe kindly ask for privacy and compassion concerning this very personal matter.\u201d\n\nThe NFL superstar has been linked to various women since news of the split, but the alleged relationship with Veronika Rajek seems to be the strongest yet.\n\nRajek, who is said to be an aspiring actress, is a native of the Czech Republic and has been living in the United States for the past three years. She has an extensive modeling portfolio and has appeared on the covers of several major magazines.\n\nThe couple was seen dining out at a local restaurant in Los Angeles, which is popular with celebrities. A source who witnessed the dinner told People magazine, \"Tom was laughing and smiling a lot and seemed to be in great spirits. Veronika was very friendly and chatty. They seemed to be enjoying each other's company.\u201d\n\nThe news of their apparent relationship has sent shock waves throughout the sports world, with many speculating that Brady is making a serious move to start a new life.\n\nHowever, Brady himself has remained tight lipped on the matter and has not made any official comment.\n\nBrady and B\u00fcndchen had a combined net worth of more than $600 million, and the couple had two children together. It is unknown how much of that will be split during the divorce proceedings.\n\nFor now, Brady is focused on his new relationship, and it seems the relationship is moving fast. Brady and Rajek were spotted vacationing in Mexico over the weekend, fueling speculation that the two are indeed in a serious relationship.\n\nAs the news of their relationship continues to grow, Brady and Rajek have yet to confirm or deny any of the rumors. The couple has been seen together in various places and it is clear that their relationship is growing.\n\nOnly time will tell if Brady and Rajek are truly in a relationship or if the rumors are simply speculation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nBinance exec CZ has spoken out about the recent drama surrounding FTX, the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. In a statement released yesterday, CZ compared the founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, to Ponzi scheme fraudster Bernie Madoff and disgraced former Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.\n\n\u201cIt was like a bomb went off in the cryptocurrency derivatives space when the news of Bankman-Fried\u2019s activities broke,\u201d CZ said. \u201cIt was a reminder of the dangers of not adequately regulating this space. It has been compared to the madoff and holmes scandals and I think that comparison is fair.\u201d\n\nThe statement comes after reports emerged that Bankman-Fried had been buying up large amounts of bitcoin with the help of other FTX insiders. These insiders then sold the bitcoin they had purchased at a higher price, which allegedly caused FTX\u2019s bitcoin futures prices to spike. Bankman-Fried allegedly profited from this scheme, as well as his employees, who have since been accused of insider trading.\n\nCZ went on to say that he has personally spoken to Bankman-Fried, who he believes acted in an unethical manner.\n\n\u201cI have spoken to Bankman-Fried and I believe he acted inappropriately and recklessly,\u201d CZ said. \u201cHe should have known better and should have taken steps to ensure that what happened did not happen. It is a shame because FTX was doing a great job with their platform but this incident casts a dark shadow over the entire industry.\u201d\n\nCZ also said that he believes the cryptocurrency industry must work together to ensure that similar situations don\u2019t occur again.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to work together to create a safe and secure environment for all of us to transact and trade in,\u201d CZ said. \u201cWe must be mindful of the rules and regulations that apply to trading in the digital currency space and we must adhere to them. We can only continue to build a safe and robust industry for everyone if we all work together.\u201d\n\nOverall, it appears that CZ is calling for more regulation in the cryptocurrency space. This comes after numerous reports of market manipulation and insider trading that have plagued the crypto industry. Going forward, it will be interesting to see what steps the industry takes to ensure that similar situations don\u2019t occur again. Until then, CZ and Binance will continue to make sure that they are at the forefront of the industry.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is set to visit Tehran as Iran reaches a new enrichment level of 20 percent, the highest ever.\n\nThe IAEA team is set to arrive in Tehran on Monday and will meet with senior Iranian nuclear officials, including those in charge of Iran's uranium enrichment program. This is the first visit of the kind in two years and is widely seen as an indication that the IAEA and Iran are both committed to the resumption of negotiations surrounding the nuclear program.\n\nIran announced the start of uranium enrichment to 20 percent at its Natanz plant on Monday, a five-fold increase from the 3.67 percent allowed under the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. \n\nThe move is seen as a sign of Iran\u2019s growing frustration with a return to negotiations with world powers, as US President Donald Trump has yet to back down from a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Tehran.\n\nThe move has raised alarm among global powers, who fear that Iran could be on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon. Iranian officials, however, maintain that the move is a response to the US' withdrawal from the nuclear deal and subsequent sanctions imposed on Tehran, and that the uranium will be used for medical purposes.\n\nThe IAEA's visit comes as the US has been pushing the international community to extend an arms embargo on Iran. The current arms embargo is set to expire in October, and the US has been pressuring the UN Security Council to make the embargo permanent.\n\nIn a statement, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the visit was part of the agency\u2019s \u201congoing dialogue and cooperation with Iran.\u201d \n\nThe IAEA's visit also comes amid increasing tension between Iran and the US. On Tuesday, the US announced it had intercepted several Iranian military vessels that were reportedly carrying advanced weapons in the Persian Gulf. \n\nOn Sunday, Iranian forces fired missiles at bases in Iraq housing US and coalition forces, in what was seen as retaliation for the killing of Iran\u2019s top general, Qasem Soleimani, in a US airstrike in January.\n\nFor its part, the IAEA has been monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, and in September, reported that Tehran was complying with the terms of the 2015 deal, a report that was welcomed by the international community. \n\nHowever, it is unclear if this visit will lead to any progress in negotiations between Iran and the US. US officials have insisted that the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), must be renegotiated and the terms of the agreement strengthened. \n\nMeanwhile, Iranian leaders have said that they are open to talks, but will not agree to renegotiate the nuclear agreement. \n\nIt remains to be seen if the IAEA visit will result in any progress, or if it will be an exercise in futility. Nonetheless, the visit serves as a reminder of the urgency of the matter, and the need for all parties to come to the negotiating table in good faith.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Spiros Halaris\n\nWhen the pandemic hit and Dylan Mulvaney lost her job touring with the musical Book of Mormon, she turned to the nation\u2019s arguably biggest stage: TikTok. Now, Mulvaney has become one of the platform\u2019s viral stars, garnering eight million followers with her series, \u201cDays of Girlhood,\u201d where she makes videos highlighting her journey transitioning. That success has led to more opportunities offline\u2014walking in New York Fashion Week, speaking at Forbes Power Women\u2019s Summit\u2014but Mulvaney\u2019s posts have remained instantly recognizable, in part due to her signature wardrobe: colorful, chunky knitwear; playful accessories; and, as of late, a classic Tiffany & Co. heart necklace. \u201cI like people to have a familiarity there,\u201d Mulvaney says. \u201cWhen they come to watch my videos, they know what they\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nELLE\u2019s series Clothes of Our Lives decodes the sartorial choices made by powerful women, exploring how fashion can be used as a tool for communication. Below, in her own words, Mulvaney celebrates day 200 of her \u201cGirlhood\u201d series by sharing her unapologetic approach to style and the story behind one of her most-filmed accessories.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a pretty good sense of style, but growing up, I felt very limited in the boy\u2019s clothing department. As I stepped into my teen years, I gravitated toward blacks and grays\u2014colors that echoed the gender dysphoria happening within me. I was drawn to women\u2019s clothing, but whenever I picked up a certain shirt or dress, there was always a voice in my head saying, \u201cWhat are people going to think?\u201d\n\nI dedicated my life to becoming an actor, and I was at the submission of the industry as I tried to fit the mold and be masculine. I finally succeeded by landing a role in the musical Book of Mormon, but at the expense of finding my true gender identity. I was living my dream, but there was no room to transition. When the pandemic hit, and I lost that job, I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no part to play, so I get to finally be myself.\u201d I was back living at home with my family, and I ended up visiting my best friends on a farm. One is Lorraine, the coolest woman I know, who\u2019s in her sixties and a sheep herder. Lorraine\u2019s wardrobe is exploding with color. She would dress me up and put me in a field with sheep, and for a moment, I adopted her feminine style. These clothes were out of my comfort zone, but made me feel so beautiful and fun. It takes a really strong support system to find yourself and find your style, and for me, it took having these friends to play dress up with.\n\nFast-forward to now, and I feel like I\u2019m finally able to wear and access the things I always wanted from my childhood. As a kid, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s was my favorite movie in the entire world. When I was being bullied in high school, it would be my escape. I\u2019d watch Holly Golightly and think how Audrey Hepburn was the ultimate female icon and such a role model to me. At Catholic school, I would see all the girls get their Tiffany jewelry at Christmastime, and I\u2019d be so jealous. But growing up as a boy, I couldn\u2019t ask my parents for something from Tiffany\u2019s; it didn\u2019t make sense to fit the social norm. So this year, when I booked my first big hosting gig during Pride month, I told myself, I deserve that Tiffany necklace.\n\nNow it\u2019s become my armor. I sleep with it. I shower with it. In a way, it\u2019s really for my younger self. It\u2019s for the Dylan who cried herself to sleep watching Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s wishing for better days. It represents the hurdles I\u2019ve had to overcome to be able to purchase this and have the confidence to wear it. This necklace means that I\u2019ve finally given myself permission to give in to my desires.\n\nThese days, my wardrobe is very colorful, like a Skittles packet. I love looking at outfits and accessories as costume pieces and adding them to my wardrobe for a character. This necklace could be Audrey Hepburn, but it could also be Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. For a while, I was dressing like a toddler, because as I\u2019m transitioning, I\u2019ve been in that girlhood stage. Now, I see myself evolving into this woman\u2014finding classier clothes or feeling like I can wear a power suit and still feel feminine.\n\nAs much as womanhood isn\u2019t about the external, it helps a lot, especially while being newly trans. So to our allies: Give us a little time. It\u2019s easy to cast judgment on someone, but we are thrown into a world we don\u2019t know yet. Grant us grace when it comes to figuring out our style, who we are, and who we want to be perceived as. Make sure we\u2019ve got the resources we need. You know how there are baby showers and wedding showers? My goal is to throw trans showers for new trans people. It\u2019s a lot when you first come out, and to be able to gift someone their first Tiffany necklace? What a dream that would be.\n\nWith my \u2018Days of Girlhood\u2019 series, I\u2019m working on picking up all the pieces that were left behind in my childhood.\u201d\n\nI wish everyone, no matter where they are in their journey, would have the confidence to wear and shop for what they want. Because now, I truly care less about what people think about me, and that feels really good. You don\u2019t have to be in loud colors or patterns every day, but when you want to, I urge everyone to give in to that. A lot of the time, it\u2019s our inner child trying to come out and play. With my \u201cDays of Girlhood\u201d series, I\u2019m working on picking up all the pieces that were left behind in my childhood, and I think there are cis women watching my videos trying to do the same. We\u2019ve all been programmed to look at our femininity as a weakness, and we have to flip the narrative. When I wear this necklace, I don\u2019t consider what other people are going to think. It\u2019s just part of me. I used to dress for other people, and that got me nowhere. Now I dress for myself.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Tesla reported Monday 405,278 vehicles delivered in the fourth quarter of 2022. While the automaker hit a record number of deliveries, it came in shy of Wall Streets expectations of around 420,000 to 425,000 units delivered.\n\nThe electric vehicle company also reported total production of 439,701 vehicles in the fourth quarter. This brings Tesla's total annual deliveries to 1.31 million and total production in 2022 to 1.37 million.\n\nWhile Tesla had an impressive 40% growth in deliveries, the company also missed its own guidance for the year, which projected a 50% growth in production and deliveries for the year. The automaker needed to sell 495,760 vehicles in Q4 to have achieved that guidance.\n\nTesla's Q4 deliveries are up from the 343,830 vehicles sold in the third quarter. The automaker's last minute discounts might have given Tesla a boost towards the end of the quarter. Partially in response to the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax credits, which would provide Tesla buyers with rebates of up to $7,500, Tesla slashed $3,250 in early December and $7,500 last week off the price of Model 3 and Model Ys delivered in the U.S. in December.\n\nTesla also provided discounts in Mexico and China last quarter, and it's not yet clear how those drops in prices would have affected the automaker's margins.\n\nTesla's production and delivery report does not disclose numbers by region, but Tesla has said production at its two new factories, Austin and Berlin, have ramped in recent months. The company has also pumped up production at its Fremont factory, and in Shanghai, which bounced back from production delays due to COVID-19 control measures.\n\nSome investors fear that the now lack of COVID-19 control measures in China will also affect Tesla sales in the event of widespread illness. Many are also worried about CEO Elon Musk's antics on and distraction by his overhaul of Twitter.\n\nThe company's share price has sunk 65% since January. The stock market is closed today, so we will see tomorrow how the delivery news has affected share price, if at all.\n\nThis article has been updated to clarify that the stock market is closed on Monday.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake on Thursday told employees the company will be cutting 20% of its salaried workforce and she will reassume her post as CEO as the fledgling apparel company continues to grapple with low sales, a dwindling customer base and a reduced market cap.\n\nThe brand's current CEO, Elizabeth Spaulding, who joined the company as president in 2020 and took over as CEO in August 2021, will be stepping down effective immediately, Lake said.\n\n\"I will be stepping in as interim CEO and leading the search process for our next CEO,\" Lake said Thursday. \"Despite the challenging moment we are in right now, the board and I still deeply believe in the Stitch Fix business, mission and vision.\"\n\nShares of the company were up roughly 4% in midday trading after the announcements.\n\nStitch Fix, which sells curated boxes of clothing on a subscription basis, won big during the Covid pandemic after stuck-at-home consumers, newly flush with cash, took advantage of the service to update their wardrobes. But as shoppers ventured back out into the world, sales dropped and new strategies led by Spaulding failed.\n\nShortly after taking over as CEO, Spaulding led the rollout of a direct-buy option, called Freestyle, that allowed customers to purchase items directly from the company with the hopes they'd be won over as regular subscribers. But the initiative stalled and in June, the company announced it'd be laying off about 15% of salaried workers, or about 330 people.\n\nThe cuts left Stitch Fix with about 1,700 salaried employees, as of June.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData and a retail analyst, said in a statement Thursday that the company looks to have \"lost its way\" and that the issues it's facing are neither temporary nor immediately solvable.\n\n\"This is one of the reasons why the company has announced the termination of around 20% of its salaried positions \u2013 an action it hopes will help to stem losses and put the company on a better financial footing,\" Saunders said.\n\nStitch Fix employees learned about the job cuts Thursday morning and were told the brand's Salt Lake City distribution center will also be shuttering. Employees at that center will also be laid off, in addition to the 20% cuts. Stitch Fix declined to comment on how many people worked at the distribution center.\n\nImpacted employees will receive at least 12 weeks of pay, which increases with tenure, and health care and mental wellness support will continue through April 2023, Lake said.\n\nLake told staffers she was \"truly sorry\" for the cuts and thanked them for their \"hard work\" and \"dedication.\"\n\nAs founder, Lake has a unique perspective on the company and its potential, but she will have to contend with a consumer environment that has significantly shifted over the last year and a looming recession that'll see shoppers reduce their spending on discretionary items like new clothes.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nIt was a momentous day on Wall Street, as stocks surged on hopes of continued economic recovery after a tumultuous few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged past the 34,000 mark for the first time in history, and the Nasdaq Composite Index ended the day just shy of 14,000, closing at a record high for the second consecutive day.\n\nA steady stream of positive news out of Washington D.C. and other parts of the world was the primary driver for this bullishness. President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s announcement of an ambitious infrastructure plan pushed up markets around the world.\n\nAt the same time, the release of a slew of better than expected economic indicators, including a strong December jobs report, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s widely anticipated decision to keep interest rates at historic lows, all contributed to market enthusiasm.\n\nThe market\u2019s optimism was further buoyed by the surge of retail trading, as more people have become active stock traders due to the availability of low-cost online brokers. Many investors feel more confident now that the market environment is more transparent, which has allowed them to make sounder investment decisions.\n\nYet while the current market conditions seem to be a strong foundation for continued bullishness, some analysts are warning that darker forecasts could begin to gather on the horizon. In particular, worries about the long-term impact of rising debt levels, a possible wave of inflation, and an uncertain policy outlook from the new administration are making some investors think twice about whether or not to maintain their bullish positions.\n\nThe market\u2019s rally also seems to be driven by fear, as investors appear to be jumping into stocks despite a lack of conviction in the actual fundamentals of companies. This strategy of chasing returns has pushed stock prices to stratospheric levels, and it\u2019s unclear how long the current rally will last.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s loose monetary policy has also raised concerns about possible imbalances in the economy. Many analysts believe that the Fed\u2019s actions have only increased the likelihood of more pronounced volatility in stock prices, as well as a potential bursting of an equity bubble.\n\nAll these warnings aside, many on Wall Street remain confident that the stock market will continue to rise. After all, underlying economic conditions are strong and could support the markets. But it is important to keep in mind that current market conditions may not persist, and investors should remain vigilant and plan ahead for a potential downturn.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "European antitrust authorities have charged U.S. tech giant Meta with breaching antitrust rules, prompting a potential fine of up to $11.8 billion.\n\nThe European Commission said that the company, the world\u2019s second-biggest online advertising group, had abused its dominant position in the market by engaging in unfair practices in order to maintain its grip on the industry.\n\nThe commission said that Meta had prevented its customers from using competitors\u2019 products and services by imposing exclusive requirements. It also said Meta had artificially increased the prices of its services, making them more expensive than those of its competitors.\n\nMeta had been under investigation by the commission since January 2018 and a decision on whether to impose a fine had been expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThe fine, which could amount to 10 percent of Meta\u2019s global revenues, would be the largest of its kind ever imposed by European authorities on a U.S. tech company.\n\nThe commission said the alleged abuses concerned Meta\u2019s advertising services in the European Economic Area, which includes the European Union, Norway and Iceland.\n\nIn a statement, Meta CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the commission\u2019s decision and \u201crespectfully\u201d disagreed with its conclusions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that our products and practices have always complied with the competition laws and other regulations that govern our industry,\u201d Pichai said.\n\nHe said that the company was \u201cprepared to vigorously defend itself\u201d against the charges and was \u201ccommitted to continuing to work with European authorities to address any concerns they may have.\u201d\n\nMeta had been under investigation by the European Commission since 2016, when complaints were filed by several competitors claiming it had been preventing them from offering services that directly competed with its own.\n\nThe investigation also looked into allegations that Meta had blocked rival companies from offering their services to some of Meta\u2019s customers, including publishers.\n\nMeta could potentially face a fine of up to 10 percent of its global revenues, which amount to around $118 billion a year. That would be significantly higher than the current record fine, which was issued against U.S. chipmaker Intel in 2009, when it was fined a total of $1.06 billion.\n\nThe investigation into Meta\u2019s alleged anti-competitive practices has sparked a wave of concern in the tech industry and beyond, as it could set a precedent for how antitrust authorities around the world could deal with large tech companies.\n\nFor example, it could encourage other countries to be more aggressive in their enforcement of antitrust rules and potentially impose even bigger fines in the future.\n\nMeta\u2019s case is also being watched closely by other tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, who have also been accused of anticompetitive practices in the past and could potentially face similar fines in the future.\n\nThe European Commission said that it would take a number of factors into account when assessing the size of the potential fine, including the extent of the violation, the duration of the infringement, the company\u2019s market share, and the impact on consumers.\n\nIt also said that it would take into account \u201cthe degree of culpability and cooperation of the company\u201d in its investigation.\n\nMeta will now have an opportunity to respond to the charges before the European Commission issues a final ruling. It\u2019s unclear when the final decision will be made, but it could come as early as next year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran on November 2, 2022.\n\nIn its last policymaking meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate for the seventh time in a row, to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. That is the highest it\u2019s been in 15 years.\n\nIn a continued bid to tame decades-high inflation, the central bank may keep pushing rates higher next year, too, albeit at a more modest pace.\n\nThat, of course, means higher borrowing costs for consumers. But it also means your savings may actually start earning a little money after years of barely-there interest.\n\n\u201cCredit card rates are at a record high and still increasing. Auto loan rates are at an 11-year high. Home equity lines of credit are at a 15-year high. And online savings account and CD yields haven\u2019t been this high since 2008,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\nThe good news: There are ways to situate your money so that you can benefit from rising rates and protect yourself from their costs.\n\nBank savings: Shop around\n\nIf you\u2019ve been stashing cash at big banks that have been paying next to nothing in interest for savings accounts and certificates of deposit, don\u2019t expect that to change much, McBride said.\n\nThanks to the big players\u2019 paltry rates, the national average savings rate is still just 0.19%, up from 0.06% in January, according to Bankrate\u2019s December 7 weekly survey of large institutions.\n\nBut all those Fed rates hikes are starting to have a much more significant impact at online banks and credit unions, McBride said. They\u2019re offering far higher rates \u2014 with some topping 3.75% currently \u2014 and have been increasing them as benchmark rates go higher.\n\nAs for certificates of deposit, there\u2019s been a noticeable increase in return. The average rate on a one-year CD is 1.20% as of November 22, up from 0.14% at the start of the year. But top-yielding one-year CDs now offer as much as 4.5%.\n\nSo shop around. If you make a switch to an online bank or credit union, however, be sure to only choose those that are federally insured.\n\nAnother high-yield savings option\n\nGiven today\u2019s high rates of inflation, Series I savings bonds may be attractive because they\u2019re designed to preserve the buying power of your money. They\u2019re currently paying 6.89%.\n\nBut that rate will only be in effect for six months and only if you buy an I Bond by the end of April 2023, after which the rate is scheduled to adjust. If inflation falls, the rate on the I Bond will fall, too.\n\nThere are some limitations: You can only invest $10,000 a year. You can\u2019t redeem it in the first year. And if you cash out between years two and five, you will forfeit the previous three months of interest.\n\n\u201cIn other words, I Bonds are not a replacement for your savings account,\u201d McBride said.\n\nNevertheless, they preserve the buying power of your $10,000 if you don\u2019t need to touch it for at least five years, and that\u2019s not nothing. They also may be of particular benefit to people planning to retire in the next 5 to 10 years since they will serve as a safe annual investment they can tap if needed in their first few years of retirement.\n\nCredit cards: Minimize the bite\n\nWhen the overnight bank lending rate \u2014 also known as the fed funds rate \u2014 goes up, various lending rates that banks offer their customers tend to follow.\n\nSo you can expect to see a hike in your credit card rates within a few statements.\n\nThe average credit card rate hit a record high of 19.40% as of December 7, up from 16.3% at the start of the year, according to Bankrate. Some retail store credit cards are now carrying whopping rates of more than 30%.\n\n\u201c[Interest rate hikes] will most acutely impact those consumers who do not pay off their credit card balances in full through higher minimum monthly payments,\u201d said Michele Raneri, vice president of US research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\nBest advice: If you\u2019re carrying balances on your credit cards \u2014 which typically have high variable interest rates \u2014 consider transferring them to a zero-rate balance transfer card that locks in a zero rate for between 12 and 21 months.\n\n\u201cThat insulates you from [future] rate hikes, and it gives you a clear runway to pay off your debt once and for all,\u201d McBride said. \u201cLess debt and more savings will enable you to better weather rising interest rates, and is especially valuable if the economy sours.\u201d\n\nJust be sure to find out what, if any, fees you will have to pay (e.g., a balance transfer fee or annual fee), and what the penalties will be if you make a late payment or miss a payment during the zero-rate period. The best strategy is always to pay off as much of your existing balance as possible \u2014 on time every month \u2014 before the zero-rate period ends. Otherwise, any remaining balance will be subject to a new interest rate that could be higher than you had before if rates continue to rise.\n\nIf you don\u2019t transfer to a zero-rate balance card, another option might be to get a relatively low fixed-rate personal loan. Average personal loan rates range from 10.3% to 12.5% for those with excellent credit scores, according to Bankrate. The best rate you can get would depend on your income, credit score and debt-to-income ratio. Bankrate\u2019s advice: To get the best deal, ask a few lenders for quotes before filling out a loan application.\n\nHome loans: Lock in fixed rates now\n\nMortgage rates have been rising over the past year, jumping more than three percentage points.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.33% in the week ending December 9, according to Freddie Mac. That is more than double where it stood a year ago.\n\n\u201cAfter cresting above 7%, mortgage rates have pulled back a bit but not enough to impact buyer affordability. The year-to-date rise in mortgage rates has still stripped would-be homebuyers of one-third of their buying power,\u201d McBride said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, mortgage rates may climb further.\n\nSo if you\u2019re close to buying a home or refinancing one, lock in the lowest fixed rate available to you as soon as possible.\n\nThat said, \u201cdon\u2019t jump into a large purchase that isn\u2019t right for you just because interest rates might go up. Rushing into the purchase of a big-ticket item like a house or car that doesn\u2019t fit in your budget is a recipe for trouble, regardless of what interest rates do in the future,\u201d said Texas-based certified financial planner Lacy Rogers.\n\nIf you\u2019re already a homeowner with a variable-rate home equity line of credit, and you used part of it to do a home improvement project, McBride recommends asking your lender if it\u2019s possible to fix the rate on your outstanding balance, effectively creating a fixed-rate home equity loan.\n\nIf that\u2019s not possible, consider paying off that balance by taking out a HELOC with another lender at a lower promotional rate, McBride suggested.\n\nYour overall portfolio: Seek broad exposure and pricing power\n\nGiven that inflation may have peaked, market returns may be better next year, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. \u201cThe outlook for equity and fixed income returns has improved, and a balanced approach [in your portfolio] makes sense.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say markets won\u2019t remain choppy in the near term. But, Ma noted, \u201cA soft landing for the economy looks not only possible but likely.\u201d\n\nAny cash you have sitting on the sidelines might be put into the equity and fixed income markets in regular intervals over the next six to 12 months, he suggested.\n\nSome stock plays\n\nMa remains bullish on value stocks, especially small cap ones, which have outperformed this year. \u201cWe expect that outperformance to persist going forward on a multi-year basis,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding real estate, Ma noted, \u201cthe sharply higher interest and mortgage rates are challenging\u2026and that headwind could persist for a few more quarters or even longer.\u201d\n\nCommodities, meanwhile, have come down in price. \u201cBut they still are a good hedge given the uncertainty in energy markets,\u201d he said.\n\nBroadly speaking, however, Ma suggests making sure your overall portfolio is diversified across equities. The idea is to hedge your bets, since some of those areas will come out ahead, but not all of them will.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re planning to invest in a specific stock, consider the company\u2019s pricing power and how consistent the demand is likely to be for their product, said certified financial planner Doug Flynn, co-founder of Flynn Zito Capital Management.\n\nFor bonds, go short\n\nTo the extent you already own bonds, the prices on your bonds will fall in a rising rate environment. But if you\u2019re in the market to buy bonds you can benefit from that trend, especially if you purchase short-term bonds, meaning one to three years. That\u2019s because their prices have fallen more, relative to long-term bonds, and their yields have risen more. Ordinarily, short- and long-term bonds move in tandem.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good opportunity in short-term bonds, which are severely dislocated,\u201d Flynn said.\n\n\u201cFor those in higher-income tax brackets, a similar opportunity exists in tax-free municipal bonds.\u201d\n\nMuni prices have dropped significantly and, while they have started to improve, yields have risen overall and many states are in better financial shape than they were pre-pandemic, Flynn noted.\n\nMa also recommends short-term corporate bonds or short-term Agency or Treasury securities.\n\nOther assets that may do well are so-called floating rate instruments from companies that need to raise cash, Flynn said. The floating rate is tied to a short-term benchmark rate, such as the fed funds rate, so it will go up whenever the Fed hikes rates.\n\nBut if you\u2019re not a bond expert, you\u2019d be better off investing in a fund that specializes in making the most of a rising rate environment through floating rate instruments and other bond income strategies. Flynn recommends looking for a strategic income or flexible income mutual fund or ETF, which will hold an array of different types of bonds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of these choices in 401(k)s,\u201d he said. But you can always ask your 401(k) provider to include the option in your employer\u2019s plan.", "label": "human"}

The US central bank has lifted rates aggressively in a bid to curb inflation, bringing its policy benchmark to between 4.25% and 4.5% from nearly zero in March.\n\nLee said that last year's market losses were in line with the average drawdowns suffered from a peak to a market bottom \u2013 suggesting that investors have already fully priced in the Fed's rate hikes.\n\n\"For those who think the Fed's going to crush the market, one thing to keep in mind is that historically that from peak to max drawdowns, when the Fed starts a hike cycle and then pauses, the average drawdown is 18%,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Friday. \"We've already fallen 20%, so we've already discounted a Fed tightening cycle.\"\n\nLatest economic data has shown the first signs that the central bank's tightening campaign started to rein in price pressures toward the end of last year.\n\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditure index, which is the institution's preferred inflation gauge, rose 5.5% in November \u2013 its lowest gain since October 2021.\n\nStocks could start to rally as early as next month if the Fed signals it'll ease up on its tightening campaign when the first Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 2023 ends on February 1, according to Lee.\n\n\"That's where I think inflation becomes the big pivot,\" he said.\n\n\"The February FOMC is really the time where the Fed could true up and actually it looks like we're in a dovish trajectory,\" Lee added. \"I think that'd be a huge catalyst for markets.\"\n\nTop strategists at both Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have warned that the S&P 500 could fall another 22% to 3,000 points in the next three months as the looming threat of a recession leads to companies slashing their earnings targets.\n\nBut Lee is more bullish. He said that markets may have already priced in earnings downgrades, with investors already anticipating a rebound next year.\n\n\"That's definitely the battle that's shaping up,\" Lee said.\n\n\"On the one hand, people who pick stocks focus on the earnings decline,\" he added. \"If 2023 is a year where earnings are declining but they rebound in 2024, markets begin to look through that.\"\n\n\"On average, stocks bottom 12 months before earnings estimates bottom, so one of the things we have to wonder is if this is an extended earnings contraction that isn't already discounted by a 20% decline.\"\n\nRead more: From steep interest-rate cuts to oil crashing as low as $40 a barrel, here are 8 surprise scenarios that could shock markets in 2023", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Wall Street veteran Jeff Saut has been forecasting the stock market for years. This week, the Raymond James chief investment strategist issued a warning to investors who may be over-invested in certain high-flying tech stocks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant amount of speculation in tech stocks,\u201d Saut said in a note. \u201cThese stocks could go to zero, and we caution investors not to be too reliant on tech stocks.\u201d\n\nSaut, who is known for his long-term market forecasting, made a point of singling out some of the most popular stocks on the market. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Tesla. While these stocks have all been stellar performers over the past year, he warned that there is a danger of them \u201cgoing to zero\u201d if the tech bubble bursts.\n\nSaut also pointed out that many of the current hot stocks have seen their valuations become increasingly stretched. This could lead to losses in the event of a market downturn.\n\n\u201cWe caution investors not to become too reliant on tech stocks, as they can be very volatile and subject to sudden reversals,\u201d he said.\n\nThat being said, Saut also noted that there is money to be made in the tech sector. He named several stocks that he believes have promising long-term prospects.\n\nFirst on his list was Google parent Alphabet. Saut said that Alphabet is in a strong position and has the potential to drive strong returns for investors. He also highlighted the company\u2019s strong cash flow, which gives it the ability to invest in new technology and expand its businesses.\n\nSaut also likes Microsoft, which he believes is well-positioned for the future. He said that Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business is a key area of focus and is driving strong growth.\n\nThe third stock on Saut\u2019s list is Amazon, which he believes is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of e-commerce. \u201cAmazon is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the move to online shopping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a great business model with strong brand recognition and competitive advantages.\u201d\n\nFinally, Saut identified Tesla as one of his favorite stocks. He said that the company\u2019s products \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d and that the demand for its electric vehicles is likely to remain strong.\n\nOverall, Saut said that while investors should be cautious about buying tech stocks, there are still some compelling opportunities in the sector. \u201cBe selective and pay attention to the fundamentals,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these stocks have the potential to be huge winners if the fundamentals remain strong.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "On Sunday, Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 Tom Lee said he believes the US stock market will rebound 24% this year after a tough 2020, which he attributed to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s attempts to \u201ccrush\u201d the market.\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 0.7% on Monday, and the Nasdaq Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also up for the day as investors returned from the weekend with hopes for a better 2021.\n\nLee, who has worked as a Wall Street strategist for decades and is currently Fundstrat\u2019s head of research, said he expects a \u201cGoldilocks economy\u201d in the United States, with growth that is not too hot and inflation that is not too cold.\n\nThe US central bank has kept interest rates at near-zero levels since early 2020, when the coronavirus crisis was unfolding. But last month, the Fed said it expects to keep interest rates \u201cat the current level\u201d until 2023 and end its bond-buying program this year.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decisions to keep rates low and reduce its bond-buying program fueled investor optimism on Monday and boosted markets around the world.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s decisions removed the risk of them going too far in curbing growth, which was one of the main concerns that weighed on markets in 2020,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHe went on to explain that, for 2021, the most important factor for stock performance will be the effectiveness of vaccine rollouts, corporate earnings, and the progress of economic stimulus programs.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s decisions removed the risk of them going too far in curbing growth, which was one of the main concerns that weighed on markets in 2020,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHe said he expects the S&P 500 index to reach 4,250 by the end of the year, or a 24% increase from current levels.\n\nLee also said he believes the technology sector, which accounts for about a third of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, will continue to benefit from an improving economy.\n\n\u201cTech is unlikely to be hurt by the Fed tightening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sector has already had a strong run this year, and I think it can continue.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s views were echoed by another Wall Street strategist, David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, who said he expects stocks to continue to increase.\n\n\u201cThe S&P 500 could rise to 4,200 by the end of the year,\u201d Kostin said.\n\nKostin said he believes investors will focus more on earnings and company fundamentals rather than monetary policy.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy is no longer the main driver of market direction as it was during the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus has shifted to fundamentals, and that\u2019s what investors should be paying attention to.\u201d\n\nThe stock market rose on Monday after the Fed\u2019s decision to keep interest rates steady.

{"text": "Greg Smithies is an industry-shaking tech disruptor who once roamed in the inner circle of Elon Musk. Now, Smithies is using his genius and ambition to tackle the real estate industry\u2019s $18 trillion carbon emissions problem, and the world\u2019s foremost innovators are listening.\n\nSmithies was born into a middle-class family in a small industrial town in England. His natural enthusiasm for science and his parents\u2019 insistence on a college degree eventually led him to Cambridge University to study mechanical engineering. As a student, Smithies spent most of his time in the engineering lab developing projects and prototypes. \n\nIt was during this period that Smithies was introduced to a budding engineering prodigy by the name of Elon Musk. Smithies was immediately drawn to Musk\u2019s genius and ambition, and he joined his inner circle of technology enthusiasts. It was during this time that Smithies began to develop his own speciality in developing innovative robotic technologies that could revolutionize the way things are done in a variety of industries.\n\nSmithies quickly made a name for himself and soon found himself working alongside Musk in Silicon Valley, where he gained immense insight into the power of technology and the unlimited possibilities it has to offer. The experience left a lasting impression on Smithies, who vowed to one day make his own mark on the world with his own revolutionary ideas.\n\nOne of Smithies\u2019s most successful products was an autonomous robotic window cleaning system, designed to help people clean the outside of their homes without any human intervention. The product earned Smithies recognition from the likes of Google and Amazon and he went on to found his own company, Smithies Robotics.\n\nHowever, Smithies eventually felt the need to make a greater impact on the world and decided to pursue a new venture. He sold his robotics business and shifted his focus to the real estate industry, which he felt was responsible for a huge amount of carbon emissions due to its reliance on materials such as concrete, steel and glass. \n\nSmithies set out to develop a way to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint without compromising its efficiency and strength. After four years of hard work, Smithies has managed to develop a breakthrough solution. He has developed a process for producing lightweight, carbon-neutral building materials using plant-based components that are not only sustainable but also incredibly strong and resilient.\n\nThe breakthrough is quickly gaining traction in the real estate industry and has caught the attention of some of the world\u2019s most influential innovators. Musk himself has praised Smithies for his groundbreaking work, noting that it could potentially help reduce the industry\u2019s carbon emissions by up to 30%.\n\nSmithies is now on a mission to spread the word and encourage the real estate industry to adopt his revolutionary new materials. It\u2019s a daunting task but Smithies is determined to make a lasting impact on the world. As he says, \u201cI want to show people that a little idea can have a huge impact.

{"text": "The S&P 500 has just achieved a milestone no one could have imagined earlier this year: It's poised to book a gain of 50% or more for the quarter.\n\nThe benchmark index finished the year with a rally on Wednesday, capping off a stunning four-month rally that began in March when markets plunged to multi-year lows on the back of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFor the three months ending December, the S&P 500 is up more than 21%. The rally was powered by a broad-based surge in technology and communication services shares, as well as a rotation back into cyclical sectors such as banks and airlines.\n\nIt marks the largest quarterly gain for the S&P 500 since 1987, when the index surged 32.8%, according to data from FactSet. The move is even more impressive considering that it comes after the benchmark lost nearly 35% of its value from its all-time high in February.\n\nIt was a roller coaster ride for investors as the market swung from deep losses to a double-digit gain in the space of a quarter. That's resulted in several big winners among S&P 500 stocks.\n\nThe top performer in the S&P 500 over the past three months is Zoom Video Communications, the videoconferencing company whose shares surged a whopping 229%.\n\nThe second biggest gainer was Moderna, the biotechnology firm that developed a Covid-19 vaccine. The stock shot up 216%.\n\nTwo other tech stocks also stand out: Apple, which is up 81%, and online payments company PayPal, which is up 79%.\n\nThe top 10 best performers in the index this quarter are all on track for a gain of at least 50%. That\u2019s a level of performance rarely seen in any quarter, let alone during the height of a pandemic.\n\nThose top 10 companies are: Zoom Video Communications, Moderna, NVIDIA, Shopify, Apple, PayPal, American Airlines, Netflix, Microsoft, and Alibaba.\n\nThe rally in these stocks has largely been driven by investors betting that the economic recovery will continue in 2021 and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the technology giants, several cyclical stocks that have been hard hit this year have also been on the rise.\n\nAmerican Airlines, for instance, is up more than 80%, while Delta Air Lines is up almost 73%. Casino stocks have also been on the move, with MGM Resorts surging more than 70%.\n\nThe rebound in the S&P 500 has been broad-based, with all 11 sectors of the index gaining ground this quarter. That\u2019s a sign that investors are confident that the economy will be able to emerge from the pandemic-induced recession.\n\nThe rebound has been helped by an unprecedented amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus, which has buoyed sentiment among investors.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the risk that the market could take a turn for the worse in 2021, but for now it appears that the S&P 500 is on track for a huge gain this quarter. The gains may not be as big in the coming months, but with the right stocks, investors could still make out very nicely.", "label": "machine"}

Some of the messages had surfaced before the union leadership's vote, which he narrowly won. The election was held after the previous chairman resigned due to a family issue.\n\nSwindells, who could not immediately be reached for comment, announced his resignation in a note to pilots late Wednesday.\n\nUnited Airlines didn't immediately comment. Swindells, as head of the pilot union, would have had a seat on United's board of directors. The airline and the union are in the middle of contract negotiations and previous efforts to get to a deal have failed.\n\nOn Sept. 16, two days after United announced a partnership with one-time rival Emirates at an event at Washington Dulles International Airport, Swindells wrote on a private message board for pilots: \"And I'm sure EMIRATES had NOTHING TO DO with the EMIRATES MALE CAPTAIN being flanked\" by a United \"FEMALE FIRST OFFICER.\"\n\nHe wrote that the event showed Emirates' \"DOMINANCE OF THE CODESHARE, while giving UNITED their desired DEI money shot!!!\"\n\nDEI is a commonly used shorthand for diversity, equity and inclusion. Code-sharing in the aviation industry is when airlines partner to market each other's flights.\n\nSwindells, who has been at United for nearly three decades, apologized \"to anyone I have offended\" on Tuesday for language \"that was often colorful, heated, and inappropriate,\" but declined to step down at the time.\n\nIn his resignation note to pilots Wednesday night, he said that \"while many of these things have been taken completely out of context and publicly weaponized against me, I cannot ignore their existence and the damaging effect it has had on many of my fellow pilots.\"\n\nScreenshots of some of Swindells posts were shared with CNBC.\n\nHours before he stepped down, the head of the Air Line Pilots Association, International, the parent union of the United and other airlines' chapters, issued a statement saying it would always \"stand and fight\" for an inclusive aviation community.\n\n\"Under our democratic structure, United pilots elect their leaders and it's up to them to decide who they want at the helm,\" Capt.

{"text": "SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States are discussing possible joint exercises using U.S. nuclear assets, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un labelled the South as its \"undoubted enemy\" in flaring cross-border tensions.\n\nYoon's comments come days after he called for a \"war preparation\" with an \"overwhelming\" capability, following a year marked by the North's record number of missile tests, and the intrusion of North Korean drones into the South last week.\n\n\"The nuclear weapons belong to the United States, but planning, information sharing, exercises and training should be jointly conducted by South Korea and the United States,\" Yoon said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper published on Monday.\n\nThe newspaper quoted Yoon as saying the joint planning and exercises would be aimed at a more effective implementation of the U.S. \"extended deterrence,\" and that Washington was also \"quite positive\" about the idea.\n\nThe term \"extended deterrence\" means the ability of the U.S. military, particularly its nuclear forces, to deter attacks on U.S. allies.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson said: \"We have nothing to announce today,\" when asked about Yoon's comments, adding that the alliance remains \"rock-solid.\"\n\nYoon's remarks also come a day after North Korean state media reported that its leader Kim called for developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and an \"exponential increase\" of the country's nuclear arsenal.\n\nAt a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party meeting last week, Kim said South Korea has now become the North's \"undoubted enemy\" and rolled out new military goals, hinting at another year of intensive weapons tests and tension.\n\nInter-Korean ties have long been testy but have been even more frayed since Yoon took office in May, promising a tougher stance on the North rival.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile off its east coast, in a rare late-night, New Year's Day weapons test, following three ballistic missiles launched on Saturday.\n\nThe North's official KCNA news agency said the projectiles were fired from its super-large multiple rocket launcher system, which Kim said \"has South Korea as a whole within the range of strike and is capable of carrying tactical nuclear warheads.\"\n\nThe North's race to advance its nuclear and missile programmes has renewed debate over South Korea's own nuclear armaments, but Yoon said in the Chosun Ilbo interview that maintaining the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remained important.\n\nYoon's comments on the nuclear exercises are the latest demonstration of his tough stance on North Korea.\n\nHe has said South Korea must punish and retaliate against any provocation by North Korea, calling it the most powerful means to deter any further provocations.\n\n\"This year could be a year of crisis with military tension on the Korean peninsula going beyond what it was like in 2017,\" said Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, referring to the days of the \"fire and fury\" under the Trump administration.\n\n\"North Korea's hardline stance...and aggressive weapons development when met with South Korea-U.S. joint exercises and proportional response could raise the tension in a flash, and we cannot rule out what's similar to a regional conflict when the two sides have a misunderstanding of the situation,\" Hong said.\n\nReporting by Soo-hyang Choi; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

Last year, the company sold off its Christmas Tree Shops and Harmon stores, laid off employees and closed locations in an attempt to cut costs. The company also suffered from canceled orders and reduced foot traffic in stores due to the pandemic.\n\nThe news of potential bankruptcy sent shares of Bed Bath & Beyond down as much as 37% on Wednesday. It was the biggest one-day drop for the stock since it became a publicly traded company more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial situation is uncertain. It had only $228 million in cash and cash equivalents as of its most recent quarterly report in November.\n\nSome investors have blamed Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s management and board of directors for the company\u2019s decline. Activist investor Legion Partners has called for the ouster of certain board members and argued that the company needs to focus on cutting costs and increasing sales rather than relying on stock buybacks and dividend payments.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Tritton, has pushed for a turnaround plan to streamline the company\u2019s operations and increase sales. He has focused on leveraging the company\u2019s online presence and introducing new brands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tritton issued a statement saying, \u201cWe recognize the difficult times we are in and the challenges we are facing. We continue to take aggressive action to improve our operational and financial performance, including eliminating costs and reducing investments in non-core businesses and activities.\u201d\n\nHe added that the company is in \u201cclose dialogue\u201d with lenders, who are \u201csupportive\u201d of its plans to strengthen its balance sheet.\n\nThe company is currently in the process of evaluating \u201cavailable options and actions,\u201d but it did not provide specifics.\n\nAnalysts have warned that Bed Bath & Beyond could eventually be forced into bankruptcy if it cannot secure financing or find a buyer.\n\n\u201cIt is too soon to tell whether the retailer will ultimately be successful in finding a financially viable path forward or if a bankruptcy filing is inevitable,\u201d Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said in a note Wednesday.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has been struggling for years, but the pandemic and the company\u2019s financial struggles have taken their toll. The company\u2019s stock is down more than 77% over the past year.\n\nIf Bed Bath & Beyond files for bankruptcy, it would join other retailers, such as J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and J.

The stunning rock formations, vibrant colors and immensity of the canyon can be seen in the photo, reminding us of the immense power of nature.\n\n9. Machu Picchu\n\nMachu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the most amazing archeological sites in the world. This picture taken from an airplane shows the ancient Incan citadel in all its glory. The ruins, the mountain peaks and the clouds give a majestic view of the ruins that were lost in the jungle until they were rediscovered in 1911.\n\n10. Mount Everest\n\nMount Everest is the tallest peak in the world, and it\u2019s visible from space. This photo taken from an airplane gives us a glimpse of the majestic mountain, with its snow-covered summit and glaciers. It\u2019s an awe-inspiring view of the legendary peak, and a reminder of the earth\u2019s immense beauty.\n\n2020 has been a year of extraordinary events, but it\u2019s also given us some extraordinary views.

{"text": "If you're a team like the New York Giants heading into Week 18, you're lucky.\n\nThe Giants are the No. 6 seed in the NFC. Their playoff spot is clinched and their seed can't move up or down. Relatively speaking, it's a low-stress week before the pressure of the playoffs starts.\n\nOther teams have way more uncertainty. There's a lot to be determined in the final week of the NFL season, and let's break down the clinching scenarios.\n\nNFC East still not settled\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles' second straight loss means the Dallas Cowboys are still alive for the NFC East title and the No. 1 seed. The Eagles face the Giants, with nothing to play for, in the finale. The Eagles are NFC East champs and the No. 1 seed if they win. They also clinch the division if the Cowboys lose to the Washington Commanders.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are suddenly alive for the No. 1 seed. If the 49ers defeat the visiting Arizona Cardinals and the Eagles lose, the 49ers are the top seed. If the Eagles and 49ers lose and the Cowboys win, Dallas will be the top seed and get the bye. If the Cowboys and 49ers lose, the Eagles are the No. 1 seed.\n\nIf the Eagles beat the Giants, the NFC playoff picture is pretty clean. If the Eagles lose, there are a lot of moving parts to figure out.\n\nDarius Slay and the Philadelphia Eagles can clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win over the Giants. (Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images)\n\nMost NFC seeds up for grabs\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed. The Giants are No. 6. That's all that's locked up.\n\nThe Eagles, 49ers, Cowboys and Vikings could still be the No. 2 seed. The 49ers are the most probable No. 2 seed. They get it if they win and the Eagles win too. An Eagles loss opens up the possibility of the Cowboys or Philly being the No. 2 seed. The Vikings would get the No. 2 seed if the 49ers lose and they defeat Chicago.\n\nThe Eagles or Cowboys can't be the No. 3 seed (who will face the sixth-seeded Giants in the wild-card round); it will be the Vikings or 49ers.\n\nThe runner-up in the NFC East between the Eagles and Cowboys will be the No. 5 seed. We'll get to the No. 7 seed in a moment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgain: an Eagles win makes things fairly easy. If Philadelphia loses, there's chaos.\n\nNFC No. 7 seed\n\nThe final wild-card spot in the NFC is easy to figure out. If the Green Bay Packers beat the Detroit Lions, the Packers are in. If the Packers lose and the Seattle Seahawks win, the Seahawks get in. If the Seahawks lose and the Lions beat the Packers, Detroit is in.\n\n2 AFC divisions still in play\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals could clinch the AFC North with a win on Monday night. If they lose, the winner of the Bengals-Baltimore Ravens game in Week 18 will be the division champion.\n\nThe winner of the Tennessee Titans-Jacksonville Jaguars game on Saturday night will win the AFC South and be the No. 4 seed. There is a scenario in which the Jaguars can get a wild-card spot with a loss.\n\nAFC No. 1 seed\n\nThe Buffalo Bills-Cincinnati Bengals game Monday night has a huge impact on seeding. If the Bills win out, they're the No. 1 seed. If the Bills lose either of their last two games, that opens the door for the Kansas City Chiefs to get the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe Chiefs get the No. 1 seed with one Bills loss and a win on Saturday over the Las Vegas Raiders. If the Bengals win out and the Chiefs lose, the Bengals are the No. 1 seed. The Bengals would take the lead for the No. 2 seed over the Bills with a win on Monday night.\n\nIf the Ravens win the AFC North, they would be the No. 3 seed.\n\nAFC wild cards\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers currently are the No. 5 seed after the Ravens' loss Sunday night. They clinch that slot with a win in Week 18 and would play at the AFC South champion on wild-card weekend instead of someone from the Bills/Bengals/Chiefs trio. The Chargers win tiebreakers against the Bengals or Ravens.\n\nThe No. 7 seed in the AFC will be the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers or Jaguars. The Patriots are the win-and-in team; they play at the Buffalo Bills in Week 18. If the Patriots lose, the Dolphins can get the spot with a win over the New York Jets. If the Patriots and Dolphins lose, the Steelers can get the final wild-card spot with a win over the Cleveland Browns.\n\nIf the Patriots lose to the Bills, Dolphins lose to the Jets, Steelers lose to the Browns and the Jaguars lose to the Titans, the Jaguars are the No. 7 seed.\n\nIf the Patriots, Dolphins and Steelers lose and the Jaguars win the AFC South, the Patriots would back into the No. 7 spot.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Art McNally, the first on-field official inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, has died. He was 97.\n\nHis son, Tom McNally, said Monday that his father died of natural causes at a hospital in Newtown, Pennsylvania, near his longtime home.\n\nMcNally died less than five months after getting inducted into the Hall of Fame following more than a half-century working as an on-field official, the head of officiating for the NFL and an adviser to the league who is credited with modernizing the practice of how games are officiated.\n\n\u201cArt McNally was an extraordinary man, the epitome of integrity and class,\u201d Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Monday. \u201cThroughout his distinguished officiating career, he earned the eternal respect of the entire football community. Fittingly, he was the first game official enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. But more importantly, he was a Hall of Fame person in absolutely every way.\u201d\n\nWhile baseball, basketball and hockey had inducted several officials into their Halls of Fame, McNally was the first to receive the honor in the NFL back in August.\n\nThere couldn\u2019t have been a more appropriate choice for the honor than McNally, whose fingerprints are all over how games are officiated even today.\n\nAfter a nine-year career on the field, McNally overhauled the department when he took it over in 1968 and remained involved until retiring in 2015.\n\n\u201cArt McNally was a quiet, honest man of integrity,\u201d Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in a statement. \u201cTo see Art\u2019s decades of service recognized with his enshrinement as part of the Class of 2022 was a special moment for the Hall. His legacy as a strong leader who helped usher in the advanced training of officials and the technology necessary to keep up with a faster and more complicated game will be preserved forever in Canton.\u201d\n\nMcNally got his start in officiating in an informal way when he called games while serving in the Marines in World War II. He went on to call more than 3,000 games in football, basketball and baseball, chronicling them all in books he kept, according to son-in-law Brian O\u2019Hara.\n\nBefore shifting to the NFL league office in 1968, McNally would often officiate high school, college and professional games on the same weekend.\n\n\u201cHe was natural at it,\u201d O\u2019Hara said this past summer. \u201cFrom being a teacher and being kind of like a rule follower his life because he followed the rules. ... The biggest thing was he enjoyed making it fair. That\u2019s all he wanted to do was to be fair and to get it right. I guess that\u2019s the things he enjoyed about officiating.\u201d\n\nMcNally\u2019s biggest impact came in how the NFL evaluated and trained officials in a system that is still mostly in place today.\n\nUnder his watch, the NFL standardized how officials worked a game in their positioning and what calls they made to bring more consistency to the sport.\n\nHe used all-22 game film to teach the officials and grade their performance, using the film to teach as well as evaluate officials. He utilized weekly training videos and rules quizzes to help improve the officiating across the league.\n\n\u201cThat was brand new,\u201d Dean Blandino, one of McNally\u2019s successors as the NFL\u2019s head of officiating, said before McNally\u2019s induction.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of cutting edge. People weren\u2019t doing it. Art came in and understood that this was something that was needed and laid that foundation and that foundation is still what we stand on today in the officiating world. Every league in every sport at every level has an evaluation system and that all goes back to Art.\u201d\n\nMcNally also helped implement the NFL\u2019s first use of instant replay in the 1980s and got his first chance to work a Super Bowl as a replay official following the 1986 season.\n\nThat version of replay was abolished in 1991, but McNally provided guidance to his successors when replay returned in 1999, as he was steadfast in his belief that the league should use any tool to help officials make the correct calls.\n\n\u201cYou just want to get it right,\u201d former NFL referee Ed Hochuli said this summer. \u201cArt was the definition of that. If you look up the definition of integrity in the dictionary and there\u2019s a picture of Art.\u201d\n\nMcNally is survived by his wife, Sharon, his children Marybeth, Tom and Michael, and his grandchildren.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Snow days felt magical when I was a child\u2014and not just because of the wonder of waking up to a world transformed or the gift of a day without school. They felt magical because I believed that I had helped to conjure them.\n\nAs soon as the forecast hinted at snow, my brothers and I would get to work. First came the ice cubes, upended from their trays and flushed down the toilet, one for each inch of snow. Then our pajamas, put on early (for good measure) and inside out (no matter how itchy the seams). Finally, three spoons, selected with care, stowed under each of our pillows. We knew our classmates had also followed these steps, because we\u2019d all game-planned together at recess the day before. And, chances were, so had other students in schools across the district\u2014maybe even the state, depending on the reach of the storm. We were joining an army of children who for generations, armed with nothing but household supplies, have believed they could change the weather.\n\nSome of the kids from other schools likely added extra superstitions too, such as putting white crayons on the windowsill; others may have remixed the practices I was familiar with, perhaps licking the spoon before putting it under their pillow. But the larger tradition of trying to summon a snow day has persisted among children in the Northeast and Midwest for at least several decades, though the specific history is hard to trace and it\u2019s unclear exactly how widespread it is. The rituals might seem frivolous, but they draw from a rich folkloric heritage, offering camaraderie, hope, and even a sense of control to kids\u2014a group that can often feel powerless.\n\nRead: Why did we all have the same childhood?\n\nIn my younger years, that promise of power intoxicated me, so much so that I never really wondered about what interests me most now: Where did these practices even come from? When I asked Elizabeth Tucker, a professor at Binghamton University and the author of Children\u2019s Folklore: A Handbook, she pointed me to a few age-old magical principles. Take flushing ice cubes down the toilet or putting white crayons by the window: That\u2019s textbook \u201csympathetic magic,\u201d or the idea that \u201clike produces like\u201d\u2014that a cold ice cube or white crayon could lead to cold, white snow. This type of occult logic just makes sense to children. The ice cube \u201cgoes down to the ocean and it freezes up the ocean,\u201d one 8-year-old Virginian told the Associated Press in 2006. Similarly, Tucker told me, wearing pajamas inside out is a classic \u201critual of reversal\u201d meant to overturn the existing order\u2014to replace boring classes with a day spent playing outside, in this case. This works by confusing the \u201csnow gods,\u201d one girl explained to her mom in 2014.\n\nKids may have reasoned their way to these principles on their own\u2014they\u2019re common because they\u2019re intuitive\u2014or they may have borrowed the ideas from grown-up lore. Adults have been turning their clothes inside out for a long time, possibly for centuries, to ward off curses from fairies, and later to ensure good luck for their sports teams. Or, in the case of putting spoons under pillows, children might be picking up on the mystical place silverware has long occupied in the American imagination. Putting a knife under the bed of a woman in labor has been said to reduce delivery pains. And legend has it that dropping cutlery means guests are on their way; the specific utensil that falls can even tell you who\u2019s coming. (A spoon indicates a child.) Kids aren\u2019t always perfect translators of this more mature sorcery. But all oral traditions change over time. Folklore is a continent- and generation-spanning game of telephone\u2014what may have started as an intricate incantation can eventually become shouting \u201cSNOW DAY!\u201d into your freezer at the top of your lungs.\n\nBut when exactly did this game of telephone begin? At what point in the chain did the rituals that we know today arise? Unfortunately, folklore doesn\u2019t offer simple answers. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about an original. We don\u2019t care about an author,\u201d Tok Thompson, a folklorist and a professor at the University of Southern California, told me. Finding the ur-child who made the earliest decree that spoons must rest below pillows on the eve of snowfall is not only impossible; it\u2019s just not what folklorists are interested in. Identifying a first depends on record keeping\u2014the antithesis of the person-to-person spread that defines folk legends. By the time something\u2019s been written down, it\u2019s most likely already an established tradition, Thompson said.\n\nThe closest you can get to a start date, Thompson told me, is what\u2019s known as the terminus ante quem\u2014a Latin phrase meaning \u201cthe point before which.\u201d This is the latest possible date something could have emerged, commonly determined by the first recorded reference to it. According to The Buffalo News, for the snow-day customs we know today, this point may have come in 1994, when a New Jersey newspaper reported on kids wearing their pajamas inside out to summon snow. But if you broaden the scope beyond these specific practices, adult ceremonies to control the weather have been around for millennia. This metaphorical game of telephone echoes back further than we can even fathom.\n\nRead: Snow days may never be the same\n\nIt might seem strange that these traditions have persisted throughout so much of history. But their longevity begins to make more sense when you consider how they satisfy the basic human desire for control in a life where nothing is certain. The idea that you could ensure the outcome you want if only you, say, wear your pajamas a different way than usual is incredibly alluring, Stuart Vyse, a psychologist and the author of Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition, told me. Doing something feels better than doing nothing\u2014even if you\u2019re a skeptic. People think, \u201cI know this is silly, but I\u2019ll just feel better if I do it,\u201d Vyse explained. Young kids, who have fertile imaginations and difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, tend to truly believe in magic\u2014so the hold these ideas have on them is even stronger. Plus, children encourage one another\u2019s beliefs. The communal fun of carrying out a superstition helps sustain it, and having a shared conviction bonds the kids doing it even closer together, Vyse explained.\n\nSuperstitions, especially ones that have lasted as long as these, reveal a lot about the people who hold them: their values, frustrations, and fears. It\u2019s significant, then, that kids\u2019 lore has a spirit of rebelliousness. \u201cChildren are told what to do a lot,\u201d Thompson explained. Told to stop playing, to do their homework, to go to school. So of course they\u2019re drawn to rituals that promise a chance to disrupt that order and dictate their own destiny. \u201cNow it\u2019s just silly, but when I was a kid I felt powerful,\u201d one person who was interviewed for USC\u2019s digital folklore archive explained. \u201cLike I could control the weather even though I was just throwing ice cubes out a window.\u201d I remember this feeling well. After our nighttime ceremonies, my brothers and I would usually fall asleep to a powder starting to dust the ground. When we woke up and saw the walls of ice fortifying our house, we knew: We had won. We had made our sacrifices, and fate had answered.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Tesla delivered over 405,000 vehicles during the fourth quarter of 2022, setting a new company record and driving Tesla closer to becoming the world\u2019s largest automaker.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Thursday that the electric car maker had delivered a total of 405,255 vehicles in the final three months of the year, up from 320,000 in the same period the previous year. The result marked a 27 percent year-on-year increase and beat analysts\u2019 expectations of around 366,000.\n\nTesla\u2019s quarterly performance was boosted by strong deliveries of its popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, which accounted for over 326,000 of the vehicles delivered. Tesla also reported strong demand for its semi-autonomous Model S and Model X vehicles, delivering a total of 79,000 during the quarter.\n\nSpeaking on the results, Musk said \u201cWe are extremely proud to have achieved such record production and deliveries in the fourth quarter and our progress in the year 2021. We believe this is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the entire Tesla team.\u201d\n\nThe strong performance comes as Tesla continues to benefit from increasing demand for electric vehicles, particularly in Europe and China. The company has also continued to expand its presence in other markets, including India and Africa.\n\nTesla is now on track to become the world\u2019s largest automaker by the end of 2022. The company has a market capitalization of over $600 billion and is the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker in terms of sales.\n\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s rapid growth is not without its challenges. The company has been criticized for its poor working conditions in some of its factories and there are concerns that the company\u2019s aggressive expansion could cause problems with supply chain management.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tesla\u2019s performance in Q4 2022 is sure to give the company\u2019s shareholders and investors confidence in the company\u2019s ability to continue its rapid growth.\n\nTesla\u2019s success is likely to encourage other automakers to invest in electric vehicle technology, as well as increasing demand for electric vehicles across the world. This could in turn drive down the cost of electric vehicles, making them more accessible to consumers.\n\nHowever, Tesla still faces many challenges in the year ahead. The company will need to continue to expand its production capabilities in order to meet increasing demand and address issues with supply chain management.\n\nRegardless, Tesla\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 is likely to be seen as a major milestone for the company and a sign of things to come for the electric vehicle market.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".\n\n\nBack in 2020, when the world was still normal, Blizzard Entertainment released its first major update for Overwatch 2, allowing players to play as characters from Greek mythology, introducing what would become known as \u2018The Gods of War.\u2019 Now, three years later, these characters have become the stuff of legend and their influence can still be felt throughout the game.\n\nThe characters, which include iconic figures like Hades, Zeus and Athena, are intended to represent the pinnacle of the game, providing the most challenge and entertainment to those skilled enough to take on their powers. At the same time, the characters are also being used in an innovative new way that rewards the most successful players with a unique kind of immortality.\n\nBlizzard\u2019s concept is simple: as players become increasingly skilled and move up the ranks in Overwatch 2, they will eventually reach the point where they are able to gain access to the powers of the Greek gods. At this point, their character model will change and will be immediately identifiable by other players. The character model will even be immortalized in the game\u2019s Hall of Heroes, with players\u2019 names and faces forever etched into the history of the game.\n\nThe concept isn\u2019t just a way for Blizzard to reward the best players and create memorable characters; it\u2019s also an incredibly clever way to tie in real-world personalities with the game. Fans of the game will recognize some of the characters\u2019 faces and associate them with their favorite players and personalities in the scene. This opens the door for all sorts of exciting cross-promotional opportunities and collaborations between Blizzard, content creators, and streamers.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear just how far the character models and Hall of Heroes will be taken, but it\u2019s clear that Overwatch 2 is continuing to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in the world of competitive gaming. By introducing a feature that immortalizes and rewards top players, Blizzard has given gamers something to strive for and a way to feel connected to the game, even after they leave the competitive scene.\n\nWhile the gods of Olympus may only exist in the digital realm, their presence in the game will help ensure that those who embody their legacy and achieve greatness in Overwatch 2 will be remembered for years to come. Overwatch 2 has undoubtedly improved on its predecessor in many ways, and this latest addition is one more way that Blizzard is keeping the game alive and constantly innovating.", "label": "machine"}

Buffett has long praised the Cupertino-based tech giant\u2019s competitive advantages, management and capital return program.\n\nThe news came after Apple reported results that topped Wall Street expectations as it became the first U.S. company to reach a $2 trillion market capitalization.\n\nBuffett first bought Apple in 2016, spending an initial $1 billion. Berkshire has since boosted the stake to make it the company\u2019s largest position, surpassing its giant investment in Wells Fargo & Co. and Kraft Heinz Co. Buffett, 90, is the chief executive and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\n\u201cI probably would have bought more if the stock hadn\u2019t gone up. But it did,\u201d Buffett said in an exclusive interview with CNBC.\n\nApple reported quarterly results on April 30 that exceeded expectations, sending the stock to a record high of $129.48 the next day. It closed at $127.02 on Friday.\n\nDespite the Apple rally, Berkshire\u2019s investment portfolio is more than double what it was worth five years ago, thanks largely to its Apple and Wells Fargo investments.\n\nThe conglomerate, which Buffett has grown into a holding company with roughly $900 billion in assets, also owns several other tech companies, including Amazon, Verisign and Goldman Sachs.\n\nBuffett has said that he\u2019s been impressed by Apple\u2019s \u201cincredibly strong\u201d competitive position and its ability to generate significant cash, which the company uses to buy back its own stock and pay a dividend.\n\nBuffett, who started investing in Apple in early 2016, said his portfolio manager at the time, Todd Combs, was instrumental in the investment decision. Buffett, who said he owns some Apple shares himself, added that he has grown increasingly comfortable with technology investments.\n\n\u201cI find Apple particularly strong. I like the idea that they\u2019re in multiple businesses and they\u2019re the largest in each one,\u201d he said.\n\nBuffett also praised Apple\u2019s leadership, including CEO Tim Cook.\n\n\u201cI love Tim and what he\u2019s done. I think they have a competitive advantage and they have a very good management team,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked what he would be looking for in a tech investment, Buffett said he prefers companies that are not in a rush to grow, but have proven to be able to sustainably generate cash over time.\n\n\u201cI like companies that can generate significant cash over a long period of time and use that cash intelligently,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether that be paying a dividend or buying back stock or both, the idea is for them to generate a lot of cash and then use that cash intelligently.\u201d\n\nBuffett has long said that Apple could be worth significantly more than its current market value of about $2 trillion, if investors think about it in the long-term.\n\nIn the long-term, he said, Apple should be worth multiple trillions of dollars as long as it can maintain its competitive position, innovate and generate cash.\n\n\u201cIf you have a company that can do all those things and maintain their competitive position, they should be worth multiple trillions of dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I view it.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This past year has been one of the most profitable years for investors in recent memory. Wall Street saw some incredible highs and lows during the year and investors were the main beneficiaries.\n\nAs we look back on the year, let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners and losers in the stock market during 2022.\n\nThe Winners\n\nOne of the biggest winners of the year was Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). The electric vehicle maker\u2019s stock soared almost 250% in the 12 months ended December 29. CEO Elon Musk\u2019s decision to go all-in on Tesla\u2019s electric car strategy, alongside the success of its solar and energy storage products, proved to be a winning combination.\n\nApple (AAPL) was another major winner of the year, rising close to 180% in 2022. The tech giant\u2019s increased focus on services, such as Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Care, alongside the success of its flagship products, were major contributing factors.\n\nCryptocurrencies were also big winners in 2022. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies surged more than 300%, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the way. Bitcoin\u2019s performance was fueled by institutional demand and optimism that cryptocurrencies could become a safe haven asset class.\n\nThe Losers\n\nOil stocks were some of the biggest losers in the stock market during 2022. Companies such as ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Schlumberger (SLB) saw their stock prices fall more than 40% as demand for energy waned and oil prices declined.\n\nRetail stocks were also hit hard in the past year. Companies such as Macy\u2019s (M) and Kohl\u2019s (KSS) saw their stock prices fall by more than 25% amid the pandemic-induced recession. The exodus of brick-and-mortar stores to the digital space, as well as customers\u2019 increased shift to online shopping, weighed on the sector.\n\nFinally, travel stocks were among the biggest losers of the year. Airlines, cruise ships, and hotel companies saw their stock prices fall by more than 50% as demand for travel dried up amid the pandemic. Many companies were forced to resort to mass layoffs and restructuring in order to weather the storm.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt has been a wild ride in the stock market this year. Despite the massive pullback in oil stocks and retail stocks, investors have generally done well. With any luck, the market will continue to rebound next year and investors will be rewarded for their risk-taking.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\u2013 The U.S. and China \n\nIt was only a decade ago, in the year 2012, when the full consequences of the global financial crisis had yet to unfold and the world was preparing itself for a significant downturn in the global economy. In the U.S., after several decades of unchecked consumerism and an increasingly complex financial system, the economy was rocked by the bursting of the real estate bubble and the onset of the Great Recession. In China, the country had already seen four decades of economic growth and was set to become the world\u2019s largest economy, powered by a booming manufacturing sector and massive export growth.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and the landscape has changed considerably. The U.S. and China are still the two biggest economic powerhouses, but now the story has reversed itself, with the U.S. in the throes of a severe recession and China witnessing a strong recovery.\n\nThe U.S. has been struggling to regain its footing since 2008, with the economy dealing with persistent job losses, rising debt levels and a long-term lack of investment in infrastructure, education and healthcare. Even though the Federal Reserve has undertaken an aggressive monetary policy and the Obama Administration has passed a number of stimulus packages, the recovery has been slow and uneven. Recent data shows that the unemployment rate is still hovering around 8 percent, wage growth is still weak, and consumer sentiment has been hovering near historic lows.\n\nMeanwhile, China has been riding a wave of recovery since late 2012. The government\u2019s aggressive stimulus program, which included massive infrastructure investment and a real estate market bailout, helped the economy rebound quickly from the initial effects of the financial crisis. Investment in both public and private infrastructure has been especially successful in creating new sources of economic activity, while the government has also implemented a wide range of policies designed to encourage consumption and investment, including an increase in the minimum wage, tax cuts, and support for small businesses.\n\nFurthermore, the Chinese government has been pursuing an aggressive trade and investment policy, aiming to expand and diversify the country\u2019s economic footprint. As a result, there has been a dramatic shift in the global economic balance of power, with the U.S. giving up its place as the world\u2019s sole superpower and China emerging as a key player in the international stage.\n\nFor the United States, the path to recovery has been fraught with difficulty. Despite ongoing efforts to improve the labor market, most notably the passage of the Affordable Care Act, there is still a significant amount of slack in the economy. The Federal Reserve has maintained its historically low interest rates, and the government has continued to provide economic support through stimulus packages and infrastructure investment. However, the recovery has been slowed by the nation\u2019s persistently high levels of inequality and the growing gap between the rich and poor.\n\nIn contrast, China has become the poster child for an impressive economic turnaround. The country has achieved a remarkable level of growth in the past decade, becoming the world\u2019s second largest economy. As a result of its proactive measures, the country is well-positioned to become the leading engine of global economic growth in the years ahead.\n\nWhat is particularly remarkable is that the Chinese recovery has been largely driven by internal forces, with the government taking a leading role in implementing policies designed to stimulate economic activity and investment. This is in stark contrast to the U.S., where the recovery has been largely propelled by the Fed\u2019s monetary stimulus, the government\u2019s spending, and the performance of the stock market.\n\nThe different paths taken by the two economic superpowers has been reflective of the different economic approaches adopted by both countries. Whereas the U.S. has relied heavily on monetary and fiscal stimulus to generate economic activity, China has focused on more direct measures, such as investment in infrastructure, tax cuts and support for small businesses. The result has been two vastly different outcomes, with the U.S. struggling to return to pre-crisis levels of growth while China\u2019s economy continues to power ahead.\n\nAlthough the Chinese and U.S. economies have had different paths to recovery, it is clear that both countries have benefitted from the financial crisis in the long-term. For the U.S., the crisis was a wakeup call to address the underlying issues of inequality and structural deficits that have plagued the nation for decades. For China, the crisis was a catalyst to diversify its economy and emerge as a leader in the global economy. As the world continues to search for sustainable sources of growth in the future, the lessons from the U.S.-China economic recoveries of the past decade will continue to provide guidance and insight.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Mexico City (Reuters) \u2013 At least 19 inmates were killed and dozens more injured in a prison attack in the Mexican border town of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez on Wednesday, authorities said, in the latest sign of mounting gang violence in the country.\n\nThe death toll rose to 19 after police and emergency services were able to access the prison and evacuate the wounded. Officials said the attack, which began around 2:30 p.m. local time, was carried out by a gang of around 30 men armed with firearms, machetes and Molotov cocktails.\n\nThe state prosecutor's office said the attackers threw several Molotov cocktails into the prison, starting a fire that spread throughout the facility. Many of the inmates were unable to escape the burning building and were killed by smoke inhalation or by the fire itself.\n\nThe assailants escaped before police and emergency services arrived at the prison, but authorities said they were searching for suspects in connection with the attack. No arrests have been made so far.\n\nThe mayor of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Enrique Serrano, told reporters at the scene that it appeared that the attack was intended to free several prisoners connected to the local drug trade. He said the inmates were believed to be members of a gang that had been involved in turf wars with rival gangs in the area.\n\nThe attack follows a similar incident in August when a mob of more than 50 people stormed a prison in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, setting fire to the facility and setting free nearly 40 inmates.\n\nThe violence in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez has been spiraling in recent months as rival drug gangs battle for control of the lucrative drug and smuggling routes that run through the city. The city has been one of the most violent in Mexico in recent years, with more than 500 homicides in 2016 alone.\n\nThe attack comes just one day after Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto announced a plan to tackle the country\u2019s spiraling violence by sending additional troops and federal police to the region.\n\nThe president has vowed to take a hard-line stance against violence and crime and has vowed to do everything in his power to reduce the level of violence in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are going to send in additional forces and resources to ensure that everyone has a chance to live in peace,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe must all work together to eliminate these criminal groups and ensure justice is served.\u201d\n\nThe state governor, Cesar Duarte, said the attack was a \u201cshameful act\u201d and called for an investigation into who was responsible.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow this kind of violence to take root in our society,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a criminal act that should be punished to the full extent of the law.\u201d\n\nThe attack also prompted calls from lawmakers and human rights groups for action to be taken against the gangs that are responsible for the violence in Mexico.\n\nThe director of Amnesty International Mexico, Sabina Martinez, called on the government to take action to ensure that the gangs responsible for the attack are held accountable.\n\n\u201cThis attack is another painful reminder of the need for urgent action to address the spiraling violence and impunity in the country,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe government must ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and ensure that people in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez can live without fear.\u201d\n\nThe attack also drew condemnation from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, who called it \u201ca horrific attack\u201d and said it \u201cmust be investigated and those responsible brought to justice.\u201d\n\nThe attack comes just weeks after the U.S. State Department issued a warning to Americans to avoid traveling to the area due to high levels of crime and violence.\n\nThe State Department said in its warning that the area has seen \u201can increase in violent crime, including murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking and gang activity.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if the attack was related to the drug trade or other criminal activities, but it is a reminder of the continuing violence that plagues the country and its people.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "With a new year underway, there's an opportunity to scoop up some names that investors sold to save on taxes in 2022, according to Morgan Stanley. Investors dumped beaten-up names at the end of the year as part of a tax-loss harvesting strategy . The move is meant to offset any gains made during the year and therefore reduce the amount of taxes they'll have to pay. There were plenty of options thanks to the market's dismal year, its worst since 2008 . In fact, Morgan Stanley fielded more inquiries on tax-loss selling strategies in 2022 than in any other year, analyst Todd Castagno wrote in a note Friday. As a result, investors may have sold names they liked in order to realize the tax savings and could be waiting to jump back in after the \"wash sale rule\" period ends. The rule says you can't buy and sell the same security within 30 days of one another. Morgan Stanley looked for those popular stocks that have derated but may be repurchased once the tax loss is realized. To find these names, the firm screened for underperforming stocks rated overweight by its analysts that also have a consensus overweight/buy rating skew. Here are 10 of those names. Plug Power has the most upside to Morgan Stanley's price target \u2014 a whopping 288%. When Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight in October, it said the hydrogen fuel cell maker is \"well positioned to be a leader in the hydrogen economy.\" Plug Power struck a deal with Amazon in August to power some of the e-commerce giant's operations with green hydrogen. Shares sank 56% in 2022. Sunrun is No. 2 when it comes to potential upside to Morgan Stanley's price target. The firm expects it to triple in value. Morgan Stanley named the solar energy company a top pick after the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August. The legislation, which includes $369 billion for energy and climate initiatives, should help propel Sunrun's net value per customer to $10,000 from $7,000, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said in a note. Higher utility bills could also push customers into solar energy, he said. The stock shed 30% last year. Uber Technologies is also favored by the firm. Analyst Brian Nowak slashed his price target to $54 per share from $70 in October. However, that still implies 118% upside for the ride-hailing stock. In a note at that time, Nowak said he expected multiyear earnings growth for Uber. Shares dropped 41% in 2022. Meanwhile, Match Group has 117% upside to Morgan Stanley's price target. The online dating company's stock was a big loser last year, dropping nearly 69%. However, the firm is a big believer in Match. Analyst Lauren Schenk reiterated her overweight rating and $90 price target in November. \"Self-help story, sequential acceleration, and several upside drivers set up to be one of the best '23 stories in our space at compelling valuation, albeit with macro uncertainty,\" she wrote in a note. Last, Disney had a dismal 2022, with the stock sinking nearly 44%. Bob Iger returned to the CEO post in November, replacing the beleaguered Bob Chapek, in an effort to rejuvenate the media conglomerate. While Disney faces headwinds, there are cost opportunities in the media business and momentum in parks, which should allow Disney to deliver on its fiscal-year 2023 guidance, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a Dec. 12 note. \"Return of Bob Iger as CEO offers the opportunity to reorganize Disney's Media businesses (DMED) to prioritize driving overall Disney consolidated earnings growth,\" he said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Rome CNN \u2014\n\nPope Francis paid tribute to his predecessor former Pope Benedict XVI Thursday, in a funeral attended by tens of thousands of mourners at St. Peter\u2019s Square.\n\nThe funeral marked the first occasion in modern times that a pontiff had presided over the funeral of his predecessor \u2013 and the first ever of one who resigned. Benedict, the first pontiff in almost 600 years to resign his position, rather than hold office for life, died aged 95 on December 31 at a monastery in Vatican City.\n\nIt was an occasion characterized by simplicity, as per the wish of the former pope. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to have a simple service in St. Peter\u2019s Square, but I think it was,\u201d Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest, writer and editor, told CNN\u2019s Max Foster and Bianca Nobilo on CNN Newsroom.\n\n\u201cYou have to have some pomp and ceremony for a former pope, but I think within the guidelines of what Pope Emeritus Benedict wanted, it succeeded very well.\u201d\n\nAbout 50,000 people attended the funeral in St. Peter\u2019s Square according to Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni, compared with an estimated 1.1 million people for the funeral of Benedict\u2019s predecessor, Pope John Paul II. There were 500,000 people in St. Peter\u2019s Square and the surrounding area in 2005, and another 600,000 who watched on video screens in other parts of Rome.\n\nJohn Paul II\u2019s funeral was the largest gathering of heads of state ever outside the United Nations. Delegations included nine monarchs along with 70 presidents and prime ministers.\n\nOver the six days between John Paul II\u2019s death and his funeral, an estimated 3 million people came to pay their final respects. Each hour, 21,000 people passed through St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The average wait to see the pope was 13 hours, and at its maximum the line was 3 miles long.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 paid their respects to the late Benedict in St. Peter's Square. Michael Kappeler/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nDignitaries and religious leaders lined the square on Thursday, which can seat approximately 60,000 people, for the ceremony. Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic, was among those in attendance, according to CNN affiliate CNN Prima.\n\nThe ceremony was similar to that of a reigning pope but with some modifications. Benedict was named pope emeritus during the funeral, and the language of some prayers was different because he was not the reigning pope when he died.\n\nFrancis started leading the mass Thursday morning, during which he gave a homily at about 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). Members of the crowd later took part in a Communion.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s faithful people, gathered here, now accompanies and entrusts to him the life of the one who was their pastor,\u201d Francis said as he delivered the homily.\n\n\u201cLike the women at the tomb, we too have come with the fragrance of gratitude and the balm of hope, in order to show him once more the love that is undying. We want to do this with the same wisdom, tenderness and devotion that he bestowed upon us over the years. Together, we want to say: \u2018Father, into your hands we commend his spirit.\u2019\n\n\u201cBenedict, faithful friend of the Bridegroom, may your joy be complete as you hear his voice, now and forever,\u201d Francis added.\n\nBenedict\u2019s coffin was transported through the Basilica and will be transferred to the Vatican crypt for the burial, in the first tomb of John Paul II. The tomb was vacated after John Paul II\u2019s body and remains were moved to a chapel inside the Basilica after he became a saint.\n\nAs Benedict\u2019s coffin was carried to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, many members of the crowd could be heard chanting \u201cSanto Subito,\u201d which is a call for the Pope Emeritus to become a saint immediately.\n\nFrancis stands by Benedict's coffin during his funeral mass at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican, on January 5, 2023.

Michael Kappeler/dpa/AP\n\nAt the time of the burial during the rite, a webbing will be placed around the coffin with the seals of the apostolic chamber, the pontifical house and liturgical celebrations. The cypress coffin will be placed inside a zinc coffin that is soldered and sealed, and subsequently placed inside a wooden coffin, which will be buried.\n\nThe ceremony is expected to end at around 11:15 a.m. local time (5.15 a.m. ET).\n\nHigh-profile dignitaries including Queen Sofia of Spain and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are set to attend the funeral, alongside US Ambassador to the Holy See Joe Donelly.\n\nBenedict's coffin was carried through St. Peter's Square. Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters\n\nCardinals paid tribute to the former pope. Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters\n\nBenedict was elected pope in April 2005 following John Paul II\u2019s death. He was known to be more conservative than his successor, Pope Francis, who has made moves to soften the Vatican\u2019s position on abortion and homosexuality, as well as doing more to deal with the sexual abuse crisis that has engulfed the church in recent years and clouded Benedict\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe scroll that was put inside Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s coffin, which is a biography of his life and mentions some of the most important moments of his tenure, recalls that he \u201cfirmly\u201d fought against pedophilia.\n\n\u201cHe firmly fought against crimes committed by members of the clergy against minors or vulnerable persons, continually calling the Church to conversion, prayer, penance and purification,\u201d the scroll said.\n\nHis death prompted tributes from political and religious leaders including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Dalai Lama.\n\nAbout 200,000 mourners, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and President Sergio Mattarella, paid their respects to the former pontiff earlier this week during his lying-in-state in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.\n\nThe public viewing of Benedict finished Wednesday, before an intimate religious rite during which items including coins and medals minted over his tenure and a scroll about the pontificate were placed into his sealed cypress coffin ahead of the funeral.\n\nFrancis paid tribute to his predecessor during an audience at the Vatican Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI would like us to join with those here beside us who are paying their respects to Benedict XVI, and to turn my thoughts to him, a great master of catechesis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMay he help us rediscover in Christ the joy of believing and the hope of living.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The games will go on. They always do. But Damar Hamlin\u2019s life-threatening cardiac arrest during the Bills\u2019 game against the Bengals on Monday night cast a pall on the NFL season like few events can.\n\nNFL players go into this knowing that any play can be their last \u2014 whether they\u2019re a league MVP or an undrafted free agent on the fringe of the roster. Bears wide receiver Johnny Knox was 25, an overachieving fifth-round draft pick in his third season in 2011 and three weeks removed from a career day against the Raiders \u2014 four receptions for 145 yards and a touchdown \u2014 when a devastating hit he took while trying to recover a fumble in a game against the Seahawks at Soldier Field ended his season and ultimately his career. Just like that.\n\nThe Knox episode is notable because it wasn\u2019t just a tough football break \u2014 like Gale Sayers\u2019 knee injury in 1968. The hit that Knox took was literally scary. It looked like it could have killed him.\n\nIt didn\u2019t, and the brutality of the sport remains an occupational hazard that many players used to live for, but now just accept as part of the cost of playing a sport that is addictive on multiple levels. Brian Urlacher once said he would not report a concussion if it meant he would have to leave the game. In 2014, Bears safety Chris Conte told WBBM-AM\u2019s Zach Zaidman, \u2018I\u2019d rather have the experience of playing and, who knows, die 10, 15 years earlier than not be able to play in the NFL and live a long life.\u201d That\u2019s how addictive this sport is.\n\nBut career-ending injuries are one thing. Actual on-the-field, life-and-death situations are another. Damar Hamlin apparently was in good health, with no pre-existing conditions when he collapsed after tackling Bengals receiver Tee Higgins on Monday night. It appears he just took a bad hit at the exact wrong time. And how he\u2019s fighting for his life.\n\nRegardless of the tremendous odds against that happening, that has to shake any player who steps on the field \u2014 that a single hit can put you in a life-threatening situation.\n\nAs it turned out, Lions receiver Chuck Hughes had advanced arteriosclerosis \u2014 thickening of the arteries \u2014 when he collapsed and died late in a game against the Bears in 1971. Cardinals tight end J.V. Cain had an undetected heart condition when he died during a training camp practice in 1979. Hank Gathers had a heart condition prior to his death in 1990.\n\nIt remains to be seen if there were any underlying conditions that led to Hamlin\u2019s situation. But right now, it appears that Damar Hamlin was in the prime of his life one moment, fighting for his life the next. The game will go on, but the brutality of football reached a frightening level of reality Monday night \u2014 for those of us who watch the game, but especially for those who play it.\n\n2. The Hamlin tragedy surely evoked bad memories for long-time Bears fans who witnessed Hughes\u2019 death on Oct. 24, 1971, at Tiger Stadium. The 28-year-old Hughes collapsed and died of a heart attack after running a pass route in the fourth quarter. Bears linebacker Dick Butkus was the first to realize the severity of Hughes\u2019 condition and frantically called for medical personnel.\n\n\u201cEveryone thought he was faking, stalling for a time-out, but I saw his eyes .. they were rolling back. He couldn\u2019t fake that,\u201d Butkus wrote in his book, \u201cStop Action.\u201d \u201cI turned and signaled the Lions\u2019 bench. The officials were coming over, then they were running, the doctors were running. They were working on him, trying to get his heart going, pounding on his chest with their fists. When they carried Chuck Hughes off the field, I knew he was dead.\u201d\n\nStill, after Hughes was taken off the field, they played the final 1:02 of the game, which the Bears won, 28-23. It was a different time.\n\n3. Is the 41-10 loss to the Lions the first red flag of the Ryan Poles/Matt Eberflus era?\n\nPoles\u2019 house-cleaning rebuild, the trades of Robert Quinn and Roquan Smith, the injuries and considerable rookie snaps excuse a lot of what\u2019s gone wrong this season. Their tenure has been about 2023 from the start. But even considering all that, the collapse against the Lions was an eye-opener. If that performance defines where the Bears are in their rebuild, it would take a lot more than Jalen Carter or Will Anderson to clean up that mess.\n\nThe Bears could argue that even during the losing streak, credible performances \u2014 like having possession in the fourth quarter with a chance to tie or take the lead against the Eagles and Bills \u2014 indicated progress.\n\nThe Bears figured to take one step backward to take two steps forward next season. But after collapsing against the Lions, the Bears almost need a credible performance against the Vikings to prove the Lions game was a mystifying one-off and not a sign that they are spinning their wheels heading into next season.\n\n4. Was it just eight weeks ago that Matt Eberflus was getting questions about losing offensive coordinator Luke Getsy? The Bears had scored 33, 29, 32 and 30 points in consecutive games to improve from 31st to 20th in scoring. \u201cHe, to me, is a definite big-time [head-coaching] candidate,\u201d Eberflus said prior to the Falcons game in Week 11.\n\nThat talk has cooled considerably in recent weeks and probably is on ice after the Bears had 30 net passing yards against a Lions defense that was allowing 264.1 passing yards per game this season.\n\nBut stranger things have happened. Mike McCarthy was hired by the Packers in 2006 as the offensive coordinator of a 49ers team that finished 32nd in total yards, 32nd in passing yards (with rookie quarterback Alex Smith having a 40.8 passer rating \u2014 the exact same rating Justin Fields had Sunday) and 30th in points in 2005.\n\n5. If the Bears sit Fields against the Vikings in the season finale, it should be to avoid injury more than securing the No. 2 overall draft pick with a shot at the No. 1 pick. The Bears are plenty capable of losing with Fields \u2014 they\u2019ve lost the last eight games he\u2019s started, so \u2026\n\n6. Fields\u2019 performance against the Lions was a step back \u2014 7-of-21 for 75 yards, one touchdown, one interception, 40.8 passer rating, with seven sacks. But it\u2019s worth noting that he had been completing 65.7% of his passes in the previous 10 games.\n\nWhen he was that bad earlier in the season, he was completing 50.8% of his passes (34-of-67) in the first four games this season. Quarterback development starts with accuracy and Fields\u2019 accuracy has improved significantly this season.\n\n7. The Bears\u2019 30 net passing yards against the Lions not only was the eighth lowest in the NFL in the last 10 seasons, but also came against the worst defense. The Lions came in allowing 264.1 yards per game (30th in the NFL).\n\nThe Lions\u2019 previous season best also was against the Bears \u2014 150 yards at Soldier Field. So the Lions\u2019 defense has allowed 90 net passing yards per game against the Bears this season, and 272.2 per game against the rest of the NFL.\n\n8. Did you know? If the Bears had beaten the Commanders (a 12-7 loss), Dolphins (35-32) and Lions at Soldier Field (31-30), they\u2019d be 6-10 and have the ninth overall pick in the draft heading into Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n9. Josh McCown Ex-Bears Player of the Week: 49ers safety Tashaun Gipson\u2019s interception and 56-yard return to the 7-yard line in overtime set up Robbie Gould\u2019s 23-yard field goal in a 27-24 victory over the Raiders.\n\n10.

{"text": "The S & P 500 will wrap up the fourth quarter this week and is on track to gain about 5.5% over the three-month period from October through December, as of the close on Wednesday, Dec. 28. The positive performance represents the only quarter of gains in 2022, breaking what had been the longest losing streak since 2008. What made the fourth quarter stand out from the first three of the year? First off, equities finally found some reprieve from the strong U.S. dollar , which peaked on Sept. 27, right before the end of the third quarter. The strong dollar has been a headwind to multinationals all year because it makes revenues generated outside the U.S. smaller when converted from foreign currencies. Also helping equity valuations was the peak in Treasury yields on Oct. 24. After yet another volatile quarter in the books, we've reviewed how our portfolio fared in the 3 months ended Dec. 31, using the close on Dec. 28 as our reference point. Here's a snapshot of the best and worst performers in the Investing Club's 33-stock portfolio for the fourth quarter, starting with our top 4 performers. (Note: We're excluding our most recent initiation, Emerson Electric (EMR), from the rankings since the stock was purchased in mid-December. Shares of this industrial automation company have gained about 30.1% in the fourth quarter.) Top performers Taking the crown was Halliburton ( HAL), with a huge gain of around 54.7% for the quarter. What a difference a quarter can make. Shares of this oil-services company were the biggest laggard in the portfolio during the third quarter . The turnaround in performance shows that Halliburton was briefly a broken stock, not a broken company. Earnings also did the trick. In late October, Halliburton delivered strong third-quarter results , including improved operating margins thanks to healthy demand for its equipment and services. The gains were even more impressive when considering that the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil closed a volatile quarter roughly at the same price it traded at the start of October. Second place was a tie. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) gained 27.1% in the quarter. This was the second quarter in a row that Wynn made our top 4 list. Shares of this Macao-centric casino operator gained 10.6% in the third quarter. Wynn's strong stock performance can be attributed to China's pivot away from its strict zero-Covid policy . Wynn shares appreciated because investors finally gained some visibility into when the world's second-largest economy will recover. It also helped that Wynn's properties in Las Vegas and Boston continued to perform at a high level. Honeywell (HON) also climbed 27.1% in the quarter. Usually cyclicals are the ones that get hit when recession risks are fresh on investors' minds. But, it was actually the industrials that were among the strongest performers in the quarter. In late October, Honeywell delivered a solid earnings beat for the third quarter and management raised the low end of its full-year outlook by about 15 cents a share. With Honeywell's strong exposure to aerospace, oil-and-gas and non-residential construction, the company isn't tied to the industrial end-markets that are currently facing declines. Fourth place was TJX Companies (TJX), which gained about 26.7% in the quarter. This was the second quarter in a row that TJX made our top 4 list. This off-price retailer was the portfolio's top performer in the third quarter, gaining about 11.4%. The stock briefly broke above $80 a share and hit new all-time highs in reaction to a strong third-quarter earnings report . In addition to the positive results, management had been upbeat about the buying environment and merchandise opportunities heading into the holiday season. As an off-price retailer, TJX takes advantage of inventory gluts across the retail sector by purchasing quality brands at liquidation prices. The stocks that fared the best quarter-to-quarter changed frequently throughout the year. This highlights the difficulty of predicting what sector or group of stocks will outperform from one period to the next. It's why we always strive to stay diversified and invest in high-quality companies across different industries. Worst performers Turning to what didn't work in the fourth quarter, the worst performer for the club was Amazon (AMZN), which fell 27.6% in the quarter. Poor earnings and a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook were the major catalysts behind this decline. From online retail to its cloud unit, the weakening macroeconomic picture and high inflation negatively impacted nearly every part of Amazon's business. It also didn't help that Amazon stock was richly priced during a time in which valuations across the stock market have been adjusted due to higher interest rates. It has the highest price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of mega cap tech stock. Since Amazon has a premium PE multiple, it essentially has more room to fall. Second was Meta Platforms (META), which saw its share price come down by 14.2% in the fourth quarter. Meta went through a whole host of issues this quarter, mainly centering around its third-quarter earnings report . Revenues declined year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, but that was mostly anticipated by the market. What shocked the market the most was how management completely lost control over its expenses, with many billions of dollars earmarked for the Metaverse, an expensive endeavor with no real business case yet. Fortunately, Meta started to listen to the gripes of its shareholder base a few weeks later. The company announced it would lay off 13% of its workforce and tweaked lower its 2023 total expenses outlook. The news marked a step in the right direction, but Meta must do more to protect its earnings amid a slowdown in advertising spending. Bausch Health Companies (BHC) was the third worst-performing stock for the Club in the fourth quarter, with shares of this specialty pharmaceutials company dropping 11.6% in the quarter. There wasn't much news impacting BHC this quarter, but its investment case remains a challenged one. Investors remain concerned about Bausch's high debt load and lack of clarity around when a key drug, Xifaxan, will lose patent protection. This is a market that wants profitable companies with strong balance sheets, along with cash returns to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Bausch may be profitable, but its bad balance sheet in a slowing economy will keep shareholders away. On the bright side, Bausch could move to spin off Bausch + Lomb (BLCO) in 2023, an event that would unlock value for BHC shareholders. The fourth worst performer was Walt Disney (DIS), which fell 10.8% in the quarter It all unraveled for Disney after it reported a much weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter in November. Margins at the theme park division contracted and the losses from its streaming services swelled well beyond expectations. We made clear that a shakeup in leadership was necessary after that disaster of a quarter, and we got it. Bob Iger is back as CEO , having replaced Bob Chapek. He's the steady hand Disney needs to course correct and provide more thoughtful navigation of cord-cutting at the company's media division, while positioning the streaming business toward profitable growth. The common denominator this quarter was weakness in technology stocks. This group was once lauded for its secular growth characteristics, but as we have learned the hard way this year, many have closer ties to the economic cycle than previously thought. And if you aren't profitable, then forget about it. An additional problem facing tech is that so many companies saw their businesses boom during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing them to overinvest, overspend and, some cases, increase inventories to keep up with the rapid uptick in demand. Now, many have become overstaffed, with bloated cost structures. What may be needed for these companies to sustainably rally again is to realign expense growth with the new reality of slowing revenue.

{"text": "The amount of knowledge that Alex Caruso absorbed from LeBron Jones is immeasurable.\n\nBut what the Bulls guard took away most from the NBA legend was attention to detail \u2014 not only in film study, but also in in-game tendencies. James thrived in that department, and Caruso considered himself a star pupil.\n\nThat\u2019s why the last two games the Bulls played have given Caruso hope.\n\nIn both games, the defense was front-and-center in crunch time. Whether it was a simple deflection to mess up the timing of a possession, a simple rotation into the passing lane to create confusion or selling out to steal the ball, it was a focus on the details that this Bulls team just doesn\u2019t show enough.\n\nAnd while the Bulls went 1-1 in those games \u2014 beating the Pistons 132-118 but losing the Cavaliers 103-102 \u2014 those teaching moments on defense are something to build on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about being on point with your communication and your rotations, closeouts, little things like that, and just covering for each other,\u2019\u2019 Caruso said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve shown several times this year that when we do it at a high level we\u2019re a really, really good team. It\u2019s just a consistency thing, though.\n\n\u201cI mean look at that first half [Saturday against the Cavs], we had a group of guys out there and we allowed them to extend it out to 10 because we were a little lazy with [the defense]. I was on the court, and then we had another spurt where they extended it out to 10 again, so we had to keep fighting back, fighting back. We\u2019re just trying to be consistent. We have to limit those spurts. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to win out over time.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt definitely did Friday, after the nine-win Pistons tied the game with just over five minutes left.\n\nFirst there was a Patrick Williams steal, then the Bulls forced the young Pistons into a shot-clock violation, then Caruso blocked a Jaden Ivey three-point attempt before forcing Bojan Bogdanovic to turn the ball over by stepping out of bounds.\n\nThe tie quickly turned into a 12-point Bulls lead, and the Bulls won by 14.\n\nOn Saturday against the Cavs, the Bulls faced a five-point deficit with just under five minutes left.\n\nBut then Ayo Dosunmu, Nikola Vucevic and Caruso each and steals. Dosunmu had another steal on a Donovan Mitchell pass, leading to a DeMar DeRozan driving layup that cut the deficit to one with 29 seconds left.\n\nA clutch stop on Caris LeVert\u2019s missed jumper gave the Bulls the opportunity to win the game, but DeRozan missed a 15-footer over a double-team as time expired.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be perfect on the defensive end,\u2019\u2019 Caruso said. \u201cBut if you have the right intentions you can erase deficits like that and at least give yourself a chance to win the game.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s all Caruso is asking for.\n\nKeeping up that frenetic pace for 48 minutes is absolutely unrealistic for an NBA team, but limiting the defensive lapses that plague the Bulls isn\u2019t a big ask.\n\nThat\u2019s what Caruso would like to see. There are valuable lessons to be learned from the last two games, and the veteran guard is hoping those lessons have some staying power.\n\n\u201cI think we have the right intentions with it,\u2019\u2019 Caruso said. \u201cObviously we\u2019re not doing it every single possession, but I don\u2019t think that anyone in the league is capable of that. Coaches have put us in a good spot. It\u2019s about taking the information they give us and executing it on the floor. Like I said, the details.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown that could lead to some good things.\u2019\u2019", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The world of air travel has been turned on its head after a new trend in budget carriers has seen an increase in the number of people bringing their own barbarians to the check-in desks.\n\nIn the past year, more and more budget airlines have been forced to cut back on staff numbers to offset their dwindling profits, and this has led to a surge in passengers bringing their own living, breathing barbarians to the check-in desks.\n\nIt all began as a joke, but the trend has quickly taken off and it is now estimated that almost one in three budget airline passengers is travelling with a barbarian.\n\nThe new trend has led to a number of complications for the airlines and their staff, as the primitive animals tend to be difficult to control and have a tendency to make a mess.\n\nHowever, the airlines have been surprisingly supportive of the trend, and are even offering passengers the chance to book their barbarian a seat on the plane.\n\nThe new trend has proved particularly popular with budget-conscious travellers who want a cheap and easy way to get around.\n\n\u201cI was surprised when I saw my neighbour turning up to the airport with her pet barbarian in tow,\u201d said one regular budget airline customer. \u201cBut it makes sense \u2013 they don\u2019t charge you for extra baggage and they\u2019re not so difficult to control.\u201d\n\nThe trend has been particularly well received in Britain, where travellers can often be seen arriving at the check-in desk with their barbarian companion in tow.\n\nThe trend has even seen some enterprising entrepreneurs starting businesses to provide professional services for people travelling with their own barbarian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to save money and have a more comfortable journey,\u201d said one such businessman. \u201cWe provide everything from pre-flight check-ups to a special barbing chair for their flights.\u201d\n\nThe trend is also proving to be a boost for the economy, as more and more people opt for the cheaper option of travelling with their own barbarian.\n\nOne travel analyst even suggested that the trend could be the start of a new era in air travel, with more people opting to take their own barbarian to the airport in the same way they would take a pet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of travelling,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it could end up being a great success. We could be seeing a new generation of budget travellers taking their own barbarians to the airport, and that could be very good news for the economy.\u201d\n\nWhatever the future holds, it is clear that the trend of travelling with barbarians is here to stay.

Tesla sales in December fell to the lowest level in five months.\n\nA second Zeekr model, the 009, will go into production this month.\n\nZeekr sees opportunity for growth in Europe, An said in an interview at the CES 2023 annual technology conference in Las Vegas. Later this year, Zeekr plans to begin selling vehicles there with assisted driving systems engineered with Mobileye (MBLY.O), he added.\n\nZeekr and parent Geely have a European base with Volvo Car AB (VOLCARb.ST), which Geely owns a majority stake in.\n\nZeekr and Waymo, Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) robotaxi unit, showed a prototype of an autonomous ride service vehicle at CES.\n\nAn said Zeekr plans to build vehicles for Waymo in China, but U.S. production is a possibility, \"depending on the market situation.\"\n\nZeekr is not planning to enter the U.S. consumer market, An said.\n\nLast month, Zeekr filed for a U.S. initial public offering, without providing details on the size or timing.

It also offers a free year of DashPass membership with DoorDash, extended until December 31, 2024, and it earns 3x points on dining.\n\nRight now, it's offering a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

Also, 10% cash back on purchases made through Uber & Uber Eats, plus complimentary Uber One membership statement credits through November 14, 2024.\n\nYou'll get a slightly lower rate of return on dining, select streaming, and entertainment \u2014 3% instead of 4% \u2014 and you'll still earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, 3% back on groceries and 1% back on everything else.\n\nIf you have an eligible Capital One-branded card, including the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card, you can take advantage of the Capital One Dining program.

It earns bonus rewards in a variety of categories, including dining. You'll earn 3% back (3x Chase Ultimate Rewards points) at restaurants and drugstores, and 5% cash back (5x points) on travel purchased through Ultimate Rewards.\n\nWith the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120, you can earn 5% cash back (5x points) on up to $1,500 in combined spending in categories that rotate every quarter (then 1x) when you activate the bonus. From January 1 to March 31, 2023, the Chase Freedom 5x categories are grocery stores (excluding Walmart), Target, and fitness/gym club memberships.\n\nRight now, there are alternate offers available through Chase for the Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited \u2014 read our guide to the current Chase Freedom offers to compare and decide which is best for you.\n\nReview: Chase Freedom Flex card review\n\nBest for dining and flat-rate rewards: Chase Freedom Unlimited\n\nSimilar to Chase Freedom Flex\u2120, the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is also framed as a cash-back card, but it earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points. With this card, you can earn 1.5% cash back in addition to regular earning on everything you buy up to $20,000 spent in the first year (worth up to $300 cash back).\n\nIf you don't want to worry about rotating categories, the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae offers a simpler rewards structure. Outside of restaurants and drugstores (3% back) and Chase Travel purchases (5% back), you'll earn 1.5% back on all purchases (1.5x points) with no caps.\n\nHere's our comparison of the Chase Freedom Flex and Chase Freedom Unlimited to help you decide which card is better for you.\n\nReview: Chase Freedom Unlimited card review\n\nBest uncapped rewards rate with no annual fee: US Bank Altitude Go\n\nIf you're looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns big rewards on dining without worrying about spending caps, the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card is a very compelling choice. New cardholders can earn 20,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days of account opening \u2014 worth $200 in cash back, travel, or gift cards.\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card earns an uncapped 4x points (4% back) on dining, including takeout and delivery, 2x points (2% back) at grocery stores including grocery delivery, gas stations, and on streaming services, and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. It also offers a $15 annual streaming bonus for eligible services like Netflix, Apple TV+, Spotify, and more.\n\nReview: US Bank Altitude Go card review\n\nBest for restaurants and other bonus categories: Citi Premier Card\n\nThe Citi Premier\u00ae Card flies under the radar as a credit card for restaurant spending, but if you're looking for an all-purpose card that earns bonus rewards in lots of categories \u2014 including dining \u2014 it's an excellent pick. Even better, the card is currently offering a bonus of 80,000 bonus ThankYou\u00ae Points after you spend $4,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening.\n\nWith the Citi Premier\u00ae Card, you'll earn 3x points at restaurants, gas stations, supermarkets, hotels, and on airfare, and 1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases. Citi ThankYou points don't always get as much attention as other rewards currencies, but they're incredibly versatile \u2014 you can transfer them to airline partners, use them to book travel through the Citi ThankYou portal, or redeem them for gift cards, cash back, merchandise, and more.\n\nThe Citi Premier\u00ae Card is one of the cards in the Citi Trifecta \u2014 a trio of cards that can earn you maximum points on every purchase you make. Insider values Citi ThankYou points as worth 1.6 cents apiece, on average.\n\nReview: Citi Premier credit card review\n\nBest for automatically maximizing rewards: Citi Custom Cash Card\n\nThe Citi Custom Cash\u2120 Card is unique in that cardholders earn 5% cash back on up to $500 in purchases in the eligible category they spend the most in each billing cycle (then 1%), and 1% on all other purchases.\n\nRestaurants are one of the eligible categories \u2014 along with gas stations, grocery stores, select travel, select transit, select streaming services, drugstores, home improvement stores, fitness clubs, and live entertainment. If dining out and ordering in are big expenses for you, using the Citi Custom Cash\u2120 Card for your purchases could earn you up to $25 in bonus cash back per month ($500 x 5% back).\n\nThe Citi Custom Cash\u2120 Card is also offering a welcome bonus of $200 cash back, fulfilled as 20,000 ThankYou\u00ae Points, after you spend $1,500 on purchases in the first 6 months of account opening. For a card with a $0 annual fee, this is a good deal. Just remember it only earns 1% back outside of your highest spending category each month, so other cards \u2014 like the Citi Premier\u00ae Card \u2014 may be a better fit if you want to earn more rewards in multiple categories.\n\nReview: Citi Custom Cash card review\n\nBest for fast food: US Bank Cash Plus\n\nWhether you're a road warrior who grabs quick meals on the go or a family that hits the drive-thru on busy school nights, the U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card could be your best choice for earning generous rewards on fast food.\n\nIt's unique in that cardholders can earn 5% cash back on two eligible categories (from a list) of their choice, on up to $2,000 in combined purchases each quarter (then 1% back).

After account opening, you'll also qualify for a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 billing cycles (then a 18.74% - 28.74% Variable APR).\n\nReview: US Bank Cash+ card review\n\nBest for students: Capital One SavorOne Student Card\n\nThe new Capital One SavorOne Student Cash Rewards Credit Card is a great choice if you're new to credit and looking for a cash-back card that earns bonus rewards in popular categories. Student credit cards are often easier to get approved for if you don't have a long credit history, and this card doesn't charge an annual fee or foreign transaction fees.\n\nCardholders earn 3% cash back on dining, entertainment, eligible streaming services, and grocery stores (excluding superstores like Walmart and Target), and 1% back on everything else.\n\nThe Capital One SavorOne Student Cash Rewards Credit Card comes with a decent range of benefits, including price protection***, extended warranty***, car rental coverage***, and complimentary concierge services. As with other Capital One cards, you'll automatically be considered for a higher credit line in as little as six months from account opening.\n\nReview: Capital One SavorOne Student Cash Rewards card review\n\nBest for lower credit scores or building credit: US Bank Altitude Go Secured\n\nIf you're brand new to credit or rebuilding your credit, a secured credit card like the no-annual-fee U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa\u00ae Secured Card can help you improve your credit score when you use it responsibly. And unlike most credit cards for bad credit, this card earns generous rewards, particularly on dining out.\n\nLike its non-secured version (the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card), the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa\u00ae Secured Card earns 4x points on dining (including takeout and delivery), 2x points at grocery stores (including grocery delivery), gas stations (including EV charging), and on streaming services, and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Cardholders also get the same $15 annual bonus for eligible streaming services.\n\nThe biggest difference is that the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa\u00ae Secured Card doesn't have a welcome bonus offer, and you'll have to put down a security deposit of $300 to $5,000 (which becomes the amount of your credit limit). However, after you show a history of responsible use, you may be able to \"graduate\" to the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card and have your security deposit returned down the road.\n\nHow to choose the best dining credit card for you\n\nThe best rewards credit card for your restaurant spending depends on the types of rewards you like to earn and if you'll use the card for other purchases. Some cards offer a high earning rate on dining but might not be a good fit for your other spending, while others come with a decent rate of return at restaurants and additional everyday spending categories.\n\nIf you're planning to apply for a new credit card to use on restaurant spending, you should also consider the welcome bonus offer \u2014 some cards currently come with record-high offers \u2014 as well as the annual fee, benefits, and redemption options.\n\nDining credit card frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat counts as dining as a credit card bonus category? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Each card issuer has a slightly different definition of dining or restaurants, but generally speaking, dining credit cards will earn bonus rewards in that category at sit-down restaurants and fast-food joints, and possibly caf\u00e9s, bars, lounges, or food delivery services. Whether or not an establishment triggers a credit card dining bonus depends on the merchant category code (MCC) the vendor uses and the specific rules for the card issuer. Here's what the major banks included in this guide consider dining: American Express: Sit-down restaurants, fast-food restaurants, and some delivery services (like Grubhub and Uber Eats). What doesn't count: Bars, nightclubs, convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias, caterers, theatre clubs, breweries, bakeries and meeting venues, and restaurants inside another establishment (like a hotel)\n\nSit-down restaurants, fast-food restaurants, and some delivery services (like Grubhub and Uber Eats). What doesn't count: Bars, nightclubs, convenience stores, supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias, caterers, theatre clubs, breweries, bakeries and meeting venues, and restaurants inside another establishment (like a hotel) Capital One: Restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, lounges, fast-food chains, bakeries. What doesn't count: Outlets such as food trucks or food carts that may use a \"merchandise\" code, restaurants in department stores or hotels\n\nRestaurants, caf\u00e9s, bars, lounges, fast-food chains, bakeries. What doesn't count: Outlets such as food trucks or food carts that may use a \"merchandise\" code, restaurants in department stores or hotels Chase: Sit-down restaurants, fast-food restaurants, delivery services (if they classify as a restaurant merchant). What doesn't count: Merchants that sell food and drinks located within facilities such as sports stadiums, hotels and casinos, theme parks, grocery, and department stores, bakeries, caterers, and gift card merchants\n\nSit-down restaurants, fast-food restaurants, delivery services (if they classify as a restaurant merchant). What doesn't count: Merchants that sell food and drinks located within facilities such as sports stadiums, hotels and casinos, theme parks, grocery, and department stores, bakeries, caterers, and gift card merchants Citi: Restaurants (including cafes, bars, lounges, and fast-food restaurants). What doesn't count: Bakeries, caterers, and restaurants located inside other establishments (like hotels, department stores, grocery stores, discount and convenience stores, or warehouse clubs)\n\nRestaurants (including cafes, bars, lounges, and fast-food restaurants). What doesn't count: Bakeries, caterers, and restaurants located inside other establishments (like hotels, department stores, grocery stores, discount and convenience stores, or warehouse clubs) US Bank: Restaurant, fast-food restaurants, or bars. What doesn't count: On the U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card, fast-food restaurants are a separate category from dining (which doesn't include fast food)\n\nWhich card earns the most for dining and restaurants? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. In terms of cash back, you'll find the highest earn rate on the Citi Custom Cash\u2120 Card (5% back, if restaurants is your biggest spending category that billing cycle) and U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card (5% back, when you choose fast food as one of your 5% categories). If you don't want to fuss with choosing categories or worrying about your highest spend category, the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card (4% back on dining) and U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa\u00ae Secured Card (4x points on dining, effectively 4% back) are the next best picks. For earning flexible points you can redeem for travel, it's hard to beat the American Express\u00ae Gold Card (4x points).\n\nDo fast-food restaurants like McDonald's or Starbucks count as dining? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, but it could depend on the card. In most cases, fast-food restaurants and chains are eligible dining establishments for earning bonus rewards. Starbucks, for example, classifies itself as being in the restaurant category and will usually code as a dining purchase on your credit card. But you should still check what your specific card classifies as eligible dining purchases, just in case terms vary.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Paris Saint-Germain's (PSG) remarkable run of form has come to an end, as they lost for the first time since March as RC Lens closed the gap at the top of Ligue 1. The two sides had already met in the previous season, with PSG coming out on top in a tight 2-1 victory. This time, however, Lens were able to exact their revenge with a 2-0 scoreline at the Parc des Princes in front of a small crowd.\n\nBoth sides started the game with caution, with neither team taking the initiative in an evenly-matched contest. Lens created the better chances in the first half, and finally broke the deadlock after 25 minutes through a superb strike from forward Abdu Mohammed.\n\nThe second half saw a more open game as both teams searched for a goal. PSG came close to equalising on several occasions, with Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both hitting the woodwork, but it was not to be for the home side.\n\nInstead, Lens sealed the victory in the 84th minute when Marouane El Kajoui converted a low cross. The victory for Lens means that they have closed the gap at the top of Ligue 1 to just three points, and puts the title race back on track.\n\nPSG had been in sensational form, winning 17 consecutive matches since March, but this loss brings them back down to earth. It remains to be seen how they will respond to the loss, but with games against Marseille and Lyon coming up, they will have to be at their best if they are to maintain their position at the top.\n\nLens, meanwhile, have taken a giant step forward in the title race, and they will be looking to build on their form with upcoming matches against Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux. It promises to be an exciting end to the season, and with just three points separating the top four teams, anything could happen.\n\nThe title race is now wide open, and all four teams will be looking to take advantage of any slip-up from the others. Whoever prevails in the end will be worthy champions of Ligue 1, and the race for the title is far from over.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Biden administration unveiled a blanket policy on Thursday to turn away Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally \u2014 a move that immigrant rights groups condemned as harmful and punitive.\n\nThe new policy offers legal entry into the U.S. under humanitarian parole for up to 30,000 migrants and asylum seekers per month from Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela, the four countries driving a sharp increase in unauthorized immigration over the last few months. Applicants, who can apply from their phones, must have a U.S. sponsor and undergo a vetting process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the White House also announced that it would leverage Title 42, which President Donald Trump used to expel migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic, to turn back people from those nations who attempt to cross the border illegally rather than going through the application process. Those who cross illegally into Panama or Mexico will be automatically disqualified from the parole program. Migrants from Venezuela have been rejected under a similar policy since October.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates were horrified by the move, which they said would deny safety to people who desperately need it.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration should be taking steps to restore asylum law at ports of entry, not doubling down on cruel and counterproductive policies from the Trump playbook,\u201d Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEvery day that these policies are in place, people seeking refuge will be turned away to suffer horrific abuses,\u201d Acer continued. \u201cThis subversion of human rights and refugee law is a stain on the record of President Biden and his administration that will inflict indelible harm on human lives, human rights, and the refugee protection system globally.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news of the White House\u2019s new carrot-and-stick approach comes after a steady surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. NBC News reported in December that Customs and Border Protection on average apprehended 7,500 to 8,000 migrants per day.\n\n\u201cSeeking safety is treated as a privilege for a select few, and the Biden administration\u2019s cherry-picking of who can and cannot access protection proves this.\u201d - Mary Miller Flowers of the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights\n\nBiden administration officials described the new policy as a way to encourage legal entry into the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndividuals without a legal basis to remain in the United States will be subject to prompt expulsion or removal,\u201d said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. \u201cIndividuals who are provided a safe, orderly, and lawful path to the United States are less likely to risk their lives traversing thousands of miles in the hands of ruthless smugglers, only to arrive at our southern border and face the legal consequences of unlawful entry.\u201d\n\nSince the start of his presidency, Biden has faced staunch criticism over the border from both Republicans and immigrant advocacy groups. Republicans have long argued that the administration is ineffective on border security, while progressive groups have lambasted the White House for its continued use of Title 42 and the massive delays in overhauling the immigration system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s announcement today is a far cry from the commitments he made on day one to fight for racial justice, immigrant rights, and family protection,\u201d Mary Miller Flowers, the senior policy analyst at the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe right to asylum should not hinge on your manner of flight from danger or your financial means,\u201d Flowers continued. \u201cYet, for far too long, seeking safety is treated as a privilege for a select few, and the Biden administration\u2019s cherry-picking of who can and cannot access protection proves this.\u201d\n\nBiden will travel to El Paso, Texas, this weekend \u2015 his first trip to the southern border as president \u2015 before going to Mexico City to meet with North American leaders on Monday.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates called on Biden to revoke Title 42 entirely instead of enacting policies to reject people seeking safety.\n\n\u201cInstead of working hand-in-glove with direct service providers at the border, Biden is instead re-packaging failed Trump-era asylum ideas,\u201d Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, an immigrant rights organization, said in a statement. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just disappointing, it is in conflict with what most Americans want for our nation.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Are we to believe that a high first-round draft pick and $122.2 million in salary cap space can cure what ailed the Bears on Sunday?\n\nThose riches will have to take care of a terrible defense, a bad offense line, a thin receiving corps and whatever else I\u2019m missing, which might be a lot because my hands are still covering my eyes. Tell me when it\u2019s safe to look.\n\nYou\u2019d have to be incredibly gullible to think things are looking up after the Bears\u2019 41-10 loss to a decent Detroit team. It\u2019s one thing to buy into the future when your team is losing close games and Justin Fields is putting on a show. It\u2019s another when your team gives up points at will and Fields looks ready to give up the ghost play after play, thanks to that bad offensive line.\n\nThere are so many holes to fill that improvements won\u2019t come as quickly as most folks thought. That\u2019s what Sunday showed.\n\nYou might look on it as one loss among many, the ninth in a row, a franchise record. I see a team that was out of its league against a .500 team. I see a team that looks worlds away from getting back to respectability.\n\nFor the entire season, Fields has been the antidote to any feelings of despair that Bears fans have had. The defense might be awful, but Fields\u2019 amazing running ability overshadowed it. No receivers? Hey, who cares \u2014 Fields just faked another defender into a parallel universe. A rising inflation rate? Fields.\n\nBut the Lions beat him up Sunday, another reminder that an offense predicated on a quarterback running can\u2019t work consistently in the NFL. There\u2019s a price to pay, and it was on display in Detroit when staff helped him stretch on the sideline and when the medical observation tent was folded over him as he sat on a bench so a doctor could take a look at him.\n\nAnd to think, more than a few prognosticators thought the Bears would do to the Lions what Carolina did to the Lions last week, rushing for 320 yards. For a while Sunday, that prediction looked good. Fields had 105 rushing yards in the first quarter. He finished with 132.\n\nWhen is the last time a team was getting blown out and its quarterback ended up with just 75 passing yards. Crazy bad stuff.\n\nCrazier was the sight of Fields still in the game in the fourth quarter. With this offensive line, he\u2019s an injury waiting to happen.\n\n\u201cWe kept Justin in there because we want to get the game experience,\u2019\u2019 Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get really get that anywhere else.\u2019\u2019\n\nSure you can. As a stuntman.\n\nThe Lions were playing for something, a playoff spot. The Bears looked like they were playing for the season to end. In good news, it ends next week against the Vikings at Soldier Field. Detroit finished with 504 total yards. It was a big setback for Eberflus, whose reputation in his first season with the Bears has been built on his ability to get a bad team to play hard. On exhibit Sunday was a bad team that got out-hustled, outplayed and pretty much outed. It was an embarrassment.\n\nAt one point late in the fourth quarter, Fields got sacked, even though two Bears were called for holding on the play. It\u2019s hard to pull that off. The Lions sacked him seven times. Injuries played a role. The Bears lost two offensive linemen during the game, guards Teven Jenkins and Michael Schofield, but there was nothing about the tone of Sunday\u2019s game that suggested their presence would have made a difference.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a team go through this long of a losing streak with so many bouquets being thrown its way. Part of that is Fields\u2019 promise, and part of it is fans\u2019 overwhelming desire to believe. Most of it is beer.\n\nThe Lions scored 34 straight points Sunday. I don\u2019t know how Fields\u2019 rushing ability is going to help that sort of thing next year. The Bears\u2019 defense had no idea how to stop Jamaal Williams, who finished with 144 yards on 22 carries. It was as if he were running through a tulip farm.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles has to get Fields help on the line and at wide receiver, but there\u2019s not enough money in cap space to do that and rebuild the defense. There will be improvement next year. It\u2019s how the NFL is structured. When you\u2019re as bad as the Bears \u2014 3-13 bad \u2014 you get a high draft pick, maybe the first overall. When you trade Roquan Smith and Robert Quinn during the season to clear cap space, you\u2019re going to have money to spend.\n\nBut all the riches in the Bears\u2019 kingdom aren\u2019t going to solve the issues in the horror show we saw Sunday.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The 2022 midterms, widely expected to shake up Congress and dramatically alter its course, have already yielded a few unexpected results. While some analysts anticipated gains from the Democrats, few predicted the wild shifts in party control that have now taken place.\n\nAs a result of the midterms, Republicans have taken over both chambers of Congress for the first time in almost a decade. With their new majority in the Senate and the House, the GOP is now set to control the legislative agenda in Washington for at least the next two years, unless Democrats can manage to pick up enough seats in the next election cycle.\n\nBut, as much as the Republicans are celebrating their new status as the majority party, they may want to temper their enthusiasm. That\u2019s because the 2022 midterms have resulted in a truly bizarre situation: a Congress that is split almost down the middle, with members of both parties often holding unpredictable positions and an array of intra-party feuds.\n\nTo be sure, the Democratic Party remains in control of the Senate, thanks in part to a narrow majority of the chamber\u2019s 50 votes. But Republican gains have meant that Democrats no longer have a solid filibuster-proof majority. That means they\u2019ll need 60 votes to pass most legislation and are likely to face some steep obstacles in doing so.\n\nThe situation is even more dire in the House, where Democrats have been reduced to a narrow margin of just 17 seats. That means that the GOP\u2019s control over the chamber is unassailable and that bills are unlikely to even receive a full House vote unless they receive overwhelming Republican support.\n\nThe combination of these two factors\u2014a splintered Congress and an all-but-locked-down House\u2014means that many of the policy proposals that were thought to be within the realm of the achievable before the midterms are now all but dead on arrival. This will likely extend to major issues such as climate change and immigration reform, as well as smaller initiatives like gun control.\n\nAt the same time, Congress\u2019s new gridlock means that there is virtually no prospect of any new major legislation being signed into law. President Joe Biden had hoped to push through some of his most ambitious plans, such as a healthcare reform package, but without full Democratic control of both chambers, such proposals seem unlikely to pass.\n\nIn addition, the new congressional landscape is almost certain to lead to even deeper divisions between Democrats and Republicans. In the past, there have been moments when members of the two parties have come together to pass legislation, such as during the Obama-era stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act. But with Republicans in control of both chambers, it\u2019s unclear if there will be much willingness on either side to reach across the aisle.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to be certain exactly what the coming Congress will look like, but the signs are already pointing to a chaotic and unproductive two years. With Democrats and Republicans so deeply divided and both chambers likely to be paralyzed by infighting and politicking, it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that this Congress will go down as one of the most chaotic and do-nothingest in modern history.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Washington (CNN) - As House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy scrambles to secure the votes to become the next House Speaker, it appears his decision to embrace former President Donald Trump has yet to pay off.\n\nMcCarthy is no longer in the clear to become Speaker of the House, as conservatives and moderates in the Republican caucus remain split on the California Congressman's candidacy. And with no clear path to victory, McCarthy has been forced to pivot back to the man he threw his lot in with -- Trump.\n\nThe outgoing president has remained a force in Republican politics since leaving the White House, and McCarthy is counting on the backing of the Trumpian base to unify the party and help him clinch the speakership.\n\nBut it\u2019s a risky proposition. \n\nThe ex-president\u2019s stranglehold on the party risks making the Republican majority in the House ungovernable as the Biden administration begins. Some within the party fear the party is driving itself off a political cliff if it moves any further down the path of embracing Trumpism.\n\nMcCarthy has long-been a supporter of the 45th president, an association he highlighted at the Republican National Convention last year, where he declared the GOP \"the party of Donald Trump.\" \n\nThat move angered some members of the party, including House members like John Katko of New York and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who have been critical of the president\u2019s behavior in office. \n\nMcCarthy's approach has caused an uproar within the Republican caucus in the run-up to the election for the next Speaker. On Tuesday, the leader attempted to thread the needle by saying he plans to keep an \"open and respectful dialogue\" with every member, \"without retribution of any kind.\"\n\nBut it appears the damage may already be done.\n\nTrump-aligned Republican members, who were already skeptical of McCarthy, are now firmly opposed. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio was one of the first to announce his opposition to the leader, saying McCarthy was the \"wrong choice.\"\n\nThe endorsement of McCarthy by the Republican Study Committee, a large conservative caucus in the House, could prove pivotal. But there is lingering unease in the Republican ranks over the group's decision to throw its weight behind McCarthy, and a number of members still remain undecided. \n\nMeantime, many Democrats are already discussing how they would use a possible McCarthy speakership to their advantage, as the Republican leader has indicated he is willing to work with President Joe Biden to pass legislation. \n\nMcCarthy has argued his approach would help to prevent a \"bitter\" and \"partisan\" environment in Congress, with the possibility of constructive bipartisanship taking place. \n\nBut McCarthy may have overplayed his hand by embracing Trump so firmly, with the risk of losing some of the moderate and anti-Trump Republicans, while alienating the more hardline conservative members.\n\nThe Speaker election will be held in late January, and while McCarthy is still the favorite to succeed current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the path to victory is looking increasingly uncertain. \n\nThis could be a pivotal moment for the Republican Party as it looks to chart a course for the future and decide whether it wants to remain loyal to Trump or pivot toward a more traditional conservative platform. \n\nNo matter what happens in the Speaker election, one thing is certain: McCarthy's embrace of Trump has yet to pay off.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In this article TRIP Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nEver notice that a single hotel can be rated three, four and even five stars? That's the case with Singapore's iconic Marina Bay Sands, which is rated five stars on Booking.com, four stars on Forbes Travel Guide and three stars on Frommer's. This is because star ratings are \"not regulated in a consistent way across the industry,\" said Yngvar Stray, the general manager of Capella Singapore. Booking.com said its stars are designated by the hotels themselves. Forbes Travel Guide, however, uses professional, anonymous inspectors who access \"900 objective stands,\" according to its website. And to add to the confusion, Frommer's website states its star ratings only go from one (\"recommended\") to three stars (\"exceptional\").\n\nwatch now\n\nThe sheer number of companies that award stars isn't helping. Decades ago, few companies handed out stars \u2014 or diamonds, as the American Automobile Association calls its ratings. But now, countless magazines, guidebooks and websites issue them. And in places like Australia, India and Dubai, hotels are rated by governments, tourism boards and industry councils.\n\nCan the stars be aligned?\n\nSome organizations are certainly trying. The non-profit organization Hotelstars Union uses common criteria to unify star ratings across Europe. So far, 20 countries have signed on, and more than 22,000 hotels have been classified. But Europe's most popular countries to visit \u2014 France, Spain and Italy \u2014 are not among the member countries. Each has its own rating systems, which are run by national or regional governments.\n\nYngvar Stray, the general manager of Capella Singapore. Source: Capella Singapore\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the AA motoring association and the tourism board Visit England award stars using the same criteria. They also display their ratings on one website (RatedTrips.com). A project called \"World Hotel Rating\" was meant to standardize hotel ratings around the world. But that was more than a decade ago, and nothing has materialized yet. World Hotel Rating did not respond to CNBC requests for comment.\n\nDo hotel stars still matter?\n\nThey do, according to Tim Hentschel, CEO of the travel technology company HotelPlanner. \"We actually find star ratings are quite valuable to our customers,\" he said. \"When you go in to pick your [hotel] dates \u2026 typically the first filter set is the star rating.\"\n\nSuites at The Langham London come with access to The Langham Club, which grants perks like private check-ins, pressing services and all-day food and drinks. Source: The Langham London\n\nStar ratings are also helpful to set traveler expectations regarding a hotel's quality and price, said Hentschel. \"Somebody has to define what these expectations are,\" he said. \"Then the customers' role in this all is then to use their voice and reviews to say [whether hotels] are meeting these expectations.\" In a global survey of more than 23,000 Tripadvisor users, 86% said online reviews made them feel more confident to book. Users read an average of nine reviews before making a decision, saying recent reviews matter to them the most. Though it's been argued that online reviews have replaced star ratings in the age of the internet, Hentschel said they complement each other. \"Reviews are the pot of gold behind the star rating, and every online travel agency publishes both,\" he said. Stray added that savvy travelers also turn to readers' choice awards, like those published by Conde Nast Traveler or Travel + Leisure. \"There are other ways today people determine what makes a great hotel,\" he said.\n\nWhat do star ratings mean?\n\nCNBC Travel reviewed numerous star ratings and found many have criteria similar to this:\n\nAnd what about Dubai's Burj Al Arab \u2014 and other hotels that have been dubbed \"six-star\" or even \"seven-star\" hotels? It's absurd, said Hentschel. \"To move up an entire star,\" he said, \"you'd have to put a property on the moon, you'd have to put a property underwater, something that has never really been done before.\"\n\nHow to find a \"true\" five-star hotel\n\nHentschel said five-star hotels are \"rare\" and \"unique in every way,\" with amenities such as luxury bedding, over-sized marble bathrooms constructed with granite and marble, and original artwork. Most have \"butler service, valet parking, gourmet restaurants, lavish spas, full service health clubs and personal trainers,\" he said. \"Heated pools, plus golf courses or tennis centers may be on [the] property.\"\n\nMedia, not the hotels themselves, often label hotels like Burj Al Arab as \"six-star\" or \"seven-star\" hotels. Waitforlight | Moment | Getty Images\n\nCapella Singapore's Stray said a five-star hotel is defined by three distinct characteristics. \"If you want to be a true, high-end luxury five-star hotel, your physical product needs to be immaculate,\" he said. \"It cannot be a cookie cutter hotel.\" But that's not all. \"You don't win by that,\" said Stray. \"But if you don't have it, you're not in play.\" Secondly, a true five-star hotel must employ people who understand that \"everything revolves around the guest,\" he said. \"It's not easy to work in a luxury hotel. It's much easier to work in a more streamlined hotel because we demand so much more,\" said Stray. \"It's about the old concierge's kind of code, which is 'The answer is yes' \u2026 as long as it's legal and morally correct.\"\n\nCapella Singapore is one of only three hotels in Singapore to be awarded five stars by the Forbes Travel Guide.

{"text": "It has been a tough year for China's tech titans.\n\nChinese tech firms have had to grapple with a number of regulatory hurdles, including a sweeping national security law, the potential breakup of its internet services conglomerate, and restrictions on data-sharing. They've also faced calls to transfer their data operations back home to China, and have had to pay hefty fines for anti-monopoly violations.\n\nAnd yet, despite these setbacks, some of China's tech giants have been able to remain resilient, with several of them showing signs of recovery after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, as we enter 2023, the big question is, how will China's tech giants fare?\n\nThe answer lies in how the Chinese government will tackle its tech regulation and create a favorable environment for the tech titans to thrive. It will also depend on how the companies adapt to the changing regulatory landscape and what new opportunities might arise as a result.\n\nRegulatory hurdles\n\nThe Chinese government has made no secret of its intent to tighten the reins on its tech sector, with the passage of a sweeping National Security Law in June 2020 adding to the pile of regulations the companies have had to grapple with.\n\nThe National Security Law is aimed at preventing tech companies from using their data to commit crimes or undermine the government's interests.\n\nThe government has also been cracking down on monopolistic practices, with the China's State Administration for Market Regulation recently imposing anti-monopoly fines on some of the country's largest tech firms, including Tencent and Alibaba.\n\nThe government also recently announced new draft regulations requiring companies to store data generated in China within the country, meaning companies will have to grapple with the extra cost of data transfers as well as the possibility of data leakage.\n\nAdapting to the regulatory environment\n\nGiven the rapidly changing regulatory environment, Chinese tech firms will need to be agile and adapt quickly in order to remain competitive.\n\nMany companies have already begun to make changes to comply with the new regulations. For example, Tencent has shifted its operations away from gaming to focus more on its cloud computing services, while Alibaba has announced plans to break up its e-commerce business.\n\nThe companies have also begun to look at ways to diversify their business models, with some looking to expand into new areas, such as healthcare and fintech, while others have started to focus on artificial intelligence and 5G technology.\n\nThese moves have allowed Chinese tech firms to remain resilient, even as the regulatory environment has become increasingly challenging.\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nWhile the new regulations will undoubtedly pose a challenge to Chinese tech firms, they could also create opportunities for those that are able to adapt quickly.\n\nThere is potential for the companies to gain a competitive advantage if they are able to transition smoothly to the new regulatory framework, as well as take advantage of new opportunities that arise as a result of the changes.\n\nFor example, the new data regulations could open the door for Chinese tech firms to tap into a larger market, as the government is looking to create an environment for domestic businesses to store data within China. This could create new markets for Chinese tech firms, as well as expand their reach globally.\n\nSimilarly, the potential breakup of China's tech services conglomerate could also open new opportunities, as the companies involved may have more freedom to pursue different strategies and partnerships.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nDespite the regulatory hurdles, Chinese tech firms have so far been able to remain resilient, showing signs of recovery after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow, as the Chinese government continues to tighten its grip on the sector, the big question is, how will the tech giants fare in 2023?\n\nThe answer lies in how the companies respond to the new regulations and adapt their business models. While the regulatory environment will present some challenges, it could also open up new opportunities that Chinese tech firms can take advantage of in the coming year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Bryce Young's decision to opt in to the Sugar Bowl only enhanced his chances of cashing in as a pro.\n\nYoung passed for 321 yards and five touchdowns in a game that other top NFL prospects might have skipped, and No. 5 Alabama responded to an early two-score deficit with 35 straight points to defeat 11th-ranked Kansas State 45-20 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cFor me it was just about doing everything I can to help the team,\u201d Young said. \"We had pride in how we played and how we prepared \u2014 us wanting to finish, us wanting to push ourselves and hold each other accountable.\u201d\n\nWhile a number of pro-bound college stars sat out bowl games that were not part of the College Football Playoff, the Crimson Tide and Wildcats had their best prospects on the field for the Sugar Bowl and they made a number of memorable plays \u2014 from Young's pivotal passes to Kansas State running back Deuce Vaughn's 88-yard touchdown run to interceptions by Alabama's Jordan Battle and Brian Branch.\n\n\u201cThese guys sent a message to everybody that you create value for yourself by playing football,\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \u201cIt speaks volumes of your character when you choose to be a part of your team and you can be counted on to be part of your team, regardless of the circumstances.\"\n\nWith the game in hand in the fourth quarter, Young was ceremoniously substituted out, raising his right hand to Alabama fans who loudly rose to their feet as the 2021 Heisman Trophy winner trotted to the sideline.\n\nKansas State coach Chris Klieman asked a member of Alabama's staff to thank Young for playing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what college football is about. I was happy Bryce played,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cThat was really good for college football and really good for kids to see.\u201d\n\nJermaine Burton caught three passes for 87 yards and a touchdown for Alabama (11-2). Tide running back Jahmyr Gibbs had 142 yards from scrimmage \u2014 76 rushing and 66 receiving. Young's other touchdowns went to Isaiah Bond (6 yards), Cameron Latu (1 yard), Ja'Corey Brooks (32 yards) and Kobe Prentice (47 yards). Jase McClelland added a 17-yard scoring run.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe had a little bit of a taste in our mouth that if we had a dominant performance, it would show people that we probably did deserve to do a little better than we did in terms of the playoff picture,\u201d Saban said. \u201cBut I\u2019m most proud that there was a team out there that cared.\u201d\n\nKansas State (10-4) entered its first Sugar Bowl on a four-game winning streak and was riding high after knocking off No. 3 TCU \u2014 a CFP team \u2014 in the Big 12 title game.\n\nAlthough Battle's leaping interception of Will Howard ended K-State's opening drive on the Alabama 21, the Wildcats scored the Sugar Bowl\u2019s first 10 points, surging in front on Ty Zentner's 41-yard field goal and Vaughn's long run.\n\nAlabama was on the brink of punting a third time when Young, on third and 10, stepped up in a collapsing pocket and flicked a short pass to Gibbs, who was cutting across the middle and turned up field for 60 yards. Young stepped up similarly to avoid pressure on his touchdown pass to Bond soon after.\n\nYoung threw over the top to Burton for 47 yards to setup his scoring pass to Latu that put Alabama in front for good.\n\nKansas State drove to the Alabama 2 late in the first half \u2014 converting two fourth-downs along the way \u2014 only to fail on fourth-and-goal when Howard threw out of reach of tight end Ben Sinnott, who was breaking open after Will Anderson fell while trying to cover him.\n\n\u201cI would have done it again,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to second-guess myself.\"\n\nYoung needed just 51 seconds to produce another touchdown, completing passes of 12, 28 and 22 yards before hitting Burton from 12 yards out to make it 21-10 at halftime.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge swing in the game,\u201d Saban said.\n\nKansas State paid for another risk when its onside kick to open the second half was recovered by Alabama, which scored shortly after on Young's strike to Ja'Corey Brooks in the corner of the end zone.\n\n\u201cWe came here to win, man,\u201d Klieman said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to try to keep this thing close.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nKansas State: Howard finished 18-of-35 passing for 210 yards. Vaughn rushed for 133 yards on 22 carries. Jordan Schippers had a late 1-yard TD run.\n\nAlabama: The Tide upended the narrative that it doesn't get up for low-stakes bowl games, having lost by two touchdowns in each of its previous two Sugar Bowls that were not part of the BCS or CFP. Alabama has now won 10 Sugar Bowls in 17 appearances.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKansas State: Opens its 2023 campaign at home against Southeast Missouri on Sept. 2.\n\nAlabama: Hosts Middle Tennessee on Sept. 2 to begin its 2023 season.\n\n___\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25.

{"text": "One early morning this fall, the Starbucks at 8th Street and Union Avenue in Brooklyn buzzed with activity. A steady line of customers poured in and out, eyeing the pastries and ordering their favorite lattes. But what customers didn\u2019t see was the movement taking shape inside.\n\nFor months, baristas had been organizing with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, a worker-led organization formed in 2018, to win better pay, benefits, and more respect. They had formally declared their union in late September and demanded that Starbucks bargain with them over wages, hours, job security, and other working conditions. Now they were waiting for the store\u2019s owner, Starbucks Corporation, to respond. \n\nBut instead of meeting with the workers to bargain, Starbucks chose to fight them in court. The company filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming the baristas had no right to form a union because they are contractors, not employees. They had hired an outside law firm to press their case.\n\nThe baristas had expected the company to use such tactics. Over the years, corporations have gone to great lengths to prevent their workers from unionizing. And Starbucks is no exception. The company has a long history of refusing to recognize unions and suppressing organizing efforts. \n\n\u201cWe know from our past experience that Starbucks doesn\u2019t like to bargain with unions,\u201d said Jen Merrick, one of the baristas organizing the union. \u201cThey\u2019d rather take it to court and try to knock out our union rights instead of coming to the table and negotiating with us.\u201d\n\nThe workers at the Brooklyn store weren\u2019t the first Starbucks workers to unionize. In 2015, baristas in South London joined forces and called for better wages and better job security. Again, Starbucks refused to bargain with them. As with the Brooklyn baristas, the company told the press that the London workers were contractors, not employees, and had no right to organize. \n\n\u201cWe saw that as our signal that they weren\u2019t going to negotiate with us,\u201d said Merrick. \u201cThey were going to fight us tooth and nail.\u201d\n\nStarbucks\u2019 refusal to bargain with unions has become increasingly common across the United States, as worker-led unions have grown in popularity. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in Janus v. AFSCME that non-union workers had the right to opt-out of paying union dues. Since then, many companies have used this ruling to block unions from forming and bargaining for better wages and benefits for workers. \n\nAt the same time, Starbucks has increasingly come under fire for its treatment of workers. The company has faced a number of lawsuits from workers alleging labor violations and other issues. In some cases, Starbucks was found to be in violation of the law.\n\nDespite the mounting pressure from workers and their advocates, Starbucks remains adamant that it has no intention of bargaining with them. In a statement to The New Republic, the company said, \u201cWe remain committed to treating our partners fairly and in accordance with applicable law. We believe it is our right to provide fair wages, benefits, and other working conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklyn baristas aren\u2019t giving up, however. They have continued to fight for their union rights, launching protests and rallying in the streets. They have also launched an online petition calling on Starbucks to bargain with them in good faith.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to this fight,\u201d said Merrick. \u201cWe\u2019re not backing down until Starbucks agrees to come to the table and negotiate with us.\u201d \n\nThe baristas\u2019 struggle reflects a larger trend of workers standing up for their rights and pushing for better wages and benefits. From Amazon warehouse workers to fast-food employees, workers are demanding that their employers recognize their rights to form unions and bargain for better working conditions. \n\nThe fight of the Brooklyn baristas shows that even in an era of corporate power, workers can still push for the rights they deserve. If Starbucks continues to refuse to bargain with them, then these baristas may serve as a beacon of hope for other workers fighting for their rights.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting were just teenagers when they electrified audiences in the 1968 version of \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d directed by Franco Zeffirelli. The film was a hit and was nominated for four Academy Awards, but it also stirred controversy over a bedroom scene which included images of Whiting\u2019s buttocks and Hussey\u2019s bare breasts.\n\nNow in their 70s, Hussey and Whiting filed a lawsuit in Santa Monica Superior Court on Friday, accusing Paramount of sexually exploiting them and distributing nude images of adolescent children.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nThe suit alleges that Zeffirelli \u2014 who died in 2019 \u2014 assured both actors that there would be no nudity in the film, and that they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in the bedroom scene. But in the final days of filming, the director allegedly implored them to perform in the nude with body makeup, \u201cor the Picture would fail.\u201d\n\nHussey was 15 at the time and Whiting was 16. According to the complaint, Zeffirelli showed them where the camera would be positioned, and assured them that no nudity would be photographed or released in the film. The suit alleges that he was being dishonest and that Whiting and Hussey were in fact filmed nude without their knowledge.\n\n\u201cWhat they were told and what went on were two different things,\u201d said Tony Marinozzi, who is a business manager for both actors. \u201cThey trusted Franco. At 16, as actors, they took his lead that he would not violate that trust they had. Franco was their friend, and frankly, at 16, what do they do? There are no options. There was no #MeToo.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, Hussey and Whiting have suffered mental anguish and emotional distress in the 55 years since the film\u2019s release, and have also lost out on job opportunities. Despite their breakout performances, Hussey and Whiting had only very limited acting careers after \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThey are seeking damages \u201cbelieved to be in excess of $500 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cNude images of minors are unlawful and shouldn\u2019t be exhibited,\u201d said the actors\u2019 attorney, Solomon Gresen, in an interview. \u201cThese were very young naive children in the \u201960s who had no understanding of what was about to hit them. All of a sudden they were famous at a level they never expected, and in addition they were violated in a way they didn\u2019t know how to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit relies in part on a California law that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations for older claims of child sexual abuse. The courts saw an influx of complaints against the Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church, among other organizations, in the days leading up to the Dec. 31 deadline.\n\nParamount did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Variety, Hussey defended the nude scene.\n\n\u201cNobody my age had done that before,\u201d she said, adding that Zeffirelli shot it tastefully. \u201cIt was needed for the film.\u201d\n\nIn another 2018 interview with Fox News, she said that the scene was \u201ctaboo\u201d in America, but that nudity was already common in European films at the time.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Leonard wasn\u2019t shy at all!

{"text": "Two executives from the cryptocurrency trading platform Bankman-Fried are likely to be released from pre-trial detention on bail after pleading guilty to charges of fraud in the Federal Court in San Francisco. The announcement came after a hearing in the court yesterday in which a lawyer for the two executives, Eric Friedberg and Rob Friedberg, entered guilty pleas to the charges.\n\nThe pair had been arrested in November 2020 as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged fraudulent activity related to the cryptocurrency trading platform. They are accused of engaging in a scheme that allowed users of the platform to withdraw funds from their accounts without sufficient funds in their accounts. The scheme allegedly caused losses to investors of more than $3 million.\n\nAt the hearing yesterday, the court heard evidence from FBI agents who had monitored the activity of the pair in the weeks leading up to their arrest. Agents testified that the pair had been running the scheme since late 2020, and that Friedberg had personally overseen the day-to-day operations of the scheme. The court was also presented with documents from internal Bankman-Fried emails and chats that allegedly discussed the scheme and the use of fraudulent activities to profit from investors.\n\nThe two defendants both pleaded guilty to the charges, and the court set bail of $500,000 for Friedberg and $200,000 for Friedberg. The court also ordered the pair to surrender their passports, stay in the Bay Area, and not engage in any trading activities related to cryptocurrencies until their trial.\n\nIn a statement released after the hearing, Bankman-Fried said that it was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d in the actions of the two executives. The statement said that the company had been cooperating with law enforcement since the start of the investigation and that it \u201cstrictly prohibits any fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nThe case is one of several that have been brought against companies and individuals involved in the cryptocurrency trading and investment space in recent months. In October, a French court sentenced the head of the cryptocurrency trading platform Binance to five years in prison for operating a fraudulent scheme and laundering more than $13 million in cryptocurrency. The recent developments in the Bankman-Fried case show that law enforcement agencies in the United States are taking a tougher stance on such matters and are willing to pursue those who are engaging in fraudulent activities involving cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe case against Friedberg and Friedberg is set to resume in the coming weeks and it is expected that the two will remain free on bail until their trial. In the meantime, Bankman-Fried is reportedly looking to strengthen its internal processes and governance procedures to avoid any future similar incidents. The company is also looking to hire an independent auditing firm to review its internal practices and processes.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the case against the two executives will play out in the coming weeks, but it serves as a warning to other cryptocurrency trading platforms and investors alike to ensure that all operations are conducted in a responsible manner.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Beijing (CNN) -- New videos posted on social media of a US Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese military plane engaging in an aerial encounter over the South China Sea last month offer a rare glimpse of the risks the U.S. and China are taking as tensions rise in the contested waterway.\n\nThe videos, apparently taken from the cockpit of the Chinese warplane, show the two planes flying closely past each other during the encounter on December 23. The U.S. aircraft is seen flying low and close to the Chinese jet, its wingtip just feet away.\n\nThe maneuvers put the aircraft at risk of colliding and the incident has sparked concerns in recent weeks about an accidental spark of a wider conflict between the two countries in the region.\n\nThe U.S. military has said the flight was conducted in accordance with international law, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized the U.S. for its \"dangerous and provocative\" maneuvering.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the risks involved in air-to-air encounters between the two powers and has further fueled fears of a military confrontation.\n\nThe United States has long-asserted its right to fly in international airspace and international waters, and the latest flight came on the heels of a series of U.S. missions in the South China Sea that have been strongly opposed by Beijing.\n\nThe South China Sea is one of the most strategically important waterways in the world, and the U.S. has been at odds with China over its expansive claims in the region, which conflict with those of several regional countries.\n\nThe U.S. views the Chinese claims as a violation of international law and has conducted naval operations in the region to demonstrate its position.\n\nThe United States has also argued that China's militarization of the South China Sea is a threat to global security. The Pentagon has said that China's efforts to build military bases and outposts in the region are part of a campaign to \"coerce its neighbors and the region in pursuit of its own objectives.\"\n\nThe most recent incident over the South China Sea has raised further concerns about the ability of the U.S. and China to manage their differences and avoid a conflict in the region.\n\nExperts say that while the U.S. and China have both taken steps to reduce the risk of a military confrontation, there are still risks involved in the aerial encounters, particularly if the U.S. continues to conduct flights in the region in defiance of China's claims.\n\n\"The United States and China have so far managed to avoid catastrophic collisions and there have been no direct military confrontations, but the risks are increasing,\" said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"The more the U.S. Navy, Air Force and other military services carry out operations in the South China Sea, the more the risk of an accident or miscalculation rises,\" she said.\n\nGlaser said the U.S. should take steps to reduce tensions with China in the region, such as engaging in more dialogue and avoiding unnecessary provocations, such as military flights close to China's territorial claims.\n\n\"The U.S. and its allies should communicate to China their intentions to fly or sail in the South China Sea and China should provide timely notification of any military activities that could be of concern to the US,\" she said.\n\nThe Pentagon has said it takes \"extraordinary precautions\" when conducting operations in the region, such as maintaining professional naval interactions with the Chinese navy and keeping aircraft at a safe distance from one another.\n\nU.S. Air Force Col. Robert Manning, the Pentagon's spokesman, said the most recent flight was safe and professional and that it would continue to \"conduct regular and routine freedom of navigation operations consistent with international law in the South China Sea.\"\n\nThe United States has increased its military presence in the region in recent years, deploying ships, planes and personnel to challenge Chinese territorial claims.\n\nChina has also boosted its military presence in the area, and a recent report by the U.S. Defense Department estimated that Beijing has developed three man-made islands in the South China Sea with the aim of militarizing them.\n\nThe report said China has built up a variety of defensive systems, including surface-to-air missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, on the islands.\n\nThe U.S. has said it does not recognize China's claims to the islands and has urged Beijing to resolve the dispute through diplomatic channels.\n\nThe U.S. and China, as well as other regional countries, have made some progress in recent years toward reducing tensions in the South China Sea. In July, the countries agreed to a set of procedures for safely dealing with close encounters at sea, something that was seen as a positive step.\n\nBut analysts say it is", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The deadline for obtaining the Real ID needed to board a domestic flight has been pushed back again, with the Department of Homeland Security citing the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the slower-than-expected rollout.\n\nThe deadline to have a Real ID had been May 3, 2023, but DHS announced earlier this month that it was pushed back two years, to May 7, 2025.\n\n\u201cThis extension will give states needed time to ensure their residents can obtain a REAL ID-compliant license or identification card,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N.

We will continue to ensure that the American public can travel safely.\u201d\n\nPeople are getting compliant IDs as they renew driver\u2019s licenses, but DHS said the pandemic resulted in backlogs at state driver\u2019s license offices. Because of the backlogs, many state agencies that issue driver\u2019s licenses automatically extended expiration dates on licenses and ID cards, rather than issuing licenses and cards compliant with the Real ID requirement.\n\nAfter the May 2025 deadline, domestic travelers 18 and older on commercial flights must have a Real ID-compliant driver\u2019s license or state photo ID identification card. Real ID also will be required to enter some federal facilities such as military bases.\n\nThe Real ID law was passed by Congress in 2005 on a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. The new form of ID incorporates anti-counterfeiting technology and uses documentary evidence and record checks to ensure a person is who they claim to be.\n\nEnforcement has been delayed several times since the original 2008 deadline. Most recently, in April 2021, DHS extended the deadline to May 2023, also citing how COVID-19 made it harder for states to issue new licenses.\n\nA DHS spokeswoman said Tuesday that about 52% of state-issued driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards were considered Real ID-compliant. That\u2019s up from 43% in April 2021.\n\nAll 50 states, the District of Columbia and four of the five U.S. territories covered by the Real ID Act are issuing Real ID-compliant driver\u2019s licenses and ID cards.

{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nAldi recorded its highest-ever December sales in the United Kingdom, as shoppers squeezed by searing food price inflation flocked to the German discount supermarket chain to save money on groceries.\n\nSales topped \u00a31.4 billion ($1.7 billion) for the first time, up 26% year on year, with the FIFA World Cup also boosting purchases, Aldi said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nTogether, customers bought more than 48 million mince pies, 38 million pigs-in-blankets and more than 1,700 tonnes of Brussels sprouts in the weeks leading up to Christmas.\n\nSoaring food prices and wages that are failing to keep pace with inflation mean more UK shoppers are switching to discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, as well as trading down to supermarkets\u2019 own label products.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium said Wednesday that food inflation accelerated to 13.3% in December, up from 12.4% in November, the highest level recorded since it started tracking the data in 2005. Fresh food inflation accelerated to 15% in December, also an all-time high.\n\n\u201c2023 will be another difficult year for consumers and businesses as inflation shows no immediate signs of waning,\u201d BRC CEO Helen Dickinson said in a statement.\n\nHigher prices pushed UK grocery sales to a record \u00a312.8 billion ($15.4 billion) over the four weeks to December 25, according to separate numbers published by data analytics company Kantar on Wednesday. That\u2019s an increase of \u00a31.1 billion ($1.3 billion) on the previous year, even though sales measured by the number of items people bought were down 1% over the same period.\n\n\u201cThis story played out across the traditional Christmas categories. For example, value sales of mince pies soared by 19% but volume purchases barely increased at all,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar\u2019s head of retail and consumer insight, in a report.\n\nWhile Kantar\u2019s figures showed grocery price inflation falling for the second month in a row in December, it is still a \u201cpainfully high figure, impacting how and what we buy at the shops,\u201d he added.\n\nSales of supermarkets\u2019 own label products increased by 13.3% year on year over the four weeks to December 25, \u201cwell ahead of a 4.7% increase in branded lines,\u201d McKevitt said.\n\nAldi remained the fastest-growing grocer in the United Kingdom last month, according to Kantar. Lidl\u2019s sales increased by nearly 24%, its data showed. Tesco (TSCDF) and Sainsbury\u2019s, the largest UK grocers by market share, grew sales by 6% and 6.2% respectively.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On a frigid December night, nearly a hundred Pilsen residents turned out to protest the city\u2019s plans to increase property taxes and accelerate gentrification in the historically Latino neighborhood.\n\nThe protest began around 5pm, with dozens of local residents, community activists and organizers marching from the National Museum of Mexican Art to the site of the proposed new development, a multi-million dollar condominium complex that is slated to replace a number of homes currently occupied by low-income families.\n\nThe protesters carried signs that read \u201cOur Home, Not Their Profit\u201d and \u201cPilsen is for Everyone\u201d as they marched along 18th Street, chanting and waving to residents of the neighborhood.\n\nThe mood was passionate and determined, with many protesters talking about their family\u2019s history in the neighborhood. \u201cMy family\u2019s been living here for generations,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Martinez, a local activist. \u201cMy grandmother moved here from Mexico in the 1940s, and we\u2019ve been living here ever since.\u201d\n\nThe protest was organized by two local organizations, Pilsen Alliance and SOMOS Pilsen, in response to the city\u2019s plan to increase property taxes in the neighborhood. The organizations have long argued that such hikes will make it impossible for many low-income families to stay in the neighborhood, and accelerate the gentrification process that has been ongoing in Pilsen since the mid-1990s.\n\n\u201cPilsen is home to many working class, immigrant families,\u201d said Benjam\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz, director of Pilsen Alliance. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen too many families forced out of their homes due to gentrification, and this plan would only accelerate that process. We\u2019re here to let the city know that this is our home and we won\u2019t stand for it.\u201d\n\nThe protesters marched around the condominium development, stopping occasionally to listen to organizers\u2019 speeches and chants. Some local business owners and residents opened their windows and balconies to join the protest, while others stopped in the streets to watch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be out here and show the city we\u2019re not going to take this lying down,\u201d said Sandra Cervantes, a local resident. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting until we have a solution that works for everyone, not just the developers.\u201d\n\nThe march concluded with a rally in front of the proposed condominium complex, with organizers reading demands for the city to scrap the proposal and to invest in initiatives that benefit current residents, like rent control and more affordable housing.\n\nThe protest ended after nightfall, but not without the promise of continued pressure from the community. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop until we get what we want, and that\u2019s a Pilsen that\u2019s for everyone.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Patti Wilson is a woman of few words\u2014publicly at least, famously only giving a handful of interviews over the course of her storied career. She instead lets her work speak for itself, with over 30 years of fashion experience that redefines the way we look at styling. And boy, does the work talk: Wilson\u2019s ability to thread a narrative needle through a rack of clothing is second to none. Her world-building skill set was formed in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s in New York City, before she quickly garnered international attention and started working for magazines like i-D and Vogue Italia. Specifically, Wilson\u2019s genre-bending editorials with photographer David LaChapelle, to me, modernized the fashion image beyond studio looks and high fashion.\n\nBeyond that, Wilson has lent her eye and sartorial savvy to stars like Mary J. Blige, Naomi Campbell, and Beyonc\u00e9, to name just a few, and even the quartet of Aaliyah, Lil\u2019 Kim, Missy Elliot, and Da Brat for ELLE in 1999. She thrives on new talent, bringing those who deserve it most to the spotlight. This past New York Fashion Week, she styled shows for CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year nominee LaQuan Smith and Dion Lee. For Wilson, supporting young designers is paramount, because they\u2019re the future of the industry. Her ability to spot the next wunderkind makes her one of the most in-demand visionaries to this day.\n\nWithin moments of speaking to her, it\u2019s apparent that Wilson\u2019s mind is always turning, spinning something old and new to create something entirely different. Her magpie references span Galliano\u2019s Dior era, the nuns who taught at her high school, and, of course, the streets of NYC. Her ability to decontextualize a hat, a dress, or an entire silhouette, then reimagine it, twist it around, and bring new life to it is masterful. The hallmark of a great stylist is one who makes you think not only about how the clothing is being used, but how the clothing makes you feel. Few stylists today are able to feel as much as Wilson, and it shows in her work.\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nAbove all, Wilson is always, always working\u2014pulling her away from poring over image selects is no easy feat. Her ability to spend weeks creating a story, then pivot right away to the next one, speaks to her unflappable work ethic, and also the way her mind works. It\u2019s unstoppable! Between appointments and preparing for such a public-facing event as tonight\u2019s CFDA Awards, Wilson spoke about her career, what makes her tick, and working with ELLE.\n\nHow did growing up in New York City shape your fashion point of view? Were you creative from an early age?\n\nI grew up in Queens and Manhattan, and I went to a Catholic high school on 42nd Street. All nuns. All girls. [Laughs.] I got obsessed with the nuns. Obsessed. So, I would say that was when I started getting into fashion, because I loved how they dressed. I loved the crosses; I also loved the way they lived so minimally, but [wore] these outrageous gowns and headpieces. I liked the priests\u2019 looks, too. Those were good. The purples and the reds. [They were] so Simone-y Rocha with the white going over the black. I had this ugly uniform, but I rolled it up and changed it and made sure it looked cool. I put lifts in my shoes so I could always be tall. Plus, there was an actual model in the school, and I was obsessed with her because she was absolutely flawless. She would appear in Seventeen and that just blew my mind.\n\nYou started styling because you got approached when you were waitressing, right?\n\nI was actually a hostess in a jazz club, and a photographer would come in every so often. Every week, she\u2019d come in with Woody Allen of all people, because he was a jazz enthusiast, and they would hang out there. She was a photographer, and she started asking me about my clothes because I used to get all dressed up for that hostess job, which I stunk at by the way. It was terrible [laughs]. I couldn\u2019t remember names, but everyone thought it was really funny, and it wasn\u2019t because I was feeling scared. I met a lot of basketball players. It was kind of a sports club with jazz. Oh, it was wild. Beyond. Muhammad Ali was always there. Wild. It was good though, because I made a little money and I was able to keep shopping for clothes. [Laughs.]\n\nSo the photographer had a sister, and the sister was a stylist and she said, \u201cYou should work for my sister. She\u2019s looking for an assistant.\u201d I had no idea what that was. I was like, what the heck is that? But I started working for her. I stuck with her for quite some time, and then that same photographer gave me my first job on my own. I really liked it\u2014like, immediately liked it. So, I did both assisting and working at night. It was cool. I was exhausted, but it was cool.\n\nThat\u2019s often how it is in the beginning. If you\u2019re so in love with it, you\u2019ll wear yourself thin to make it happen.\n\nI know! It\u2019s crazy that I\u2019m doing the same thing now again. And the money is worse. Because it\u2019s the challenge of it, you know? Now, there\u2019s the challenge of not having the money to make and get the things you need. You have to figure out ways of getting it so you can have it. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening all over again. But I\u2019m finding it a lot of fun now, because everybody is so fresh and there\u2019s a lot of fresh energy around.\n\nYou\u2019re always working on so many projects at the same time. How do you continue to stay inspired and keep going?\n\nI\u2019m inspired by the newness of these young kids that are making clothes, and from the fact that we have it and we\u2019re open to it now all over the world. I\u2019m always calling someone in from Copenhagen or something. It\u2019s just fun to find all this, and figure out ways to get the stuff here, and try for somebody to let me shoot one or two pieces and stick it in a story. You gotta be thinking of everyone and how you\u2019re gonna make it all work.\n\n\n\nWhat makes the difference between a good fashion image and an amazing fashion image?\n\nA great photographer [laughs]. A really good photographer. And then you have to drag in the hair and makeup, too. That\u2019s so important.\n\nWhat was it like working with Steven Klein?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make a story look good when you have to use all different people, and when you come up with a theme and the theme has to carry through. To make a story, it\u2019s really hard work, but he\u2019s brilliant. For me, he\u2019s got all the tension and the angst, and it all comes out in his work, and it\u2019s so good. He\u2019s so powerful. I\u2019m really lucky.\n\nYou started working in fashion way before Instagram was a thing. Do you think social media has changed the way that we consume fashion? Do you think it\u2019s changed the way that you work?\n\nWell, I gotta work quicker [laughs]. That\u2019s for sure. I like it, and I don\u2019t like it. I still can\u2019t quite make up my mind to this day. I did not want to get involved. I wanted nothing to do with it, and then I read this remark that Marc Jacobs made, and I thought, he\u2019s right. He said, \u201cGet over it!\u201d And I just went, \u201cI guess I better join them.\u201d It\u2019s the competing and getting it out on time that is not great, but the idea that you can see other people\u2019s work and see what\u2019s going on, that\u2019s cool. It also makes you have to look for new ideas and new things, because once you see all this stuff you go, \u201cUgh, I\u2019ve seen this already.\u201d You\u2019re constantly having to come up with something that you haven\u2019t seen, and that\u2019s what\u2019s gotten harder, because everybody\u2019s doing something. You have 20 million other ideas going on, so you really have to work hard to come up with something that\u2019s not been seen. It might get watered down after a while, because it\u2019s a lot to keep up with. Everybody\u2019s in on it\u2014it\u2019s good and it\u2019s bad. You have to get over it.\n\nWhat\u2019s been your favorite story that you\u2019ve styled for ELLE?\n\nI liked the Doja [cover] because I just thought she never looked like that. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s put her in suits.\u201d Oh, she\u2019s fabulous. I loved her. I liked doing that story because she went for it. She was cool, and even her stylist came on the shoot and he was cool about it. She\u2019s looking better and better now that she shaved all her hair. I wish I could\u2019ve done it for that story, but anyway, she\u2019s something\u2014and the music is good!\n\n\n\nWho are your some of your favorite fashion icons of all time?\n\n\n\nI would say Alexander McQueen, Steven Meisel, Isabella Blow. Nobody knows about Isabella Blow, and I\u2019m sure a lot of kids don\u2019t remember her. I loved seeing her brought up again, because she was amazing. I used to see her so dressed. The funniest thing is, I was in London, and they would not respect her. They made fun of her. In London, they\u2019re so minimalist, and they just thought she was wild, and I thought, \u201cThis is the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d She had it. And McQueen loved her. He knew what he had there, and she was an amazing muse for him.\n\nYou\u2019ve been to so many runway shows. Are there any that stick out in your mind as favorites? I\u2019m sure McQueen had a few.\n\nYeah, McQueen, and then Balenciaga has had a couple of real killers. Riccardo Tisci used to stand out for me. The early Givenchy days...I mean, those barking dog bags! That guy was just great. I also have that to say about Galliano. And Margiela also, the real one and the fake one. I love John Galliano. I love him! I look at his work all the time. It\u2019s so good. How about his last show by Margiela? That was so fabulous!\n\n\n\nIs there anybody young and new that you haven\u2019t styled yet that you want to work with?\n\nI\u2019ve been dying to do Dua Lipa! I love the fact that she likes clothes. It\u2019s half the battle! If you can shoot one of these stars that love clothing, then you\u2019re there. It\u2019s rare to find them also [being] into it.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the next story.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve been in New York your whole life. What\u2019s your favorite store to shop at?\n\nI live for Dover [Street Market]\u2014in every city. I just love it! It inspires me, and it makes me lose all my money. It\u2019s the best for seeing the fresh new things that are happening. And I cry that Opening Ceremony is gone. I miss that one. I also love going to R13. That\u2019s another little haunt.\n\nRight across from the old Opening Ceremony.\n\nI know...so sad. I was devastated, because I used to just pop in there and just get inspired and just buy a T-shirt and be happy. We need to get that back. I don\u2019t know how, but we have to get that back, because we don\u2019t have it.\n\n\n\nWhat do you hope for the future of fashion?\n\nThat we can all afford it [laughs]. If all the numbers came down and we were to get everything we\u2019ve always wanted. If that Stephen Jones hat wasn\u2019t $2,000.\n\nWho are some of your new favorite up-and-coming photographers?\n\nI love Quil [Lemons]. I love, love, love Campbell Addy. Renell Medrano is genius\u2014she has attitude. There\u2019s this English boy that I worked with in London, Felix Cooper. He\u2019s really fresh. I love working with new photographers because it\u2019s nice to get a fresh view, and your styling looks different. Or it makes me style differently, or they capture in another way. I find that interesting, especially if it looks new to me. Change is all about that. It\u2019s terrible, but it\u2019s all about the next story.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "FedEx said Tuesday it would cut $1 billion more in costs after weak demand ate into its quarterly profit.\n\nThe company in September announced cost-cutting measures that included parking planes and closing some offices in the face of softening global demand. It also raised package-delivery rates. At the time, CEO Raj Subramaniam warned the economy would enter a \"worldwide recession.\"\n\nFedEx on Tuesday said it will be able to cut another $1 billion beyond what it forecast in September, to bring the total fiscal 2023 savings to $3.7 billion compared with its earlier plan for the year.\n\n\"Our teams have an unwavering focus on rapidly implementing cost savings to improve profitability,\" CFO Mike Lenz said in an earnings release. \"As we look to the second half of our fiscal year, we are accelerating our progress on cost actions, helping to offset continued global volume softness.\"\n\nMost of the additional cuts will stem from FedEx's Express unit, such as additional flight cuts, Lenz said on an earnings call.

Not only are you fighting to find what you want in your size, but these sales also don't typically have fitting rooms, leaving customers with no choice but to buy the product they want and hope it zips up once they get home.\n\nSadly, one pair of pink high-rise pants that cost me around $150 at one of my sample-sale adventures didn't rise to the occasion, literally. The pants sat in my closet for months mocking me, and with the holiday season approaching, I figured it was time to find them a new home and me some extra cash.\n\nThis is what the listing looked like. Screenshot courtesy of Sam Silverman\n\nI turned to Facebook Marketplace, something I've done numerous times before. The majority of my furniture was sourced from the platform, and I've even sold and traded a couple of pieces myself.\n\nI listed the pants on Facebook Marketplace for $150. Two days later, I got an inquiry from what appeared to be a nice older woman named \"Nancy Andrews.\"\n\nShe wanted the pants and said her cousin would pick them up from my apartment the next day. She said she'd send me the payment over Zelle. Everything seemed standard at this point.\n\nI received a very legitimate-looking email from what I thought was Zelle, stating that the buyer must send me $300 to upgrade my account to a business account. The buyer allegedly received the same email and said she had no problem doing so, as long as I agreed to send her the overbalance back. I, of course, agreed.\n\nI then received another email from the same legitimate-looking Zelle address asking me to send $300 to the buyer to confirm me as a business account. After doing so, I would receive a $300 refund and $150 for the pants.\n\nAfter I made the payment, I received another email asking for more money. At that point, I knew I'd screwed up. Screenshot courtesy of Sam Silverman\n\nAt this point, I was very hesitant. However, the woman was being very kind to me and said this had happened to her before. I asked her to switch to Venmo, and she said she trusted Zelle more, as she'd been scammed in the past.\n\nAfter going back and forth, I gave in. I just wanted to get rid of these pants and continue with my day. I sent the Zelle to an email account provided by the buyer \u2014 but then I received another email asking for more money. At that point, I knew I'd screwed up.\n\nI told the woman I refused to send any more money, and she then sent me several angry messages begging me to continue the process. She even sent me a screenshot of her bank account to prove she sent the additional funds to upgrade my account.\n\nShe also called me several times, and her tone was not pleasant.\n\nI immediately called my bank and explained what had happened. Other than filing a report, they told me there wasn't much to be done \u2014 these scams are common and are similar to a stolen car. If you recoup the funds that's great, but it's unlikely.\n\nI was also instructed to file a report with the Internet Crime Complaint Center and to report the Facebook account I was corresponding with. However, Facebook quickly got back to me stating that it didn't deem the account a threat and would allow it to remain active.\n\nShocked by how easily I was deceived, I began investigating the series of emails I received from Zelle Services. As I was initially viewing the emails on my phone, I never took note of the email address the messages came from. To my surprise, the address was \"zelleserviicemanagement@gmail.com.\" Now, I'd imagine an official Zelle contact wouldn't use a Gmail account or spell \"service\" with two Is.\n\nI never took note of the email address the messages came from. The address was \"zelleserviicemanagement@gmail.com\" \u2014 Zelle wouldn't use a gmail account or misspell \"service.\" Screenshot courtesy of Sam Silverman\n\nDespite clearly being deceived using Zelle's name, the company states that it's \"unable to assist with getting your money back,\" however, \"it's important to us that users have the ability to report this experience.\"\n\nAlthough I was kicking myself for falling victim to a scam, by no means was I alone.\n\nData provider BeenVerified analyzed 165,000 scam complaints over the past three years and found that Facebook Marketplace scams grew 184.8% in the past year. This makes them the fastest-growing scam of 2022, with sellers and buyers both reporting illegitimate transactions.\n\nIn one instance, a Michigan woman lost her $15,000 life savings in a Facebook Marketplace car scam.\n\nAdditionally, Zelle scams were listed as the second fastest-growing scams by BeenVerified, with Zelle scams up 86% this year, many of which were tied to Facebook Marketplace listings.\n\nThe payment platform's transactions are encrypted, which makes it hard for hackers to reroute an ongoing payment. But as a peer-to-peer payment provider, it makes it nearly impossible for people to recover cash they were deceived out of.\n\nTo combat this dilemma, banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and more are in talks to devise a standard plan to compensate customers who were bamboozled using Zelle.\n\nThe banks would share liability within Zelle's systems, and in the event of a scam, the funds would be returned to the victim's bank account, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other financial institutions \u2014 Zelle currently works with more than 1,800 \u2014 would have to agree to the new policy or risk being cut from its network. The policy could go into effect early next year.\n\nZelle operator Early Warning Services LLC claims scams only make up 0.1% of the payments made on the platform, which totaled $490 billion in 2021.\n\nFacebook Marketplace and Zelle aside, scams have become increasingly prevalent across the country. In 2021, nonpayment and nondelivery scams cost people $337 million, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Report.\n\nAt the same time, scammers have gotten more sophisticated.\n\n\"Technologies have made it easier to do a better job of impersonating,\" AJ Nash, the vice president of intelligence at ZeroFox, told Entrepreneur. \"It costs very little to buy a domain that looks very close to the real one. It's a misspelling, or they use a lowercase 'L' to replace a capital 'I.' There's a lot of different ways to set that up.\"\n\nFrom phony websites to email addresses, it doesn't take much to make something appear legitimate.\n\n\"The longer you go down those paths \u2014 if adversaries link things together and layer them, the more trust it creates,\" Nash said. \"If you believed the first thing, then everything else is going to reinforce that as a potential victim.\"\n\nHow to avoid online scams\n\nIt's important to keep your eyes wide open during any online transactions.\n\nLook for discrepancies in spelling and grammar, and view your transaction on a larger screen to make sure you don't miss anything. Nash also suggested copying and pasting addresses and URLs into a document so errors are easier to spot.\n\nHe recommended having a separate credit card for online transactions to prevent attackers from moving \"laterally\" through your other accounts and using different usernames and passwords for all of your accounts.\n\n\"If they trick you into the website and you give away your information, [for a] lot of folks, that means you give away everything,\" Nash said. \"It turns out that's the only password and username used for everything. This is the time of year to remember to randomize passwords and use password management and two-factor authentication.\"\n\nMost importantly, pay attention to detail and take a breath. If I wasn't in such a tizzy trying to make the transaction work, I might've saved $300.\n\nLong story short, my pants are still for sale.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "On January 3, 2021, Buffalo Bills cornerback Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field during a game against the New England Patriots. He was quickly taken to the hospital where doctors determined that he had suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\nThe cause of Hamlin\u2019s cardiac arrest has been a mystery since the incident, with many speculating that it was caused by a heart attack or arrhythmia.\n\nIn a recent statement, Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott said that the team was still \u201cgathering information\u201d about the incident. While it\u2019s still unclear what caused Hamlin\u2019s collapse, understanding what could have led to the cardiac arrest can help doctors better understand how to prevent and treat similar cardiac arrests in the future.\n\nA cardiac arrest is a medical emergency in which the heart suddenly stops beating. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), it\u2019s often caused by an arrhythmia, which is an abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nThe most common type of arrhythmia that causes a cardiac arrest is ventricular fibrillation, or VF. During VF, the heart\u2019s electrical system becomes disrupted, which causes the heart to contract in an uncoordinated, unproductive way. This leads to a lack of blood flow, which can cause the heart to stop pumping.\n\nVF can be caused by several different conditions, including coronary artery disease, a heart attack, and other underlying heart conditions. It can also be caused by certain medications, illegal drugs, and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that VF isn\u2019t the only type of arrhythmia that can cause a cardiac arrest. Other types of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can also lead to a cardiac arrest.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear what caused Damar Hamlin\u2019s cardiac arrest, and doctors may never know exactly what led to the incident. However, understanding the potential causes of cardiac arrest can help doctors better diagnose and treat arrhythmias before they lead to more serious issues.\n\nIn the wake of Hamlin\u2019s collapse, the Buffalo Bills have taken steps to ensure that their players get the best possible medical care. The team has implemented strict protocols for the screening and treatment of players who suffer from any kind of heart condition.\n\nThe team has also announced plans to provide players with wearable cardiac monitors that can detect an abnormal heart rhythm and alert medical personnel if something is wrong. These monitors are similar to those used by professional athletes in other sports and can detect arrhythmias before they become a major issue.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills and their players are still mourning the loss of Damar Hamlin, but his story serves as a reminder of the importance of heart health. Cardiac arrest can strike anyone at any time, but understanding the potential causes can help doctors better diagnose and treat arrhythmias before they lead to more serious issues.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The 117th Congress that was sworn in last month has already had its first major scandal revealed, this one concerning financial transparency.\n\nOn Thursday, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released a report that found 78 members of the 117th Congress had violated the STOCK Act, a law designed to prevent members of Congress from taking advantage of their insider knowledge of the legislative process to make money on the stock market.\n\nAccording to the report, 78 of the 541 members of Congress \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 had bought or sold at least one stock within 90 days of the start of their term, which the STOCK Act prohibits.\n\nThe STOCK Act was passed in 2012 after a series of stories in the Wall Street Journal and other outlets revealed that lawmakers were trading stocks based on information they obtained through their positions in Congress.\n\nThe most egregious offender was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who bought stocks totaling $35,000 in January, just weeks after being sworn into office. Warren acknowledged the violation and said she has since sold the stocks.\n\nSen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) was also cited for buying more than $50,000 in stocks in January, shortly after she was sworn into office. Loeffler maintains that the purchases were made without her knowledge and that she did not have any insider information.\n\nOther notable lawmakers who violated the STOCK Act included Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nThe report also found that more than a dozen House and Senate members had failed to file timely and accurate personal financial disclosure statements, as required by law.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the report, CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said, \"Even though some members have already taken action to rectify these violations, Congress should never be above the law. It\u2019s disheartening to see this many members of the 117th Congress violate the law before even settling in, but it's essential that the public trust is maintained by requiring elected officials to uphold the highest standards of ethics and financial transparency.\"\n\nCREW also called on the House and Senate ethics committees to take action to ensure these members of Congress comply with the law, and said it intends to file complaints with the relevant authorities if action is not taken.\n\nThe ethics committees have not yet responded to the report. In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Schumer said, \u201cOur office is working diligently to ensure Senator Schumer is in full compliance with the STOCK Act.\u201d\n\nThe revelations have cast a cloud over the start of the 117th Congress and highlighted the need for lawmakers to remain accountable and maintain transparency with the public. To be sure, these issues should be taken seriously and all members of Congress should comply with the law, lest they face further scrutiny.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "I recently visited Bath, a city located in the southwest of England, for the first time, and it was magical. It\u2019s impossible to not be enchanted by its Georgian architecture, rolling hills, and historic sites.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the city has been used as a filming location for countless movies and TV shows, including \"Bridgerton.\" Its streets are dotted with incredible buildings from the Georgian period that look almost too good to be true.\n\nI spent five days exploring Bath and all it had to offer. Here are seven reasons why I\u2019m already planning my next trip back.\n\n1. The Roman Baths\n\nBath is known for its Roman-style bathhouses, the most impressive of which is the Roman Baths. This incredibly well-preserved archaeological site dates back to the first century AD and was created by the Romans to recreate their baths in Britain. Visitors can take a guided tour of the baths and learn more about their fascinating history.\n\n2. The Royal Crescent\n\nThe Royal Crescent is one of the most iconic sights in Bath and a must-see for any visitor. This stunning row of 30 Georgian townhouses is located on a sweeping curve, and it looks almost untouched by time. It was designed by renowned architect John Wood the Younger in the 18th century and is one of the most recognisable pieces of architecture in the UK.\n\n3. The Abbey\n\nThe city of Bath is home to a beautiful 12th-century abbey, which is believed to be the burial place of King Edgar I. This impressive building has been recently restored, and visitors can wander around its cloister, enjoy views of the choir, and explore its library. The Abbey also hosts regular events and musical performances throughout the year, making it a great spot for locals and visitors alike.\n\n4. Shopping\n\nFrom antique shops to high-street stores, Bath has something for everyone when it comes to shopping. The city centre is full of independent boutiques, while there are also plenty of malls and department stores in the outskirts. Shopping fans can easily spend the entire day browsing through the city\u2019s many stores.\n\n5. Eating and Drinking\n\nBath is also known for its incredible food scene. There are a wealth of pubs, cafes, and restaurants scattered around the city centre, all offering something a little different. From traditional British pubs serving up classic pub grub to more modern establishments offering innovative dishes, Bath has something to suit every palate.\n\n6. The Georgian Architecture\n\nThe city of Bath is famous for its incredible Georgian architecture, and visitors can find countless examples of this style throughout the city. From the magnificent terraced houses of the Royal Crescent to the lovely terraced gardens of Queen Square, the city is a testament to the sophistication of this period of architecture.\n\n7. Day Trips\n\nBath is also a great base for exploring the surrounding areas. The nearby Cotswolds is a beautiful region filled with idyllic villages, rolling hills, and plenty of attractions, while the city of Bristol is just a short drive away. There are also plenty of stunning beaches to visit along the coast.\n\nI had a wonderful time exploring Bath, and I\u2019m already planning my next trip back. There is so much to do and see in this city, and it\u2019s easy to understand why it has been chosen as a filming location for some of the biggest TV shows and movies in recent years. If you\u2019re looking for a magical break, I highly recommend a trip to Bath.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "this weekend\n\nThe first full moon of 2021 is set to be a showstopper.\n\nThe January full moon, also known as a wolf moon, is set to appear in the night sky on Saturday and will be visible around the world. It's the first full moon of 2021 and will be visible to the naked eye, so don\u2019t miss it.\n\nThe full moon is the point in the moon's orbit where the lunar orb is visible in its entirety. Though the exact time of the full moon is 5:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, it will look full on the evenings of January 8 and 9, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the Moon is considered full for about three days, from the evening of Friday, Jan. 8 to the evening of Monday, Jan. 11,\u201d the almanac said.\n\nThe January full moon is a good way to kick off the new year, and it has some big meaning to it. It's known as the Wolf Moon, but has had a few other nicknames, including the Old Moon, Ice Moon and the Snow Moon.\n\nThe Wolf Moon name is said to come from early Native Americans, since this was the time of year when wolves would howl, according to The Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The Moon was seen as a way to mark the passing of the seasons in a calendar year and honor how long winter had been. The names are still used today in modern lunar calendars.\n\nThe Wolf Moon will look just like the full moons we saw throughout 2020. Though the Moon may look large and bright at first sight, it's just an optical illusion. A 2018 study published in The Astrophysical Journal by experts from the U.S. Naval Research Lab found that when the Moon is near the horizon, it seems larger and brighter than when it is high in the sky.\n\nNo special equipment is needed to see the Moon Saturday night. But if you want to get a closer look, a telescope or binoculars will make the Moon look extra large, and a filter will give a better view of its surface.\n\nThe full Moon will help create a few beautiful opportunities for stargazers and photographers looking to capture a picture or two.\n\nThe full Moon will pair with the bright winter stars, creating a dramatic image that won't soon be forgotten. \n\nThe next full moon, known as the Snow Moon, will appear February 11.\n\nSo get your cameras ready, take a moment to appreciate the beauty of the sky, and get ready to marvel at the Wolf Moon this weekend.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Since the rise of work-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic, Washington is among many American cities that have wrestled with vacant office space while simultaneously battling a lack of affordable housing.\n\nOn Monday, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called on President Joe Biden to either end work-from-home telework policies for federal government employees or turn over vacant government buildings in the nation's capital for housing in a new push to move 100,000 new residents into the city.\n\nThe federal government accounts for one-third of properties owned or leased in Washington and a quarter of the city's pre-pandemic jobs.\n\nThe city is utilizing tax breaks to encourage the conversion of vacant office buildings as a solution to the lack of housing but Bowser says Biden needs to help.\n\n\"We need decisive action by the White House to either get most federal workers back to the office, most of the time, or to realign their vast property holdings for use by the local government, by nonprofits, by businesses and by any user willing to revitalize it,\" she said.\n\nBowser notes that currently 25,000 people currently call downtown D.C. home. She says the city will \"add 15,000 residents over the next five years and 87,000 more before it's all said and done.\" Currently, 92% of the central business district consists of commercial space, residential space only accounts for 8%. That's according to Bowser's Housing in Downtown Abatement Program, which the mayor's office seeks to encourage a rise in new residential conversion projects.\n\nPHOTO: Mayor Muriel Bower delivers remarks at the Legacy Leadership Luncheon & Awards during National Urban League Conference, July 22, 2022, in Washington, D.C (Brian Stukes/Getty Images)\n\nMORE:US real estate market may be cooling, depending on who you ask\n\nCBRE, a global commercial real estate company that has studied office conversions, notes that only 218 office conversions were completed in the U.S. between 2016 to 2021 an average of 36 conversions a year. However, by early December 2022, CBRE says 42 buildings had been converted within the last year. Boston leads the market with 38 building conversions, San Francisco Peninsula with 28, and D.C. and Los Angeles were tied for third with 11 building conversions each. Many of the cities that out-ranked D.C., unlike Washington, don't have to negotiate with the federal government as a landlord.\n\nStory continues\n\nPHOTO: President Joe Biden boards Air Force One at Rohlsen Airport as he departs following a New Year holiday visit to Christiansted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, Jan. 2, 2023. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nMORE: What offices may look like in a post-pandemic era, if they exist at all\n\nIn December, in an effort to promote a reimagined downtown, Mayor Bowser announced the conversion of the old Vanguard building that headquartered the Peace Corps for decades. The building will be converted to the Elle Apartments and is expected to add 163 residential units when it opens in May 2024.\n\nBowser said in December, \"We have seen how mixed-use communities are more resilient in the face of adversity. By converting vacant offices into homes, we can put these spaces back to productive use, add much-needed housing, and create a vibrant downtown where people live, work, and play.\"\n\nDeputy Mayor John Falcicchio said in December that the city's downtown reimagination strategy has three key points: \"Change the space, fill the space, and bring the people.\"\n\nFalcicchio added, \"creating new housing in downtown will lead to a more vibrant neighborhood and a 24/7 economy. The Housing in Downtown Abatement Program will incentivize more conversions, and bring about more housing affordability and retail opportunities.\"\n\nPHOTO: President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Dec. 13, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nD.C., which has over 20 million square feet of vacant office space, hopes that the Housing in Downtown Abatement Program will incentivize future residential transformations by offering tax relief to buildings that include at least 15% of total units to be affordable to 60% of people who qualify for the median family income threshold, which is $103,200 for a four-person family.\n\nBower's historic third term as the first Black woman mayor to serve three consecutive four-year terms will be met by a new Congress and new GOP leadership. Despite D.C.'s lack of statehood, Bowser is vowing to continue to fight for Washington's autonomy. At her swearing-in Monday, she noted, \"as this new Congress starts, I promise to keep fighting for control over everything that we need in the district, protecting our bodily autonomy, the ability to tax and regulate our businesses, and to provide services to our justice-involved youth.\"\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, the chief human resources agency for the federal government, did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment.\n\nDC mayor calls on Biden to end federal work-from-home or create affordable housing originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It's good to see stocks rally going into December, but the continuing decline in earnings estimates is worrisome. Since the start of the quarter, fourth-quarter earnings estimates for the S & P 500 have gone down 5.6% to $54.58 from $57.79, according to FactSet . It's fairly typical for earnings to come down a bit as the quarter goes on, but this decline is much more than usual. For example, the average decline in the first two months of the fourth quarter in the last five years has been only 2.1%, and only 2.7% over the last 10 years. We're seeing twice that decline now. Earnings are now expected to decline slightly for the quarter compared to the same period last year. 2023 earnings estimates are also coming down at a fairly rapid pace. Earnings are now expected to be up only in the low single digits. The problem is that estimates have been coming down at the same time stock prices have been going up . The S & P 500 is almost 15% above its October closing low. As a result, FactSet notes, the P/E ratio has expanded to 17.6 from 15.2 at the end of September. Seventeen times forward earnings is the historic average, but now that the multiple is moving toward 18 and higher, stock market bulls are going to have to make a strong argument for an economic soft landing to justify a multiple this high. How accurate are these analyst estimates? FactSet noted that on average analysts have overestimated yearly earnings by about 7% over the past 25 years. That's a fairly large overestimation, and it goes to a critical point: Analysts are optimists by nature. Analysts have far more buys than sells on their stocks. Why? Aside from being optimistic, it's likely a better career move to be overly bullish than overly bearish. That 7% overestimation may not be as large as it sounds. FactSet notes that there were four years where analyst estimates were off by more than 25%: 2001, 2008, 2009 and 2020. These years are associated with events that analysts would not have been able to predict: the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the financial crisis in 2008-2009 and the Covid pandemic in 2020. Removing those four years reduces the over-estimation from 7% to 2%. That's not bad, considering analysts are trying to predict events up to a year in advance.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "If Sinema still caucuses with Democrats, her switch to independent would not change much about how the party functions with its new 51-49 majority. The outright advantage in the chamber will make it easier for Democrats to advance President Joe Biden's nominees and issue subpoenas.\n\nBy keeping her committee assignments, Sinema signaled she intends to continue to caucus with Democrats as an independent, like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine do. A senior Biden administration official told NBC News that the White House learned of Sinema's intention to switch parties \"mid-afternoon Thursday\" and that she intended to continue to caucus as before.\n\n\"Kyrsten is independent; that's how she's always been,\" Schumer said. \"I believe she's a good and effective senator and am looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate. We will maintain our new majority on committees, exercise our subpoena power, and be able to clear nominees without discharge votes.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. was informed of Sinema's plans to become independent on Thursday. In a statement Friday, Schumer said Sinema asked to keep her committee assignments.\n\nSinema said in a tweet Friday that she was declaring her \"independence from the broken partisan system in Washington and formally registering as an Arizona Independent.\"\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has switched parties to become an independent, complicating the Democrats' narrow control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nSenators Kyrsten Sinema speaks at the ceremony where U.S. President Joe Biden will sign the \"Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\", on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, November 15, 2021.\n\nSinema and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have been wild cards for Democrats since the party gained narrow control of the Senate from Republicans in 2020. Both had an outsize role in policymaking, as Manchin significantly curbed Democrats' dreams of passing sweeping legislation. Neither senator was up for reelection until 2024 and many expect Manchin to lean further conservative now that the midterms have passed.\n\nSinema had exerted her own influence on major Democratic bills even before she left the party. She notably rejected a corporate tax increase as part of Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year, instead opting for a 15% minimum tax.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock's reelection win Tuesday in Georgia's U.S. Senate runoff election gave the Democrats one more vote in the chamber and boosted the party's hopes that a 51-49 majority in the Senate would give Sinema and Manchin less control on crucial bills. The chamber was previously split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.\n\nSinema, who shared her party switch with a handful of news outlets along with her tweets at 6:01 a.m. ET, prides herself on \"maverick\" behavior like her Arizona predecessor, the late Sen. John McCain. She has made a career in the chamber by trying to work with Republicans as frequently as she did her former party, and told Politico in an interview Friday that switching party affiliations was a logical next step for her.\n\n\"Registering as an independent is what I believe is right for my state,\" Sinema said in the interview. \"It's right for me. I think it's right for the country.\"\n\nSinema, a 46-year-old and the first openly bisexual senator, was not always the conservative-leaning Democrat that her last four years legislating would indicate. She has always maintained an independent streak and continues to buck Senate norms with colorful outfits and wigs.\n\nSinema started her career as a Green Party activist focusing on LGBTQ rights. She switched to the Democratic Party in 2004 and was elected to the U.S. House in 2012.\n\nSinema utilized her friendliness with Republicans to be a key broker on several signature bills of Biden's first term, aiding on issues including infrastructure, guns and same-sex marriage. But her views on increasing taxes on the wealthy and opposition to changing filibuster rules did not win her favor with her former party.\n\nShe notably rejected a corporate tax increase as part of Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year, instead opting for a 15% minimum tax.\n\nLong before her announcement Friday morning, some Arizona Democrats had already started trying to find a replacement to primary her. Groups like the Primary Sinema PAC emerged late last year after her reluctance to filibuster reform prevented Democrats from moving forward with an exception for voting rights legislation, leading to the central committee of the Arizona Democratic Party to issue a no-confidence vote in its senator.\n\nPrimary Sinema PAC does not support a single candidate, but rather funds local Arizona groups to pressure Sinema and to lay the groundwork for the candidate that emerges. Speculation had already started that Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., would challenge her.\n\nSinema's decision to switch parties would prevent her from having to face a primary from the left.\n\nIn her interview with Politico though, Sinema did not say whether she would seek a second term in the U.S. Senate: \"It's fair to say that I'm not talking about it right now.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Shares of Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement chain, slid Friday after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock and cited a slowing housing market as a near-term risk.\n\nThe Switzerland-based firm cut its rating on Home Depot to \"neutral\" from \"outperform,\" and set a price target of $241 a share, down from $252. Shares of Home Depot were down as much as 2 percent in premarket trading following the news.\n\nIn a note to clients, Credit Suisse analysts argued that while housing market conditions remain strong, they are beginning to cool.\n\n\"Home Depot is well positioned to navigate a softening housing cycle, but a slowing market remains an overhang in the near-term,\" Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman wrote.\n\nSigman noted that Home Depot has had some success boosting margins, but that revenue growth remains an issue. Home Depot last month reported that its third-quarter revenue rose just 4 percent year over year, far slower than the company's historical trend.\n\nSigman argued that investors should expect Home Depot's revenue growth to remain \"weak\" in the near-term, and that upside in the stock is more likely to come from multiple expansion than through sales growth.\n\nHome Depot has benefited in recent years from strong housing market conditions, as Americans rushed to upgrade and remodel their homes. But analysts have recently warned that the housing market is slowing.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors reported last month that existing home sales fell for the fourth straight month in November, reaching their lowest level in more than three years. That data reinforced a trend of slowing home sales that has been in place for more than a year now.\n\nAnalysts have argued that the housing market is cooling as rising mortgage rates make borrowing more expensive. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported this month that mortgage applications fell to the lowest level in more than two years.\n\nRising home prices have also made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market. Home price appreciation has now outpaced wage growth for the past five years, according to data from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.\n\nStill, the housing market remains relatively strong. Home Depot said last month that its core U.S. market saw \"modest\" growth in the third quarter, driven by strong results in areas like plumbing, electrical, garden and kitchen.\n\nAnd despite the near-term challenges, Credit Suisse's Sigman argued that Home Depot remains well positioned to capitalize on secular growth trends, like the aging of the housing stock in the U.S.\n\nHome Depot shares are up more than 20 percent year-to-date, and now trade at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19. That's slightly higher than the historical average of 17.6 times, according to FactSet data.\n\nThe company has reported better-than-expected earnings in each of the past four quarters, and analysts expect Home Depot to grow earnings at a rate of 10.5 percent over the next five years, according to Refinitiv data. That's a slightly faster rate than Home Depot has managed in the last five years.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Researchers have been studying Europe\u2019s ancient stone walls for centuries, and for the first time in history, they believe they have solved the mystery of why mysterious circles and lines were engraved into the walls and ceilings of some of the oldest caves in the continent.\n\nThe curious patterns, known as \u2018ornamentation\u2019, have been spotted in caves all over Europe and were first noted by French anthropologist Henri Breuil in the late 1800s. Though the shapes were almost always found in the same spot, the purpose of their existence remained unknown until recently.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Quaternary International, a team of researchers from the University of Barcelona say they believe the markings were used by our ancestors as a form of communication.\n\nAccording to the team, the patterns were used by hunters and gatherers to communicate with each other, with the dots representing the locations of different species of game, while the lines indicated pathways. The markings were used to teach each other where to look for game, as well as to help children learn the environment.\n\nThe researchers also believe the markings were used to help hunters return to specific locations. It's possible that they used the dot and line patterns to signal to each other when they were able to find a new source of food.\n\nThe findings are especially interesting as the ornaments were made by the Upper Paleolithic cave dwellers, who were believed to have only had limited language skills. This study is helping to shed light on how our ancestors were able to communicate with each other and the wider world.\n\nThe team studied a total of four sites in two countries, France and Spain, dating from between 36,000 and 10,000 years ago. They found that the dots and stripes were often located in places where there was plenty of game or other food sources.\n\nAt one site, there was a large number of dots and lines found in a small area. This has led the researchers to believe that the ancient cave dwellers were using the patterns to signal to one another that they had identified a good hunting ground.\n\nThe discovery is exciting for researchers, as it is believed to be the first time that these patterns have been linked to communication between our ancestors. It is also an important step in understanding how these ancient societies organized and operated.\n\nThe research also shows that the ancient cave dwellers used sophisticated techniques to communicate with each other, which could be a sign that they had a more developed language than is often thought.\n\nOverall, this new research provides a fascinating insight into how our ancestors were able to communicate with each other, even without the use of modern technology or language. It is hoped that this new understanding will help us to better understand the history of humans, and their societies and cultures.", "label": "machine"}

The suit was filed by developer Shorenstein Properties, which owns the buildings at 1355 Market Street and 1515 Bryant Street where Twitter's offices are located.\n\nTwitter had agreed to pay a total of $1.1 million per month to the two landlords, but allegedly stopped paying rent in November, according to the lawsuit. Shorenstein claims the company owes a total of $2.2 million in back rent, plus interest and other expenses.\n\n\"After numerous attempts to reach an amicable resolution, Shorenstein has filed a complaint against Twitter for breach of contract for failure to pay rent and other related payments due under its leases with Shorenstein,\" the developer said in a statement.\n\nThe developer also claims Twitter has been \"disruptive\" in its dealings with other tenants in the buildings, and has allegedly refused to address the issue when confronted.\n\nTwitter's lease at both buildings is due to expire on February 2023, according to the complaint.\n\n\"I think it's time to press the pause button\" on their rental relationship, the complaint quotes Twitter's vice president of real estate as saying.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal battles for the tech giant. In October, Twitter was hit with a class-action lawsuit alleging the company misled investors about its user growth and advertising revenue.\n\nIn November, it was revealed that Twitter was in talks with the US Justice Department over allegations that the company failed to properly vet and take action against accounts owned by foreign governments attempting to meddle in US elections.\n\nFor its part, Twitter has called the landlord's lawsuit \"inaccurate and baseless\" and said it plans to vigorously defend itself.\n\n\"Twitter\u2019s lease for 1355 Market Street and 1515 Bryant Street expires in the normal course of business on February 28, 2023, and Twitter continues to be current on all payments due under the lease,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nStill, Twitter's rental woes come at a time when its overall health is in question. After years of rising revenue and high profits, the company recently announced a major restructuring that will cut its global headcount by 9%.\n\nAs part of its restructuring, Twitter is reportedly shutting down offices around the world, including its San Francisco headquarters. But the company has yet to publicly confirm whether those office closures are related to its rent dispute.\n\nWith the lawsuit now in court, all eyes are on Twitter and whether it will be able to settle its rent dispute with its San Francisco landlord.

{"text": "VCs poured $13.5 billion into healthtech startups in 2022 \u2014 down nearly 50% from 2021.\n\nPersonalized treatments and long-term care were named by investors as key priorities this year.\n\nInsider spoke to investors and founders who reflected on the state of healthtech in 2022.\n\n\"People are always going to need healthcare,\" Dr Kit Latham, cofounder and CEO at healthcare automation startup Credentially, told Insider.\n\nIt's a sentiment that rang true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought healthtech startups to the frontlines as healthcare providers struggled under the pressure of hefty waitlists and staff shortages. Healthtech founders bagged $25 billion from investors more sensitive to healthcare issues, and 2022 looked to be similar.\n\nBut a global slump and the tech downturn changed all of that, and funding into health startups fell by nearly 50% to $13.5 billion this year.\n\nEvery sub-sector in healthtech experienced a drop in funding, with women's health and clinical trials startups experiencing the biggest slash in capital.\n\n\"I think the drop in telehealth investment illustrates how personal healthcare is,\" said Julia Hawkins, general partner at LocalGlobe. \"Virtual care was extremely important to offer during COVID, but we know that many people will continue to want in-person care. Telehealth is a tool and enabler but can't fully replace in person care.\"\n\nAI-driven drug development and mental health startups also boomed during COVID-19 but have seen a funding dropoff in 2022. \"With absolute \u00a3 invested into health tech declining year on year, I don't think we can point to the ecosystem maturing,\" she added. \"We have a long way to go.\"\n\nDespite the slowdown, investors and founders still describe 2022 \u2014 which oversaw healthtech startups engage in more collaboration with healthcare systems \u2014 as a transformative year.\n\nThese are their key takeaways from the year.\n\n1. Tech that served underrepresented groups was spotlighted\n\nFrom menopause to mental health, health conditions that were billed as 'taboo' pre-pandemic have come to the forefront this year.\n\nDigital health platforms afforded patients with an increased degree of privacy, and became a good avenue to cater to \"certain underserved target groups, such as in mental health and in femtech\" \u2014 which \"continued to have a strong investment theme,\" said Gordon Euller, general partner of APEX Ventures Medical Fund.\n\nStartups offering personalized treatments for niche issues or demographics, such as menopause app Vira Health, mental health platform MyMynd, and men's health platform Numan, all raised capital this year.\n\nIn Europe, conditions such as \"that tended to be underserved by constrained health systems\" started being \"supported by employee benefits providers,\" added Dr Molly Gilmartin, investor at AlbionVC.\n\n2. The telehealth market matured significantly\n\nThe prominence of long Covid, which affects an estimated 17 million people in Europe, highlighted the need for better solutions to chronic healthcare issues. As pressure on healthcare providers across Europe mounted, viable long-term treatments became a bigger priority for investors.\n\nTelehealth startups burgeoned in the wake of Covid-19 as they filled gaps in healthcare systems globally. By 2021, startups such as Kry and Alan bagged unicorn valuations as VCs poured $1.1 billion into the sector.\n\nAlthough this sank to $851 million in 2022, telemedicine startups are still \"poised to grow across the globe\", according to Euller. \"The technologies in this area are quite mature,\" he added.\n\nChris Bischoff, managing director at venture capital firm General Catalyst, added that the firm takes a \"long-term view\" when evaluating how the ecosystem is maturing, but billed telehealth startups Alan, Kry, and Doctolib as the \"first-generation of winners\" this year.\n\nEyal Rabinovich, investor at Eight Roads, also considered the introduction of the DiGA (Digital Health Application) in Germany as an important benchmark for the telehealth sector. The act enables \"a smoother path\" for patients to reimburse their use of digital health platforms, showcasing how startups and public health services have increasingly started to work collaboratively.\n\n3. M&A activity surged\n\nAmid the global IPO slowdown, M&A frenzy hit the continent \u2014 particularly in the last quarter of 2022 \u2014 with $39 billion in healthtech acquisitions in Europe in 2022, per Dealroom. And it's a trend that's expected to continue well into 2023.\n\nSome hefty deals included AstraZeneca's acquisition of Neogene Therapeutics for $320 million, and Arcutis nabbing Ducentis Biotherapeutics for $400 million.\n\nLatham \"expected the continued growth of M&A\" in the coming year \u2013 adding that he \"wouldn't be surprised to see more US acquisitions of UK and European healthtech, if the dollar remains strong.\"\n\n4. Generalist VCs started moving into healthcare investing\n\nHealthtech startups often provide clinical-grade treatments, and so verifying the science is an important aspect when conducting due diligence \u2014 a feat that health-focused funds may find easier. But this year has seen more generalist VCs enter the playing field.\n\n\"A lot of generalist investors are now making a long-term bet on healthtech in general,\" Gilmartin told Insider.\n\nFounders have noticed this trend. Henry Majed, cofounder of mental health startup MyMynd, noted an influx of generalist VCs enter the mental health sector after many healthtech heavyweights had invested in the first-generation of startups.\n\n\"Generalist VCs are moving into mental health and wellbeing now,\" he said. \"They were waiting for that shakedown to happen, to look for the best players in the sector.\"", "label": "human"}

This, in turn, has sparked the creation of \u201cdeveloper forums\u201d, which are intended to provide developers with a platform for expressing their thoughts and concerns about the current state of game development, as well as providing a space for constructive feedback from the community.\n\nThe discovery of the secret room in Lashes Out is a sign of the importance of allowing developers more freedom and autonomy to create their own works, and hopefully this will pave the way for a more honest and open dialogue between publishers, developers and the gaming community.", "label": "machine"}

In response, hundreds of thousands of people flocked to Rome to pay their respects.\n\nThe funeral, which was celebrated by Pope Francis, began at 10:00AM at St. Peter's Square. An honor guard of cardinals and bishops walked in a solemn procession bearing the late Pope's body, followed by a large crowd of faithful mourners.\n\nAt 11:00AM, the crowd in St. Peter's Square silently bowed their heads to honor the late Pope as the bell tolled from St. Peter's Basilica. Pope Francis led the congregation in prayers, while music was provided by an orchestra and a choir.\n\nAt noon, Pope Francis and representatives from other religions offered a memorial prayer for Pope Benedict. The procession continued with a procession of cardinals and bishops carrying the late Pope's casket to St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nInside the Basilica, the Pope led a Mass of Christian burial. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, offered a moving homily in remembrance of Pope Benedict.\n\nThe funeral Mass concluded with the lighting of candles, at which point all of the faithful attending the Mass in the Basilica sang the traditional Salve Regina in his honor. The crowd outside St. Peter's Square also joined in the singing, and as the sun set on Rome, the bells tolled again to signal the completion of the funeral.\n\nLater that evening, Pope Francis joined thousands of people for a candlelight vigil to remember Pope Benedict. As the crowd lit hundreds of candles and sang together, the Pope spoke of his deep sadness at the passing of Pope Benedict. He said that it was a sorrowful day but that he was determined to carry on the legacy of Pope Benedict and continue the good works that he had started.\n\nAfter the candlelight vigil, the Pope returned to the Vatican, where he welcomed mourners who wished to pay their respects to the late Pope. The crowd inside the Vatican was silent and reverent, many tears flowing as people held hands and prayed for the soul of their beloved former pontiff.\n\nThe funeral of Pope Benedict was a solemn and moving affair, drawing thousands of people from all over the world in a show of faith and love for the former pontiff. As mourners left St. Peter's Square, there was a palpable sense that the spirit of Pope Benedict would live on in the hearts and minds of his flock.", "label": "machine"}

The agreement, first established in 1954, has never been activated, but the U.S. Department of Defense has publicly stated that it would come to Taiwan\u2019s defence if China attacked.\n\nHaig called on other countries, including members of the European Union, to follow the example of the U.S. and sign similar defence agreements with Taiwan.\n\nHe also urged the international community to put more pressure on China by \u201cmaking it clear that it will suffer economic and political consequences if it attacks Taiwan.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the pressure needs to come from a variety of sources, including trade sanctions, financial restrictions, asset freezes, travel bans and visa restrictions, as well as \u201cpublicly shaming\u201d China.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the Chinese Communist Party is not allowed to forget or ignore its ambitions or actions in relation to Taiwan,\u201d said Haig.\n\n\u201cWe must demonstrate that the international community is willing to take action to defend the island\u2019s sovereignty, and to demonstrate the consequences of an attack.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The bare-knuckle political fight among Republicans over Kevin McCarthy's run for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives could signal trouble ahead when lawmakers need to agree on bigger issues, like addressing the nation's debt ceiling.\n\nRepublicans captured a thin House majority in November's midterm elections, breaking the hold of President Joe Biden's Democrats on both chambers of Congress. But instead of moving quickly on their own priorities, a group of about 20 hardliners have prevented the House from getting started by forcing repeated leadership votes.\n\nMcCarthy hopes to win the House gavel in the end by making concessions to his hardline opponents, but his allies warn that those deals would make his job all the more difficult if he wins the speakership and has to corral his narrow 222-212 majority.\n\n\"They've shown that we can't govern, and now they'll help Biden get wins before his reelection,\" fumed Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Texas conservative who backs McCarthy.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing the House in the coming months will be addressing the $31.4 trillion federal debt ceiling, which the U.S. Treasury is expected to reach later this year.\n\nCongress has come to the brink of default over the past years in standoffs over raising the debt ceiling, which is needed to cover costs that lawmakers have previously agreed to take on.\n\nA standoff in 2011 led Standard & Poor's to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time, sending financial markets reeling. Congress most recently managed to lift the debt ceiling in December 2021 only because Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to a rules change allowing it to do so.\n\nThat infuriated many House Republicans, including some who are now leading the opposition to McCarthy and demanding greater control over the House agenda.\n\nRepublican Representative Andy Biggs at the time called McConnell's deal \"offensive and dangerous.\"\n\nA standoff this year could rattle the global economy at a time when recession fears are already widespread.\n\nMcCarthy and many of the hardline Republicans have also vowed to punish Senate Republicans who helped pass a December 2022 bill that kept the government funded through September, averting a shutdown.\n\nAnother opponent, Representative Ralph Norman, said he would not vote for McCarthy because he would not commit to forcing a government shutdown, adding: \"It's a trust issue.\"\n\nSuch a maneuver, the hardliners claim, could force deep spending cuts including changes to the Social Security and Medicare programs, moves they say are necessary to address the nation's rising debt.\n\nUNDERCUTTING AUTHORITY\n\nOne particular concession that McCarthy has agreed to, according to a source, would allow any single member of the House to propose the speaker's ouster at any time, through a procedure called the \"motion to vacate the chair.\"\n\nLawmakers tried to remove House speakers by invoking the rule in 1910 and in 2015, when former Republican Speaker John Boehner resigned after a hardline conservative filed a request to oust him.\n\nUnder Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, such a move could be made only with support from a majority of either party. McCarthy's opponents now want to restore the rule to what it was before Pelosi's reign.\n\n\"The problem is for him that with every concession, he has to wake up every day wondering if he's still going to have his job,\" said Democratic Representative Richard Neal.\n\nBoehner and his successor as speaker, fellow Republican Paul Ryan, both left the post after conflict with conservative hardliners whose influence has since grown.\n\n\"Individual members can now feel emboldened to call a motion to vacate, cause a stink or gum up the works of Congress, if they aren't getting what they want,\" said Kevin Seifert, a former aide to Ryan, who opted not to seek reelection in 2018 as the caucus took a harder right tack during Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\"That will continue through the rest of this Congress, regardless of who is speaker,\" he added.\n\nMcCarthy has also agreed to give members of the House Freedom Caucus seats on a key rules panel that has jurisdiction over legislation earmarked for votes, the source said, potentially making the House floor harder to govern.\n\nOther concessions, including one that would require 72 hours before a bill could come up for a vote, are likely to slow down House business.\n\n\"It's all about empowering us to stop the machine in this town from doing what it does,\" said Representative Chip Roy, a leading McCarthy opponent.\n\n\"I am open to whatever will give me the power to defend my constituents against this godforsaken city.\"\n\nReporting by David Morgan, additional reporting by Richard Cowan and Gram Slattery; Editing by Scott Malone and Cynthia Osterman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (UNG) is a rapidly growing exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has been garnering attention from both energy investors and energy traders alike in recent years.\n\nThis ETF has become increasingly popular due to the fact that it offers exposure to a volatile market without needing to own actual natural gas assets or futures.

Chris Stewart, a Republican from Utah. The two were discussing the various state of the Democratic and Republican parties after the primary elections and the likeliness of a contested convention.\n\nWhen Burnett asked Stewart if he thought that Mitt Romney would be a good choice for the GOP, Stewart dodged the question, instead opting to go on a tangent about how socialism had taken root in American politics.\n\n\u201cNo, I don't think he's the right choice and I think young people are realizing it,\u201d he said, addressing Burnett as \u201cyoung lady.\u201d\n\nBurnett, visibly irritated by the remark, interrupted him: \u201cCongressman, I'm not a young lady, I'm actually a grown woman. I'm 43. I'm not a young lady.\u201d\n\nThe response from viewers was overwhelmingly supportive of Burnett, with many applauding her for standing up for herself and for not backing down in the face of a sexist remark. \n\n\u201cYou go, girl!\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n\n\u201cThat moment when Erin Burnett called out a Congressman for referring to her as a \u201cyoung lady\u201d was all of us. Respectful AF,\u201d wrote another.\n\nBurnett's response to the congressman was seen as an important act of reclaiming her own self-respect, especially as a woman in the predominantly male-dominated realm of broadcast journalism. It was a reminder that a woman's identity is not defined by her age, but rather by her accomplishments and her own agency.\n\nBurnett has had quite a distinguished career in journalism and she continues to be a trailblazer in her field. In 2003, she became the first female news anchor for the financial news channel CNBC, and since then she has held many noteworthy positions within the industry.\n\nBurnett is no stranger to the rigors of covering news events, and her tough-as-nails demeanor can be seen on her popular CNN show \u2018Outfront\u2019. She is known to be a formidable interviewer and isn't one to back down in the face of difficult questions or the like.\n\nHer response to the congressman in the New Hampshire primaries may have been brief, but it was yet another demonstration of her fortitude and her own commitment to her self-respect and dignity as a woman.\n\nThe moment was a stark reminder that women, even in powerful positions such as broadcast journalism, are often subjected to objectification and sexist remarks from those who are in power. But Burnett's response has resonated with many women and girls who continue to fight sexism and misogyny every day. \n\nBurnett, who is a mother of two, has already been hailed for her courage and strength of character in the face of the congressman's remark. However, what was truly inspiring about the moment was how Burnett used her power to send a strong message to anyone who might ever make such a comment again.\n\nBurnett's unwavering response should serve as a reminder that, while respectful dialogue should be a given, all women must continue to use their own power to stand up for themselves and their rights as equals.", "label": "machine"}

But for former Salesforce executive and startup COO Nicole Diamantis, that couldn't have been further from the truth.\n\nDiamantis, who started her career at Salesforce in 2010, quickly rose through the ranks, taking on senior-level roles in product and technology at the software giant. However, despite her success in the corporate world, she found herself on a path that was taking her further and further away from her personal life.\n\n\"When I was in that Salesforce executive role, I had no work boundaries,\" she said. \"I worked crazy long hours and felt I had to be always available and always 'on.' There was a certain pressure that was there that I felt I had to do more and be more\u2014or else I'd get left behind. I started to feel like I was in a really deep downward spiral.\"\n\nDiamantis, who was also working on the side for a startup, eventually realized the detrimental effect the long hours and lack of work/life balance were having on her life. In 2015, she left her job at Salesforce to become the COO at a startup, but even then, her workaholism continued.\n\n\"In my mind, I had to be doing more and more, because I was a startup COO and I had so much to do,\" she said. \"I would work days, nights, weekends\u2014it didn't matter, I just felt like I had to work all the time. I became so obsessed with work and consumed by it. I was burning the candle at both ends\u2014physically, mentally, and emotionally.\"\n\nThe situation came to a head when Diamantis had a health scare and was forced to take a step back and look at her life. She realized that she had to make a change, so she left the startup and committed to finding a better work/life balance.\n\n\"I had to learn work boundaries the hard way,\" she said. \"It took some time, but I finally realized that there was a point where I was no longer productive\u2014that working longer and harder was actually leading to less efficiency. Once I got to that point, I was able to prioritize tasks and set limits for myself.\"\n\nNow, Diamantis has a healthier approach to work. She has set boundaries for herself\u2014including not checking email on the weekends or after hours\u2014and she has a designated time each day where she turns off all electronics and takes time to relax and recharge.\n\n\"I'm learning to be more present in the moment and enjoy the little things,\" she said. \"It's hard to do, but I'm finding that the more I can be conscious and intentional about how I'm spending my time, the more satisfied and productive I am at work. It took me a while to learn this lesson, but it's been invaluable for me.\"\n\nFor anyone else struggling to maintain a healthy work/life balance, Diamantis suggests focusing on \"the three R's\": rest, recovery, and reflection. Taking the time to get adequate rest and recovery, as well as reflecting on the tasks you accomplished during the day can help you stay focused and productive without burning out.\n\n\"It's OK to take a break and let yourself relax,\" she said. \"We can all learn from my experience and be more mindful of how we use our time and how we can have a more balanced life.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "This point is set out by the Supreme Court in Byrd v. Raines, a 1997 case brought by the late Senator Robert Byrd, whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was Senator Manchin. Byrd was an inveterate advocate of the institutional power of Congress. On behalf of Congress, in his official capacity, and not because of any injury to him, Byrd, along with others, challenged the Line Item Veto Act. That law allowed the president to cancel spending and tax measures in a bill even after the president signed it into law. The court held that individual members of Congress had no standing to challenge an injury to Congress as an institution: Rather, it was up to Congress to take away the president\u2019s authority expressly. Here too, if Congress did not like the amount of debt that Congress had incurred, there is a simple institutional remedy\u2014pass a law, admittedly over the president\u2019s veto, to slash Social Security or anything else it likes. After all, Congress can shut down the funding of the federal government. What it cannot do is to challenge the validity of the public debt.\n\nThe question arises: To what extent does the Biden administration, or the Democrats in Congress, really want to stop the GOP from engineering a default? Give some rope to the GOP to hang the Constitution, and it may end up hanging the GOP instead. Let the public see that the House Republican caucus is ready to destroy the public credit in order to slash Social Security and Medicare, which could be the price it demands from Biden. Republicans\u2019 intransigence would leave them on the hook for all the chaos in the financial markets that a debt ceiling breach would unleash. On that issue alone, the Democrats might bring about the destruction of the GOP. It may seem appealing to let the House ruin the public debt if it destroys the GOP.\n\nBut the cost is too high. Debt has been the country\u2019s greatest asset, as Hamilton knew it would be. Debt let us grow. Debt let us win World Wars I and II. In this century, debt saved us from the financial crisis. Debt let us survive Covid. A fine recent book, In Defense of Public Debt, by four distinguished economists, explains how much we owe to debt. We have an obligation to save it for crises ahead and use every means, legal or political, that may help to do so. It is typical of the GOP to treat the country\u2019s debts as dishonorably as Trump treats his own. Default is his business model.

These roles will include customer service, barista, and even \u201cvirtual barista\u201d roles.\n\nThis shift is part of a larger effort to become a \u201cworkforce-lite\u201d company. Starbucks plans to reduce its number of in-store baristas and other non-store personnel by 30% in the next five years. This move comes on the heels of similar moves by companies like Amazon, who recently announced plans to automate parts of its workforce.\n\nThe Seattle-based company is emphasizing that it will still employ skilled personnel and provide career paths for them. \u201cThe future of Starbucks is all about improving customer experience and utilizing digital tools, such as mobile ordering and customer-facing digital monitors, to do so,\u201d said Kris Engskov, executive vice president and president of US operations. \u201cWe remain committed to our baristas, who are essential to our customer experience.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the changes in staffing, Starbucks has also announced plans to equip all its stores with new automated technologies. It plans to install self-ordering kiosks in nearly 10,000 stores around the world in the next five years. The kiosks will allow customers to order items by scanning QR codes and paying with their phones or other digital payment methods. Starbucks also plans to use facial recognition technology to personalize customer experiences and display targeted promotions.\n\nAt the same time, the company is investing in new training programs for its employees. It recently announced a new \u201cStarbucks Experience University\u201d, designed to train its personnel in the latest technologies and give them the skills to better serve customers.\n\nAnalysts have praised Starbucks\u2019s decision to focus on customer experience and digital tools, citing the potential to expand the company\u2019s presence and customer base. \u201cStarbucks has been a leader in customer service and digital innovation for years, and this move further cements their place as one of the most forward-thinking companies out there,\u201d said Andy Ellwood, CEO of the market research firm BIA/Kelsey.\n\nThe company\u2019s new strategy will likely have an impact on the wider food and beverage industry, particularly among smaller, independent operators.

Last summer, she revealed her natural hair for an iconic photoshoot for Vogue.\n\nAt the time, she spoke about the power of embracing her curls and how important it was for her to show her fans her true self. \n\nIn the accompanying interview, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important for me to remind myself, and for other women, to not be afraid to love their true selves. I hope that if I can shine a light on others not to be afraid to be themselves, they can do that.\u201d\n\nKardashian isn\u2019t alone in her desire to showcase her natural curls. Many celebrities have embraced their natural texture in recent months, including Ariana Grande, Taraji P. Henson, and Yara Shahidi.\n\nThe importance of embracing natural hair and being a positive role model for diverse beauty is something that can\u2019t be understated. Kardashian\u2019s latest reveal is a powerful message that you can love yourself, no matter what your natural hair texture looks like.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "of 2023. \n\nIt\u2019s the start of the new year, and Wells Fargo is ready to offer some tactical investing ideas for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWith the U.S. economy continuing its slow but steady recovery from the coronavirus-fueled recession, and stock markets around the world remaining volatile, investors are looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve. That\u2019s why Wells Fargo has put together a list of tactical investing ideas for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe first and perhaps most important tip the firm suggests is to take a long-term view. With the U.S. economy still rebounding from the pandemic-induced recession, and stock markets worldwide remaining volatile, now is not the time to panic and rush into short-term investments. Instead, Wells Fargo suggests focusing on opportunities that can provide long-term returns.\n\nWells Fargo also recommends diversifying your investments. As the U.S. economy remains uncertain, investors should spread their money across different asset classes and sectors. This will help reduce the risk of an investment gone awry and allow investors to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise in the markets.\n\nWhen it comes to specific investments, Wells Fargo believes commodities are the way to go. The firm suggests taking advantage of the rally in oil, which has been driven by rising global demand and supply disruptions. The firm also notes that precious metals, such as gold and silver, remain attractive options for investors who want to hedge their bets against inflation.\n\nInvestors should also look for opportunities in the tech sector. Despite the sector's recent sell-off, the technology sector still has the potential to outperform in the long term. Wells Fargo recommends that investors focus on companies with strong balance sheets and long-term growth potential, such as Amazon and Apple.\n\nFinally, Wells Fargo recommends that investors stay up to date on global developments. With the U.S. dollar weakening against foreign currencies, there may be opportunities to invest in emerging markets, such as China and India, which have recently seen strong economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, investors should keep in mind that the global economy is in a state of flux, and markets remain volatile. By keeping a long-term view and diversifying investments across multiple asset classes, sectors, and countries, investors can mitigate the risk of any one investment going bad and take advantage of opportunities that may arise. By following these simple tips, investors can position themselves to make the most of the first quarter of 2023.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "?\n\nIt's hard to miss the fact that interest rates are on the rise. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate to 1.50% in December, the highest level in 15 years. While the Fed's action was expected, it's still a stark reminder of the rising costs for borrowers of all kinds.\n\nThe rate increase was the third of the year and will likely lead to higher rates for borrowers, who are already dealing with near-historic highs for some home loan products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and jumbo loans.\n\nFor those wondering what to do about higher rates, experts offer the following advice:\n\nKnow Your Financing Options\n\nNot all loans are created equal, so it pays to shop around to find the best deal.\n\nFor example, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, one of the most popular loan options, is currently hovering around 4%, which is still historically low. But a 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage, with its rate fixed for five years before adjusting annually, is around 3.5% - a rate that won't rise until after that initial period is over.\n\nRates also vary by lender, so it pays to compare options to ensure you're getting the best rate you can.\n\nKeep an Eye on Rates\n\nInterest rates can change daily, so it's important to stay on top of fluctuations if you're looking to refinance or apply for a loan.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also sets a federal funds rate, which influences how other interest rates move. Knowing when the Fed is expected to raise rates can help you plan for when you should refinance or apply for a loan.\n\nConsider Other Financing Options\n\nWhen it comes to financing, there's more than just conventional mortgages and home equity loans available.\n\nFor instance, some home buyers may be able to qualify for an FHA loan, which is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, but have to pay an upfront mortgage insurance premium. These loans also have a lower credit score requirement than a conventional mortgage.\n\nVeterans may also be able to qualify for a VA loan, which is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. These loans come with relaxed credit and down payment requirements, plus there is no mortgage insurance required.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, you may be able to qualify for a state or local housing loan, which can often provide financing at more favorable interest rates than conventional products.\n\nStay on Top of Your Credit Score\n\nYour credit score is an important factor in determining your interest rate, so it pays to know your credit history and keep it in good shape.\n\nPay your bills on time, maintain a low debt-to-income ratio and keep the number of hard inquiries to a minimum. These steps can help you boost your credit score and, as a result, could make you eligible for a better rate.\n\nBe Prepared\n\nThe higher interest rate environment is here to stay, so borrowers should be prepared to pay a premium for their loans. While rates may still be low by historical standards, they are expected to continue to rise in the near future.\n\nThat's why it pays to know your financing options and stay on top of your credit score. Doing so can help you find the best deal and make sure you can still afford a loan when rates are higher.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "or triple\n\nNasdaq stocks are in the spotlight this week as analysts and industry experts forecast a significant rally in the coming year. With some expecting a potential doubling or tripling of share prices, investors are optimistic that this surge could be the beginning of a much-needed boost to the Nasdaq.\n\nThe experts cite a number of reasons for this optimism, ranging from the continued rebound of the global economy to the increasing stability of the markets after the pandemic. \"We're already seeing a rebound in sectors such as retail and technology, which were heavily affected by the pandemic,\" said Bill Stevens, a financial analyst at Raymond James. \"Now, as the world gradually returns to normal, these sectors are expected to pick up even more momentum in the coming year.\"\n\nAs the global economy begins to recover, the Nasdaq is expected to benefit from the newfound confidence. According to Matt Crowley, a financial analyst from Merrill Lynch, \"Investors are more willing to take risks in the Nasdaq, which means that stock prices are likely to increase as well. We are seeing signs of growth across all sectors, and this should continue in the coming year.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq also stands to benefit from several key developments that have occurred over the past few months. For example, the agreement between the U.S. and China to end tariffs has raised hopes that the global economy is finally beginning to stabilize. Additionally, the decision by the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates at historic lows has buoyed sentiment in the financial markets.\n\nAnalysts from some of the world's largest banks, such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have recently shared their bullish outlook for Nasdaq stocks in the coming year. According to Goldman Sachs, \"We are expecting a strong rally in the Nasdaq in 2023, with several stocks in the index likely to double or even triple in price by the end of the year.\"\n\nAnalysts have also identified a number of individual stocks that they believe are poised for a big rally in 2023. Some of these stocks include Zoom Video Communications, Tesla, Square, Crowdstrike Holdings, and Palantir. Each of these companies have seen their share price increase significantly over the past year and have strong fundamentals that suggest further growth in the coming year.\n\nThe optimism surrounding the Nasdaq is shared by many investors, and it appears that the markets are ready for a significant rally in the coming months.

{"text": "After a tough start to the year, BNY Mellon investments have emerged as the top-performing fund providers of 2022, according to recently released figures. The two funds, the BNY Mellon Global Equity Series Fund and the BNY Mellon International Equity Series Fund, achieved a combined return of 40.13% and 45.41%, respectively, over the past year. This impressive performance put them both in the top 20% of all mutual funds, a remarkable achievement. \n\nThe two funds are managed by the same team at BNY Mellon, and they share a common philosophy: focus on fundamentals. This means avoiding strategies that rely too heavily on short-term speculation, and instead taking the time to research and understand long-term trends.\n\nThe Global Equity Series Fund, which invests primarily in US-based stocks and has a portfolio of around 50 holdings, focuses on companies with strong fundamentals. The team behind the fund aims to select investments that have the potential to reward investors over the long run.\n\nSimilarly, the International Equity Series Fund takes a longer-term view, investing in companies from around the world. While the fund does hold some well-known multinational corporations, it also looks for smaller, lesser-known companies with strong potential. By investing in these businesses, the fund can capitalize on the potential of their growth.\n\nThese funds don\u2019t just rely on traditional stock analysis methods. They use a range of quantitative tools and techniques to identify companies that are poised to outperform their peers. This includes analyzing historical trends, macroeconomic data, and trends in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the results of our investments,\u201d said BNY Mellon Investment Management\u2019s Global Head of Research, Christina Chang. \u201cWe strive to invest in stocks and companies with strong fundamentals, and it has paid off. We are optimistic that this performance will continue into the future.\u201d\n\nThis strong performance is just the latest example of BNY Mellon\u2019s long-term investment strategy. The firm has a track record of success, with the Global Equity Series Fund outperforming the broader US equity market by nearly 10% over the past three years.\n\nIn addition to focusing on fundamentals, BNY Mellon believes in taking a global approach to investing. The company has more than $1 trillion in assets under management, and invests in markets around the world. This helps the firm identify attractive opportunities in the markets of today, as well as tomorrow.\n\nThe Global Equity Series Fund and the International Equity Series Fund have been major drivers of BNY Mellon\u2019s performance in 2022, and the firm is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.

{"text": "A former NFL player who attended the University of Michigan says he wants to ensure that allegations of sexual abuse made against a former university doctor are heard and addressed.\n\nRobert Anderson, an offensive tackle with the Detroit Lions in the late 1970s, recently wrote a letter to the school's president, requesting an independent investigation into the allegations against former University of Michigan physician Robert Anderson.\n\nIn the letter, Anderson wrote:\n\n\"As a former student athlete at Michigan, I am deeply troubled by the reports of former student athletes and non-athletes who were victims of sexual abuse by Robert Anderson. I feel compelled to stand up for their story to be heard and addressed. I request a meeting with you and other members of the Michigan leadership team to discuss how we can do what is best for those who were abused, those still currently enrolled, and for the university as a whole.\"\n\nThe allegations against Dr. Anderson were first reported in 2018. At the time, the university conducted an internal investigation and determined that Anderson had sexually abused hundreds of students, often under the guise of medical examinations, throughout his tenure as a doctor at the university.\n\nDespite the findings of the investigation, Anderson had never been criminally charged and no criminal charges were ever filed against him.\n\nAnderson's letter sparked a new wave of reports from former Michigan students who said they had also been abused by Anderson.\n\nIn response to Anderson's letter, the university said it had taken additional steps to ensure the safety of its students, including hiring a full-time investigator to look into the allegations and creating an independent committee to review the university's handling of the Anderson case.\n\n\"We understand how important it is that these survivors have their stories heard and that their voices are respected,\" university spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said in a statement. \"We will make sure that their stories are heard as we continue to move forward with this important process.\"\n\nThe university has also set up a hotline for survivors of sexual abuse and created a website to provide additional information and resources for those affected. \n\nIn addition to the university's efforts, Anderson is also hoping to draw more attention to the allegations against Anderson, and to encourage other survivors to come forward. \n\n\"I have spoken to many former classmates who experienced the same kind of abuse at the hands of Anderson,\" Anderson said in a statement. \"It is devastating to hear these stories, and it's heartbreaking to know that they have suffered in silence for so long. I want to use my platform to help ensure that their stories are heard.\"\n\nAnderson has set up a website and is encouraging other survivors to share their stories, as well as giving information to victims on how to seek justice.\n\n\"I want to ensure that no other student is ever subjected to the abuses that took place under the guise of medical care,\" Anderson said. \"It is critical that students, alumni and parents feel confident in the safety of our campus, and it is up to all of us to hold the university accountable.\"\n\nAs the university continues to investigate the allegations against Anderson, Anderson and other former student-athletes are hoping that the attention surrounding the case will result in meaningful change, and that justice is served for those who were abused.\n\n\"My hope is that these survivors find the courage to come forward and speak their truth,\" Anderson said. \"I want to make sure that these stories are not forgotten and that justice is finally served.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Another day, another Trumpworld memoir. The latest damning dispatch from the Trump Administration comes courtesy of Stephanie Grisham, who served various roles in the White House throughout a four-year period: communications director and press secretary in the West Wing, as well as communications director and chief of staff in Melania Trump\u2019s East Wing. In I\u2019ll Take Your Questions Now, her new memoir, Grisham depicts a White House \u201cwhere everything was like a clown car on fire running at full speed into a warehouse of fireworks.\u201d Caught between the president\u2019s abusive leadership style and the conflicting loyalties she felt toward the first lady, Grisham\u2019s final straw came on January 6, 2021, when she tendered her resignation hours into the insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nThe Trumps, for their part, have already moved to discredit Grisham. Describing Grisham as \u201cvery angry and bitter\u201d after a break-up, President Trump said in a statement, \u201cStephanie didn\u2019t have what it takes and that was obvious from the beginning. She had big problems and we felt that she should work out those problems for herself. Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.\u201d Melania Trump also clapped back, saying in a statement, \"The author is desperately trying to rehabilitate her tarnished reputation by manipulating and distorting the truth about Mrs. Trump. Ms. Grisham is a deceitful and troubled individual who doesn\u2019t deserve anyone\u2019s trust.\"\n\nGrisham\u2019s account, like any Trumpworld memoir, must be read with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, as Grisham herself admits, \u201cCasual dishonesty filtered through the White House as though it were in the air conditioning system.\u201d But Grisham anticipates that readers may not take her account at face value, writing, \u201cThis is not, by the way, a book where you need to like me.\u201d We read I\u2019ll Take Your Questions Now in advance of publication; now, we\u2019re breaking down the biggest bombshells below.\n\nFirst up: Grisham offers insight into the daily routines of the first lady, and the derisive nickname they inspired:\n\nI could count only a handful of times over the years that Mrs. Trump was actually in her office. She preferred to run things via text or phone calls, which initially made it hard to set an agenda and form a close working relationship. Mrs. Trump was working from home long before the country was\u2026 the First Lady kept to her rooms in the residence. That became a running joke among those who knew her. The Secret Service unofficially dubbed her \u2018Rapunzel\u2019 because she remained in her tower, never descending. In fact, some agents tried to get assigned to her detail because they knew the First Lady\u2019s limited movements and travel meant that they could spend more time at home with their families.\n\nAccording to Grisham, there was no lost love between Melania Trump and her stepchildren, particularly Ivanka Trump:\n\nIvanka was constantly getting into the press shots that truly should have been reserved for the president and first lady. It was yet another example of the Kushners putting themselves on the same level as the first couple, and it was unseemly. For Mrs. Trump, it was about protocol and the rules; or all of us as staff, it was about allowing her to be in her role and have the people of the United States see her representing them with dignity and class\u2026 Mrs. Trump seemed relieved to see that I shared her frustrations with her daughter-in-law, so much so that she eventually let me in on the nickname she had privately given her: \u2018the Princess.\u2019 Many times after that I would hear one of her favorite stock complaints, \u2018Princess always runs to her father.\u2019\n\nJared Kushner is described as \"Rasputin in a slim-fitting suit.\" Anadolu Agency // Getty Images\n\nInappropriate behavior on the part of the Kushners earned the couple their own derisive nickname. \u201cBecause they dabbled in a bit of everything and could be precocious and self-absorbed, we in the East Wing dubbed [the Kushners] \u2018the interns,\u2019\u201d Grisham writes. \u201cMrs. Trump was amused and herself used the nickname every now and then.\u201d Tension between the East Wing and the Kushners is an enduring theme throughout the book, with Grisham continually emphasizing the conflicts of interest proposed by the Kushners\u2019 role in the administration. Take, for example, the matter of Jared Kushner\u2019s security clearance:\n\nThe greatest irony, of course, was when I heard that Jared Kushner never got a security clearance because of all of his issues, financial interests, and so on. As far as I know, he only ever got the most basic clearance, yet he was in all of the most important meetings of the administration. He also reached out directly to many heads of state, such as Benjamin Netanyahu and the leadership of the Saudi government, something no staffer should ever do, let alone if they had no top security clearance.\n\nRemembering when Kushner teamed up with speechwriter Stephen Miller to write a televised address at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Grisham writes at length about what she saw as Kushner\u2019s poisonous influence in the White House:\n\nI had shared with Mrs. Trump many times my opinion that if we lost reelection in 2020 it would be because of Jared. She didn\u2019t disagree with me. It was my fervent opinion that his arrogance and presumption had grown over the years, and he threw his power about with absolutely no shame. I would venture to say that being in the White House changed Jared as a person. There was no reason that he should be sitting with the speechwriter laying out our nation\u2019s plan to fight a global pandemic. And I knew that if things went badly with the speech, which felt inevitable, he would be the first person to say in the president\u2019s ear that the comms team had fucked it all up. He was Rasputin in a slim-fitting suit.\n\nBut the Kushners aren\u2019t the only Trumpworld acolytes to come under fire in I\u2019ll Take Your Questions Now. Grisham doesn\u2019t mince words when writing about Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham:\n\nLindsey Graham? Well, it struck me that he was using Trump to mop up the freebies like there was no tomorrow (seems that he still is). He would show up at Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster to play free rounds of golf, stuff his face with free food, and hang out with Trump and his celebrity pals. On one occasion, I came across him at Bedminster after he\u2019d kicked out a White House staff member so he could take her room. Senator Freeloader was sitting at a table by the pool, a big grin on his face, lapping up the goodies he was getting like some potentate. He said to me, with a creepy little smile, \u2018Isn\u2019t this great? Man, this is the life.\u2019\n\nGrisham, like many other Trumpworld alums, takes note of Trump\u2019s obsession with dictators. But it\u2019s her recollection of 2019\u2019s G20 Summit in Osaka that\u2019s the most chilling, suggesting an all-too cozy rapport between Trump and Vladimir Putin:\n\nTrump would usually spend a minute or two talking about what \u2018animals\u2019 the reporters could be, and then the press would come in. With President Putin, Trump started out the same, then changed his tone. With all the talk of sanctions against Russia for interfering in the 2016 election and for various human rights abuses, Trump told Putin, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going to act a little tougher with you for a few minutes. But it\u2019s for the camera, and after they leave we\u2019ll talk. You understand.\u2019\n\nThe most interesting moments in I'll Take Your Questions Now come when Grisham offers a look behind the scenes of memorable moments. Take, for example, her recollections about the hand slap heard \u2018round the world. In 2017, Melania Trump made headlines when she appeared to slap her husband\u2019s hand away during a diplomatic visit to Saudi Arabia in 2017. The truth, according to Grisham, is less interesting:\n\nI'll Take Your Questions Now: What I Saw at the Trump White House I'll Take Your Questions Now: What I Saw at the Trump White House Now 55% Off $13 at Amazon\n\nFor those who care to know, Mrs. Trump \u2018slapped\u2019 her husband\u2019s hand away that day because she thought it was against protocol to hold hands at such a formal ceremony. Melania was a rule follower, sometimes to a fault, and her husband knew that. He often tried to hold her hand or messed with her hands on purpose in front of the cameras to irritate her.\n\nGrisham also delves into the Stormy Daniels scandal from 2018, remembering when Daniels sued Donald Trump over his efforts to suppress her disclosure of their affair. In the ensuing media blitz, Daniels likened Trump\u2019s penis to a toadstool\u2014a depiction he took such issue with that he called Grisham from Air Force One to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cDid you see what she said about me?\u201d He said after a moment, referring to Stormy. Then he added, unsurprisingly, \u201cAll lies. All lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nThen I figured out exactly what he was concerned about. \u201cEverything down there is fine,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat the hell was I supposed to say to that? I kept it to a simple \u201cOkay,\u201d praying that somehow we\u2019d get disconnected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he repeated.\n\n\"It\u2019s fine.\" Pool // Getty Images\n\nRemember Trump's mysterious visit to Walter Reed Medical Center in 2019, when protocol was disrupted and doctors were asked to sign NDAs? Grisham takes us behind the scenes there, too.\n\nI was reminded of what had happened in the fall of 2019 when Trump had made a seemingly impromptu visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. I was informed, as were a small handful of others, including Vice President Pence, of the reason for the visit. Pence was told he had to stick around town \u201cjust in case.\u201d What I was not allowed to tell anyone at the time was that the president was having a very common procedure that all men and women over the age of fifty should have. In such a procedure, a patient is sometimes put under. In Trump\u2019s case that could mean signing a letter under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to put Pence temporarily in charge, but the president was ultimately not put under, I believe simply so he wouldn\u2019t have to be perceived as giving up power.\n\nBut we know the real behind-the-scenes story you want to know about: behind the scenes of Trump's haircare routine. Grisham has got you covered:\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s hair, when not perfectly coiffed, was a sight to behold. There is no way to describe exactly how he styles that magnificent and very wild mane of his, but it involves a comb, a hair dryer, and a shit ton of hair spray. His hair is much longer than I had imagined, like multiple inches from end to end. He cuts it himself with a huge pair of scissors that could probably cut a ribbon at an opening at one of his properties.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now, dear reader. We\u2019ll see you next time there's a Trumpworld memoir to excavate, which surely won\u2019t be long.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Critics called 2022 \u201cthe year of the botched execution\u201d\u2014and it was indeed an infamous period, mainly because the state of Alabama lost the ability to competently kill prisoners in its charge while retaining the sovereignty to try.\n\nOn July 28, Alabama executed Joe Nathan James Jr., a convicted murderer. And, for some reason\u2014the precise cause remains a mystery because of the extreme degree of confidentiality the state guarantees its executioners\u2014the execution team working that night botched their task badly, piercing James all over his body before evidently cutting into his arm, presumably in search of a visible vein in which to insert an IV catheter. They nevertheless managed to kill him, the results of their work clear in the early-August autopsy I witnessed. I left that experience convinced that Alabama\u2019s next execution would also likely unfold against protocol.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: Dead to rights\n\nWith that in mind, I headed to Alabama again on September 22, the scheduled execution date of another man, Alan Eugene Miller. I was there that night when, after an hour or more of failed attempts, executioners exhausted their efforts at getting two needles into two of Miller\u2019s veins, and state authorities called off his death.\n\nUndaunted by their two consecutive failures in the execution chamber, Alabama promptly scheduled another death-row prisoner, Kenneth Smith, to die. I immediately made Smith\u2019s acquaintance and agreed to attend his killing as well. On November 17, Alabama again tried and again failed to execute its man. Smith spoke with me later that night, once he was back in his cell, and told me how his would-be executioners had pierced his arms and hands and finally his neck underneath his collarbone before abandoning their efforts.\n\nAt that point, Alabama finally acknowledged what had been clear to me since early August: Inside the state\u2019s execution chamber, there is a crisis deserving of investigative review. On November 21, Governor Kay Ivey ordered a temporary halt to executions so that the Alabama Department of Corrections could assess its execution methodology and personnel before moving forward. But this is not to say that Alabama is evolving; if notions of progress were distributed evenly among the states, this would be the point in the story where I would be able to report that this series of botched executions had caused Alabama\u2019s leaders to consider abandoning the death penalty altogether. Instead, Alabama is choosing a path of technical, rather than moral, innovation.\n\nThe state appears to be preparing to premiere a new kind of execution by lethal gas. In the gas chambers of old, little cells were filled with poison that eventually destroyed the organs of the trapped prisoners, resulting in death. Now Alabama proposes to use nitrogen gas to replace enough oxygen to kill via hypoxia, an untested method once imagined in a National Review article and made manifest in a plastic gas mask.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren made a certain presumption about the relationship between moral and technological progress, and that presumption shaped his interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, which bans cruel and unusual punishment. It went like this: As societies develop, their moral sensibilities tend to become more refined as well. Or, as Warren put it, writing in Trop v. Dulles, \u201cThe Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d In other words, Americans ought to aspire to more and more humane means of punishment, and the law ought to be understood as cooperative in that effort.\n\nAnd yet, though several methods of execution have fallen into disfavor across history, the Supreme Court has never formally banned one, instead allowing states to choose from many archaic ways to kill prisoners. Lethal gas, for example, remains an artifact of the past and a specter of the future, both lethal injection\u2019s inferior predecessor and its current statutory alternative in a small number of states\u2014Alabama among them.\n\nAmerica\u2019s executions with gas began roughly 100 years ago, at the outset of a century that would witness the industrial-level use of cyanide in Germany\u2019s death camps. Scott Christianson\u2019s book The Last Gasp: The Rise and Fall of the American Gas Chamber notes an inflection point in America\u2019s experiment with gas in March of 1921, when Nevada Governor Emmet Boyle signed the Humane Execution Bill into law, requiring future executions to be carried out with lethal gas. The new law endeavored to replace older, uglier methods\u2014hanging and electrocution\u2014with a manner of dying that was promised to be painless and bloodless. Instead, on February 8, 1924, Nevada prison officials led the Chinese immigrant Gee Jon to a converted stone barber house that would be flooded with a gaseous form of hydrocyanic acid commercially known as cyanogen, a highly toxic substance used industrially to manufacture fertilizer and exterminate insects. Witnesses watched through the brick outbuilding\u2019s window that morning as Gee gasped and convulsed amid the haze of lethal gas that filled the chamber. One military physician who observed the execution that day would later report that the death house\u2019s heating had failed, causing the gas to partially liquefy rather than vaporize, then collect on the floor of the chamber where it remained in a deadly pool for hours after Gee\u2019s death. That same physician would also later speculate that Gee, who had been poisoned on a frigid day at roughly 9:45 a.m. and who was not removed from his shackles until after noon, had likely died of cold and exposure.\n\nS. Frank Thompson: I know what it\u2019s like to carry out executions\n\nNevertheless, the execution was hailed as a coup for progress: Finally, after all of the bodies twisting on nooses and smoking under electrocution hoods, there was a scientific, humane execution method. Around the world, people took note: In Soviet Russia, Leon Trotsky was certain that America would soon turn its dastardly weapons on revolutionary Europe; in Germany, the news was met with great interest by researchers for the cyanide industry and budding fascists alike.\n\nMore than 600 people have died in American gas chambers since Nevada\u2019s 1924 experiment. Remarkably, states used gas to execute prisoners even after the term gas chamber became synonymous with Nazi Germany. Though the chamber had promised instantaneous and painless death, the ugliness and risk of its application eventually made it the country\u2019s shortest-lived method of execution, Deborah Denno, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, told me. In plain view of witnesses, prisoners died screaming, convulsing, groaning, and coughing, their hands clawing at their restraints and their eyes bulging and their skin turning cyanic.\n\nThe last of them, Walter LaGrand, was killed in Arizona in 1999. Despite the length of time separating his death from Gee\u2019s, he endured a similarly troubled execution: LaGrand, a German-born American who was convicted of murder, gagged and hacked and then died over the course of 18 minutes. Knowing what prison authorities intended to do well before they strapped LaGrand into the black harness that would contain his body as he choked on poison gas, the government of then\u2013German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der had tried diplomatic interventions to save the man\u2019s life. The irony was lost on Arizona.\n\nAlabama has something slightly different in mind. Nitrogen hypoxia is the dream of Stuart Creque, a technology consultant and filmmaker who, in 1995, proposed the method in an article for National Review, in which he speculated optimistically about the ease and comfort of gas-induced death. After hearing about the potential of nitrogen hypoxia as a lethal agent in a BBC documentary, Oklahoma State Representative Mike Christian brought the idea before Oklahoma\u2019s legislature in 2014 as an alternative to lethal injection. Oklahoma passed a law permitting the use of nitrogen hypoxia as a backup method of execution in the event that lethal injections could no longer be carried out. Mississippi passed similar legislation in 2017; Alabama followed in 2018. With Missouri, California, Wyoming, and Arizona (which have older lethal-gas statutes still on the books), these three nitrogen-curious newcomers make up the handful of governments that could begin attempting to execute people with lethal gas at any time. (Alabama Department of Corrections did not immediately reply to a request to comment for this article.)\n\nAlabama is by no means the ablest of these states, but it is among the more eager. Since the state\u2019s governor announced an execution moratorium pending an investigation, Alabama\u2019s attorney general, Steve Marshall, has been adamant that the killings will resume as soon as possible. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Marshall recently said at a press conference he called to dispense his thoughts on the subject. \u201cThis needs to be expedited and done quickly, because we have victims\u2019 families right now asking when we will be able to set that next date and I need to give them answers,\u201d adding that \u201cjustice delayed is justice denied.\u201d\n\nCourt papers provide clues about where Marshall\u2019s insistence upon speedy executions translates into an interest in gas. Earlier this year, Marshall\u2019s deputy attorney general, James Houts, brandished a gas mask during the deposition of Alan Eugene Miller, one of the men the state tried and failed to execute via lethal injection this fall, and asked Miller if he would be cooperative if prison officials attempted to fit the mask to his face or if he would be upset by the process. A witness to the event described the mask as a large plastic covering that would obscure most of the face, and which was to be locked in place by wide lime-green straps arrayed around the mask like the fixtures of a headlamp. Houts all but assured Miller\u2019s attorneys and a district-court judge that Alabama would be prepared to execute Miller on September 22 of this year via nitrogen hypoxia, though he could not state directly and unequivocally that the state had actually finished developing its nitrogen-hypoxia execution protocol.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Alabama officials weren\u2019t ready, and thus they attempted to kill Miller this fall with the usual cocktail of lethal drugs piped in via needle. Still, their presentation with the gas mask during Miller\u2019s proceedings demonstrated something useful about their approach: Unlike the gas houses of yesteryear, the state is evidently preparing to use a sealed mask attached to some source of nitrogen gas in order to induce hypoxia in a restrained prisoner. For this method of execution to kill successfully, the state will need access to the mask and its tubing, nitrogen gas or its precursors, a sealed chamber for the safety of bystanders, and a detailed plan.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: A history of violence\n\nNitrogen is cheap and widely available, but also extremely dangerous. It has been used as a method of suicide and has killed people in industrial accidents. Deployed at a prison, it could pose a risk to staff in the event of leaks. Just last year, a liquid-nitrogen leak at a Georgia poultry facility resulted in six deaths and 11 hospitalizations. The Alabama Department of Corrections is aware of these risks: James Houts admitted during a court hearing in November that \u201cthe fact that there\u2019s nitrogen gas stored in a certain place\u201d presented \u201cthe dangers of inert-gas asphyxiation to employees.\u201d\n\nHouts added that the state had attempted to contract with a Tennessee-based firm to diagnose and improve their gas-execution system. But that firm terminated their contract with the state in February of this year after protests from local religious leaders, leaving the ADOC without an obvious alternative. This month, a spokesperson for Airgas, a national industrial-gas distributor that has done business with the ADOC in the past, told me over email that \u201cnotwithstanding the philosophical and intellectual debate of the death penalty itself, supplying nitrogen for the purpose of human execution is not consistent with our company values. Therefore, Airgas has not and will not supply Alabama nitrogen or other inert gasses to induce hypoxia for the purpose of human execution.\u201d Airgas\u2019s spokesperson added that the company\u2019s contact in Alabama had been notified of this position upon my outreach. Few vendors, it appears, want to be directly involved with America\u2019s return to the gas chamber.\n\nAlabama will need a finished protocol taking all of the above into account before it is ready to execute the first American by nitrogen hypoxia. As of this fall, state officials seemed not to have one. It would take a certain audacity to be the first state to test an unknown means of execution immediately following three consecutive botched executions. But Alabama\u2019s administrators are nothing if not audacious.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Morbi bridge collapse: Indian family lost 12 members in the Gujarat disaster\n\nMorbi, Gujarat: Early Sunday morning, a tragedy struck the small town of Morbi in the Indian state of Gujarat when a bridge connecting the old town with the new residential and commercial development collapsed, killing 12 people and injuring several others. According to local police, the victims were members of a single family and have been identified as Ashok Patel (45), Rajshree Patel (40), their son Raj (10), daughters Priya (8) and Nisha (5). Their son's wife Heena (22), her brother Sanjay (25), their children Yuvraj (2) and Chetiya (5 months old) and four other members of the family were also killed in the accident.\n\nAt around 4:30 am on Sunday, the Morbi bridge - which is about 200 metres long and 7 metres high - suddenly gave way, plunging the victims and debris into the river below. Some eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud bang before the bridge suddenly caved in. The bridge collapse occurred during peak traffic hours and dozens of vehicles, including two buses, were on it at the time of the accident.\n\nRescue teams arrived at the scene of the accident within minutes and immediately began the arduous task of searching for survivors. Unfortunately, none were found. Witnesses on the scene reported that the bridge had begun to wobble before it collapsed and that there were warnings that the structure was unsafe.\n\nThe chief engineer of Gujarat\u2019s Public Works Department, Pankaj Khandelwal, announced that a team of engineers had been dispatched to examine the structural integrity of the bridge and determine the cause of the collapse.\n\nThe Gujarat government has declared a three-day state mourning in memory of the deceased. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and offered financial assistance.\n\nThe tragedy has been met with much grief and sorrow in the local community. Most of the victims\u2019 family members lived close by and many of them have been rendered homeless due to the disaster. Local NGOs and other organizations have come together to provide assistance to those affected. \n\nThe incident has sparked a debate about the safety of bridges in India, with many criticizing the government for failing to adequately inspect and maintain bridges across the country. Activists have called for more stringent regulations to ensure the safety of bridges, especially those in rural areas. \n\nMany residents have accused the authorities of neglecting to repair or upgrade the bridge despite knowing it was in a poor state. Local police have launched an investigation into the incident and have questioned several government officials in relation to the tragedy.\n\nThe tragedy of the Morbi bridge collapse highlights the need for greater investment in infrastructure and stricter safety regulations for bridges in India. It serves as a reminder of the importance of building resilient structures and of the tragic consequences when these are not adequately maintained.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "It was an exciting year for photography. More photographers than ever before have embraced their passion for capturing the best moments of the year, and the world is reaping the benefits of this amazing art. But this year was especially noteworthy, because women and nonbinary photographers made their presence felt in the world of photography in a big way.\n\nThe contributions of women and nonbinary photographers were seen everywhere throughout 2022, from the political events of the United States to the street fashion of Japan and beyond. Many of these photographers had previously gone unrecognized and their talent overlooked, but this year was different. From galleries to festivals, more people than ever before were noticing the amazing work of these photographers, and their influence was felt throughout the industry.\n\nWe've rounded up some of our favorite work from the women and nonbinary photographers of 2022. Their unique perspectives and artistry shone through in their work, providing a unique insight into the world around them.\n\nOne of the most impressive photographs came from Lisa Grundy. Grundy captured the scene of people waiting in line to vote in the US presidential election in 2022. The photo was a stark reminder of the long history of voter suppression and showed the determination of the American people to have their voices heard. It also highlighted the importance of representation and the power of photography to tell a story.\n\nAlina Hargreaves, meanwhile, chose to focus her work on fashion. Hargreaves captured a series of images documenting the street fashion of Japan and its youth culture. Her photographs were vibrant and full of color, displaying the unique spirit and creativity of the country's people. The work showcased the diversity of fashion around the world and was an inspiration to many.\n\nIn 2022, the world was lucky enough to witness the work of many other talented photographers as well. From classic portraiture to documentary pieces, these photographers' work provided an insight into cultures, beliefs, and experiences around the world.\n\nOne of the most memorable works was a series of photos by Christian O'Neill. This New Zealand-based photographer documented the experiences of protesters during the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. O'Neill's work highlighted the resilience of the protestors and the spirit of hope that drove the movement.\n\nHaruna Kakehashi focused her work on beauty and femininity. In her project \"Bloom,\" Kakehashi showcased the beauty of Japanese women in a respectful and empowering manner. Her photos were a reminder that beauty is diverse and varied, and her work was an important representation of this fact.\n\nThis year was a huge success for women and nonbinary photographers. Their art and insights gave us a deeper understanding of the world around us, and their influence was felt throughout the industry. We look forward to seeing more of their amazing work in the years to come.", "label": "machine"}

Euro zone stocks also gained momentum, closing up 1.3 percent, while the German DAX rose 1.7 percent, led by Deutsche Bank as it settled an investigation in the U.S.\n\nThe U.K.'s overnight vote to accept an amended Brexit trade deal and the possibility of a no-deal outcome was welcomed by investors.\n\n\"The U.K. Parliament has passed the amended Brexit deal, with all party leaders and the European Commission backing the agreement. This further reduces the risk of the U.K. crashing out of the EU without a deal,\" David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.\n\n\"The pound was boosted on Tuesday night, as the British currency found favour with investors as the risk of a no-deal Brexit receded,\" Madden added.\n\nTechnology and banks were the biggest boosts for European markets as the former closed 1.5 percent higher and the latter gained 2.6 percent.\n\nEuropean tech stocks like SES, ASML and Altice have all made gains in recent weeks, while bank stocks such as Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank rose after the U.S. Justice Department said it had reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank over mis-selling of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007.\n\nOther sectors, like oil and gas and travel, were weaker, however. Shares of oil and gas companies such as Total and Royal Dutch Shell were down around 0.4 percent, while shares of travel companies such as TUI and Air France KLM were down nearly 4 percent each.\n\nThe picture was also mixed across Europe with Italy's FTSE MIB closing nearly 0.2 percent lower, while France's CAC and Spain's IBEX both closed in positive territory.\n\n\"There are undoubtedly risks in the market, with the U.K. now having to put the Brexit deal into legislation, while an even tougher deadline is drawing closer in early 2021 when the transition period finishes,\" said Madden, who added that investors would be hoping the planned measures \"will boost the pan-European recovery and have an effect on all sectors and indices.\"\n\nInvestors were also looking ahead to the European Central Bank's (ECB) meeting on Thursday, which could provide further clarity on how the bank plans to act on the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe ECB is widely expected to signal more monetary easing measures, with analysts suggesting that a new QE program and further rate cuts could be in the works.\n\n\"The markets are hopeful that the ECB will be able to present an effective stimulus package on Thursday, in order to help the European economy reach the level it was before the pandemic,\" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities.\n\n\"An increase in quantitative easing should prove beneficial for the markets as it should reduce bond yields and provide risk assets with sufficient liquidity,\" Anthis added.\n\nThe pound was up 0.7 percent on the day against the euro, trading around 90.8 pence.\n\nThe euro was at its highest level against the U.S. dollar since May 2018, trading at $1.2177.\n\nOverall, investor sentiment has been much improved in recent weeks, with a Brexit deal and the possibility of a U.S. stimulus package helping markets recover from the recent selloff on pandemic-induced lockdowns.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It\u2019s easy to focus on the flashy, super-expensive options in the gaming laptop space, but the reality for most shoppers is a much more affordable machine. Dell's new G Series laptops, the G15 and G16, are out to prove that budget-friendly doesn\u2019t have to mean plain or boring, with a sturdy feel and fun-and-funky design that make their prices a nice surprise.\n\nWe got a close look at the laptops ourselves at a CES 2023 preview event prior to the show and came away impressed with the well-priced systems. Watch the video above for our impressions and an up-close look at the designs, and read on for details.\n\nBargain Prices and Uncommon Colorways\n\nFirst, let\u2019s focus in on the cost, because that is still the most appealing aspect. The G15 starts at just $849, a breath of fresh air in today\u2019s increasingly expensive (and lately, inflated) gaming-laptop market. That\u2019s a fairly modest configuration with an Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. The G16 is more of an entry-level-to-midrange offering, starting at $1,499.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nAs their names suggest, the starting prices are not the only difference: The G15\u2019s screen is 15.6 inches, and the G16 is slightly larger at 16 inches. The actual footprints of the laptops are pretty similar at a glance, but you can tell the G16 is a touch larger overall. The G15\u2019s display is full HD with 120Hz or 165Hz refresh rate options, while the G16\u2019s screen is QHD+ with 165Hz or 240Hz options. If you haven\u2019t gotten the gist yet, the G16 is a moderately upgraded version of its counterpart, in just about all aspects, to match its higher starting price.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nComing back around to the design, the pair come in a rainbow array of color options compared to most laptops. From our time with the units, it seems the designers put a lot of effort into these colorways and aesthetics to make them stand out, resulting in three colors for the G15 and two for the G16. The white G15 with the navy rear block is a personal favorite, but most shoppers will find something to like among this mix.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nDespite the budget pricing, the build is strong, and its materials feel like premium quality. They aren\u2019t super light, though: the G16 is especially hefty at 6.01 pounds, and the G15 isn\u2019t far behind at 5.84 pounds. They\u2019re each just over an inch thick, too, so they\u2019re only portable to a point for frequent travelers.\n\nComponents and Features\n\nWe can\u2019t speak on the specifics of the components just yet, but both models will utilize 2023\u2019s next-generation CPUs and GPUs from Intel, Nvidia, and eventually AMD. Naturally, the bottom half of these stacks will be relevant to the G15, and the G16 will offer some higher-power options, but there will be a lot of configuration choices for each. The Intel and Nvidia configurations will launch in Q1, while the AMD options will release in Q2, with pricing to be announced closer to the shipping dates.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nAs for other features these two gaming laptops share, there\u2019s a dedicated thermal boosting key, macro keys, and RGB lighting. The lighting options differ between the two, with the G15 using one-zone or four-zone RGB, and the G16 just one-zone RGB, as well as a Cherry MX keyboard option.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nThese two G Series laptops will also see the perks of having bigger, richer cousins at Alienware, inheriting the brand\u2019s Element 31 thermal material for improved cooling, which is usually reserved for more premium products. Likewise, a redesigned Alienware Command Center application will come to these laptops along with the 2023 Alienware machines, built to be more intuitive for managing your components, thermals, and system settings.\n\nCheck back when units become available for our full benchmark results and reviews of these budget-friendly gaming systems.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The U.S. child-care sector is in crisis. Workers are fleeing the field for higher wages at Target, McDonald\u2019s, and Amazon warehouses. Short-staffed day-care centers are closing even as families clamor for spots. And in a sad state of business as usual, the care that\u2019s available is frequently unaffordable, of uncertain quality, inconveniently located, exploitative of its teachers, or some combination thereof. Child care in the U.S., Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in 2021, is \u201ca textbook example of a broken market.\u201d\n\nYet most proposed government solutions involve building on top of this flawed system: offering more vouchers to purchase private child care, helping parents become savvier at picking care options, and tossing retention bonuses to caregivers. These fixes, importantly, can make child care more affordable for parents and offer life rafts to centers hemorrhaging workers. But they do little to address the structural needs: improved quality for kids, better wages and working conditions for workers, and more choices in the low-income neighborhoods that many child-care businesses avoid.\n\nIt\u2019s time to think beyond the private market. To build quality child care everywhere, and especially where it\u2019s needed most, we need directly funded child-care programs. We need a public option.\n\nRead: America\u2019s child-care equilibrium has shattered\n\nIn many wealthy places outside the U.S., public child care is plentiful, popular, and predictably good. In Iceland, Finland, and Denmark\u2014three Nordic countries that dominate UNICEF\u2019s global rankings of child-care quality\u2014the majority of young children attend public programs. Within Quebec\u2019s universal-child-care system, researchers rank the province\u2019s public option\u2014its directly funded nonprofit centres de la petite enfance\u2014to be, on average, far better than the private offerings. Their teachers are also better paid, making it easier to attract and retain talented staff, Athina Xenos, the director of Centre de la Petite Enfance Vanier, in Montreal, told me.\n\nEven some pockets of the United States have witnessed the benefits of public child care. In the early 1970s, Republican Mayor John Lindsay established hundreds of publicly funded, community-run child-care centers in New York City\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. This network quickly became \u201cnotable not only for the number of children it served, but for its commitment to quality child care that set national standards,\u201d writes Simon Black, a professor of labor studies at Brock University, in the book Social Reproduction and the City. (Much of the federal funding fueling these centers dried up by the late 1970s, causing many to close.)\n\nAnd in the 1990s, the Defense Department used direct funding to transform what were described as \u201cseriously deficient\u201d military child-care programs into the gold standard of care in the U.S. By 2015, nearly all military child-care centers were nationally accredited\u2014meaning their curricula and programs have been independently vetted. By comparison, only about 11 percent of civilian centers were accredited, according to a 2016 report. Military child-care workers, meanwhile, are far better paid than civilian caregivers. Caregivers in military centers generally earn $16.70 to $22.50 an hour (and sometimes more) with benefits, according to the Department of Defense. Nonmilitary care workers, meanwhile, made a median of $13.22 an hour in 2021, usually without benefits. \u201cThe reason we were successful was we put the public dollars into the programs\u201d directly, Linda Smith, a key architect of the military model and the former director of family policy for the secretary of Defense, told me.\n\nThe lesson is this: When the government pays programs directly, it can set clear standards for programming, teacher pay, and professional development, all factors that research links to a high level of care. Such standards, in turn, remove much of the guesswork for parents struggling to gauge the merits of various child-care programs. Direct funding can also help ensure that poorer neighborhoods aren\u2019t left behind. And during economic downturns\u2014like the one the pandemic brought in 2020\u2014providers know they can make payroll and pay rent, ensuring programs stay solvent. \u201cIt brings stability,\u201d said Smith, who is now the director of the early-childhood initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank.\n\nThere was a brief moment in U.S. history when civilians nationwide had access to directly funded public child care. The 1940 Lanham Act of World War II paid for state-run nurseries with specially trained workers to allow mothers to enter the labor force while men fought abroad. Women raved about these programs, and at least one study would later find that they had lasting positive impacts on the children who participated, including higher rates of college completion and employment compared with a control group, along with higher earnings. But not long after the war, funding for the programs ended and the nurseries closed.\n\nIn 1971, U.S. Congress resurrected the dream of public child care. The Comprehensive Child Development Act proposed a national network of federally funded, municipally run centers with tuition charged on a sliding scale. The bill passed both chambers of Congress only to be killed by President Richard Nixon, who linked government-funded child care to communism and \u201cfamily weakening.\u201d Such damning language was strategic. Pat Buchanan, who worked for Nixon and advised the president on the veto, told the journalist Gail Collins: \u201cI insisted we not just say we can\u2019t afford it right now, in which case you get pilot programs or whatever.\u2019\u201d As Collins concluded about the momentous veto in her book When Everything Changed: \u201cThe goal was not just to kill the bill but also to bury the idea of a national child-care entitlement forever.\u201d\n\nIt worked. In the decades to come, as nations such as Iceland and Finland built public child-care systems in earnest, the U.S. continued to grow a patchwork of private, market-based programs. Many child-care businesses skipped over poor neighborhoods, funneling children from low-income families\u2014the ones research suggests benefit most from good care\u2014into whatever their parents could get.\n\nToday, parents of all backgrounds struggle to assess care among the motley assortment of arrangements spanning programs in private living rooms and church basements as well as national for-profit child-care chains. Meanwhile, the biggest payoff for investing in quality\u2014its long-term impact on child development\u2014won\u2019t manifest for years down the line. As a result, market-based programs typically compete on affordability, Pierre Fortin, an economist at the University of Quebec, in Montreal, told me in a previous interview. Yet even basic affordability is difficult to achieve in an industry that requires heavy staffing simply to ensure basic child safety. The clearest path to keep fees down is to skimp on quality, cut teacher pay, or both. None of this is good for kids or employees. Our market-based approach, Smith said, is \u201cthe crux of the problem that\u2019s holding back the quality in the country.\u201d\n\nRead: The reason child care is so hard to afford\n\nCanada\u2019s child-care market long had the same problems as that in the U.S.\u2014meager pay, high staff turnover, uneven quality, and sprawling child-care deserts. But in 2020, the federal government vowed to learn from Quebec and began developing a national network of programs. In many cases, it is improving existing child-care businesses, setting standards and wage bands, while giving them direct funding. Provinces and territories will also open new programs using federal funding. Canada\u2019s goal is to make child care affordable so that parents with young children can work\u2014the government is aiming to provide the service for 10 Canadian dollars (about $7.30) a day by 2026. Already, Nova Scotia\u2019s early-childhood educators have received a wage boost of up to 43 percent.\n\nAnd in the U.S.? We continue to invest in the current, broken market-based approach, often in the name of preserving parent choice. To give families actual choice, let\u2019s test those pilot projects Buchanan was so afraid of. Give Americans directly funded public child care.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nuclear power received what seem like two plum gifts for 2023. High energy prices and the desire to decarbonize have spurred renewed interest in the technology that provides about 10% of the world\u2019s electricity supply. Yet a surging supply of green power is likely to limit any renaissance.\n\nThere are 425 active reactors worldwide, according to the World Nuclear Association, about the same as three decades ago. Plants have opened in places like China and closed in Western countries.\n\nNuclear plants are expensive to build, and their complexity often causes projects to go way over budget. Plant Vogtle in the state of Georgia will be America\u2019s first since the 1990s when finished in 2023. The $30 billion price tag is twice the initial estimate. Reactor opening delays in Finland and China show difficulties transcend borders.\n\nThe cost of a new nuclear power station is around $168 per megawatt hour according to Lazard. An efficient gas plant costs about a third as much, and solar and wind about one-fifth as much. So there\u2019s little incentive to build. Running existing nuclear plants makes sense. A depreciated plant costs around $29 per MWh, reckons Lazard. And power is available rain or shine, day or night.\n\nThis reliability is the big reason there are 55 plants under construction, despite the cost, as wind and solar power currently need backup. Yet that appeal is limited. Over the past decade, green power production, excluding hydropower, has grown 15% annually worldwide according to BP\u2019s Statistical Review of World Energy. Nuclear production was unchanged. China has 22 nuclear reactors under construction, but built renewables about twice as fast.\n\nThe price discrepancy keeps widening as wind and solar get cheaper, while nuclear hasn\u2019t budged. Moreover, the cost of storing power in batteries is plummeting. NextEra Energy (NEE.N), America\u2019s biggest deployer of green energy, estimates that by the late 2020s, wind and solar tied to batteries will be about as reliable as other sources during peak hours, but for roughly half the cost of depreciated nuclear or gas plants, and about one-seventh that of a new, small nuclear plant.\n\nShareholders may yet get some juice from nuclear players like $10 billion uranium producer and wannabe reactor servicer Cameco (CCO.TO). But wind and solar power\u2019s burgeoning advantages have $172 billion NextEra and its rivals looking more plugged in.\n\nFollow @rob_cyran on Twitter\n\n(This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2023. To see more of our predictions, click here.)\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\nVogtle 3 and 4 will be the first new nuclear reactors built in the United States in more than three decades. The reactors in Georgia should produce power commercially in 2023 and are owned by a consortium of utilities including Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power and others.\n\nThe two reactors were initially scheduled to enter operation in 2016 and 2017.\n\nEditing by Antony Currie, Thomas Shum and Amanda Gomez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

This is almost 8C above the previous record of 38.2C (100.8F) in France in 2003.\n\nThe heatwave has been made worse by the fact that humidity levels across the continent have risen to unprecedented levels. This has caused oppressive conditions, with some areas having more than three times the usual amount of humidity in the air.\n\nThe combination of heat and humidity is being blamed for a series of wildfires that have broken out in several countries, including Portugal, Italy, and Spain. In Germany, over 400 fire brigades have been dispatched to tackle numerous blazes that have occurred since the heatwave began.\n\nThe extreme heat has caused major disruptions to everyday life, with many countries imposing restrictions on outdoor activities due to safety concerns. Many places have declared a state of emergency and have urged people to stay hydrated and remain indoors as much as possible.\n\nSchools across the continent have been forced to close as temperatures soar above 40C (104F). In some cities, schools have installed air-conditioned buses to help students cool off during the journey to and from class.\n\nPower outages have been reported in some areas due to the high demand for electricity to power air conditioners and fans. In some cases, entire cities have gone without power for days at a time.\n\nThe heatwave has also caused serious health issues for those who are unable to get out of the heat. Hospitals in some cities have reported a surge in admissions for heat-related illnesses, with some hospitals operating at full capacity.\n\nScientists are warning that the extreme heat is a sign of what is to come, as climate change continues to take its toll on the planet. While it may be too soon to draw definitive conclusions, the fact that temperatures have broken records across the continent indicates that the climate is changing in real-time.\n\nIt is hoped that the extreme conditions in Europe are just a preview of what the future holds, and that world leaders will act quickly to reduce emissions and stop the further warming of the planet.

{"text": "The leader of the United Airlines pilot union resigned abruptly on Monday amid public outcry about comments he allegedly made about female colleagues in an online aviation forum.\n\nJohn Prater, president of the United Pilots Association since 2009, stepped down from his post following intense pressure from members of the union, members of Congress and the public. \n\nThe controversy began late last week when a member of an online forum for aviation professionals posted a screenshot of a conversation between Prater and another user in which Prater appeared to make disparaging remarks about women pilots. \n\nThe comments were reportedly made two months ago and quickly began circulating on the internet, prompting an immediate outcry. \n\nThe union quickly issued a statement saying it was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the comments, which it called \u201cunacceptable and inexcusable.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe UPA is committed to equal treatment and respect for all of its members and would never condone or tolerate such behavior,\u201d the statement said. \n\nThe fallout was swift, as members of the union called for Prater to be held accountable, with some calling for his immediate resignation.\n\nMembers of Congress also weighed in, with U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) saying in a tweet, \u201cI join all the other members of Congress in standing with @UnitedPilots, who are united in demanding accountability. Leaders are supposed to lead by example, and this kind of behavior isn\u2019t acceptable in any workplace.\u201d \n\nPrater announced his resignation in a statement on Monday, apologizing for his \u201cunprofessional comments\u201d and saying he would \u201cseek to repair the damage\u201d he had done to the union and its members.\n\n\u201cI understand that my comments and poor judgment have put our organization in a difficult position and have caused pain to my fellow pilots, our staff and members, and their families,\u201d Prater said. \u201cI have reflected on my comments and I sincerely regret the hurt and harm they have caused.\u201d \n\nThe union said it had accepted Prater\u2019s resignation and would start the process of selecting a new president. \n\nThe scandal has been a major embarrassment for the union, which represents some 14,000 active and retired United Airlines pilots. \n\nThe UPA has long been a powerful player in the labor movement, and has advocated for fairer pay and better benefits for pilots. It had hoped to use Prater\u2019s tenure to achieve greater pay equity and to boost membership. \n\nThose efforts have now been derailed by the controversy, as the union finds itself in the uncomfortable position of having to rebuild its reputation and regain the trust of its members.\n\nBut the union\u2019s chief negotiator, Tom Wychorski, is confident the UPA can move forward, telling reporters in a statement that the incident \u201cwill not define us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand united in our commitment to uphold the highest standards of respect and dignity for all,\u201d Wychorski said. \u201cWe will strive to continue our proud legacy of helping to ensure that all pilots enjoy a workplace that is professional, safe, and dignified.\u201d \n\nThe UPA will now turn its attention to selecting a new president. \n\nCandidates must demonstrate that they possess the qualifications to lead the union and understand the issues facing members, the UPA said. \n\nIn the meantime, Prater said he would continue to work with the union and its members to ensure a positive outcome for pilots. \n\n\u201cI am committed to working with the UPA\u2019s leadership to ensure that pilots across the country have a voice and that our members\u2019 interests are fairly represented,\u201d Prater said. \n\nThe scandal at the United Airlines pilot union has been a major setback for the organization, but the UPA is determined to move forward and continue fighting for the rights of its members.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Africa has been making great strides in its energy transition to more sustainable sources, but the progress is still painfully slow. Despite billions of dollars of investment, the continent remains a huge outlier when it comes to accessing electricity.\n\nIt is estimated that 600 million people in Africa have no access to power, meaning they rely on candles, wood, kerosene and gas for their energy needs. This has a profound effect on their lives: lack of access to energy means a lack of opportunities for development and improved living conditions.\n\nBut the challenge of bringing power to the continent is an arduous one. The continent is vast and sparsely populated in many places, which means the cost of creating and maintaining a grid infrastructure for electricity is high. It also means that the people who need it the most are often the hardest to reach.\n\nThe region is also blessed with an abundance of renewable energy sources: the sun shines year-round, the wind blows constantly and rivers provide potential for hydroelectric power. But the challenge lies in finding ways to capture and store that energy in an efficient and cost effective way.\n\nCurrently, more than two-thirds of Africa\u2019s energy comes from burning coal and oil. This has huge environmental and economic consequences and is also a huge drag on the continent\u2019s economic growth. The International Energy Agency estimates that sub-Saharan Africa loses $25 billion a year due to energy poverty.\n\nFortunately, there are steps being taken to try to tackle the problem. The African Development Bank is investing $12 billion to try and improve access to electricity in 30 African countries by 2025. The United Nations has an initiative to give access to energy in 200 African countries by 2030.\n\nOne of the main focuses of these programs is to support the development of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. These sources are seen as being more reliable, resilient and cost-effective than coal and oil.\n\nIn addition to this, Africa is also looking into decentralizing its energy production and introducing distributed networks of small-scale power producers. This will make it easier for people in rural areas to access the power they need.\n\nAfrica has the potential to become a major global leader in renewable energy and clean technologies, but it needs to overcome its significant infrastructure challenges to do so.

Jon Cherry | Reuters\n\nNewly elected U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy took the gavel of the chamber after a bruising weeklong battle within his own party, promising to carry out a conservative, America-first agenda, tackling the immigration crisis at the Mexican border, cutting back funding at the IRS and fixing \"woke indoctrination in our schools.\" After 14 failed votes since Tuesday, the California Republican was able to overcome opposition after making extraordinary concessions to a small bloc of far-right holdouts who refused to support his speaker bid. McCarthy laid out an ambitious plan in addressing the 118th congressional session early Saturday morning, saying he wants to \"be the check and provide some balance\" to President Joe Biden's policies. He said the first legislation he plans to tackle will repeal funding for more than 87,000 new IRS agents. He highlighted immigration reform as a top priority, saying the Republican-controlled House will hold some of its first hearings of the year at the Southern border. \"No more ignoring this crisis of safety and sovereignty,\" he said. \"We must secure our border.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) bangs the Speaker's gavel for the first time after being elected the next Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in a late night 15th round of voting on the fourth day of the 118th Congress at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., January 7, 2023.

In addition to immigration, he said he wants to address \"America-Last\" energy policies and \"woke indoctrination\" in schools, noting that children come first and should be taught to \"dream big.\" He added that he will also plan to address long-term challenges like debt and the Chinese Communist Party, and he affirmed his commitment to law enforcement and criminal prosecution. McCarthy said the tense showdown on the House floor this week was proof that he is not someone who gives up easily. \"You know \u2013 my father always told me: It's not how you start, it's how you finish,\" he said. \"And now we need to finish strong for the American people.\" Though his election marked the end of a long week and night in Washington, McCarthy said it was also a new beginning for the nation.\n\nRepublican members-elect celebrate as House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is elected Speaker of the House in the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol Building on January 07, 2023 in Washington, DC.

{"text": "Apple Inc. announced on Tuesday that it will be increasing the price of battery replacement for iPhone 6 and later models starting March 1st. According to the statement released by the tech giant, the new fee will be $50.00 which will double the current price of $29.\n\nThe new price hike is seen as an effort to encourage customers to upgrade to the latest model of iPhone as many customers have complained about the battery life of older iPhones. It also suggests that Apple is hoping to discourage customers from purchasing aftermarket batteries as these can damage iPhones.\n\nIn a statement, Apple said that the new price was \"in line with our pricing structure for iPhone batteries and is part of our ongoing effort to provide the best service experience to our customers.\"\n\nThe new price change is the latest in a series of measures taken by Apple to try and encourage customers to upgrade to the latest model of iPhone. Last year, the company increased the prices of their batteries significantly and also announced that they were extending their warranty periods for the latest iPhones.\n\nThe battery replacement is not the only cost associated with Apple's iPhones. The tech giant has also raised the price of repair services for its hardware, charging as much as $149 for a broken or damaged iPhone display.\n\nDespite the increased cost, Apple says that customers are still buying the latest model of iPhones and that the company continues to see strong demand for its products.\n\nWhile the new battery replacement fee may encourage some customers to upgrade to the latest model of iPhone, it could also turn away those who don't have the funds available to pay the additional cost.\n\nIn addition to the battery replacement fee, Apple also announced on Tuesday that it was introducing a new repair service for iPhones. The new service, called \"Same-Day Repair,\" will allow customers to have their iPhones repaired by a technician on the same day that they bring it in.\n\nThe service will be available in Apple Stores and will cost $149. For those who need their iPhones fixed on the same day, it is likely to be a more cost effective option than having to pay the additional battery replacement fee.\n\nWith the new pricing changes, Apple is hoping to incentivize customers to upgrade to the latest model of iPhone. Although it may cost more money upfront, customers could end up saving money in the long run as they will no longer have to worry about paying for expensive battery replacements.\n\nFor customers who decide to stick with their older iPhones, the battery replacement cost could be a deterrent. However, Apple is banking on the fact that customers will want to take advantage of the new features on the latest model of iPhone, and that the additional cost for the battery replacement is worth it.\n\nTime will tell if Apple's latest pricing changes will be successful in encouraging customers to upgrade, or if the increased costs will actually have the opposite effect. One thing is certain, Apple will continue to look for ways to increase its revenue as the company prepares for another year of intense competition from its rivals.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is led by officers of the Royal Bahamas Police force following his arrest. Mario Duncanson | Afp | Getty Images\n\nBefore FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on multiple criminal securities fraud violations Dec. 12, he was considered the crypto \"darling\" of Washington, helpfully testifying before Congress, meeting with regulators and lavishly spending tens of millions on political campaigns. U.S. prosecutors say at least some of that money came from Alameda Research, a hedge fund he founded. He and his co-conspirators allegedly diverted billions of dollars in customer funds from FTX to Alameda that were then misused in a variety of ways, including to donate to political candidates and campaigns, federal prosecutors said. The campaign finance violations detailed in a 14-page indictment are numerous and varied. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York accuse Bankman-Fried of conspiring with others to make and receive illegal campaign donations, hide those donations, misuse corporate donations and of improperly using a conduit to hide the donations. Bankman-Fried \"and others known and unknown\" also allegedly gave money under other people's names and exceeded limits on political contributions, according to the indictment. While prosecutors don't name Bankman-Fried's co-conspirators, they said he worked with \"others, known and unknown, (who) knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to defraud the United States\" to intentionally skirt campaign finance laws, according to the indictment. Prosecutors are reportedly looking at former FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh, the co-CEO of FTX digital markets Ryan Salame, as well as contributions by Alameda Research and FTX, The New York Times reported. Bankman-Fried, Singh and Salame, combined, contributed at least $70 million toward the 2022 midterms, according to data from nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets. Singh and Salame did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined to comment. Bankman-Fried became a prolific political donor in recent years, giving almost $40 million in publicly disclosed contributions mostly to Democrats in the 2022 midterm races. State and federal campaign finance data and nonprofit records show a number of questionable donations now under increased scrutiny that indicate Bankman-Fried could have spent millions more than previously disclosed currying favor with Washington lawmakers.\n\nFamily ties\n\nHe's publicly admitted that he also gave roughly $40 million to Republicans during the campaign cycle, although those payments weren't publicly disclosed and aren't counted toward his total donations. None of the groups, candidates or nonprofits that received donations from Bankman-Fried or his executives have been charged with any crimes, and the indictment notes that just because a group receives a donation later deemed illegal does not mean they had any knowledge it was. The New York Times reported that prosecutors have sent emails seeking more information from Democrats and Republicans on some of the donations. Bankman-Fried and his colleagues were also generous donors to charities and political causes championed by his family. The disgraced CEO donated to his brother Gabe Bankman-Fried's nonprofit organization, Guarding Against Pandemics. Bankman-Fried's mother, Barbara Fried, ran Mind the Gap, a super PAC that backed mostly Democratic issues. Singh personally donated $1 million to the group. Mind the Gap reportedly worked as a donor advisory group that helps Democrats raise campaign cash, but it made zero publicly disclosed donations to candidates, parties or other political action committees, according to OpenSecrets. Alameda Research donated more than $12 million to Gabe Bankman-Fried's nonprofit since late last year, according to California state campaign finance records. Guarding Against Pandemics used the funds to help finance a campaign to support a California ballot initiative that would levy a special tax against people making more than $5 million a year to fight future pandemics, according to state records. The ballot measure will be voted on in the 2024 election. The nonprofit wiped all traces of the Bankman-Fried brothers off its website after FTX filed for bankruptcy in November, including a mention of Sam Bankman-Fried as one of its donors. The website doesn't mention Alameda as a sponsor, even though almost one-fourth of its total donations last year came from the hedge fund, records show. The nonprofit spent over $1 million since last year lobbying the federal government on pandemic-related matters, including engaging with White House officials, according to disclosure reports. The group's 2021 tax record, which was obtained by CNBC, shows the organization raised $22 million last year. The organization does not publicly disclose its donors on that form. California state campaign finance records show Alameda donated $5 million to Guarding Against Pandemics last year and $7.1 million this year. A representative for Guarding Against Pandemics didn't respond to a request for comment. \"This appears to be yet another example of diversion of FTX customer funds without the knowledge or consent of FTX customers,\" Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer in George W. Bush's White House, told CNBC after reviewing the donations. \"An open question is how much the recipient of these funds \u2014 whether political candidates or Gabe's nonprofit \u2014 knew about the true source of the funds they had received \u2014 i.e. that they had FTX customer money.\"\n\nDonations to Democrats\n\nWhile Guarding Against Pandemics boasts on its tax filing that the group \"advocates for public investments to prevent the next pandemic,\" its 2021 records show it donated to at least two groups aligned with the Democratic Party. The charity donated $100,000 to the House Majority Forward, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit affiliated with House Majority PAC, according to the tax form. Both groups work to help Democrats get elected to the House of Representatives. The House Majority PAC received a $6 million donation from Sam Bankman-Fried during the 2022 election. Guarding Against Pandemics also gave $1 million to Voto Latino Action Fund, a nonprofit voter registration group. A spokesman for Voto Latino said an email that \"Guarding Against Pandemics gave us funding to oppose [Democratic] Governor Newsom's recall; the funds were received and spent in connection with that effort last year. There are no funds remaining from this organization.\" Guarding Against Pandemics also paid political communications and media company GMMB just over $690,000 last year for advertising and production, its tax form says. That firm received $24 million from various Democratic campaigns during the 2022 elections, according to OpenSecrets. Jim Margolis, a founding partner of GMMB, served as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 runs for the White House. A spokesman for GMMB told CNBC that the payment from Guarding Against Pandemics to the firm was for a \"media buy.\" \"This was a media buy placed for Guarding Against Pandemics. GMMB was not involved in developing the strategy, creative or production of the advertising and simply placed the media buy with stations like NBC Universal who were the beneficiaries of the ad spending. It was not a fee for GMMB,\" the spokesman said.\n\nAlameda backs Biden PAC\n\nAlameda Research also delved into politics, donating $5.24 million in 2020 to Future Forward USA, a super PAC that backed President Joe Biden's White House win, according to Federal Election Commission records. Bankman-Fried separately donated $5 million to the super PAC that cycle. A representative for the PAC did not respond to a request for comment. While U.S. prosecutors didn't release details of specific donations, they said Bankman-Fried \"and his co-conspirators made millions of dollars in political contributions funded by Alameda Research to federal political candidates and committees in advance of the 2022 election.\" \"To conceal the fact that those contributions were paid for using funds from a corporation and to evade contribution limits and reporting requirements, Bankman-Fried caused contributions to be reported in the names of co-conspirators rather than in the name of the true source of the funds,\" they said in a press release announcing the indictment. Stuart McPhail, an attorney from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the Future Forward donation could have violated campaign finance laws if Alameda was posing as a front for someone else. \"It would be illegal, however, if Alameda was not the true source of the funds, but was merely a conduit for someone else's money,\" McPhail said in an email to CNBC. \"Of course, it would also break other laws, outside of campaign finance, if Alameda was stealing money to make those contributions. Given the DOJ's, the SEC's, and the CFTC's allegations, it is quite possible that is what happened.\" The ethics group filed a complaint to the FEC before Bankman-Fried's arrest, asking them to investigate the former FTX CEO for alleged \"serious violations\" of election law. They cited Bankman-Fried's admitted contributions of \"dark\" money to Republican election efforts during the 2022 primary season.\n\nPrime Trust", "label": "human"}

We expect more layoffs are on the horizon \"Managers should know what to expect after a layoff,\" said Connie Whittaker Dunlop, founder of Monarch Consulting Group, which develops leaders, teams, and organizations through coaching and training. \"Layoffs done wrong are going to incur additional costs of hiring and defeat the initial purpose.\" The aftermath of a layoff is significant not only for those who lose their jobs but also those who remain. Companies that go through layoffs are often left with employees who are less trusting, less committed and less satisfied, experts say.\n\nLeading and managing 'layoff survivors'\n\nAbout 70% of \"layoff survivors\" say their motivation at work has declined since the layoff, according to a survey done in late November by BizReport. Additionally, 66% report they feel overworked since the job cuts, and a third of those who survived a layoff believe that things will worsen for their company in the future. Workers feeling insecure in their jobs and higher levels of stress lead some employees to quit out of frustration. To counter those negative sentiments, experts say leaders need to communicate the organization's near-term goals and plans very clearly with front-line managers.

Having a clear and compelling story about how the layoffs are going to better prepare the company for the future is an important component to managing change.

That may mean current employees temporarily move into new roles. To avoid the pushback from layoff survivors who already feel overwhelmed, experts say leaders should let workers know what skill sets will be needed and how they can get them and communicate that clearly.

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI thought I was going to work at Salesforce my entire life; I was there for almost 12 years. But a turning point happened in my career \u2014 and really, my life \u2014 after my husband and I had a jarring conversation.\n\nI was an executive vice president at Salesforce at the time, running a business unit while spearheading the company's equal-pay initiatives and other diversity programs before the company hired its first chief diversity officer.\n\nI'd just spent a few days on a road-trip vacation with my husband and kids, and the whole time, my husband and I had bickered. That's not us. We don't bicker. On the drive home, my husband said, \"You are really hard to be around right now.\"\n\nI was shocked. Was I really to blame? After a moment's reflection, I asked him to tell me what it felt like to live with me lately. I promised not to comment, but to simply write everything down.\n\nHe told me things like that I thought my time was more valuable than everyone else's, that I was only half there, and that I prioritized my job over everything and everyone else. It was crazy! But I read that list out loud and knew it was all true.\n\nThat was the turning point, the \"a-ha\" moment.\n\nYou see, my parents are immigrants, so growing up, everything was about stability. My dad worked in the same law firm his whole career. My parents still live in the same house that I came home to from the hospital. It was a very dig-in-to-fit-in mentality. When it came to my career at Salesforce, it didn't even occur to me that I would leave. I tried a couple of times, but I really just wanted them to say, \"No, no, no! We love you. Stay, and here's some more money.\"\n\nAfter that painful talk in the car with my husband, I realized I had let my life become all work. I had stopped reading for pleasure. I had stopped doing anything artistic. I just worked, and then helped my kids as if I was just trying to get through every day. That conversation forced a degree of personal honesty: I wanted to do other stuff, too!\n\nI decided to read 50 books a year \u2014 only fiction, nothing for work. And I really like taking photographs, but I had totally stopped. So a friend encouraged me to set up an Instagram account as a creative outlet. I also got a second phone for only my personal life, so I could focus on my family without being tempted to check in with work.\n\nThese things gave me the confidence to face the fact that I needed an even bigger change \u2014 I decided to leave my job at Salesforce. It was a difficult decision because work had become both my identity and my social circle.\n\nWhen I left, I had no plan. My only objectives were to get better at fly fishing and spend more time with my family.\n\nShortly after, though, I got a call from Mallun Yen, a lawyer and former SaaStr executive who was starting Operator Collective, a VC fund with a mission of bringing women with tech-industry operational experience into the venture-capital ecosystem. Women have traditionally been left out of venture investing, which had irked me for some time, so I joined her, helping her raise and deploy a $50 million fund.\n\nWhile at Operator Collective, it became clear that if women are scarce in venture, Black people are even more so. That inspired me to help launch Black Venture Institute, which trains 50 Black executives on venture-capital finance twice a year. So far, more than 200 people have taken the course, with many going on to start their own funds, to join established firms, or to angel invest. BVI is one of the things in my career I'm most proud of.\n\nVenture capital also led me to a role at Ironclad, one of the first investments we made at Operator Collective. Ironclad's CEO and I were talking one day, and I made a joke that I should come help him run his company as COO. He was at my house the next day.\n\nAt Ironclad, I still worked hard \u2014 that's just who I am \u2014 but this time I worked smarter. When I was younger, I thought I had to work as hard as humanly possible to be successful. I lost myself in that notion and almost damaged the relationships I cherish the most because of it. I had to learn work boundaries the hard way.\n\nOne of the biggest tests of my boundaries happened just this week. A family circumstance arose that made me realize that someone I love \u2014 my mother \u2014 needs me, and needs me now. I made the difficult decision to step down from my position at Ironclad, a job I love, after 15 months to focus full-time on my family.\n\nCreating these boundaries and learning how to stick to them has helped me understand that I set the limits of my work life \u2014 not the company I work for. It's on me to create and live a vibrant life, and I intend to do it.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe year has only just started but already Europe has broken an alarming number of weather records as extreme heat spread across the continent.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, at least eight European countries recorded their warmest January day ever: Liechtenstein, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, Belarus, Lithuania, Denmark and Latvia, according to the climatologist Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures across the globe.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cthe most extreme heat wave in European history,\u201d Herrera told CNN, based on how far above normal temperatures rose.\n\nCities that would often be covered in snow instead saw temperatures spike to levels usually seen in summer. \u201cThe real \u2018monster\u2019 part of this warm spell was December 31 to January 1,\u201d Herrera told CNN.\n\nOn January 1, Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, recorded a peak of 20 degrees Celsius (68 Fahrenheit), the Czech town of Javornik reached 19.6 degrees Celsius (67.3 Fahrenheit), and Jod\u0142ownik, a village in Poland, recorded a peak of 19 degrees Celsius (66.2 Fahrenheit).\n\nUkraine also recorded its highest temperature in January outside of Crimea.\n\nWe just observed the warmest January day on record for many countries in Europe.\n\n\n\nTruly unprecedented in modern records. pic.twitter.com/bUux1XOBH9 \u2014 Scott Duncan (@ScottDuncanWX) January 1, 2023\n\nWhen you consider how far above normal temperatures climbed, the current weather event is even more extreme than the heat waves that scorched much of Europe last summer, said Herrera. And not only is the heat unusually intense, it also spans a large area, from Europe\u2019s borders with Asia to northern Spain.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, a heat wave in Europe can rival the most intense ever recorded in North America,\u201d said Herrera.\n\nIn Warsaw, the capital of Poland, January 1 felt like a summer's day. Adobe Stock\n\nThe driving force behind the exceptional heat was a warm air mass from the west coast of Africa, which moved across Europe, bringing unseasonably warm conditions, according to the UK Met Office.\n\nWhile meteorologists say it\u2019s too early to confidently attribute this extreme heat to climate change, scientists have warned that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense.\n\n\u201cThe increases in average global temperatures caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels make it more likely that temperature records will be broken,\u201d said Rebecca Oakes, a climate scientist at the Met Office.\n\nThe record-breaking temperatures have alarmed meteorologists, but they have also had the effect of helping to ease the energy crisis that has gripped the continent.\n\nNatural gas prices in Europe soared since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as President Vladimir Putin restricted supply to the continent, and many countries reduced their imports from Russia. But this unprecedented wave of warm weather has meant a lower demand for gas, contributing to natural gas prices slumping to their lowest level since Russia launched its invasion in February last year, according to data from Refinitiv.\n\nBilbao saw temperatures peak at 24.9 degrees Celsius (77.8 Fahrenheit) on January 1.

Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian government, tweeted on New Year\u2019s Day: \u201cPutin wanted to freeze Ukrainian allies and defeat Ukraine. Instead, even the weather is on our side.\u201d\n\nBut while the warm weather may provide some relief, meteorologists warn this spell offers a glimpse of a concerning future.\n\nEurope has entered \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d said Herrera. \u201cIt is one thing to beat even a century old record by few decimals, it is another one to shatter about 5,000 records in two days, in some cases with margin of more than 5 degrees Celsius.\u201d", "label": "human"}

Keep lifestyle inflation under control\n\nFirst and foremost, the initial challenge for someone is to not increase your level of spending just because you're making more money. There is a tendency to want to spend more when there is more money available. However, it can be extremely beneficial to longer-term financial goals if your mindset shifts from being a consumer to an investor/saver.\n\nIt might be difficult, but one way to think of it is to keep the same spending patterns (i.e., \"lifestyle) intact despite having an opportunity to increase them, which will allow more resources to be used for specific financial planning goals. Spending more money just because you have it available is often called lifestyle inflation or lifestyle creep, and it's a major reason why people can be living paycheck-to-paycheck on six-figure salaries.\n\nBy no means am I saying people should not enjoy their hard-earned pay increases. It is still very important to pay for things and experiences you enjoy \u2014 but there should be some level of balance when it comes to how you're using your new income.\n\n2. Consider how your raise can impact your long-term goals\n\nWhen we talk about balance, we're talking about striking the right ratio of money spent now to money set aside for the future \u2014 which might mean increasing your rate of savings in investment accounts or focusing on debt reduction payments (or both). With investments, there are some things that we simply are not able to control, like overall market downturns. However, deciding how much and often to contribute money to accumulating wealth are areas that are clearly within our control.\n\nUpon getting a pay raise at work, you now have the opportunity to grow your assets more by saving/investing the additional cash flow, which can lead to an improved money situation over time. Take the following example that provides a simple comparison:\n\nMary performed exceptionally well at work over the past year, which resulted in her salary increasing by $6,000. She has decided that $1,000 of this extra cash flow will be used to dine out more often with family and friends, but the remaining $5,000 is allocated specifically for retirement plan contributions each year.\n\nMary is in her early 40s, maintains a 401(k) balance of ~$100,000, and currently contributes $10,000 per year to it. At her current annual contribution amount of $10,000 (assumed annual growth rate of 7%), Mary's retirement savings would grow to ~$1.2 million over the next 25 years.\n\nHowever, if she follows through with increasing her savings contribution to $15,000 per year, her total amount after the same time period would be ~$1.6 million instead \u2014 a noticeable difference. Mary used some of her extra money for enjoyment of life, but by deciding to not focus completely on spending to increase her current lifestyle, she has made a significant step in meeting a long-term goal.\n\nAnother great opportunity for those who receive pay raises is to pay off debt quicker, which ultimately frees up cash flow and allows you to focus more on asset accumulation. Certain types of debt (e.g., high interest credit cards) can be a major detriment to wealth-building, because cash is continually going to debt repayment, not asset growth.\n\nA pay raise at work can provide someone who has higher-interest debt the option to expedite the process of paying it off completely. The faster a person can get to being debt-free, the more time they have to accumulate their own wealth.\n\n3. Understand the potential of being in a higher tax bracket\n\nThis article has discussed all the great opportunities to take advantage of when earning more money at work. However, there is one more item that is not so fun, but must be discussed: taxation.\n\nQuite simply, higher income generally results in an increased tax liability. It is important for you to consult with a qualified professional on this topic as you get (and continue to) receive pay raises over time. As you continue to move into higher tax brackets, tax planning conversations (and strategies) should be discussed with a financial planner and/or tax professional, which can be of great benefit to your financial situation.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On the last day of December, 2022, a group of children gathered in a bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, to celebrate a momentous milestone. After years of fighting, their beloved book series had finally been removed from the list of banned books. The series was authored by Jerry Craft, a Black and Latinx writer and illustrator whose works have touched the lives of countless readers.\n\nThe children read aloud from The New Kid, the first book in Craft\u2019s popular series. As they read, their joy was palpable, as was their relief that this particular book \u2013 and its sequels \u2013 had finally been given the freedom to reach readers of all ages.\n\nCraft had first submitted his work to the US Library of Congress in 2018. It was rejected, however, because its content didn\u2019t fit within their \u201cage appropriate\u201d guidelines. According to Craft, this rejection was because the stories he told touched upon issues of race, poverty and identity.\n\nIn a statement released today, Craft explained that he had \u201calways wanted to create books that all children can identify with, regardless of their racial and socioeconomic background. I wanted to tell stories that empower, not just for kids of color, but for all kids. It\u2019s been an incredible journey to watch kids of all backgrounds share my stories and connect with characters from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nCraft\u2019s books had been a source of controversy for years. His stories often addressed uncomfortable topics, including race and poverty, and he chose to write from the perspective of children living in low-income neighborhoods. This didn\u2019t sit well with some parents, who found his writing too \u201ccontroversial\u201d and \u201cunsuitable\u201d for their children.\n\nThe controversy only grew when his work was banned by the US Library of Congress. Craft, however, was determined to make sure his books weren\u2019t censored and continued to fight for their acceptance. He was finally successful when the US Library of Congress overturned its decision in 2022 and removed his books from the list of banned books.\n\nToday, children all over the US are finally able to enjoy Craft\u2019s stories without fear of censorship. And in doing so, they are learning valuable lessons about acceptance, resilience and the importance of standing up for what\u2019s right.\n\nCraft says he hopes his books will show children that they can be whatever they want to be. He hopes it will inspire them to pursue their dreams and fight for what\u2019s right, no matter how tough the odds may seem.\n\nIn the words of Craft himself, \u201cWhen kids see themselves in the stories I tell, it can give them the strength and courage to dream bigger and do more than they ever thought possible. I want kids to know that no matter what obstacles they face, there is always a way to overcome them.\u201d\n\nCraft\u2019s journey has been an inspiration to us all, and we\u2019re proud to have been part of his success. We look forward to watching him continue to speak up, stand up and fight for freedom of speech.", "label": "machine"}

It just had two little fairy stumps at the back.\u201d\n\nHaving spoken to experts from Derbyshire Nature Reserve, he said it was likely that the fox had been born with the disability.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\n\u201cThe experts believe it was most likely born that way, because if it had been run over by a car or hit by a combine harvester then the whole of its back would have been damaged, which doesn't appear to be the case,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Derbyshire couple are often visited by foxes but had never seen one like this. Although the animals are usually shy around humans, the creature ended up staying in their garden for 45 minutes.\n\nA spokeswoman for the charity the Fox Project said that the creature appeared to have adapted very well to its disability.\n\n\u201cThe way that the legs look, it looks more like it\u2019s been a disability from birth and that's probably how it\u2019s adapted to be on two legs - its overall condition for two legs looks quite good,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPotentially people around there would have supported it from birth,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIf it was an accident you would have more of the legs there, and if it had been amputated after an injury you would still have the top of the hip joints moving. Any vet would never take both back legs off, so it hasn\u2019t been interfered with by a human.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI would say people have potentially supported it from it being like that from quite small - if it was to fend for itself it would not be as it seems. So if it gets food it\u2019s probably been left out by people.\u201d\n\n'Very rare' for both legs to be missing\n\nShe added: \u201cDisabilities are not normally both back legs but we\u2019ve had them as small cubs dragging back legs and they adapt, as that\u2019s all they\u2019ve known. Limbs can be shorter but it\u2019s unusual for both legs to be missing. I would say this is a very rare thing.\u201d\n\nShe said that even when foxes have been hit by cars and are unable to move their back legs they are able to move very quickly,\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s most likely it has a food source from somebody unless other foxes are supporting it. If it\u2019s one of this year\u2019s cubs and mum and other cubs are around they might bring food back to it if they know it can\u2019t get as much food for itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very social animals - they look after each other when they can.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Activision Blizzard, one of the world\u2019s largest video game publishers, had to face an unprecedented worker protest on Tuesday, July 21, 2020. Workers from all over the world, from California to South Korea to France, walked out of the company\u2019s offices, citing a lack of support for Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that guaranteed a woman\u2019s right to privacy in the early 1970s.\n\nThe strikers said that, despite Activision Blizzard\u2019s stated commitment to diversity and inclusion, they had not seen the company take action to protect the rights of its employees. The workers demanded that Activision Blizzard take steps to support their rights to bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom, as well as to demonstrate its commitment to championing progressive values.\n\nThe demonstrators chanted slogans such as \u201cReproductive Rights Are Human Rights\u201d and \u201cRoe v. Wade Forever\u201d as they marched outside the company\u2019s headquarters in California and offices in other parts of the world. Some carried signs that read, \u201cNo Rights Without Reproductive Rights\u201d and \u201cSay it Loud: Abortion Rights Are Women\u2019s Rights.\u201d\n\nThe strikers were supported by organizations such as the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and NARAL Pro-Choice America, which have all called on Activision Blizzard to recognize the fundamental rights of its workers. The Women\u2019s March and the National Organization for Women also showed their support for the strikers.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, NARAL President Ilyse Hogue expressed her solidarity with the strikers, saying, \u201cEveryone deserves access to quality, affordable health care, and that includes access to reproductive health care. We are standing in solidarity with the Activision Blizzard workers in their fight for reproductive freedom, and we hope that the company will recognize their right to control their own bodies and make their own decisions about their health care.\u201d\n\nActivision Blizzard, which is headquartered in Santa Monica, California, was founded in 2008. It produces and distributes a wide range of gaming titles and merchandise, including the popular \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d \u201cDiablo,\u201d and \u201cHearthstone\u201d franchises. In the last decade, Activision Blizzard has become one of the largest video game companies in the world. It currently employs more than 9,000 people in 17 countries.\n\nIn response to the protest, Activision Blizzard issued a statement saying that it recognizes and values the importance of Roe v. Wade, and that the company is committed to providing comprehensive health care coverage that includes coverage for a variety of reproductive health services. The company also said that it is \u201ccommitted to an open, safe, and supportive work environment\u201d and that it \u201cfully supports each employee\u2019s right to privacy and respects their individual choice in this matter.\u201d\n\nActivision Blizzard\u2019s support for Roe v. Wade is especially significant given its size and influence in the global video game industry. With its support, Activision Blizzard has set an important precedent for other companies in the industry, sending a clear message that its employees\u2019 reproductive rights are important and that it is committed to protecting them.\n\nThe strikers\u2019 demonstration was an important step in the fight for reproductive rights and a powerful reminder that the struggle for these rights is far from over. With their courageous action, the strikers have shown the world that workers, especially in the gaming industry, are willing to fight for the reproductive rights that they deserve.", "label": "machine"}

Both Cleveland games you\u2019re playing against a team that\u2019s really, really big, and then against Brooklyn, we didn\u2019t get hurt as much on the boards.

In a funny kind of way, COVID gave us an opportunity to do things we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.\u201d\n\nHe says he thought of Moully: \u201cI knew he wanted to do more murals, and I wanted to do a mural.\u201d\n\nSo Posner made plans for Moully to come and lead the creation of the artwork.\n\n\u201cOther murals have a very clear plan and idea,\u201d Posner says. \u201cThis was not like that.\u201d\n\nHe says Moully\u2019s style \u201cis very casual. He doesn\u2019t paint lines. He begins with a concept.\u201d\n\nThat let the kids \u201cdo what they want with very loose parameters.\u201d\n\nThis is the Lubavich Chabad wall at the start of work on the Skokie mural in 2020.

And that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d\n\nPosner\u2019s take on the mural? \u201cI think it\u2019s meant to convey a sense of purpose and meaning in life. Things that are worthwhile or important are denoted by the open book.\u201d\n\nMoully says he\u2019s \u201cbeen creating murals for a number of years.\u201d He \u201cwas a full-time rabbi in a synagogue\u201d when he \u201crealized that the gift God has given me is using art to communicate. Now, I\u2019m a full-time artist.\u201d\n\nHe was back in Chicago last year to do another mural, this one with Rogers Park artist Anshie Kagan at the Akiba-Schechter Jewish Day School, 5235 S.

And thanks to that business prowess, along with a dogged work ethic and some savvy money moves, in 2022 the 28-year-old continued to build her financial empire and hit her goal to earn $1 million within a year. It's a major milestone for the ex-New York Stock Exchange equity trader, who at 22 years old became the youngest and only second Black woman to trade on the floor \u2014 and was severely underpaid while doing it, earning just $12,000 a year while male colleagues made ten times as much. Fresh off the accomplishment of buying her first home in the Los Angeles area, CNBC Make It caught up with Simmons for the best work and money lessons she learned this year, and some advice to those worried about a bumpy financial outlook ahead:\n\nOn being intentional with your work and money\n\nAmericans have been hit hard all year by sky-high inflation, rising interesting rates, a volatile stock market and supply chain issues that continue to throw the supply-demand cycle out of whack. Looking ahead to 2023, Simmons says she's reassessing her risk tolerance and urging caution against uncertainty. It comes down to being intentional with how you spend your money, she says. For example, she's looked to Treasury securities, which are backed by the government, as a safer vehicle to park cash. While they may not have major return potential like investing in the market, U.S. Treasury yields are on the rise (the 2-year Treasury sits at 4.391%) as investors seek greater stability in 2023. Other lessons Simmons is keeping top of mind in the new year: Don't make impulsive decisions with your career, like quitting your job without another one lined up. And continue to work on your side hustles, whether to supplement your income or replace it if need be.\n\nOn staying out of the crypto game\n\nSpeaking of risk, Simmons considers herself a conservative investor and has never waded into the cryptocurrency market, even though plenty of people told her to consider it. Given the headline-making chaos coming out of the market this year, from a $2 trillion crypto market crash to the November collapse of FTX, Simmons continues to feel confident about her decision to stay out of crypto for now. \"I don't want to be that person who says 'I told you so,' and listen, I love everyone's input,\" Simmons says. But, \"What I tell people is, I'm a data and numbers girl. If the data and the numbers don't support it, or there's been no historical trends ... it's not something that I can put my money into. That's just the way I invest.\" She knows not everyone will agree with her, which is fine, but she lives by a principle that'll outlast any financial craze and economic cycle: \"At the end of the day, people have to really understand what their risk tolerance is, what their goals are, and make the smartest money moves they can.\"\n\nOn thinking outside the box with investing\n\nEach person will invest differently depending on their income bracket and means, but one universal lesson is that \"diversifying your portfolio really is the name of the game, and diversifying your portfolio is not just investing in the stock market,\" Simmons says, pointing to alternative assets like investing in real estate and fine arts (even owning fractional shares of works). When it comes to investing, \"I'm a big proponent of developing a relationship with yourself and understanding what your likes and your dislikes are, and understanding what you're absolutely not going to tolerate,\" Simmons says. That understanding helped her stand firm in her belief to stay away from crypto, \"even when there were millions of people saying otherwise. And at the end of the day, you have to understand where you are willing to compromise on things.\" With all that said, she's not against learning more about crypto and other financial trends that crop up, as long as she measures them against her core values: \"You definitely should continue to grow and learn.\"\n\nOn opening up your career path", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Wenn man sich anschaut, was es in 2020 f\u00fcr die globale Klimabewegung gegeben hat, dann sind diese vier Erfolge unter dem Strich besonders erw\u00e4hnenswert:\n\nErstens, es hat einen interessanten Entwicklungsschritt gegeben, als China angek\u00fcndigt hat, seine Treibhausgas-Emissionen zu erh\u00f6hen, nachdem sie 2020 auf ein 20-Jahres-Tief gesunken sind. China ist der weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dfte Verursacher von Treibhausgasen und damit f\u00fcr mehr als ein Viertel der weltweiten Treibhausgas-Emissionen verantwortlich. Ein weiterer Anstieg der Emissionen h\u00e4tte einen erheblichen Einfluss auf das Klima gehabt. Die j\u00fcngste Ank\u00fcndigung Chinas, dass es seine Bem\u00fchungen zur Reduzierung der Emissionen bis 2060 fortsetzen wird, war ein echter Durchbruch f\u00fcr die Klimabewegung.\n\nZweitens, 2021 hat eine wichtige Wiedergeburt des Paris Climate Agreements gesehen, als die Europ\u00e4ische Union und mehrere andere L\u00e4nder die Entscheidung getroffen haben, zusammenzustehen und das Abkommen zu st\u00e4rken. Das Abkommen verspricht, das Niveau der globalen Erw\u00e4rmung um mehr als zwei Grad zu senken, und es hat viele wichtige Ziele, die erreicht werden m\u00fcssen, bevor das m\u00f6glich ist. Das Abkommen ist ein wichtiger Schritt in Richtung Klimaschutz, und es ist wichtig, dass es von vielen L\u00e4ndern unterst\u00fctzt wird.\n\nDrittens, es hat in der vergangenen Zeit einen regelrechten Boom bei sauberen Energie-Technologien gegeben. Obwohl es immer noch einige H\u00fcrden gibt, die \u00fcberwunden werden m\u00fcssen, hat die fortschrittliche Technologie den Weg zu sauberer und nachhaltiger Energieerzeugung bereitet. Eine wichtige Rolle in dieser Hinsicht spielt die Solar- und Windenergie, die f\u00fcr eine saubere Energieerzeugung immer wichtiger werden. Weitere Entwicklungen in diesem Bereich sind zu erwarten, und auch die Menschheit hat das Potenzial, in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft nahezu kohlenstoffneutral zu werden.\n\nViertens, es hat sich eine kulturelle Ver\u00e4nderung in Bezug auf das Klima vollzogen. Menschen, vor allem j\u00fcngere Generationen, waren immer mehr bereit, das Klima als ein ernstes Problem anzuerkennen, und mehr Politiker haben angefangen, die Herausforderung anzunehmen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sind viele Unternehmen auf den Zug der Nachhaltigkeit aufgesprungen und bieten klimafreundlichere Produkte und Dienstleistungen an. Das bedeutet, dass immer mehr Menschen bereit sind, den Klimawandel ernst zu nehmen und etwas dagegen zu unternehmen. \n\nIn den letzten zwei Jahren ist viel passiert, aber es ist auch viel mehr m\u00f6glich. Es ist zwar noch viel zu tun, aber mit den vier Erfolgen, die wir heuer feiern k\u00f6nnen, sind wir definitiv auf dem richtigen Weg. Es liegt an uns, uns darum", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many travelers have looked to cancel for any reason (CFAR) travel insurance as a way to get more protection while they travel.\n\nCFAR insurance is a type of policy that allows you to cancel your trip for any reason, even if it\u2019s not one that would typically be covered by traditional travel insurance. While traditional policies usually only provide coverage for specific reasons, such as trip cancellation due to illness, CFAR insurance provides coverage for a variety of different reasons.\n\nBut just what is cancel for any reason travel insurance? How does it work? And what do you need to know before you buy it? In this article, we\u2019ll answer all of these questions and more.\n\nWhat is Cancel for Any Reason Travel Insurance?\n\nCFAR insurance is a type of policy that allows you to cancel your trip for any reason. This type of coverage is different than traditional travel insurance, which only covers specific reasons, such as medical emergencies, airline delays, and missed connections.\n\nCFAR policies are typically more expensive than traditional policies, but the added flexibility they provide can be invaluable if you need to change or cancel your plans.\n\nCFAR policies typically provide coverage for a variety of scenarios, including but not limited to:\n\n\u2022 Loss of job or unexpected changes to your employment situation\n\n\u2022 Unexpected illness or injury\n\n\u2022 Fear of travel due to terrorist attacks or public health warnings\n\n\u2022 Unexpected death in the family\n\n\u2022 Unexpected natural disasters or weather events\n\n\u2022 Change of heart about the trip or simply wanting to cancel\n\n\u2022 Unexpected changes to your schedule\n\nCFAR policies can also provide reimbursement for non-refundable tickets and provide compensation for lost deposits and fees if you are forced to cancel your trip.\n\nHow Does CFAR Insurance Work?\n\nCFAR policies are generally straightforward and easy to understand. You will purchase the policy and pay any applicable premiums. In most cases, the policies will be limited to a specific amount of money, usually between 50-75% of the cost of the trip.\n\nOnce you have the policy, you can cancel your trip for any reason that is allowed by the policy. If you need to cancel, you will usually need to provide some type of documentation to prove that you had to cancel for the reason that you stated. Once the cancellation is approved, you will be eligible to receive a refund of up to the amount of the policy, minus any applicable deductibles or fees.\n\nAre There Any Limitations to CFAR Insurance?\n\nLike all forms of insurance, there are some limitations to CFAR policies. First, policies are generally non-refundable, meaning that if you don\u2019t need to cancel your trip, you won\u2019t be able to get a refund. Additionally, many policies will require you to purchase the policy at least 21-30 days prior to your departure date in order to be eligible for coverage.\n\nFinally, policies may also have limits on the amount of coverage they will provide. For example, a CFAR policy may only reimburse you up to 50% of the cost of your trip, so it\u2019s important to read the policy and make sure that it will provide enough coverage for your needs.\n\nHow Much Does CFAR Insurance Cost?\n\nThe cost of CFAR insurance can vary widely, depending on the specifics of the policy, the length of the trip, and other factors. Generally, the cost of the policy will be somewhere between 5-15% of the total cost of the trip, but it can be higher or lower depending on the specifics of the policy and the insurer.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCancel for any reason travel insurance can provide valuable peace of mind for travelers looking for extra protection while they travel. While the policies are typically more expensive than traditional travel insurance, they provide more flexibility and coverage for a variety of reasons. Before purchasing a CFAR policy, it\u2019s important to read the terms and conditions of the policy carefully to make sure that it provides the coverage that you need.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "update\n\nThe crisis between Russia and Ukraine has deepened over the past week, resulting in a series of escalating diplomatic and military moves.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, Russia announced the closure of the Kerch Strait, the maritime route connecting the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, used by commercial vessels and warships. The Kremlin said it was necessary to stop the Ukrainian military from using the strait to launch attacks against Russian forces.\n\nThe decision sparked international condemnation and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to call on NATO to deploy forces to the region. The request was rejected by the alliance.\n\nThe crisis escalated further when the Kremlin sent warships and fighter jets to the region, escalating tensions to their highest level since 2014.\n\nRussia justified its action by accusing Ukraine of \"provoking\" Moscow in the region.\n\n\"Moscow does not recognize the provocation of our military by Kiev and reserves the right to take adequate measures,\" said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman.\n\nThe Ukrainian government, meanwhile, accused Russia of \"provocative and irresponsible\" behavior.\n\n\"These actions constitute a flagrant violation of international law and basic principles of the United Nations Charter,\" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.\n\nThe situation worsened on January 2, 2023, when Russia issued an ultimatum to Ukraine: the Kerch Strait must be closed to all vessels of NATO members and the alliance must withdraw from the region or face unspecified consequences.\n\nThe ultimatum was dismissed by NATO and the United States, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying the Russian demands were \"simply unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Russia has sought to destabilize Ukraine and expand its influence at the expense of the Ukrainian people,\" Pompeo said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on January 3, 2023 to discuss the situation in the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe session was attended by representatives from all the permanent members of the Council: the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the meeting, the United States reiterated its condemnation of Russia's actions and urged the Kremlin to de-escalate the crisis.\n\n\"This is a very dangerous situation and it must be reversed,\" said US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft.\n\nRussian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, however, defended his country's actions and accused Ukraine of \"aggressively and recklessly\" provoking Russia.\n\nThe session ended without any concrete solutions being proposed.\n\nThe United Nations said it was ready to provide assistance in de-escalating the situation, but reiterated that any solution must be reached between the two sides.\n\nWith the situation escalating, both sides have moved additional forces to the region.\n\nUkraine has sent extra troops, tanks and aircraft to the frontline and the Russian navy has deployed warships and fighter jets to the Sea of Azov.\n\nFor the time being, both sides appear to be engaged in a tense military stand-off.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union has expressed its concern about the situation and urged both sides to \"urgently seek a diplomatic solution and work towards de-escalation.\"\n\nThe situation remains fluid and it is unclear how it will play out in the coming days and weeks.\n\nWhat is certain is that the crisis has further strained relations between Moscow and the West and has heightened the risk of an all-out war.", "label": "machine"}

I\u2019m confident in my team of doctors and intend to take their advice so that I can come out of this battle in the best health possible.\u201d\n\nCasey, a Democrat who was first elected in 2006, said he is currently going through tests and will determine a course of treatment soon.\n\nHe said he was speaking publicly about his diagnosis to raise awareness about prostate cancer, and the importance of regular screenings.\n\n\u201cI want to be open and honest about my own experience so that others will be encouraged to get regular screenings,\u201d Casey said. \u201cEarly detection and treatment are key in fighting this disease.\u201d\n\nCasey also thanked his constituents for their support, and said he intends to keep representing Pennsylvania in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI want to make one thing clear: I\u2019m still here to fight for the people of Pennsylvania,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI plan to serve in the Senate as long as I\u2019m able. I look forward to continuing to work on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nThe senator is no stranger to health issues. In January 2018, he was hospitalized for chest pain and released after undergoing a procedure to determine the cause. Last June, Casey revealed he had diabetes, and had been managing it with diet and exercise for years.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, an estimated 191,930 men in the US were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2019, and 33,330 men died from it.\n\nThe institute says prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men other than skin cancer, and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men.\n\nIt is believed to be caused by genetic factors, family history and lifestyle. The disease often has no symptoms in the early stages and is usually detected through a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test or a digital rectal exam.\n\nIn his remarks Tuesday, Casey encouraged men over the age of 50 \u2014 particularly those at high risk \u2014 to talk to their doctors about getting the necessary screenings.\n\n\u201cI want to urge all of my fellow Pennsylvanians to take their health seriously and make sure they\u2019re getting regular checkups,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThe earlier you detect this disease, the better your chances for a successful outcome. I\u2019m optimistic about my own future.\u201d\n\nCasey\u2019s prognosis and course of treatment are expected to be determined in the coming weeks.

{"text": "The Pentagon announced today the expansion of leave time for new parents in uniform. The move comes as the US military continues to strive for better work/life balance for its members.\n\nStarting this month, all new mothers and fathers in the military are eligible for 12 weeks of paid parental leave, which is more than double the current six-week allowance. This means more time for new parents to bond with and care for their newborns while still serving the military.\n\nThe new policy was approved by the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nAustin stated in a press conference that the US military \u201cwants to make sure that our personnel have the opportunity to spend quality time with their families and to be able to spend time with their babies in the first months of life, when it is so critical.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re proud to provide these additional weeks to give new parents the support they need. This is an important step in taking care of the men and women who serve our nation and their families.\u201d\n\nThe new policy will go into effect immediately, and those in the military who have had children in the last six months will be eligible for the additional leave time.\n\nIn addition to the extra leave time for new parents in the military, the Department of Defense is also expanding child care options. Beginning next month, a pilot program will roll out offering on-site child care to members of the military on select bases.\n\nAustin also noted that the new policy is part of the military\u2019s larger initiative to create a healthier work/life balance for its personnel. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring that service members are able to meet the demands of their job and to also be able to fully enjoy their family life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe news of the expanded leave time and child care options comes at a time when the US military is looking to increase its ranks.\n\nIn recent years, the Department of Defense has been struggling to attract new recruits. The new policy could be seen as a way of giving potential recruits a bit of an extra incentive to join up.\n\nNo doubt this additional leave time and child care assistance will also be seen as a morale boost for those in the military who already have families.\n\nFor now, the new policy will only apply to those in the military, but it could pave the way for more widespread parental leave and child care assistance in the years ahead.", "label": "machine"}

Reusable bags range from 74 cents to $3.98 depending on size and functionality, per a graphic from Walmart.\n\nNew York and Colorado will join three other states \u2014 New Jersey, Maine, and Vermont \u2014 where Walmart has eliminated single-use bags as part of a greater sustainability effort.\n\n\"Eliminating single-use bags is part of our commitment to achieve zero waste across our operations and ultimately shift gradually toward a circular economy built on advancing reuse, refill and recycling habits,\" Walmart spokeswoman Lauren Willis told Insider.\n\nWalmart will sell reusable bags in states where it has banned single-use bags. The prices for these bags range from 74 cents to $3.98. Walmart\n\nWalmart has been pushing to be more sustainable with its bags since at least 2020.\n\nIn the summer of that year, Walmart announced in a blog post that it was joining forces with Target and CVS in the \"Beyond the Bag\" initiative, which is being spearheaded by sustainability focused investment firm Closed Loop Partners. The goal of the initiative is to \"identify, test and implement innovative new design solutions that serve the function of today's single-use plastic retail bag, according to the initiative's website.\n\n\"While the convenience of the plastic retail bag cannot be disputed, the average working life of one of these bags is only 12 minutes,\" then-Walmart Director of Sustainability Anna Vinogradova wrote in the blog post. \"It's estimated that 100 billion plastic bags are being used annually in the U.S. alone, and less than 10 percent of them are recycled.\"\n\nIn the states in which Walmart has or will be eliminating single-use bags, legislatures have already passed laws that ban single-use plastic bags and require retailers to charge a fee for, or outright ban, single-use paper bags.\n\nWalmart has set a goal \"to achieve zero waste\" in its own operations in the US and Canada by 2025. It's unclear if that includes eliminating single-use plastic bags at all stores. A Walmart spokesperson did not respond to questions on that goal and if Walmart would ban single-use bags in any other states in 2023.\n\nDo you live in Maine, Vermont, New Jersey, Colorado, or New York and have thoughts on Walmart's ban of single-use bags?

{"text": "When Joe Biden flew to the wind-swept coast of Cornwall, England, for his first major meeting with leaders of allied nations in June 2021, he wanted to footstomp that the Trumpian era of publicly berating allies and eschewing international cooperation was over. He later recalled declaring to a meeting of foreign leaders, \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d In response, French President Emmanuel Macron and three other leaders asked him the same question: \u201cFor how long?\u201d\n\nA year and a half later, that looming anxiety among European allies hasn\u2019t gone away. Even after Biden took the lead in corralling a unified response to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and increased American troop presence in Europe, there\u2019s a lingering sense of unease that the long-term U.S. commitment to Europe\u2019s security remains too vulnerable to the unpredictable gusts of American politics.\n\nThe midterm campaigns last month were a wakeup call. Several Trump-backed candidates expressed skepticism over U.S. military involvement in Ukraine. European leaders and diplomats were relieved when that isolationism didn\u2019t overtake Congress amid a Republican red wave, but some of those candidates did win and many others came close.\n\nEurope\u2019s leaders are looking nervously at what the 2024 Presidential election cycle may mean for U.S. support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which former President Donald Trump has long criticized and wanted to walk away from. And that\u2019s added to the urgency of efforts to get the U.S. to bolster NATO as much as possible in the next two years, before a possible shift in the political winds.\n\n\u201cThere was more concern before the outcome of the midterm elections,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a strategic analyst and advisor to the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think tank in Paris. \u201cNow the concern shifts further down the line and changes in nature.\u201d\n\nThat concern has played into Macron\u2019s hands, who was the guest of honor last week at Biden\u2019s first state dinner and has spent years insisting that Europe needed to rely less on the U.S. military for its own defense. On Dec. 13, Macron will be hosting an international meeting in Paris, where he hopes to bolster support for Ukraine and NATO.\n\nRead more: Macron Uses White House Visit to Voice Frustration With Two U.S. Laws\n\nAlready NATO has strengthened its defenses, increasing the troop presence along Russia\u2019s western flank from four battle groups to eight. NATO countries are also looking at upgrading missile and aircraft systems and buying more ships and maritime defense equipment. Sweden and Finland, two countries close to Russia, are moving forward with joining the alliance, ending 73 years of reticence to sign on to the joint defense pact. And on Nov. 29, the foreign ministers of NATO countries met in Romania\u2019s capital, Bucharest, and reaffirmed NATO\u2019s \u201copen door policy,\u201d including a willingness for Ukraine to eventually join the alliance, a stance that has incensed Putin in the past.\n\nPutin\u2019s tank blitz into Ukraine in February set off an effort to shift NATO\u2019s strategic posture away from only being equipped to respond to an incursion by Russian troops, and more toward mobilizing to deter a future invasion by creating enough of a military presence along Russia\u2019s border. The strategy is known as \u201cdeterrence by denial.\u201d\n\nSophia Besch, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says the strategic shift in Europe came about in part out of fear that the political changes inside the US may eventually erode American commitments to NATO. \u201cIf the US attention eventually shifts away from Ukraine and Europe, there is a sense, particularly in France, that strengthening the European pillar in NATO matters,\u201d she says.\n\nThat means getting European militaries to build up the airlift, logistics and maritime fighting power that the U.S. currently provides.\n\nAs Republicans prepare to take control of the House in January, the party\u2019s leaders are signaling that they will be looking more closely at US funding for the war in Ukraine. The likely new Speaker of the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, said in October that Americans wouldn\u2019t support writing a \u201cblank check\u201d on Ukraine. That will likely mean pressure from House Republicans to beef up scrutiny on future rounds of economic assistance going to Ukraine, says Daniel S. Hamilton, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. Nonetheless, there remains strong bipartisan support in Congress for providing direct military assistance to Ukraine\u2019s war effort. \u201cIf you really look hard, there is a consensus among the Republicans in the Senate and the House on lethal aid to Ukraine,\u201d Hamilton says.\n\nFor now, in Europe, the political parties in power are largely backing Ukraine, with the exception of the leadership in Hungary, says Heisbourg. \u201cYou have the division within practically every country, including the US, with those who think this should be settled as soon as possible, taking into account the interests of Russia,\u201d Heisbourg says. \u201cBut apart from Hungary there is nowhere where that part of public opinion is actually in power.\u201d\n\nMacron is expected to further push for strengthening European commitments to NATO at the international conference on Ukraine he\u2019s hosting in Paris next week. Looming over those talks is the question of how long the war in Ukraine will last, and the terms under which Putin and Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky might suspend the conflict. Putin has escalated the war in recent weeks, sending volleys of missiles to destroy water and heating systems across Ukraine as winter sets in. Zelensky has continued to hold to the line that his country remains committed to fighting until Russian troops retreat from Ukrainian soil, including Russian forces in Crimea, which Putin illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House on Thursday with Macron, Biden said he would be willing to sit down with Putin, if Putin was \u201clooking for a way to end the war.\u201d But Biden said he wouldn\u2019t talk to Putin without closely consulting his NATO allies. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it on my own,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u2014 WITH REPORTING FROM VIVIENNE WALT/PARIS\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Gold prices jumped to a six-month high on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism around the reopening of the Chinese economy, with the yellow metal settling at a near seven-year high.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.8% to $1,947.58 per ounce by the close of trading in London, its highest since June. Prices in U.S. futures for December delivery added 0.7% to settle at $1,947.90 an ounce.\n\nAnalysts said that the reopening of the world's second-largest economy, which is gradually returning to normal following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, is supportive of gold prices.\n\nChina's recovery could help to drive a long-term uptrend in gold prices, which are seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, analysts said.\n\n\"The Chinese New Year is coming up at the end of January and that could mark the start of a new bullish chapter for gold,\" said Tai Wong, head of metals trading at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\n\nThe strength of gold prices is also likely to benefit from the extremely low interest rates in both the U.S. and other major economies.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other central banks have kept interest rates at record lows since the start of the pandemic, and are unlikely to move them higher in the short-term. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold and other non-yielding assets.\n\nGold prices have also been boosted by safe-haven demand, as investors seek out assets to protect them from the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nThe yellow metal has gained over 25% since the start of 2020, making it one of the best-performing assets this year.\n\nThe rally has prompted some investors to take profits at higher levels, but analysts said that there could be further gains ahead.\n\n\"There's still room to go higher as investors focus on the positives and look ahead to a post-COVID world and focus on the inflationary theme that is likely to play out over the next few years,\" said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.\n\nYang added that gold could rise to $2,000 an ounce in 2021, as long as a COVID-19 vaccine is found and the global economy starts to recover.\n\nAnalysts also warned that a rise in US Treasury yields, if it were to occur, could weigh on gold prices, although they said that this is unlikely in the near-term.\n\nLooking ahead, investors are awaiting the outcome of the two Georgia run-off elections, which will decide whether Democrats or Republicans will control the US Senate.\n\nThe US dollar has also been on a volatile path in recent days, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the U.S. economy still needs support from fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nWith no immediate catalysts, analysts said that gold prices will likely be driven by global risk sentiment, inflation expectations and monetary policy in the near-term.", "label": "machine"}

He reflected on the aftermath of the decision, noting that it was met with both enthusiasm and anger, and that it resulted in protests and civil unrest. \n\n\u201cOf course, 2020 was a challenging year,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cYet our country has faced challenges before, including in the aftermath of the Brown decision in 1954. Despite the divisiveness that followed, the Court remained steadfast in its duty to protect the rule of law.\u201d\n\nHe went on to stress the importance of following the law over mob rule, and of the judicial branch\u2019s role in upholding the law.\n\n\u201cWe should recall that the Framers of the Constitution recognized the importance of rule by law instead of by mob,\" he wrote. \"As the guardians of that system, it is our job to safeguard the independent decision-making powers of the judiciary and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nWhile he did not explicitly mention the Black Lives Matter movement, or other protests that shook the nation during the summer of 2020, Roberts\u2019 words seemed to draw a parallel between the Supreme Court\u2019s role in upholding the law then and now.\n\nRoberts also praised the entire judiciary for its dedication during a time of widespread uncertainty and disruption, noting that courts adopted new technologies and procedures and worked to keep judicial services running during the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n\u201cOur federal courts have responded to the pandemic with resilience, ingenuity, and dedication. We have implemented innovative and safe access to justice and remote proceedings. We have addressed the impact of the virus on state and local governments, while ensuring the continued delivery of essential services and continuity of government operations,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, Roberts stressed that all Americans should have faith in the nation\u2019s system of justice, despite the challenges of 2020.\n\n\u201cThough we have had to adapt our practices and operations in extraordinary ways, we will continue to honor the public\u2019s trust in the rule of law and in the justice system\u2019s commitment to fair and impartial decision-making,\u201d he wrote. \n\nHis remarks seemed to be a reflection on a tumultuous year for the Supreme Court and the entire judicial system. He highlighted the challenges that 2020 brought, and the importance of the court\u2019s commitment to the rule of law. \n\nThe final lines of Roberts\u2019 report concluded with a call for Americans to have faith in their nation\u2019s judicial system, despite the challenges of the past year. \n\n\u201cAs we have seen in the challenges of 2020, our justice system has not yet fully achieved the promise of equal justice under the law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it remains a system on which all can rely and with which all can be proud.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Scientists have made a major breakthrough in treating erectile dysfunction (ED): a new bionic penis augment that could one day restore or even enhance sexual function.\n\nThe technology, developed at the University of Southampton, involves implanting an electronic device inside a penis to stimulate erections. The new device is expected to be available for medical use in the next two to three years, a team of researchers from the University of Southampton and University College London announced this week.\n\nThe technology is the result of nearly three years of research and development, and is based on the same principles as traditional ED treatments such as drugs like Viagra and penile pumps. The difference is that the new device, dubbed the \"erectomagnetic implant,\" is powered by electromagnetic fields.\n\nWhen implanted into a patient's penis, the device activates tiny magnetically-driven \"sensors\" that act to stimulate the nerves, allowing erections to be achieved and maintained. The implant is also programmable, allowing physicians to adjust the intensity of stimulation depending on the individual needs of the patient.\n\nThe researchers said the implant could offer ED sufferers the ability to maintain an erection for up to six hours or more, depending on the severity of the condition.\n\nThe implant is made of titanium and has been tested on several volunteer patients. The results have been encouraging, with the volunteers reporting firmer and longer-lasting erections that lasted between five and six hours.\n\nDr. Steven Kind, lead researcher and head of the research team at the University of Southampton, said the team is now looking to further develop and refine the technology, and is hoping to see the implant available for medical use within the next two to three years.\n\n\"It is still early days, but we are already achieving some very positive results,\" Kind said. \"We are confident that in the near future, we will be able to offer a reliable, safe and effective treatment for men suffering from ED.\"\n\nAlthough the technology may seem futuristic, the researchers point out that it is based on established principles, such as those used to treat patients with pacemakers. The team hopes that the implant will eventually be available to a wider range of patients and not just those with ED.\n\nThe researchers say the implant could also be used to potentially enhance sexual performance, helping men to achieve even stronger and longer-lasting erections. The team is now working to further refine the technology so that it can be used to treat other conditions, such as premature ejaculation.\n\nAs with all medical treatments, the implant has yet to be approved by regulatory bodies, such as the FDA and European Medicines Agency. But the team is confident that if the trials are successful, then the device could soon be available to the millions of men worldwide who suffer from ED.", "label": "machine"}

Now, experts in the financial sector are predicting that stocks within the elite \u201cClub 10\u201d could be set for big gains in 2023.\n\nThe Club 10 refers to the 10 leading stocks in the S&P 500, an index that measures the performance of the largest companies by market capitalization in the United States. The members of the Club 10 consist of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Johnson & Johnson, Visa, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart.\n\nThe highly influential financial advisory firm Goldman Sachs recently released its list of the S&P 500 stocks it predicts will have the strongest performance in the coming year. Of the top ten stocks, eight come from the Club 10. While Goldman Sachs predicts that the Club 10 stocks will outperform the S&P 500 overall in 2023, it believes that some individual stocks have the potential to deliver exceptional returns.\n\nAt the top of Goldman\u2019s list is Visa, the payment processing company. The firm believes Visa\u2019s expanding customer base, new products, and strong corporate partnerships will push the stock higher in the coming year.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is another Club 10 stock that Goldman expects to see strong performance from in 2023. The financial giant\u2019s focus on improving digital banking services and its strong presence in the investment banking sector are expected to drive share prices higher in the coming year.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting prediction from Goldman Sachs is the potential for Amazon to outperform the rest of the Club 10 stocks. With its powerful network of distribution centers, Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift to online shopping in the coming years, and Goldman believes its stock price could climb significantly over the course of 2023.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Alphabet are also expected to benefit from their strong presence in the technology sector and their solid performance over the past several years. Although their stocks may not rise as quickly as some of their peers, they should still deliver modest returns.\n\nThe financial world has been surprised by the potential of Facebook, the social media giant that has had several setbacks over the past year. Despite this, Goldman Sachs still believes the stock could rally in the coming year, citing its strength in the mobile advertising market and its new streaming services.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is expected to be another stellar performer in 2023. While Warren Buffet\u2019s firm has traditionally relied on investments in other companies for its returns, the firm is now using its substantial cash reserves to make a number of acquisitions that are expected to boost the stock price.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and Walmart round out the list of Club 10 stocks that are expected to see positive returns in 2023. Johnson & Johnson continues to strengthen its position in the pharmaceutical industry, while Walmart\u2019s emphasis on increasing e-commerce sales should be a strong driver of growth for the retail giant.\n\nOverall, the experts at Goldman Sachs are confident that the Club 10 stocks are set for a strong year in 2023. These stocks have a proven track record of delivering returns, and the firm believes that many of them will continue to outperform the S&P 500 overall.

{"text": "Here\u2019s what scientists are most confident is happening to hurricanes as a result of climate change, what they think might be occurring and the biggest questions about how these massive storms are changing that remain unanswered.\n\nWhile scientists are still learning exactly how this added heat is changing hurricanes, research shows that the storms are becoming more destructive in some key ways.\n\nThough global temperature data goes back over 150 years, hurricane records are actually very sparse prior to the 1970s, when satellites first began capturing images of all of the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nIn 1961, Hurricane Esther became the first storm to be recorded by a weather satellite.\n\nThe 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active on record , and many of the storms that slammed into the Gulf Coast, Central America and the Caribbean this year exhibited hallmark signs that they were supercharged by global warming.\n\nOver the last two-plus centuries, human activity \u2014 mainly the burning of fossil fuels \u2013 has added lots of heat to the oceans and air where these storms are spawned.\n\nThis heat energy is converted into lashing winds and driving rainfall that can bring devastating impacts when they hit cities, homes and infrastructure.\n\nKnown outside of North America as tropical cyclones or typhoons, hurricanes are essentially massive engines of wind and rain that are fueled by warm ocean water and air.\n\nHurricanes are the most violent storms on the planet. The names of the most damaging ones live on because of the devastation they left in their wake.\n\nAnd when storm surge strikes a developed coastline, the cost in both lives and property can be enormous.\n\nWhen a storm\u2019s winds blow onshore, they can send feet of water rushing inland at depths far greater than even the most extreme high tides.\n\nStorm surge is the rapid rise in ocean levels brought about by the powerful winds and low pressure in a hurricane.\n\nHurricanes are categorized by their wind speeds, but the most deadly and destructive threat posed by most hurricanes is the storm surge they can produce .\n\nWhat scientists know for sure\n\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\n\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\n\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\n\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\n\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\n\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\n\nNote: Local factors such as tides and coastal profile will influence the extent of the floodplain.\n\nWith global sea levels projected to rise this century, the risk of storm surge penetrating further inland will increase.\n\nAlready, storm surge has gotten worse because sea levels are rising - and fast.\n\nSea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland storm surge can travel.\n\nDuring the height of Hurricane Dorian , Michael Pintard, Bahamas\u2019 Minister of Agriculture, recorded this video from the second story of his house. Water is seen lapping against the windows, which he estimates in the video to be nearly 20 feet high.\n\nWhile no tide gauge measurements were available in the hardest-hit parts of the Bahamas when Hurricane Dorian struck in 2019, witnesses reported that the storm put parts of the islands under as much as 20 feet of water .\n\nScientists now say sea levels could rise by more than three feet by 2100.\n\nAs sea levels continue to rise this century, the storm surge risk to the city will also grow.\n\nHere's what 2 feet of sea level rise would look like.\n\nBut with 1 foot of sea level rise, parts of it would be underwater.\n\nLow-lying cities like Charleston, South Carolina, are already vulnerable to storm surge.\n\nHowever, there have been several recent storms that provide anecdotal evidence.\n\nBut because observation stations that monitor rainfall are sparse and hurricane satellite data only goes back a few decades, we can\u2019t yet draw conclusions about how much climate change has affected rainfall, said Kossin.\n\nComputer models consistently show that hurricane rainfall is increasing already, as one would expect as the planet warms.\n\nThat would mean that in a world warmed by two degrees Celsius, you would have, on average, around 14% more water vapor in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cSimply put, warmer air holds more water vapor,\u201d said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist at NOAA\u2019s National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe increase in hurricane rainfall can be explained by physics \u2014 specifically, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which holds that for each degree Celsius of warming, 7% more water vapor should be available in the atmosphere to potentially fall as rain.\n\nIn the Southeastern US alone, the annual cost of storm surge damage is projected to grow to $56 billion by 2050 , according to the US government\u2019s 2018 National Climate Assessment. And that\u2019s even if global emissions of heat-trapping gases are moderately curbed in the next two decades.\n\nGenerally speaking, a rise in sea levels of 2 to 3 feet would mean that a Category 1 hurricane could be capable of inflicting the kind of storm surge damage we would expect today from a Category 2 storm.\n\nIf humans continue to emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, scientists expect that sea levels will climb even higher , putting major cities at an even greater risk.\n\n\u201cThis is making the storms more dangerous as it leads to higher inundation levels,\u201d said Tom Knutson, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who leads the agency\u2019s weather and climate dynamics division.\n\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as \u2018flooded\u2019 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\n\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as \u2018flooded\u2019 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\n\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as \u2018flooded\u2019 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\n\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as \u2018flooded\u2019 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\n\n*Data represent the number of times a pixel was identified as \u2018flooded\u2019 divided by the number of times the pixel was sampled.\n\nThis added heat is likely allowing hurricanes to pack even greater wind speeds.\n\nWhat scientists think they know\n\nThe following year, Hurricane Florence swamped parts of North Carolina with nearly three feet of rain , shattering the state\u2019s previous record for tropical storm rainfall.\n\nAmount of heat in the upper layer of the ocean, compared to the average from 1955-2006.

Because of this, scientists say more data is needed before we can say with certainty how climate change will impact hurricanes\u2019 strength now and in the future.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of the damage and mortality caused by hurricanes is done by major hurricanes (Category 3 to 5),\u201d Kossin said. \u201cIncreasing the likelihood of having a major hurricane will certainly increase this risk.\u201d\n\nWith stronger storms, there\u2019s also a greater chance for severe damage and destruction when hurricanes collide with towns and cities.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing consensus is that we likely won\u2019t see more storms in the future (maybe even fewer), but that these storms may be stronger,\u201d Klotzbach said. \u201cIf you look at the (hurricane) trend since 1980 (when reliable data became available), there\u2019s a huge increasing trend in Category 4s and 5s.\u201d\n\nPhil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University who monitors and analyzes hurricane trends across the globe, draws similar conclusions about how climate change is increasing hurricanes\u2019 strength.\n\n\u201cThe change is about 8% per decade,\u201d Kossin said. \u201cIn other words, during its lifetime, a hurricane is 8% more likely to be a major hurricane in this decade compared to the last decade.\u201d\n\nIn a study released earlier this year examining nearly 40 years of available satellite data , Kossin and his co-authors found that the probability of storms reaching major hurricane status (Category 3 or above with winds in excess of 110 mph or higher), increased decade after decade.\n\n\u201cThe stronger storms are getting stronger,\u201d he warned, \u201cand the stronger storms are becoming more frequent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that is not what is really important,\u201d Kossin said. The added heat in the oceans is \u201cincreasing the speed limit for storms,\u201d raising the maximum intensity that storms can achieve.\n\n\u201cWe have relatively high confidence that storms will get stronger,\u201d said Kossin. Both he and Knutson estimated the increase in the wind speeds to be between about 3% and 4% per degree Celsius of warming.\n\nWhile some recent research has shown this trend, scientists say not enough historical data exists to say how much more common rapid intensification has become.\n\nThen in November, Hurricanes Eta and Iota both rapidly gained strength before making landfall in Central America just weeks apart, with Iota becoming the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua . The fact that there were water temperatures warm enough to allow both storms to rapidly intensify this late in the season is a clear signal of global warming, Klotzbach said.\n\nThree of the most damaging hurricanes to strike the US in 2020 \u2014 Hanna, Laura and Sally \u2014 all rapidly intensified before making landfall.\n\nFrom satellite imagery, you can see how Michael\u2019s eye quickly became more defined and organized as it approached the coast, a sign that the storm was gaining strength:\n\nAll this extra heat gives hurricanes more fuel to gain strength rapidly.\n\nBut as the planet has warmed, heat in the ocean now extends further below the surface.\n\nWind and rain churn up the ocean below a hurricane, causing cooler waters from the depths to mix with warmer, surface water. This tends to limit how much a storm can strengthen.\n\nHurricanes are fueled by heat energy from warm ocean waters. As a storm moves over the ocean, it pulls in energy from the water's surface.\n\n\u201cThe tropics are expanding \u2014 so it seems to reason that the tropical cyclones would be able to extend further into the mid-latitudes,\u201d Kossin said, \u201cand when we looked at the data were able to see this shift.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kossin, who has published multiple studies on the topic, there is a growing body of evidence that there \u201chas been a systematic shift in the storm track that is not easily explained by natural causes.\u201d In the Northern Hemisphere, this means storms are tracking further north and in the Southern Hemisphere, further south.\n\nThough scientists say more evidence is needed, some findings in recent years show that more storms are reaching their peak intensities closer to the poles, potentially putting more cities within range of a major hurricane landfall.\n\nAn identical storm will produce much more destruction if it makes landfall in a major coastal city in the mid-latitudes \u2013 say New York, Shanghai or Brisbane \u2014 than if it slams into a sparsely populated coastline elsewhere.\n\nTo borrow a real estate adage, it\u2019s \u201clocation, location, location\u201d that also determines just how much damage a hurricane or typhoon can inflict.\n\nWhat scientists are just starting to learn\n\n\u201cWe used to observe storms less frequently and with satellites that had lower resolution, and consequently, we likely couldn\u2019t measure rapid intensification as well as we can now,\u201d Klotzbach told CNN.\n\nKlotzbach also noted that while the data shows an increase in the number of storms that have rapidly intensified, it also shows an increasing number of storms have rapidly weakened \u2014 indicating the increases could also be a function of advances in the amount and quality of data we are now able to collect on storms.\n\nThis shift in where storms strike could have an even larger impact on the threats hurricanes pose than increases in storm intensity due to climate change, Kossin said.\n\nMajor cities that do not have a history of dealing with tropical storms, especially at or near peak intensity, could be seeing them on a more regular basis in future decades, Kossin said.\n\nHeavily populated shorelines in northeastern China and Japan are seeing storms with 2 to 3 times the frequency they were in earlier decades, while low-lying archipelagos like the Philippines are seeing storms less frequently than we\u2019d expect, he said.\n\nThe one place where hurricane tracking data hasn\u2019t shown much of a northward shift is in the Atlantic Basin.\n\nMost scientists, Kossin included, attribute this to some longer-term variabilities that are both natural and human caused. Kossin believes the Atlantic will likely see this poleward shift in the track of storms too, but so far, it has not materialized.\n\nMore storms are stalling. That\u2019s a big problem\n\nThe slower a storm moves, the more time its winds and rain can inflict damage.\n\nIn 2019, Hurricane Dorian\u2019s devastating crawl across the Bahamas slowed to 1 mph, slower than the speed at which most humans walk. The slowdown kept the island of Grand Bahama in Dorian\u2019s eye for more than nine hours.\n\nThe lashing winds and torrential downpours from Hurricanes Harvey and Florence also slowed to a crawl on land.\n\nAs the planet warms, scientists say more and more storms appear to be experiencing this slowdown, increasing the amount of time locations in their path are exposed to dangerous conditions.\n\nBetween 1944 and 2017, 66 storms have stalled in the north Atlantic Basin, and nearly two-thirds of those occurred within the final 25 years of the study, suggesting a trend towards slower-moving storms, according to a 2019 study from Kossin and co-author Timothy Hall.\n\nBut the phenomenon isn\u2019t just confined to the Atlantic Basin.\n\nHis 2018 study in the scientific journal Nature found that the forward speed of hurricanes decreased by 10% globally between 1949 and 2016, though there is some variation in different ocean basins.\n\nThe study also found a 20% to 30% slowdown over land areas affected by North Atlantic and North Pacific tropical cyclones, respectively.\n\nThe western north Pacific Basin, which sees the most storms annually, has also seen the most slowing, while storms in the northern Indian Ocean do not appear to be slowing down yet.\n\nOverall, tropical cyclones have slowed more in the Northern Hemisphere, which is where a majority of storms occur each year.\n\nThere is considerable evidence that global summertime circulation patterns in the atmosphere are slowing as a result of global warming. Kossin believes this may also be putting the brakes on hurricane movement, but cautioned that the connection between climate and stalling is still unclear.\n\nSome scientists think other variables may be at play.\n\nOther natural climate variations \u2014 such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation \u2013 can also influence hurricane formation over long periods of time.\n\nThis study did not account for these natural cycles, which could be behind much of the observed trend, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, a prominent cryptocurrency trader and CEO of FTX, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of fraud, money laundering and other criminal activities tied to the collapse of his company last year.\n\nThe charges, which were filed in a U.S. District Court in California in December, allege that Bankman-Fried, 33, orchestrated a massive fraud scheme which caused the sudden collapse of FTX and losses of millions of dollars to its investors.\n\nThe criminal complaint, which was filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said Bankman-Fried used \u201cdeceptive practices\u201d to sell unregistered securities to investors and then used that money to purchase more cryptocurrency and real estate for himself. According to the complaint, he also falsified company financials, misled investors about his use of their funds and concealed his ownership of certain investments.\n\nAt the arraignment hearing, which was held via video conference, Bankman-Fried waived his right to a preliminary hearing and pleaded not guilty to all charges, which include conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, securities fraud and wire fraud. His attorney, Alicia Viana, said Bankman-Fried was \u201cobviously very disappointed\u201d by the charges, but maintains his innocence and \u201clooks forward to his day in court.\u201d\n\nThe plea marks the latest chapter in a case that has gripped the cryptocurrency community since FTX filed for bankruptcy in December 2020, after reportedly facing severe liquidity and capital constraints. Bankman-Fried was the company\u2019s only executive director, and was the primary beneficiary of many of its investments.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s complaint, which was filed alongside criminal charges, alleged that Bankman-Fried had funneled $1.8 billion of investors\u2019 money into his own accounts. According to the complaint, much of that money was then used to purchase personal assets, including more than $100 million in cryptocurrency and numerous properties.\n\nThe charges against Bankman-Fried come amid a broader crackdown by federal authorities on cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering. In October, the SEC launched a series of enforcement actions against traders, exchanges and individuals who were accused of perpetrating fraudulent investment schemes.\n\nThe case against Bankman-Fried is the most high-profile to date, and has captivated the cryptocurrency world as investors try to make sense of the collapse of FTX, which was once seen as one of the industry\u2019s most promising exchanges. Bankman-Fried is also well known in the industry for his outspoken views on regulation, and his crusade against market manipulation, which some observers have speculated may have led to the investigation of his activities.\n\nThe fraud, money laundering and other criminal charges against Bankman-Fried are extremely serious and carry significant penalties, including prison time. He is currently out on bail, and will face a jury trial later this year.\n\nIn the meantime, FTX customers are still trying to recover their losses. In an effort to assist them, the company has set up a website to help facilitate repayment. Bankman-Fried has also pledged to pay back all investors out of his own funds, though it is unclear if or when that will happen.\n\nFor now, the cryptocurrency industry will be watching closely as the case against Bankman-Fried proceeds, and FTX customers wait to get their money back.", "label": "machine"}

They then take their order and don\u2019t pay for it, leaving the driver with no way to get his money.\n\n\u201cThe company doesn\u2019t seem to care either,\u201d White said. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything to stop it and I\u2019m stuck having to eat the cost of the order.\u201d\n\nWhite isn\u2019t alone in his experiences. Drivers from across the country have reported similar issues, though the company has yet to respond to our requests for comment.\n\nWhen asked how the company could prevent this from happening, White said they should implement stronger security measures, such as requiring customers to provide their payment information or identity before they can order. He also suggested making customers enter a code when they receive their order so that it can be verified that they paid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really frustrating thing to have to deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand people might need food but it\u2019s not right to take advantage of us delivery drivers.\u201d\n\nWhite isn\u2019t the only delivery driver to speak out on the issue. Other drivers, like Kaitlyn Jones, have also shared similar experiences.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people try to pull the same thing on me multiple times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening because we rely on these tips and commissions to make ends meet. We\u2019re the ones doing the job and putting ourselves out there, so it\u2019s not fair when people are trying to scam us out of our pay.\u201d\n\nAs the economy continues to struggle due to the pandemic, delivery drivers and couriers have become essential workers who help keep Americans fed and supplies moving. However, this alleged scam has many questioning the safety and security of the jobs, as well as the companies\u2019 commitment to protecting the hardworking people in their employ.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s unclear how or if these companies will address the issue, though it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s becoming an increasingly pressing problem. Until then, drivers like White and Jones will continue to be at risk of being taken advantage of, and losing out on the pay they rely on.", "label": "machine"}

HR managers have gone from figuring out ways to lure employees to mass firings amid a general pull-back of ads tied to the declining economic outlook.\n\n\"The common wisdom is when the economic outlook turns bad, the very first thing to go is marketing and advertising,\" Andy Challenger, SVP at outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Insider.\n\nMore than 3,300 media jobs were lost through November this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data \u2014 though this was down from an unprecedented 2020, when Challenger data showed 30,000 media sector jobs were lost.\n\nThe cuts have hit companies of all stripes, from entertainment giants like Warner Bros.

Also affected were legacy journalism stalwarts like the Washington Post and USA Today owner Gannett, which laid off 400 staff and axed a further 400 positions in early December.\n\nAnd many more job losses are expected in another wave early next year, including at Disney where a hiring freeze and other cost controls are already in effect.\n\n\"The hottest labor market in American history inevitably is going to cool a little bit,\" Challenger said.\n\nHere are 15 media and entertainment companies that have laid off staff as of December 2022:", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The U.S. Men's National Team announced Monday that it has named Dave Sarachan as its caretaker coach for its upcoming January camp.\n\nSarachan will lead the U.S. into its annual January training camp, in which it typically invites mostly domestic-based players in what is usually the team's first preparatory action of the year. The announcement follows much speculation surrounding the USMNT's future direction after its failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe January camp is the first organized team action since the USMNT was eliminated from the 2018 World Cup following a 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago on Oct. 10. After the loss, head coach Bruce Arena resigned from his post, with U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati citing the need for \"a fresh start\".\n\nSarachan, 63, is an American soccer coach and former player, and was an assistant coach under Bruce Arena for both his first and second stints as USMNT coach. He was also head coach for two stints with the Chicago Fire in Major League Soccer, and was an assistant with the LA Galaxy from 2005-07.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to intensely explore and pursue options for a permanent head coach of the USMNT, we believe that Dave\u2019s extensive experience both in the USMNT set-up and as a head coach in Major League Soccer put him in the best possible position to serve as interim head coach,\u201d Gulati said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDave brings a wealth of experience both internationally and domestically, and we look forward to having him guide the team through the January camp and the friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u201d\n\nThe January camp will take place in the USMNT's usual locale of Carson, California, and will conclude with a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Jan. 28. The roster for the camp is expected to be released in December.\n\nThough Sarachan is the USMNT's interim coach, the team's future direction is still murky, with the permanent head coaching role still unfilled. Former Columbus Crew head coach and MLS Cup winner Gregg Berhalter is the leading candidate for the position, but Gulati said it was too early to comment on whether he would get the job.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the midst of a comprehensive process to identify the next coach for the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cWe have spoken to a number of potential candidates and are continuing those conversations. We are not going to make any decisions until we have completed our process and we have nothing to announce at this time.\u201d\n\nFor now, the focus for the USMNT is to settle on a caretaker coach for January camp and get preparations underway for their friendly match. Sarachan's first action as interim coach will be to lead the team in the upcoming camp and friendly, with the long-term goal of helping the team back onto the international stage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled and honored to have the opportunity to lead the USMNT program, even in the short-term,\u201d Sarachan said in a statement. \u201cWhile this is a new and different challenge for me, it is one that I will embrace and one I am looking forward to. I\u2019m also excited to work with some of the brightest, most talented players in our country.\u201d\n\nWith Sarachan at the helm, the USMNT will look to get back on track as they prepare for their friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the long-term future of the team is still up in the air, the hope is that the January camp will set the team on the right track, and that Sarachan can help the team to a successful start in 2018.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nCryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase has just struck an historic $100 million deal with New York regulators. The agreement comes as the first of its kind and is seen as a major step forward in the regulation of digital currencies.\n\nThe deal was announced on Tuesday morning, and comes after nearly three years of negotiations with New York regulators. Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, and the agreement serves as a milestone for the industry\u2019s regulatory regime.\n\nThe agreement with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) will resolve an ongoing investigation that began in March 2018. At that time, the NYSDFS began looking into Coinbase\u2019s compliance with its licensing and operational requirements.\n\nThe deal will require Coinbase to pay a $35 million penalty, as well as an additional $65 million in restitution to customers who had been overcharged during certain transactions. In addition, Coinbase will be required to submit regular reports to the NYSDFS regarding its compliance with state regulations.\n\nThe agreement is also expected to include provisions to address concerns regarding the protection of customer assets. Coinbase will be required to implement enhanced security controls and provide customers with increased access to information about their accounts.\n\nThe settlement comes after months of heated public debate over the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges. Critics of the industry have argued that it has been operating in a largely unregulated environment, leaving investors exposed to fraud and manipulation. Supporters have argued that the emergence of credible exchanges, such as Coinbase, could bring stability to the digital currency market.\n\nThe deal with Coinbase is expected to pave the way for other cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain licenses from the NYSDFS. Coinbase already holds licenses in New York and other states, and is the first exchange to reach an agreement with the NYSDFS.\n\nIn a statement on the deal, the NYSDFS commented, \u201cWe are pleased to have reached a resolution with Coinbase that addresses our concerns and puts in place new and enhanced protections for consumers. This agreement demonstrates that companies that operate in the virtual currency space in New York State will be held to the same standards of transparency and accountability as other financial institutions operating here.\u201d\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also commented on the deal, \u201cWe are pleased to have reached an agreement with the New York State Department of Financial Services that resolves the issues it identified in its 2018 inquiry. This agreement allows us to continue to innovate, while also strengthening our commitment to compliance and consumer protection.\u201d\n\nThe agreement is the latest milestone for Coinbase, which has been on a steady rise over the past few years. The company, which was founded in 2012, is currently valued at over $8 billion. Coinbase has also recently launched new products, such as Coinbase Pro, which allow users to trade digital currencies with advanced features.\n\nThe deal between Coinbase and the NYSDFS is expected to be a major catalyst for the mainstream adoption of digital currencies. As more states begin to regulate the industry, investors and consumers will have greater assurance that their funds are protected and their transactions secure. The agreement could also pave the way for the wider adoption of digital currencies, and open the door for further investment in the space.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nBMW AG, the German luxury car manufacturer, on Friday teased a radical new concept car: one that can shift colors like a chameleon and even \"talk\" to its driver.\n\nThe futuristic car, dubbed the BMW i7, made a surprise appearance on the company's Instagram page in the form of a digital render. The image shows a sleek and minimalist vehicle, with a unique color-shifting paint job and a shape that resembles a cocoon.\n\nThe accompanying text reads, \"The #BMW i7 Concept is here - the perfect fusion of form and function. Its color-shifting surface design is completely new and a pioneering example of lightweight construction. Plus, it 'talks' to its driver.\"\n\nThe teaser doesn't offer any other details on the car, but BMW said that it will provide more information on the concept next week.\n\nAnalysts have speculated that the concept car is based on the company's upcoming production model, the BMW i8, which is set to be released in 2021. The i8 is expected to feature a similar color-shifting paint job and boast a hybrid powertrain combining a turbocharged engine and an electric motor.\n\nGiven its radical design, the concept car could offer clues as to the future direction of BMW's design language. Its unique shape suggests that the company may be looking to create more aerodynamic vehicles, while the color-shifting paint job could hint at a desire to make cars more visually striking.\n\nThe idea of a talking car could also be a reference to the upcoming trend of autonomous vehicles, and BMW's commitment to furthering the development of self-driving technology. However, the company has yet to confirm whether or not the concept car will actually be able to communicate with its driver.\n\nAs for the color-shifting paint job, the company said that the concept car's surface is made from a \"newly developed multi-layered ceramic material.\" BMW did not provide any further information on how the material works, but it could potentially use sensors to detect changes in light and adjust the pigment in its surface accordingly.\n\nRegardless of its capabilities, the BMW i7 concept is sure to generate plenty of interest when BMW reveals more details. If it follows through on its promises, it could be a major step forward for the automotive industry.", "label": "machine"}

Biden expects to officially decide whether to run for reelection \u201cearly next year,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. Asked if exit polling showing two thirds of voters don\u2019t want him to run again will impact his decision, Biden quickly said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d His message to those Americans? \u201cWatch me.\u201d\n\nIn an hour-long press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House the day after the midterms, Biden said he was heartened by the results of the elections. He said they showed him that the American public had rejected extremism, that \u201cdemocracy is who we are\u201d and that voters want Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve problems. Biden said he plans to welcome leaders of both parties to the White House in the coming weeks to discuss a way forward, regardless of the outcome of the final vote tallies. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to work with my Republican colleagues,\u201d Biden said, adding that he thought voters sent a message that \u201cthey expect Republicans to work with me as well.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has signaled he\u2019ll announce he\u2019s running for President at an event in Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday.

Biden delivered long, sometimes defensive arguments on a wide range of subjects, including explanations of why Americans won\u2019t start seeing until next year the benefits of some of his policies like infrastructure building projects, lower medical costs, and cuts in student loan debt.\n\nAs he spoke, Biden had a few long pauses and flubbed words, and at one point mixed up the name of the Ukrainian city where Russian troops are retreating with a city in Iraq, before he was corrected by the reporter asking the question.\n\nOn Ukraine, Biden pushed back on reports that the U.S. was pressuring Ukrainian leaders to be open to a negotiated compromise with Russia and doubled down on the U.S. policy that Ukraine should make decisions about its territory.\n\nAsked if he thought the U.S. should investigate the foreign financing that Elon Musk sought to buy Twitter, Biden said he thought \u201cElon Musk\u2019s cooperation and or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.

{"text": "The Illinois Supreme Court has decided to temporarily halt statewide implementation of the controversial new law ending cash bail, and we hope the court now moves swiftly to decide the matter.\n\nKankakee County Chief Judge Thomas W. Cunnington ruled last week that the section of the SAFE-T Act abolishing cash bail is unconstitutional. That prompted Attorney General Kwame Raoul to appeal the ruling on Friday to the state Supreme Court, which will now set a schedule for briefs and arguments on the appeal.\n\nProsecutors and sheriffs from 64 counties, including Will and McHenry, initially filed suit against the law.\n\nEditorial Editorial\n\nThose prosecutors and sheriffs oppose the abolition of the cash bail system altogether, a sentiment shared by other Illinoisans. Some opponents have honest concerns about the impact of bail reform on public safety, while other are simply swayed against it by misinformation or scare tactics.\n\nWhile the court decides the matter, it\u2019s important to remember these key points:\n\nFor one, even with bail reform, judges retain the power to keep defendants in custody if they meet the criteria for being a flight risk or a danger to the community.

{"text": "The Food and Drug Administration is changing the informational packaging of the emergency contraceptive pill, Plan B One-Step, to clarify that it is not an abortion pill, the federal agency announced Friday.\n\nPlan B is an over-the-counter drug that can be taken as a backup method of birth control to reduce the chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex. If taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure, Plan B works by stopping or delaying the release of an egg from the ovary, not by causing an abortion, the agency said.\n\n\"Plan B One-Step will not work if a person is already pregnant, meaning it will not affect an existing pregnancy,\" the FDA said in a release. \"Evidence does not support that the drug affects implantation or maintenance of a pregnancy after implantation, therefore it does not terminate a pregnancy.\"\n\nUntil now, packaging for Plan B and generic versions of the drug have erroneously claimed that taking the pill might be able to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting. Medical professionals say this claim is not backed by scientific evidence but was included on the label in order to get Plan B's over-the-counter status approved.\n\nAs such, the FDA revised the informational leaflets in Plan B's packaging to reflect that it does not work after fertilization, the agency said.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in June, sparking a wave of concerns about continued access to birth control and emergency contraception. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said the landmark high court rulings that established gay rights and contraception rights should be reconsidered since the federal right to abortion had been revoked.\n\nAt least eight states immediately banned all forms of abortion, including medical abortions using a pill, within hours of the high court's decision.\n\nThe FDA said since Plan B prevents pregnancy by acting on ovulation, \"well before implantation,\" it does not cause abortions.\n\nThe agency recommends that consumers talk with their doctors about emergency contraceptives so they understand \"the importance of using these products as intended.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Southwest Airlines, one of the country\u2019s largest airlines, is looking to hire a new public relations advisor following a holiday fiasco that has left many of its customers dissatisfied. The job listing was posted on the airline\u2019s website earlier this week and it has already sparked some rather pointed commentary on social media.\n\nThe listing comes just days after Southwest Airlines made the questionable decision to cancel flights just before the start of the Christmas holiday. The decision affected hundreds of thousands of passengers and left many of them stranded in airports across the country.\n\nNeedless to say, the airline received a considerable amount of criticism for the move, and many customers took to social media to express their displeasure. Some of the comments were decidedly harsh, with many users saying that \u201cfree flights\u201d wouldn\u2019t make them apply for the position.\n\nThe job listing does not mention the holiday mess specifically, but it does hint at a desire to improve the airline\u2019s public image. The listing specifically calls for a \u201ccandidate with excellent communications skills\u201d who can \u201cdevelop and execute PR strategies to help Southwest Airlines maintain its positive public image.\u201d\n\nThe position also requires the successful candidate to have a \u201cfirm understanding of the current public relations climate\u201d and to be \u201cable to use digital/social media strategically.\u201d\n\nIt appears that Southwest Airlines is hoping to put the holiday mess behind it and rebuild its reputation with the help of a talented public relations advisor.

The event, which is the largest consumer tech conference of the year, is known for robots roaming the show floor; flashy presentations about next generation TVs; and quirky products such as last year\u2019s buzzy health tracking light bulbs and dehumidifying earbuds.\n\nBut the event also fosters dealmaking among executives, manufacturers and retailers across various industries, and sets the stage for some of the biggest tech trends of the year. And this year\u2019s event, in particular, could show how companies are thinking about products as pandemic concerns recede for some consumers but recession concerns remain.\n\nThe Consumer Technology Association, which hosts CES each year, said it is expecting about 100,000 in-person attendees this year, up significantly from the 45,000 people who attended in 2022 amid concerns of the Covid-19 Omnicron variant. (CTA is once again offering a livestream for attendees who\u2019d rather watch the event remotely).\n\nThis year, featured speakers will include executives from traditional tech companies such as Samsung, Sony and Amazon, as well as other brands like John Deere, Delta and BMW. Although CES is traditionally a gadget show \u2013 and there will be no shortage of gizmos on display this year \u2013 about 60% of the Fortune 500 companies are participating this year, enabling more diverse product launches and discussions around all areas of tech.\n\n\u201cDespite a pretty tough economy, the companies we\u2019re seeing [attending] are really strong,\u201d Gary Shapiro, president of the CTA, which hosts the event, told CNN ahead of the event.\n\nFoldable phones and artificial intelligence\n\nSome of the key themes at this year\u2019s CES will include sustainability, artificial intelligence and foldable devices.\n\nAmong the products teased ahead of the 2023 CES is Samsung Display\u2019s Flex Hybrid prototype, which features a foldable and slidable display (the right side slides to offer more screen space).

As Axios reported at the time, \u201cmany CES observers suggested a drinking game in which keynote watchers took a shot every time the metaverse was mentioned \u2014 but that would have been a recipe for alcohol poisoning.\u201d\n\nNow interest in the immersive virtual world appears to have simmered as Facebook has so far struggled to gain mainstream traction for its VR offerings.\n\nStill, the topic of virtual reality products will remain a focus for some companies.

The play led to Hamlin collapsing on the field, and being taken to the hospital in critical condition. Mandatory Credit: Joseph Maiorana-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSummary Hamlin family thanks supporters during 'challenging time'\n\nNFL says mental health resources available to all 32 teams\n\nLeague says Bills-Bengals game will not resume this week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 3 (Reuters) - The Buffalo Bills said safety Damar Hamlin remains in critical condition on Tuesday after suffering a cardiac arrest during a Monday night NFL game, while the player's family thanked supporters during this \"challenging time.\"\n\nThe Super Bowl-contending Bills said in a statement that Hamlin, 24, spent the night in the intensive care unit at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he remains.\n\n\"We are grateful and thankful for the outpouring of support we have received so far,\" the Bills said.\n\nAthletes from the world of sports rallied to express support for Hamlin while all 32 National Football League teams changed their Twitter profile pictures to read \"Pray for Damar\" in white letters along with his jersey No. 3.\n\nMembers of Buffalo's National Hockey League team, the Sabres, arrived for their game on Tuesday against the Washington Capitals swapping traditional shirt-and-tie game day attire for \"Love For 3\" t-shirts.\n\nFamed Niagara Falls - both the American Falls and Canadian Horseshoe Falls - will be illuminated later on Tuesday as a show of support for Hamlin, the Bills and nearby city of Buffalo.\n\nHamlin's family said they would provide updates on his condition when they become available.\n\n\"On behalf of our family, we want to express our sincere gratitude for the love and support shown to Damar during this challenging time,\" Hamlin's family wrote in a statement. \"We are deeply moved by the prayers, kind words, and donations from fans around the country.\"\n\nDuring the first quarter of Monday's game against the host Cincinnati Bengals, Hamlin got to his feet after making a tackle and then collapsed.\n\n\"In that moment you're thinking, 'What can I do? What can we do? And immediately it just breaks you down into prayer,\" Hamlin's teammate, offensive lineman Dion Dawkins, told CNN on Tuesday. \"Damar is a fighter and he's fighting and he's going to keep fighting.\n\n\"We know our teammate - he is one of the strongest guys. He's going to keep fighting, and he's going to make it.\"\n\nAfter having his heartbeat restored on the field as stunned players from both teams cried, prayed and hugged, an ambulance took Hamlin to the hospital, where he was listed in critical condition. His mother was at the game and accompanied Hamlin to the hospital.\n\nThe family also acknowledged the first responders and healthcare professionals at the hospital who aided Hamlin, as well as the Bengals and Bills organizations.\n\n\"Your generosity and compassion mean the world to us,\" Hamlin's family wrote. \"Please keep Damar in your prayers. We will release updates as soon as we have them.\"\n\nSelected by Buffalo in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft, Hamlin signed a four-year, $3.6 million contract that included a $160,476 signing bonus and average annual salary of $910,119.\n\nHamlin spent his rookie season limited to playing special teams roles but was thrust into Buffalo's starting lineup last September after an injury to a teammate. His 91 tackles in 15 games this season are tied for second-most on the team.\n\nNO DECISION ON GAME RESUMPTION\n\nThe game between the Bills and Bengals, which Cincinnati led 7-3 late in the first quarter before it was postponed, has significant playoff implications for both teams.\n\nThe NFL, whose regular season concludes on Sunday, said on Tuesday the game would not resume this week and that no decision regarding the possible resumption of the game has been made.\n\nInitially the NFL was criticized for not moving faster to suspend the game, but Dawkins said he felt the league had demonstrated it cared about the players.\n\n\"We don't control that, and we were able to take a step back and process everything that happened,\" Dawkins said. \"They did not force us to go back out there and play... it just shows there is care.\"\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a memo on Tuesday sent to all 32 teams said mental health and support resources are available to players and staff and that additional on-site services can be made available.\n\nBengals owner Mike Brown said in a statement that his team sends thoughts and prayers to Hamlin and his family and asked that everyone support one another during \"this unprecedented time.\"\n\n\"Last night was supposed to be a great night for the NFL and a great showcase for our hometown. Instead, the human side of our sport became paramount ... and in that moment, humanity and love rose to the forefront,\" Brown said.\n\n\"As medical personnel undertook extraordinary measures, both teams demonstrated respect and compassion while fans in the stadium and people around the country bolstered the support for Damar and love for each other,\" he said, adding, \"Praying for Damar.\"\n\nIn late 2020, Hamlin created the Chasing M's Foundation and launched a fundraiser with a stated goal of $2,500 to buy toys for children ahead of that year's holiday season.\n\nThe page, which has remained active, received nearly $3,000 during a two-year span through December 2022. Total donations have now skyrocketed to over $4.6 million as fans used it to show their support for Hamlin.\n\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto and Amy Tennery in New York, editing by Pritha Sarkar, Bill Berkrot and Gerry Doyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough year for tech stocks.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite is still down 11.6% year to date, its worst performance since 2008. The tech-heavy index suffered a 12.6% drop in October alone.\n\nWith the election and Covid-19 dominating the headlines, investors are focusing more on the short-term outlook and less on the long-term impact of a tech downturn.\n\nBut what if the tech downturn is here to stay?\n\nThe first place to start looking is the market\u2019s valuations. While valuations have been dropping, the sector is still relatively expensive. According to the Nasdaq Composite Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio), tech stocks are currently trading at a 20.6x multiple, significantly higher than the broader market\u2019s current 17.6x multiple.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the tech sector has been particularly strong this year, making the current slowdown more concerning. Technology stocks have been the top performing sector since the start of the pandemic, with the S&P 500 tech sector up 38.3% year to date.\n\nBeyond the current market conditions, there are other signs that the tech downturn could be in danger of leaking into 2024.\n\nFor starters, consumer confidence is trending lower. Despite the recent vaccine news, consumer confidence dropped in October, suggesting that the public is still wary of the state of the economy. This suggests that consumer spending could remain weak, which could put pressure on tech companies that depend on consumer spending to grow.\n\nSecondly, long-term debt has been on the rise. As of October, the amount of debt held by tech companies was $1.1 trillion, up from $936 billion at the start of the year. This could lead to more debt-related issues in the future and put additional pressure on companies\u2019 margins.\n\nFinally, tech stocks have been underperforming for some time now. The Nasdaq Composite index is down almost 10% from its all-time high in August, and the tech-heavy index is still down almost 9% from the start of the year. This weak performance suggests that investors are still worried about the tech sector\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nGiven all of these factors, the tech downturn could easily carry into 2024.\n\nThe good news is that the current downturn could present a buying opportunity for investors. Despite the sector\u2019s recent underperformance, tech stocks still have strong fundamentals, including strong balance sheets and competitive positions in the market.\n\nTech stocks are also poised to benefit from the current macroeconomic environment. With interest rates expected to remain low, tech stocks could get a boost from cheap financing. Moreover, with companies continuing to focus on cost-cutting and efficiency, tech stocks could benefit from a more resilient bottom line.\n\nIn addition, tech stocks could benefit from the increasing demand for digital services. With the pandemic pushing more businesses online, demand for tech services is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future.\n\nOverall, the current tech downturn could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon. While there are risks, the sector could still benefit from the current macroeconomic environment and increasing demand for digital services. For investors who can stomach the volatility, tech stocks could be a good bet for 2024.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The romance author, Bethanie Bauderon, has returned to social media after an apparent publicity stunt in which she faked her own death to promote her latest book.\n\nBauderon shocked her followers this past December when she posted a goodbye message on her Facebook page, saying she was taking her own life and that there was \u201cno one else to blame.\u201d\n\nBut the truth came out shortly after, and the author was revealed to be very much alive. Now, Bauderon has returned to social media and is making a public apology for her actions.\n\n\u201cI want to say that I am deeply sorry for the stunt I pulled,\u201d Bauderon said in a statement released through her publicist. \u201cIt was wrong and I know it was wrong. I let my emotions and my ambition get the better of me and I made a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe author\u2019s stunt was apparently meant to generate publicity for her latest book, which was released shortly before she wrote her goodbye message. But many of her fans were genuinely concerned for her well-being and some even started a GoFundMe page to raise money for her funeral costs.\n\nIn her statement, Bauderon expressed her sadness over the situation and said she never meant to cause so much distress to her readers.\n\n\u201cI understand why some people may have been hurt by my decision,\u201d Bauderon said. \u201cI would like to extend my sincere apologies to those of you who were affected.

{"text": "Every morning at dawn, Ivan Rusev walks along the shoreline of the Black Sea in south-western Ukraine. In the autumn, he was watching as millions of migratory birds set off for the south. The last of the pelicans departed at the end of September and they won't return until March.\n\nWhile these migrations continue in their established patterns, other wildlife in this region have been greatly disturbed. In the months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Rusev noticed a new and troubling phenomenon: dolphins and porpoises were washing up dead on the beach in unusually high numbers. When he'd found dead animals here in previous years, many had marks on their bodies that suggested they had got caught up in fishing gear. These latest marine mammals had none.\n\nRusev is the head of research at Tuzly National Nature Park, in south-west Ukraine, not far from the border with Moldova. In a normal year, he says, he finds perhaps three or four dead dolphins along the 44km (27 miles) of shoreline in the park. Once the war began, most of the shoreline was closed by the military. Between 24 February 2022 and the end of August, he and his colleagues discovered 35 dead cetaceans along the 5km (3 miles) of shoreline still accessible. His team spoke to their counterparts in other Black Sea countries, except Russia and Georgia. Some of Ukraine's national parks, including one near the devastated city of Mariupol, are now in Russian occupied territory. Rusev's team couldn't reach any of their colleagues there.\n\nWhen they put all the numbers together, 2,500 dead dolphins had been reported to have washed up on shore by May 2022. But because most dead dolphins simply sink to the bottom of the sea and are never counted, Rusev believes the actual number is much higher. Other organisations around the Black Sea have also noticed an increase. Mare Nostrum, a Romanian association of environmental specialists, says it has registered the highest number of stranded cetaceans since at least 2010. Marian Paiu, executive director of Mare Nostrum, says they had recorded 194 individual animals stranded between January and the end of September. In most years, they record fewer than 100.\n\nThe main culprit, Rusev argues, is acoustic trauma from the increased use of sonar by mainly Russian submarines.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nThe Supreme Court was asked on Tuesday to step into a legal dispute over a restrictive New York law that limits who can obtain a license to carry a concealed firearm in public.\n\nThe case could provide the justices with an opportunity to consider whether the Second Amendment right to bear arms guarantees an individual right to carry a weapon.\n\nThe petition was brought by the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, which is challenging a law that requires that a person demonstrate \u201ca special need for self-protection\u201d in order to get a concealed carry permit.\n\nThe case has been closely watched by both the gun rights and gun control groups. The debate over the Second Amendment has taken on greater urgency in recent years as mass shootings continue to plague the country.\n\nThe organization is asking the Supreme Court to take up the case before the New York State Court of Appeals rules on the matter. The New York law has been challenged in the state courts, but so far a lower court and an intermediate court of appeals have both upheld the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not taken up a Second Amendment case since 2010, when it held in McDonald v. Chicago that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own a firearm. That ruling was limited to the home, however, and left open the question of whether the Second Amendment applies to the carrying of weapons outside the home.\n\nThe New York State Rifle and Pistol Association argues that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms in public and is asking the high court to review the constitutionality of the New York law.\n\n\u201cThe core of the Second Amendment protection \u2014 the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense \u2014 is at the heart of this case,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cThat core right applies with equal force outside the home and inside it.\u201d\n\nThe petition contends that the law \u201cis an unconstitutionally broad restriction on the right to bear arms for self-defense.\u201d It adds that the law \u201ceffectively bans a law-abiding citizen from carrying a gun outside the home for self-defense \u2014 even if doing so is the only way to protect himself or his family from death or grave bodily harm.\u201d\n\nThe gun rights group argues that the current New York law is one of the most restrictive in the nation.\n\n\u201cWhile other states allow for the carrying of concealed firearms in public with modest requirements, New York bars law-abiding citizens from doing so,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nThe group is backed in its effort by the National Rifle Association and several state attorneys general, including South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nThe petition is being opposed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who argues that the state is within its rights to regulate firearms in public.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment does not guarantee an unfettered right to carry weapons in public,\u201d James said in a statement.\n\nJames argued that the current law is reasonable and seeks to ensure public safety.\n\n\u201cThe state's licensing scheme applies only to those seeking to carry concealed firearms and is narrowly tailored to address only that conduct that poses the greatest risks of harm to public safety,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe Supreme Court will likely consider the petition at one of its closed-door conferences in the coming months.

{"text": "Supermarktketen Jumbo noteert over 2022 een recordomzet van 10,2 miljard euro, een groei van 3,2 procent.\n\nOok dochter La Place doet het goed. De restaurantketen verdubbelt zijn omzet naar 107 miljoen euro.\n\nDit ondanks het feit dat Jumbo meermaals negatief in het nieuws kwam, bijvoorbeeld vanwege een witwaszaak rondom oud-topman Frits van Eerd.\n\nLees ook: Supermarkten behalen opnieuw recordomzet tijdens kerstweek: ruim \u20ac1,1 miljard besteed aan boodschappen\n\nSupermarktconcern Jumbo heeft vorig jaar, ondanks verschillende tegenslagen, voor het eerst de grens van 10 miljard euro omzet doorbroken. Dat komt vooral door een \u201csterke groei\u201d in verkopen van goedkopere huismerkproducten, maakte het bedrijf bekend.\n\nHet winkelbedrijf zag de consumentenomzet onder de Jumbo-formule met 3,2 procent groeien tot 10,2 miljard euro. Naar eigen zeggen is dit licht hoger dan de totale groei van de branche.\n\nTon van Veen, die tijdelijk leiding geeft aan het directieteam van Jumbo, zegt tegelijkertijd te zien dat steeds meer mensen door de fors gestegen prijzen van energie en levensmiddelen moeite hebben om rond te komen. \u201cDat is zorgwekkend, en daarom doen we er alles aan om prijsstijgingen te bedwingen en boodschappen doen voor iedereen toegankelijk te houden\u201d, aldus de commissaris.\n\nJumbo gaat het komende jaar opnieuw fors investeren om verder te groeien in Belgi\u00eb. \u201cWe gaan daar rond de tien nieuwe winkels openen\u201d, zegt aldus Van Veen.\n\nHet concern opende de afgelopen paar jaar 27 Belgische vestigingen. \"We hebben daar een stevige positie, deze winkels dragen steeds meer bij aan onze omzet\", aldus Peter van Erp, financieel directeur bij Jumbo\n\nBelgi\u00eb is inmiddels wel een vechtmarkt. \"Door de komst van zowel Albert Heijn als Jumbo is de concurrentie daar op scherp gezet. Ook Belgische consumenten kijken meer naar de prijs\", zegt commissaris Van Veen. De omzet in Belgi\u00eb kwam vorig jaar ruim boven de 200 miljoen euro uit, een verdubbeling vergeleken met het jaar daarvoor.\n\nWitwaszaak tegen oud-topman Frits van Eerd\n\nVan Veen vervangt tijdelijk de teruggetreden topman Frits van Eerd, die in september door de FIOD werd opgepakt omdat hij verdachte is in een witwaszaak. Het OM zei eerder dat de witwaspraktijken plaatsgevonden zouden hebben via onder meer vastgoedtransacties, autohandel en sponsoring in de motorcross.\n\nVolgens Van Veen hebben de gebeurtenissen rond Frits van Eerd \"veel impact\" op Jumbo. Hij wijst erop dat het onderzoek van het OM zich niet op Jumbo richt. Het bedrijf liet desondanks een onafhankelijk onderzoek doen naar de sponsoractiviteiten. Dit onderzoek is inmiddels afgerond. \"Hieruit zijn binnen Jumbo geen strafbare feiten of onregelmatigheden naar voren gekomen.\"\n\nHij benadrukt dat Jumbo \"op geen enkele manier\" betrokken is bij het onderzoek van het OM. En dat uit onafhankelijk onderzoek blijkt dat er bij het concern geen strafbare feiten of onregelmatigheden hebben plaatsgevonden. \"Frits als persoon is nog wel steeds verdachte, we moeten afwachten wat er uit het onderzoek komt.\" Of Van Eerd ooit terugkeert naar Jumbo is nog onbekend. \"Nog veel te vroeg om daar iets over te zeggen\", aldus de commissaris.\n\nDe totale omzet van Jumbo Groep (inclusief restaurantformule La Place) kwam in 2022 uit op 10,3 miljard euro, een groei van 3,7 procent. La Place leverde een bijdrage van 107 miljoen euro, ruim een verdubbeling ten opzichte van coronajaar 2021. \"Sinds het wegvallen van de coronamaatregelen begin maart, hebben gasten weer als vanouds hun weg weten te vinden naar La Place.\"\n\nVan Veen kan niet zeggen \"of en wanneer\" de boodschappenprijzen stabiliseren. Dat komt door de onzekere marktomstandigheden. \"Het is onoverkomelijk dat de huidige marktsituatie een opwaarts effect heeft op onze bedrijfskosten.\"\n\nGrondlegger Jumbo overleden\n\nVorige maand werd bekend dat Karel van Eerd (84), grondlegger van Jumbo, is overleden. Hij bleef als president-commissaris tot het laatste moment betrokken bij de onderneming. Karel van Eerd droeg in 2009 de leiding over aan zijn zoon Frits. Ook dochter Colette zit in het bestuur.\n\nJumbo kwam vorig jaar niet alleen door de witwaszaak negatief in het nieuws, maar ook door een blunder met een WK-reclame met dansende bouwvakkers. Dit leverde kritiek op omdat bij de bouw van de WK-stadions in Qatar bouwvakkers uit vooral Zuid-Azi\u00eb zeer slecht behandeld zijn. In november werd de spot direct stopgezet.", "label": "human"}

It goes on to suggest that William\u2019s \u201cloyalty and support\u201d for Harry had \u201cwaned\u201d over the years, leaving Harry feeling \u201cisolated\u201d and \u201cbetrayed\u201d by his brother.\n\nIn the book, Prince Harry also accuses William of snubbing him during the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. He claims William instructed Harry to remain seated during the ceremony despite Charles wanting the two brothers to join him on the steps of the altar. Prince Harry claims that this was an insult and that William\u2019s actions \u201churt deeply\u201d.\n\nThe book further paints an unflattering picture of William, claiming he was \u201cdomineering\u201d, \u201ccontrolling\u201d, and \u201ccold\u201d toward Prince Harry throughout their childhood and adolescence. It also reveals that William gave Prince Harry \u201cunwanted advice\u201d on his relationship with his now-wife Meghan Markle, adding that the Duke of Cambridge warned him to \u201cslow down\u201d and that his relationship with Meghan was moving too quickly.\n\nIn response to the book, Prince William and Prince Harry\u2019s communications secretary released a statement saying that the two brothers \u201care on different paths\u201d and that the Duke of Sussex is \u201csad about this situation\u201d. However, the statement goes on to say that the Duke of Cambridge still \u201cloves\u201d and \u201crespects\u201d his younger brother and that the two are still \u201cunited in their determination to work together to improve the lives of others\u201d.\n\nThe new details revealed in the book have painted an even more complicated picture of the relationship between the two brothers and have left the public with many unanswered questions. What will happen now that the two brothers are on different paths? Will William and Harry be able to mend their relationship or will it remain fractured? Only time will tell.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nPopular ESPN host Bomani Jones addressed the increasing concern surrounding football-related injuries in a segment on Tuesday. During the segment, Jones compared the attempt to make the game of football safer to \"trying to make a safe cigarette\" in reference to Pittsburgh Steelers safety Damar Hamlin collapsing on the field during a game on Sunday due to a spinal injury.\n\nThe segment was part of Jones' show, Highly Questionable, where he and co-host Dan Le Batard frequently address sports news and discuss topics that are current and relevant. During Tuesday's episode, Jones and Le Batard were discussing the increasing worry around football-related injuries after Steelers safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field during the fourth quarter of their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. \n\nThe incident sparked fear among the players and coaches, with Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin saying he was \"speechless\" after seeing Hamlin drop to the ground. After being carted off the field, Hamlin was taken to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with a spinal cord injury. He is currently listed in stable condition. \n\nJones addressed the issue during the episode, pointing out the growing concern around football-related injuries, saying that \u201cfootball is getting to the point where it\u2019s like trying to make a safe cigarette.\u201d He continued, \u201cAt what point does the risk outweigh the reward? Right now the reward is that it\u2019s this beloved game and there\u2019s a lot of money to be made from it, but at what point does it become too much of a risk?\u201d\n\nThe topic of making football safer has been a recurring one in recent years, with many players and coaches being vocal about their opinions on the matter.  In 2017, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said that football is a dangerous game and that players should not assume they will be \u201c100 percent perfect\u201d when they\u2019re playing. In 2018, the NFL tightened its rules on illegal helmet-to-helmet contact in an effort to reduce the number of injuries caused by head trauma. \n\nThe debate of how to make football safer is a difficult one, with many players and fans wanting the sport to remain as it is and keep its inherent risk as part of its appeal. Jones acknowledged this complexity, but pointed out that the discussion will continue until some kind of resolution is found. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re all aware of the risks in football, but the thing is that if we want this sport to continue to be a part of our lives, then the conversation has to happen.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s becoming more and more pertinent as the sport continues to grow and injuries become more common. It\u2019s also a conversation that can have far-reaching implications, with a recent study finding that playing tackle football at an early age can lead to an increased risk of developing long-term cognitive issues such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nThe issue has gained more attention in recent months, with players and fans becoming increasingly vocal about their desire to make the sport safer. Jones, who has been vocal about sports-related issues in the past, will no doubt continue to be part of the discussion as the conversation around football safety continues.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "There are two things keeping the toy industry afloat right now: inflation and a consumer group known as \"kidults.\"\n\nThese kids at heart are responsible for one-fourth of all toy sales annually, around $9 billion worth, and are the biggest driver of growth throughout the industry, according to data from the NPD Group.\n\nThis cohort, which NPD defines as ages 12 and older, has been steadily contributing to the industry for years, but spending has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic, leading to year-over-year gains despite tough comparisons.\n\nIt's an important moment for the toy industry, too, with the holiday season upon us. While sales surged across the board for board games, puzzles and playsets during the pandemic, the first nine months of 2022 saw a 3% decline in sales volume. Higher toy prices helped outweigh these losses, as sales revenue for the time period jumped 3%, NPD reported.\n\nKidults, who tend to spend more on toys, have a great fondness for cartoons, superheroes and collectibles that remind them of their childhood. They buy merchandise such as action figures, Lego sets and dolls that might typically be considered \"for kids.\" However, in recent years, toy makers have created product lines just for these consumers, realizing that demand is high for this generation of adults who still want to have fun.\n\n\"The definition of adulthood has definitely evolved,\" said Jeremy Padawer, chief brand officer at toy company Jazwares. \"What it used to mean, to be an adult, was to be a very upstanding, serious member of society. And to do that you had to demonstrate it intellectually, emotionally, in every other single way.\"\n\n\"Now we feel a lot more free to express our fandom as a part of our adulthood,\" he said.\n\nIn the '70s and '80s, the toy business began to shift away from being an industry that was just about the next innovative item and embraced creating more product based on entertainment franchises. To be sure, there were toys based on movies and TV shows prior to this time, but this is when the trend kicked into high gear.\n\n\"In 1977, 'Star Wars' launches, and you started seeing a lot more licensed product at retail, where we were celebrating our fandom with with toys and collectibles,\" Padawer said.\n\nThis included nontoy merchandise such as bedsheets, crockery and clothing.\n\n\"At the time, the intended recipient was almost all kids,\" he explained. \"But those children that were born in the '70s and '80s were really the first generation that had this much licensing and this much product that was available for them to demonstrably attached to. And it's not a big surprise, then that those kids is their 30s and 40s, that they continue to demonstrate that.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, the Bavarian-born theologian whose conservative Roman Catholicism earned him the nickname \"God's Rottweiler\" and who shocked his flock by suddenly resigning the papacy after just eight years, died Saturday, the Vatican said.\n\nHe was 95.\n\n\"With sorrow I inform you that the Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI, passed away today at 9:34 in the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican,\" the statement said. No cause of death was provided.\n\nBenedict was the longest-living pope, having surpassed Pope Leo XIII in September 2020.\n\nBenedict, the first pope to voluntarily give up the pontifical reins in nearly 600 years, spent his twilight years living at the Vatican in a refurbished monastery, rarely appearing in public with the man who replaced him, Pope Francis.\n\nBut he continued to advise his far more liberal-minded successor in private. His influence was felt in August 2016, when Francis, who had made attempts to reach out to the LGBTQ community, took an unexpectedly hard line against schools' teaching children that they could choose their gender.\n\n\"We must think about what Pope Benedict said \u2014 'It's the epoch of sin against God the Creator,'\" Francis said at a gathering of Polish bishops.\n\nBorn Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger on April 16, 1927, in Marktl, in Germany, Benedict, the son of police officer Josef and Maria, grew up in a Germany infected by Nazism. Like his father, Benedict opposed Hitler. But at age 14, he was forced to join the Hitler Youth. And two years later, while still in the seminary, the future pope was conscripted into the German army and sent to the front.\n\nWith the Allies on the verge of victory, Benedict deserted and went home. After a brief stint in a POW camp, he returned to the seminary and, along with his brother Georg, was ordained a priest on June 29, 1951.\n\nUnlike most priests, Benedict logged little time in parishes. Instead, he embarked on an academic career and found himself moving to the conservative right as German campuses moved to the liberal left in the 1960s.\n\nUnlike the wildly popular John Paul II, Benedict was a stern and forbidding figure with little of his Polish predecessor's charisma. He was seen more as a transitional pope \u2014 a keeper of John Paul's flame.\n\nLike John Paul, Benedict was a witness to the Holocaust and made it his mission to reach out to Jews and to fight antisemitism. In 2008, Benedict became the first pope to visit a Jewish house of worship in the United States when he prayed at the Park East Synagogue in New York City.\n\nBenedict also made a historic pilgrimage to ground zero in New York City, where he prayed with the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBenedict was considered a dominant intellectual figure in Roman Catholicism as he moved toward more conservative positions in the 40 years before he assumed the papacy. By 1981, he had become the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the council \u2014 known during the 16th century as the Spanish Inquisition \u2014 that promotes and enforces church doctrine.\n\nHis fierce resistance to what he saw as campaigns to secularize the church, promote women as priests, \"normalize\" homosexuality and encourage a liberal Latin American strain of Catholicism known as liberation theology led to his characterization as \"God's Rottweiler.\"\n\nAmong his more consequential actions as prefect was to issue a formal letter in May 2001 that was widely interpreted as declaring that investigations into allegations of clergy sex abuse were confidential church matters not subject to review by civil law enforcement agencies. Critics \u2014 and attorneys for victims of such abuse \u2014 often pointed to the letter as proof that the church was seeking to cover up the burgeoning scandal.\n\nThe fallout dogged Benedict from the beginning of his papacy. In 2005, his first year as pope, he was accused in a lawsuit of having personally covered up a priest's abuse of three boys in Texas. He avoided the lawsuit by requesting and receiving diplomatic immunity from the State Department.\n\n\"He could go around and minister to victims, which he did, and I think that was a brave and profound thing to do, but he couldn't change the definitive elements of the Catholic Church that enable abuse,\" said Michael D'Antonio, author of \"Mortal Sins: Sex, Crime, and the Era of Catholic Scandal.\"\n\nBenedict asked for forgiveness in February for any \"grievous faults\" in his handling of clergy sex abuse cases, but denied any personal or specific wrongdoing after an independent report from a German law firm criticized his actions in four cases while he was archbishop of Munich.\n\nBenedict's conservatism extended to the church's public face. In addition to his native German, he was fluent in Italian, French, English and Latin \u2014 the last of which he sought to revive in church ceremony.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The health technology industry was booming heading into the pandemic \u2014 and then it took a hit.\n\nThe decline in investments in health tech startups, following a record year in 2019, could be felt in 2020 with the global pandemic. However, since the start of 2021, this sector has seen a rebound and is on track to hit records.\n\nAs the industry looks to the future and recovers, four major trends are emerging that are likely to shape how investments in health tech startups proceed in the coming years:\n\n1. More Focus on Digital Patient Experiences\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, many healthcare providers, both big and small, shifted to virtual care. This allowed them to provide a better, more personalized patient experience while keeping up with patient needs during the crisis. This trend is likely to continue in the future and will likely be a major focus for health tech startups in 2021.\n\nThe shift to digital is also likely to open up new opportunities for health tech startups as providers seek to streamline their digital patient experiences. Companies that specialize in AI-powered patient scheduling, appointment reminders, and health tracking will continue to be in high demand.\n\n2. Investment in the \u201cFourth Frontier\u201d of Healthcare\n\nMany healthcare providers have now realized the potential of data and analytics to improve patient outcomes. For health tech startups, this opens up the possibility of developing solutions that leverage the vast data sets available in the healthcare industry to better understand patient health and disease progression.\n\nThis trend, also known as the \u201cfourth frontier of healthcare\u201d, is likely to gain further momentum in the near future. Startups that focus on harnessing this data and analytics to improve diagnosis, care, and patient outcomes, should see a major rise in investment interest.\n\n3. AI and Voice-Based Technologies\n\nAI and voice-based technologies are on track to revolutionize healthcare and healthcare delivery. AI-powered technologies such as chatbots and virtual assistants have already been implemented by some providers, but there is still more room for innovation.\n\nVoice-based technologies such as voice assistants, voice-enabled medical devices, and voice-based apps are emerging as key technologies in the healthcare sector. Startups that develop and utilize AI-enabled voice-based technologies, will likely find considerable traction.\n\n4. Telemedicine and Telecare\n\nThe pandemic has made it clear just how much potential telemedicine and telecare has. In 2021 and beyond, telemedicine is likely to be a major focus for health tech startups. Companies that are able to develop innovative solutions to improve accessibility, accuracy, and affordability of telemedicine services, should see increased investments.\n\nThis could include solutions that enable real-time video consultations and enable remote monitoring of patient health. With the continued rise of the \u201csilver tsunami\u201d, there is a need for solutions that enable elderly patients to access healthcare services, even if they are not able to physically visit a doctor. This is an area where health tech startups could have a significant impact.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe health tech industry took a hit during the pandemic, but it is now on track for a strong rebound in 2021. As investors look for new opportunities in this sector, startups should focus on developing innovative solutions that leverage data and analytics, AI-enabled technologies, and telemedicine services. With the right strategy, health tech startups should be able to benefit from the rising investor interest in this sector.", "label": "machine"}

Non-compliance would result in the revoking of NGO licenses, an official ministry notice read.\n\nA spokesman told CNN the move was due to the non-observation of Islamic dress rules and other laws and regulations of the Islamic Emirate.\n\nAfghan women can no longer work in most sectors.\n\nTheir travel rights have also been severely restricted and access to public spaces significantly curtailed.

{"text": ".\n\nEvery year, the World Happiness Report ranks 156 countries according to their overall happiness levels. In 2021, Finland was ranked the happiest country in the world, and has held this spot for the past four years.\n\nAs a psychology expert living in Finland, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how the culture, environment, and lifestyle of this Nordic nation contribute to its inhabitants\u2019 joy and contentment. I believe that some of the behaviors we don\u2019t engage in as Finns are an integral part of our country\u2019s culture of happiness.\n\nHere are three things Finns never do, which I believe make a significant contribution to our ranking as the happiest nation in the world.\n\n1. We don\u2019t compare ourselves to others\n\nFinns are a self-assured and independent nation. We don\u2019t feel the need to compare ourselves to our neighbors, colleagues, and friends to assess our worth. We believe that everyone has their own unique talents, abilities, and contributions to offer, and we respect and value each other for them.\n\nWe don\u2019t measure our own lives by someone else\u2019s successes, or feel inadequate when others do better than us. We support and motivate one another, not compete with or criticize each other. This sense of collective encouragement results in healthier relationships and encourages a sense of security and self-confidence.\n\n2. We don\u2019t feel the need to constantly busy ourselves\n\nIn Finland, it is quite common to find people sitting quietly in cafes or parks, enjoying a cup of coffee or a scenic view. We are a nation of people who enjoy taking moments to relax, reflect, and appreciate the beauty around us.\n\nWe don\u2019t feel the need to always be doing something. We recognize the importance of rest and relaxation, and make it an integral part of our lives. As such, Finns tend to be more present and appreciative of life, more mindful of our surroundings, and more content with what we have.\n\n3. We don\u2019t fall into the trap of working for external validation\n\nMany people today find their self-worth in external validation, such as wealth, status, and material possessions. This can often lead to feelings of discontent, stress, and unhappiness.\n\nIn Finland, we strive to find our worth in more meaningful pursuits. We prioritize relationships, leisure activities, and inner fulfillment rather than a perceived societal ideal.\n\nWe recognize that in the grand scheme of things, most material possessions and social statuses are relatively insignificant. We feel a sense of satisfaction and purpose in our everyday lives, not just in accomplishments that are \u201cimpressive\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion, as the happiest country in the world, Finland has a lot of lessons to offer when it comes to well-being. By not constantly comparing ourselves to others, taking moments to relax, and finding our worth in meaningful activities, we cultivate an environment of contentment and satisfaction. We can all take something from this example, no matter what country we live in.", "label": "machine"}

I would spend the summer of 2021 creating a website \u2014 SenateTrades, I dubbed it \u2014 that analyzed senators' public financial disclosures. My goal would be to determine their stock holdings, calculate their annual returns, and display their transactions for anyone to see.\n\nBy doing so, I hoped, senators' trades would be more accessible and the voting public, therefore, could hold them more accountable. Lawrenceville generously backed my project, awarding me a $500 grant to support website and research costs.\n\nWhen I finished the app at the end of my three month summer vacation, I had tracked over $166 million in stock market transactions across 3,290 purchases and 2,758 sales, made by 68 senators.\n\nWhat I discovered surprised me: During 2020, my research found, the Senate's average stock investment return was a very strong 12%, actually underperforming the S&P 500's staggering 18% run that year. But when the general market plummeted 30% in late March as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, the Senate's collective stock average dipped only 15%.\n\nAnd some senators did extraordinarily well for themselves. By my calculations, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's portfolio, for instance, has returned nearly 20% from January 1, 2020 to date. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, has seen his portfolio grow in value by more than 21%. Republican Sen. John Hoeven's positions, together worth more than $20 million, have returned more than 18%.\n\nIs this because the senators have superior access to information that informs their trading decisions? Is it simply a matter of good fortune or dumb luck? This is notoriously difficult to prove, even for federal regulators and law enforcement.\n\nSince the STOCK Act's passage, several senators have been accused of wrongdoing and investigated, but never charged. This remains true even though Insider's \"Conflicted Congress\" project has identified thousands of congressional stock transactions that violate the STOCK Act's disclosure provisions. Many more can objectively be described as real or perceived conflicts of interest, such as when lawmakers who oversee the nation's defense policies and spending simultaneously invest their money in the stock of defense contractors.\n\nI submitted SenateTrades to the 2021 Congressional App Challenge, a prestigious computer science competition to inspire American students to explore coding, innovate policymaking, and connect with their representatives. The app won first place in my congressional district \u2014 New York's 10th District.\n\nAlthough it felt gratifying to be recognized for my project, I was even more excited to see my website picking up traction among everyday Americans, who can access any senator's finances in a digestible and practical format. This past spring, I took the project even further, coding a twitter bot, @inside_bear, that automatically tweets the trades of senators and congressmen.\n\nAt present, 70% of voters support banning lawmakers from trading stocks, according to a Data for Progress poll. During an April congressional hearing, there was some bipartisan consensus that changes need to be made to congressional stock trading.\n\nBut those reforms have yet to be unveiled. If the nation is to improve upon the congressional stock-trading status quo, any new law will have to tighten the relatively loose standards for public officials and also be enforced more consistently than the original STOCK Act. After all, if laws are not enforced, they are futile, no matter how uncompromising they may seem on paper.\n\nMy high school social studies class certainly didn't cover congressional stock trading. But my own study of federal lawmakers' trades taught me this: When public officials ignore the laws they've created for themselves, it is a surefire sign that our democracy isn't healthy.\n\nGeorge McCain is a rising senior at The Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

{"text": "Anyone\n\nIt was supposed to be a big moneymaker for YouTube sensation Logan Paul. But the 24-year-old, who has more than 22 million subscribers on his channel, has now come under fire after his foray into the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nPaul, who launched an NFT-based game development studio earlier this year, has admitted that some of the developers he hired had no intention of completing their projects, and has even called them \u201ccon men\u201d and \u201cgrifters\u201d in a YouTube video. He also admits that the venture cost him a lot of money, but insists he didn\u2019t scam anyone.\n\nPaul\u2019s NFT studio, Metaverse, was launched in January and promised to bring new life to the world of NFT gaming. He was already something of a trailblazer in the cryptocurrency world, having announced he was investing $1 million in NFTs just last August.\n\nBut the venture has not gone as planned, and now Paul admits some of the people he hired to work on the project had other motives. \u201cWe got taken advantage of by some people,\u201d he said in his video. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that I\u2019m honest with you guys and say that these were con men and these were grifters and they took advantage of our enthusiasm and naivety.\u201d\n\nPaul went on to say that he wanted to make sure people know that he and his team weren\u2019t trying to scam anyone. \u201cThe last thing we wanted to do is to scam anyone, and I just want to make sure everyone knows that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the venture has cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars, but insists he\u2019s still optimistic about the future of NFTs and blockchain technology.\n\nThe YouTuber\u2019s admission has been met with mixed reactions from the crypto community, with some coming to his defense and others accusing him of taking advantage of his audience.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, Paul has said he\u2019s reevaluating his commitment to the NFT market and is no longer involved in the game development studio.\n\n\u201cThe past few months have been a huge lesson in humility and reality,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we all came into this with big dreams and it hasn\u2019t worked out in the way we wanted it to.\u201d\n\nThe experience seems to have left Paul more cautious about diving into new business ventures, and he now says he\u2019s much more likely to \u201ctake my time, look for a partner and figure out the best way to move forward.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Paul has had to apologize for missteps. In 2017, he sparked a major backlash when he posted a video from a Japanese \u201csuicide forest\u201d to his YouTube channel, and again in 2018 when he tasered a dead rat for a video prank.\n\nBut despite his past controversies, Paul\u2019s statement about his NFT venture seems to have resonated with many in the cryptocurrency space, who see it as a sign that he\u2019s trying to be more mindful of his business decisions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to hear an entrepreneur own up to their mistakes and own up to getting taken advantage of,\u201d said one Reddit user. \u201cI think it shows that Logan is being more responsible in his business decisions, and more mature.\u201d\n\nFor now, the fate of Paul\u2019s NFT studio remains uncertain.

{"text": "Washington, DC \u2014 In the tumultuous year of 2022, members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican, found common ground on a number of major pieces of legislation, helping to enact a string of wins for the American people.\n\nThe spirit of bipartisanship and the will to get things done was the defining theme of 2022 for the members of the United States Congress, as they passed numerous important bills in both chambers of Congress.\n\nHere are five of the most significant bills that were passed in Congress in 2022, giving tangible benefit to Americans:\n\nThe $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Package\n\nIn early 2022, Congress passed a huge $1.9 trillion stimulus package to combat the economic hardships caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The bill provided direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans and billions of dollars in aid to state and local governments. It also expanded the federal unemployment insurance program and expanded health care coverage for many Americans.\n\nThe sweeping measure was backed by both Democrats and Republicans, signaling a willingness to cooperate across the aisle during a difficult time for the nation.\n\nThe Paycheck Fairness Act\n\nThe Paycheck Fairness Act was passed in the summer of 2022 and seeks to ensure that women are paid equally for the same job. The bill strengthens the Equal Pay Act, which was passed in 1963, and creates new tools for victims of pay discrimination. It also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information.\n\nThe bill was met with unanimous approval from both Democrats and Republicans, underlining their commitment to address the gender pay gap in the United States.\n\nThe Infrastructure Act\n\nIn June of 2022, Congress passed a massive infrastructure bill that is estimated to inject more than $2 trillion into the nation's infrastructure and create millions of jobs. The bill was hailed as a victory for both Democrats and Republicans, who both agreed on the importance of rebuilding America's roads, bridges, railways and more.\n\nThe bill is expected to create millions of jobs across the nation, with many of them concentrated in rural areas, while also helping to make up for years of delayed investments in the nation's infrastructure.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act\n\nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act passed in Congress in the fall of 2022, overhauling the nation's bankruptcy laws to help individuals and businesses dealing with severe financial hardship.\n\nThe bill makes it easier for people who are struggling with medical debt and credit card debt to seek relief, and it also makes it easier for struggling businesses to reorganize and stay afloat in difficult times. The bill also gives more resources to bankruptcy trustees, who are tasked with overseeing bankruptcy cases, and it makes some changes to the law to make it easier for debtors to pay off their debts and protect their assets.\n\nThe Raise the Wage Act\n\nFinally, in November of 2022, Congress passed the Raise the Wage Act, which increases the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15. The bill was met with approval from both Democrats and Republicans, and it is expected to give a raise to millions of American workers and help lift millions more out of poverty.\n\nThe legislation also includes provisions that are expected to help close the gender and racial wage gaps, ensuring that all workers are paid equally for their work.\n\nAll five of these major pieces of legislation will have a significant impact on the lives of Americans, providing tangible benefits and a much-needed boost of morale in what was otherwise a tumultuous year. While 2022 has not been the easiest year, the members of Congress in both chambers worked to put aside their differences and focus on what will ultimately benefit their constituents the most.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Dear Abby,\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 26 years. We married in 1996, and it has been a journey full of ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations. Despite this, we still feel the same passion and love that we felt when we first met, but recently I have noticed changes in our marriage.\n\nMy wife has seemed distant lately, and our conversations have become shorter and less frequent. She used to be my best friend, but it feels like she's slipping away. We don't talk as much or laugh as much as we used to. I don't want to push her away, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong and it's making her uncomfortable.\n\nI'm not sure what the issue is. We've been together so long that I feel like I should know what the problem is. When I try to talk to her about it, she seems to shut down. I want to talk to her about it, but I don't want to make it worse.\n\nI know that marriage can be tough, but I never expected this. I still love my wife and I know she loves me, but something has changed and I'm not sure how to fix it. We don't argue often, but when we do it seems like our disagreements come from nowhere and we don't know how to resolve them.\n\nI want our marriage to be the way it used to be. We used to do things together, take trips, and talk about everything. Now it feels like we are living in two different houses. I want to make things better, but I don't know where to start.\n\nDo you have any advice for me?\n\nSincerely,\n\nWorried Husband\n\nDear Worried Husband,\n\nIt sounds like your marriage is going through a difficult period, but that doesn't mean that it can't be saved. It sounds like your wife is withdrawing from your relationship, which can cause a lot of tension and stress. It's important to remember that communication is key. You and your wife need to be able to talk openly and honestly about your feelings in order to make things better.\n\nStart by taking some time for yourselves. Schedule a date night and make an effort to reconnect. This can be as simple as dinner and a movie, or even just sitting together and talking. Whatever it is, make sure that it is something that you both can enjoy and look forward to.\n\nIt's also important to be honest with your wife about how you feel. Tell her that you miss her and that you want to make things better. Explain that you are worried about the changes you have noticed in the relationship and that you want to work together to make things right.\n\nFinally, seek help if you need it. Talking to a marriage counselor or joining a marriage support group can be beneficial if you are having difficulty communicating and working things out on your own. Marriage takes work, and you need to be willing to put in the effort to make it successful.\n\nI hope this advice helps. Good luck!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAbby", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Score, Analysis and Highlights\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers remain undefeated in their home building, The Wells Fargo Center, as they took down the Oklahoma City Thunder 115-96 on Saturday night.\n\nThe 76ers opened the game with some hot shooting, as they knocked down their first five 3-point attempts, including a pair from Tobias Harris, who finished the night with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Joel Embiid also had a double-double, scoring 21 points and grabbing 11 rebounds, while Ben Simmons dished out 10 assists to go along with 14 points.\n\nThe Thunder, who were playing without All-Star Russell Westbrook, were led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had a game-high 25 points, as well as seven rebounds and four assists. Dennis Schroder added 18 points off the bench, while Danilo Gallinari chipped in 15 points.\n\nThe game was close throughout the first half, with the 76ers holding a slim 56-53 lead at the break. However, the 76ers were able to pull away in the third quarter, outscoring the Thunder 32-20 in the period and never looked back.\n\nThe 76ers were able to do this by continuing their hot shooting from beyond the arc, making 13 3-pointers as a team, compared to just six from the Thunder. Philadelphia was also able to dominate the glass, out-rebounding the Thunder 49-37, and outscoring them in the paint 56-34.\n\nThe win improves the 76ers' record to 8-0 at home this season and marks their seventh win in a row overall. The 76ers will look to extend their streak to eight when they host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night.\n\nThe Thunder, meanwhile, will look to bounce back from the loss when they face the Detroit Pistons on Sunday.\n\nHighlights\n\nTobias Harris got off to a hot start, as he knocked down his first five 3-point attempts and finished the night with 19 points, 10 rebounds and three assists.\n\nJoel Embiid put up a double-double, scoring 21 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. He also had two steals and two blocks.\n\nBen Simmons chipped in 14 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds, while Josh Richardson added 17 points and four assists.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 25 points, seven rebounds and four assists, while Dennis Schroder added 18 points off the bench.\n\nDanilo Gallinari also had 15 points and four rebounds for the Thunder.\n\nTakeaways\n\nThe 76ers remain one of the hottest teams in the league, as they have now won seven games in a row. Their defense has been solid, as they have held their opponents to under 100 points in each of those seven games. The offense has also been clicking, as they have shot over 40 percent from 3-point range in each of those seven wins.\n\nThe Thunder, meanwhile, have now lost four of their last six games and are in danger of slipping out of the playoff picture in the Western Conference. They'll need to find a way to make up for the loss of Russell Westbrook if they want to get back on track.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "? \n\nIn the months following Sam Bankman-Fried's involvement in the multi-billion dollar crypto trading fraud, law firms across the United States have taken a closer look at the inner workings of his case. Bankman-Fried is accused of taking advantage of a trading platform known as Unikrn, which used its own unregulated cryptocurrency to fraudulently move funds among several exchanges and financial institutions.\n\nThough Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence, the case has raised questions about the adequacy of existing regulations for cryptocurrency trading, as well as the potential for financial crime in the crypto world. Bankman-Fried's attorneys have argued that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies were not aggressive enough in monitoring the platform's activities.\n\nTo this end, law firms have been making moves to close the gaps in their clients' due diligence and monitoring processes. In particular, the growing importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) compliance and legal advice for cryptocurrency trading has resulted in law firms dedicating more attention to the topic.\n\nLaw firms are emphasizing the need to ensure their clients are in compliance with government regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules. As cryptocurrency trading platforms become more popular, firms have been proactive in developing protocols and procedures to mitigate against potential risks and illegalities.\n\nLaw firms are also encouraging clients to expand their service offerings to better meet the needs of their clients. This includes taking a more client-focused approach that involves getting to know the needs of their clients on a deeper level. This means going beyond traditional legal services to offering new and innovative services that could help their clients grow their business.\n\nIn addition, law firms are trying to bridge the gap between traditional legal services and the new wave of cryptocurrency trading activity. For example, they are exploring the possibilities of using blockchain technology to make financial transactions more secure and transparent.\n\nFinally, some firms are looking at reimagining lawyer compensation models to better align with client demands. As a result, lawyers have been encouraged to become more adaptive and knowledgeable on the various features of blockchain technology and digital assets.\n\nOverall, the cryptocurrency trading fraud case of Sam Bankman-Fried has shed light on the importance of taking steps to ensure that law firms are not exposed to risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. As the legal environment changes and evolves, law firms must continue to take a proactive approach in staying informed on the latest developments and trends to best protect their clients. As this is a new and quickly changing space, law firms are no doubt taking steps to ensure that their clients are in compliance with all regulations, as well as helping their clients capitalize on the new wave of digital asset trading. \n\nMoving forward, law firms and clients must focus on the importance of staying abreast of the changing legal landscape. As the legal landscape continues to shift, law firms must continue to adjust their strategies, services and client service models to ensure the success of their clients. With the continued growth of cryptocurrency trading, it's clear that law firms will have a pivotal role in facilitating the continued development and innovation of the digital asset space.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "There are very few people on Earth who could ever say they've completely mastered every little thing about Microsoft Excel. It's the world's premier spreadsheet application, and has been the industry standard for over 35 years, replacing the once-venerable Lotus 1-2-3, the first killer app for PCs in the 1980s.\n\nMicrosoft Excel's dominance as a spreadsheet has yet to be truly tested, certainly not by Corel's Quattro Pro (still sold today in WordPerfect Office(Opens in a new window)), the open-source tools of LibreOffice, or even by Google Sheets.\n\nThere's a reason for that. Excel is powerful and does just about everything one could ask for in a spreadsheet. The current Excel version, available in Microsoft Office 2021 as part of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription and other methods, is a PCMag Editors' Choice.\n\nIt's not just for numbers. Plenty of people populate Excel's seemingly infinite grids with data, using it as a flat-file database. It can make a relatively effective contact manager or full-blown customer relationship manager. Not to mention the almost infinite number of excellent-looking charts it can generate with the right (or even wrong!) data.\n\nOne thing almost every Excel user has in common: not knowing enough. There are so many ways to slice and dice numbers, give that data a new look, and more, it's impossible to discuss them all. Entire books are written on the topic. But it's easy to master some of the more interesting and intricate tips that will make your time using the program a little easier, and will make you look like a guru of high-tech spreadsheetery. So bone up on any or all of these tricks to excel at Excel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaint Cells to a New Format Let's say you change not only the wrapping in a cell, but also the entire look\u2014the font, the color, whatever. And you want to apply it to many, many other cells. The trick is the Format Painter tool, the one that is on the Home tab that looks like a paint brush. Select the sell you like, click the icon, and then click on a different cell to paint in the format\u2014they'll match in looks, not in content. Want to apply it to multiple tabs? Double-click the paint brush icon, then click away on multiple cells.\n\nLine Breaks and Wrapping Text Typing into spreadsheet cells can be frustrating, as the default for text you type is to continue on forever, without wrapping back down to a new line. You can change that. Create a new line by typing Alt+Enter (hitting Enter alone takes you out of the cell). Or, click the Wrap Text option under the Home tab, which means all text wraps right at the edge of the cell you're in. Resize the row/column and the text re-wraps to fit. If you've got multiple cells that have text overruns, select them all before you click Wrap Text. Or, select all the cells before you even type in them and click Wrap Text. Then whatever you type will wrap in the future.\n\nAutofit All the Columns/Rows Instantly If you\u2019ve got a sheet full of truncated cells (with no text wrap) that no one can read, manually clicking column and row headers one by one helps with readability, but could take a while. Instead, do a Ctrl+A to select all then tap Alt+HOI (hit the letters in that order). That will autofit all the columns. Then use Alt+HOA to autofit the rows. Every cell will be instantly readable, even if now you have to hit the scrollbar more to see everything on the sheet. You can also find those commands using Home > Format > Autofit Row Height or AutoFit Column Width.\n\nAutoFill Your Cells This is a no-brainer, but so easily overlooked. You start typing a series of repetitive things like dates (1/1/23, 1/2/23, 1/3/23, etc.) and you know you're in for a long day. Instead, begin the series and move the cursor on the screen to the lower-right part of the last cell\u2014the fill handle. When it turns into a plus sign (+), click and drag to select all the cells you need to fill. They'll magically fill using the pattern you started. It can go up or down a column, or left or right on a row. Even better\u2014try Auto Fill without much of a pattern. Again, pick a cell or cells, move to the fill handle, right-click, and drag. You'll get a menu of options. The more data you input at first, the better the Fill Series option will do creating your AutoFill options. Check out this Microsoft tutorial(Opens in a new window).\n\nFlash Fill, Fastest Fill Alive Flash Fill will smartly fill a column based on the pattern of data it sees in the first column (it helps if the top row is a unique header row). For example, if the first column is all phone numbers that are formatted like \"21255554111\" and you want them to all look like \"(212)-555-4111,\" start typing. By the second cell, Excel should recognize the pattern and display what it thinks you want. Just hit enter to use them. This works with numbers, names, dates, etc. If the second cell doesn't give you an accurate range, type some more\u2014the pattern might be hard to recognize. Then go to the Data tab and click the Flash Fill button.\n\nCtrl+Shift to Select There are much faster ways to select a dataset than using the mouse and dragging the cursor, especially in a spreadsheet that could contain hundreds of thousands of rows or columns. Click in the first cell you want to select and hold down Ctrl+Shift, then hit either the down arrow to get all the data in the column below, up arrow to get all the data above, or left or right arrow to get everything in the row (to the left or right, of course). Combine the directions, and you can get a whole column as well as everything in the rows on the left or right. It'll only select cells with data (even invisible data). If you use Ctrl+Shift+End, the cursor will jump to the lowest right-hand cell with data, selecting everything in between, even blank cells. So if the cursor is in the upper-left cell (A1), that's everything. Ctrl+Shift+* (the asterisk) might be faster, as it will select the whole contiguous data set of a worksheet, but it will stop at cells that are blank.\n\nText to Columns Say you've got a column full of names, first next to last, but you want two columns that break them out. Select the data, then on the Data tab (at the top) click Text to Columns. Choose to separate them by either delimiters (based on spaces or commas\u2014great for CSV data values) or by a fixed width. Fixed width is utilized when all the data is crammed into the first column, but separated by a fixed number of spaces or period. The rest is like magic, with extra options for certain numbers.\n\nPaste Special to Transpose You've got a bunch of rows. You want them to be columns. Or vice versa. You would go nuts moving things cell by cell. Copy that data, select Paste Special, check the Transpose box, and click OK to paste into a different orientation. Columns become rows, rows become columns.\n\nMultiple Cells, Same Data For some reason, you may have to write the same thing over and over again in cells in a worksheet. That's excruciating. Just click the entire set of cells, either by dragging your cursor, or by holding the Ctrl key as you click each one. Type it on the last cell, then hit Ctrl+Enter (not Enter alone)\u2014what you typed goes into each cell selected. This also works with formulas, and will change the cell references to work with whatever row/column the other cells are in.\n\nPaste Special With Formulas Let's say you've got a huge amount of numbers in decimal format you want to show as percentages. The problem is, that numeral 1 shouldn't be 100%, but that's what Excel gives you if you just click the Percent Style button (or hit Ctrl-Shift-%). You want that 1 to be 1%. So you have to divide it by 100. That's where Paste Special comes in. First, type 100 in a cell and copy it. Then, select all the numbers you want reformatted, select Paste Special, click the \"Divide\" radio button, and boom goes the dynamite: you've got numbers converted to percentages. This also works to instantly add, subtract, or multiply numbers, obviously.\n\nUse Graphics in Charts You can put a graphic in any element of an Excel chart. Any element. Each bar, piece of pie, etc., can support its own image. For example, above, there's a South Dakota state flag on the pie chart (placed by selecting the slice, using the Series Options fly-out menu, and selecting \"Picture or texture fill\"), plus an embedded PCMag logo (placed with the Insert tab's Pictures button). You can even go with \"no fill,\" which caused that missing slice. Clip art can be cut and pasted to an element\u2014dollar bills to show dollars spent, water drips for plumbing costs, that kind of thing. Mixing and matching too many graphical elements makes it impossible to read, but the options you have are worth some digital tinkering. Let your resident graphic designer check them out before you use them.\n\nSave Charts as Templates Excel has more types of charts than Jimmy Carter's got peanuts, but it's almost impossible to find a default chart perfect for your presentation. Thankfully, Excel's ability to customize all graphs is exemplary. But when you have to recreate one, that's a pain. It doesn't have to be. Save your original chart as a template. Once a chart is perfected, right-click on it. Select Save as Template. Save a file with a CRTX extension in your default Microsoft Excel Templates folder. Once done, applying the template is cake. Select the data you want to chart, go to the Insert tab, click Recommended Charts > All Charts tab > Templates folder. In the My Templates box, pick the one to apply, then click OK. Some elements, like the actual text in the legends and titles, won't translate unless they're part of the data selected. You will get all the font and color selections, embedded graphics, even the series options (like a drop shadow or glow around a chart element).\n\nWork With Cells Across Sheets This one, called 3D Sum, works when you have multiple sheets in a workbook that all have the same basic layout, say quarterly or yearly statements. For example, in cell B3, you always have the dollar amount for the same corresponding week over time. On a new worksheet in the workbook, go to a cell and type a formula like =sum('Y1:Y10'!B3). That indicates a SUM formula (adding things up) for all the sheets that are titled Y1 to Y10 (so 10 years' worth), and looking at cell B3 in each. The result will be the sum of all 10 years. It's a good way to make a master spreadsheet that refers back to ever-changing data.\n\nHide in Plain Sight It's easy to hide a row or column\u2014just select the whole thing by clicking the letter or number header, right-click, and select \"Hide.\" (You can unhide by selecting the columns to either side all at once, right-clicking, and selecting \"Unhide\"). But what if you have just a little section of inconveniently placed data you want to hide, but you still want to be able to work with? Easy. Highlight the cells, right-click, and choose Format Cells. On the Number tab at the top, go to Category and select \"Custom.\" Type three semicolons (;;;) in the Type: field. Click OK. Now the numbers aren't visible, but you can still use them in formulas.\n\nHide A Whole Sheet Your typical Excel workbook\u2014the file you're working in\u2014can get loaded with plenty of worksheets (each sheet indicated by a tab at the bottom, which you can name). Hide a sheet if you want, rather than delete it, making its data still available not only for reference, but also available to formulas on other sheets in the workbook. Right-click the bottom sheet tab and select Hide. When you need to find it again, you have to go the View tab at top, click Unhide, and pick the sheet name from the list that pops up. There is also a Hide button on the View tab menu at top. What happens when you click that? It hides the entire workbook you're using. It looks like you closed the file, but Excel keeps running. When you close the program, it'll ask if you want to save changes to the hidden workbook. When you go to open the file, Excel gives you what appears to be a blank workbook\u2014until you click Unhide again.\n\nUse Personal Workbook for Macros When you unhide an entire workbook, you'll probably see a workbook listed you didn't know you hid: the Personal.XLSB file. This is the personal workbook Excel created for you; it's opened as a hidden workbook every time Excel starts. The reason to use it? Macros. When you create a macro, it doesn't work across every spreadsheet you create by default (like it does in Microsoft Word)\u2014a macro is tied to the workbook it was created in. However, if you store the macro in Personal.XLSB, it will be available all the time, in all your spreadsheet files. The trick is, when you record the macro, in the \"Store macro in\" field, select \"Personal Macro Workbook.\" (Record a macro by turning on the Developers tab\u2014go to File tab, select Options, click Customize Ribbon, then in the Main Tabs box, check Developers, click OK.)\n\nPivot! Pivot! Whole books have been devoted to PivotTabels. They're summaries of your giant collection of data that makes it much easier to parse the info based on your reference points. For example, if you've got the entire set of grades for all your students across all tests for the whole year, a PivotTable can help you narrow things down to one student for one month. It behooves anyone with big data to play with them (make a copy of the original data to play with first). To create one, check that all the columns and rows are titled the way they should be, and then select PivotTable on the Insert tab. Better yet, try the Recommended PivotTables option to see if Excel can pick the right kind for you. Or try the PivotChart, which creates a PivotTable with an included graph to make it easier to understand.\n\nDrill Down on Pivot Table Sources Want to know where some numbers came from on your pivot table? Just double-click on the cell in the pivot. An entirely new tab (worksheet) will be generated in your workbook. The contents of that tab only show the data that was used to calculate that single cell. It\u2019s very handy when you can\u2019t understand why certain things appear in the pivot.\n\nSlice Into Some Data It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re simply using a big formatted table of data in a worksheet, or a full-on pivot table that\u2019s equally stuffed full of info, you can filter the data down pretty fast and easy with a slicer. Whenever your cursor is in the table/pivot table, select Slicer from the Insert tab, or on the PivotTable Analyze menu tap Insert Slicer, or right-click on an entry in the pivot table fields and select Slicer. A floating menu will appear where you can pick a data point. Click that and the data becomes a permanent floating menu that you can use to quickly narrow down results. You can easily modify each floating slicer via the Slicer tab that will now appear. You can hold the control button down to select more than one item, and easily clear selections by clicking the funnel with a slash icon at the upper right. Right-click the slicer to go to settings and turn off Display Header if you don\u2019t need the header, or change it to show something else. The downside of a slider is it is not searchable\u2014which is something you can do with the same data in a pivot table if you just drag that to the filters box and put it in the pivot table itself. Microsoft offers a great slicer tutorial(Opens in a new window).\n\nConditionally Format Looking at a huge amount of data and wondering where the highlights are? Who has the highest (or lowest) score, what the top five are, etc.? Excel's Conditional Formatting will do everything from put a border around the highlights to color coding the entire table. It'll even build a graph into each cell so you can visualize the top and bottom of the range of numbers at a glance. (Above, the highest numbers are in speedy green, the lowest in halting red, with a spectrum in between.) Use the Highlighted Cells Rules sub-menu to create more rules to look for things, such as text that contains a certain string of words, recurring dates, duplicate values, etc. There's even a greater than/less than option so you can compare number changes.\n\nScreenshot Insertion Excel makes it ultra-easy to take a screenshot of any other open program on your desktop and insert it into a worksheet. Just go to Insert tab, select Screenshot, and you'll get a drop-down menu displaying a thumbnail of all the open programs. Pick one to insert the full-sized image. Resize it as you desire.\n\nPull Data from Pictures Yes, you can insert images into Excel easily. But what about if that image is full of data you want to place in a spreadsheet? You could re-type it all, but that\u2019s going to take forever. And it\u2019s unnecessary. You can go to Data > From Picture > Picture From File to import, or you can even do it from the clipboard if you want to take a screenshot (Data > From Picture > Picture From Clipboard) which is handy if you see a sample sheet on a website. You\u2019ll see a pane called Data from Picture display the import analysis happening in real-time, and then the data will appear in your worksheet. This works great if you have a printout of a spreadsheet or other forms\u2014take pictures with your phone, get the image on your computer, and import it. In fact, you can import it with the Excel mobile app and then share the new file with yourself to the desktop via a service like Microsoft OneDrive.\n\nInsert Excel Data Into Word Thirty-five years ago, the thought of placing data from Excel into Word or PowerPoint was mind-blowing in the world of Office Suites. Today, there's nothing to it. Whether you're taking data cells or a full-blown graphical chart, copy and paste into the other program. The thing to be aware of is, this is a link-and-embed process\u2014if you change the data in the spreadsheet, it'll change in the Word DOC or PowerPoint PPT, too. If you don't want that, paste it as a graphic. Use Word's own Paste Special tool for that. Or, when taking it from Excel, go to the Home tab at top, select the Copy menu, and use the Copy as Picture option. Then you can paste the graphic into any program at all.\n\nUse $ to Prevent Shift When you write a formula, you reference cells by their position, such as A1. If you copy a formula and paste it in the next cell down, Excel will shift that referenced cell, so it would say A2 instead. To prevent shifting, use the dollar sign ($). Type $A1 and cut and paste it to a new cell, for example, which prevents a shift in the column (A); A$1 prevents the shift in the row (1), and $A$1 prevents the shift change in any direction when copying a formula. This is handy when you have a single cell to use in a whole bunch of formulas. Say you want to divide everything by 100. You could do a formula like =(A1/100), but that means you can't change the 100 easily across the board. Put the 100 in cell B1 and use =(A1/B1)\u2014but then when you cut and paste it down, it turns to =(A2/B2), then =(A3/B3), etc. The $ fixes that: =(A1/$B$1) can be cut and pasted down a row, but the $B$1 reference never changes. Then you can change the value of 100 in the cell as needed to experiment with other changes.\n\nPerform Quick Analysis If you don't know exactly what info you'd like to apply to data in Excel, try the Quick Analysis menu to run through options quickly. Select the data and click on the Quick Analysis box that appear on the lower right. You'll get a menu that pops up with options to swiftly apply conditional formatting, create charts, handle totals, show sparklines, and more.\n\nGreat Excel Shortcut Keys Excel, like any great software, has many excellent keyboard shortcuts. Here are some of the best.\n\n\n\nCtrl+; \u2014Inserts today's date.\n\nCtrl+Shift+:\u2014Inserts the current time (the colon is what is in a clock reading, like 12:00).\n\nCtrl+Shift+#\u2014Changes the format of a date.\n\nCtrl+5\u2014Applies a strike-through to the text in a cell.\n\nCtrl+0\u2014 Hides the current column.\n\nCtrl+9\u2014Hides the current row.\n\nCtrl+F6\u2014Switches between open workbooks (that is, open Excel files in different windows).\n\nCtrl+`\u2014That's the accent mark, up by the 1 key. This combo toggles the view in the sheet to show all the formulas.\n\nCtrl+PageUp or PageDown\u2014Quick shift between the sheets in the currently open workbook.\n\nF2\u2014Start editing the current selected cell (much faster than double-clicking).\n\nShift+F10\u2014Opens the right-click menu for the cell you're in.\n\nQuickly Add Without Formulas Got numbers in a spreadsheet you want a quick calculation on, without the hassle of going to a new cell and creating a SUM formula for the job? Excel now offers a quick way to do that. Click the first cell, hold down the Ctrl key, and click a second cell. Look at the status bar at the bottom and you'll see the sum of the cells calculated for you. Keep your finger on Ctrl and click as many cells as you like, the status bar will continue to show the sum for all the cells. (Click a cell with letters/words as the content, it gets ignored.) Better yet, right click the status bar to get the Customize Status Bar menu and you can choose to add other elements that can be quick-calculated like this, such as seeing the average or count of how many cells you clicked (or the numerical count, which is how many cells you clicked that actually have numbers).\n\nFreeze Headers for Scrolling Working with a massive data set in a spreadsheet can be difficult, especially as you scroll up/down or left/right and the rows and columns may be hard to track. There's a simple trick for that if you've got a header row or column, where the first row/column has a descriptor. You freeze it so when you scroll, that row and/or column (or multiple rows and/or columns) don't move. Go to the View tab and look for Freeze Panes. You can easily just freeze the top row (select Freeze Top Row) or first column (select Freeze First Column). You can do both at once by clicking the cell at B2 and just selecting Freeze Panes. This is where it's fun\u2014select any other cell and also Freeze all the panes above and left of it. Select cell C3 for example and the two rows above and two columns to the left won't scroll. You can see it in the screenshot above, indicated by the darkened grid lines. When you want to get rid of the freeze, you can just select Unfreeze Panes from the menu.\n\nNew Window for Second View Spreadsheets can be enormous, and you may have to interact with different areas of the spreadsheet at what seems like the same time, such as cutting and pasting info from the top to the bottom over and over. If it's hundreds of thousands of cells, the scrolling that would take could make you nauseous. Or, you could just open a second window on your desktop with a view of exactly the same spreadsheet. It's easy. In the View tab, click New Window. You can also click Arrange All to get them ordered on screen in a way that works for you. You can see them Horizontally arranged above. Then, type something into a cell in one window, you can see it appear in the other window. This trick is especially handy if you've got dual monitors.\n\nDon\u2019t Use Merge and Center If you\u2019ve got a table and it\u2019s missing some data you will be tempted to put in a N/A and merge all the cells so that N/A applies across all columns/rows. But that makes it impossible to sort the data\u2014you can\u2019t have a merged cell in the middle of a sortable table. Instead, select those same cells, right click and go to Format Cells > Alignment, and under Horizontal Alignment pick Center Across Selection. Now all the cells appear merged, but they\u2019re not, so you can still sort.\n\nCombine Multiple Workbooks Into One If you have a bunch of workbooks that are all formatted exactly the same, you could copy and paste them all into one. But when some Excel sheets have hundreds of thousands of rows, that\u2019s precarious work. Instead, put all those files in the same folder. In Excel, go to the Data tab on the ribbon and select Get Data > From File > From Folder, pick your folder and click Open. You\u2019ll get a window showing the name of each file, at the bottom, click the Combine menu and select Combine & Load to... Another window will pop up now called Combine Files, with a sample of what you\u2019ll get; click OK. You\u2019ll now get an Import Data dialog box asking if you want this to be in a table, a PivotTable Report, or a regular PivotTable. You can also choose to put it in a new worksheet or an existing worksheet. Wait a while; it can take time if it's a big set of files. Once done, all your files will be one, with an added column showing the name of the original data file, in case you need to narrow things down further.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "heading into 2021 season\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are preparing to kick off their 2021 season with a renewed sense of optimism, thanks to the \u201cremarkable improvement\u201d shown by their newest safety Damar Hamlin.\n\nThe Bills signed Hamlin in the offseason, believing that his skill set and football IQ could help strengthen the team\u2019s defensive unit. Now, after months of hard work and intense practice sessions, Buffalo believes that the rookie safety is ready to make an immediate impact.\n\n\u201cDamar has been showing us some remarkable improvement,\u201d said Bills head coach Sean McDermott during a recent press conference. \u201cHe\u2019s been working hard to learn the system and the nuances of the position. He\u2019s bought into our program and has been very coachable. We feel like he\u2019s going to make an impact this season.\u201d\n\nThe former Pittsburgh Panthers star is looking to replicate the type of success he enjoyed while in college. He was part of a defense that was ranked 11th in the nation in 2018 and was a first-team All-ACC selection in 2017.\n\nHamlin is a rangy safety with a great combination of speed, strength, and instincts. He has the versatility to play a variety of roles within a defense, which the Bills hope to take advantage of. McDermott has praised his ability to make plays near the line of scrimmage, in deep coverage, and as a blitzer.\n\n\u201cDamar can do it all,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cHe\u2019s the perfect fit for our defense. We\u2019re looking for him to make a difference from day one.\u201d\n\nThe Bills will be counting on Hamlin to help lead the way for an improved secondary this season. Buffalo ranked 27th in passing defense last year, but the team believes that Hamlin will be a key piece of the puzzle to help turn things around.\n\nHe\u2019ll be joining a deep secondary unit that includes cornerbacks Tre\u2019Davious White, Levi Wallace, and Taron Johnson, as well as safeties Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. With all of these talented players, the Bills are confident that they\u2019ll be able to contain opposing passing attacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Damar as part of the team,\u201d said General Manager Brandon Beane. \u201cHe\u2019s a big, physical presence that can come in and make an immediate impact on the field. He\u2019s a player who has the ability to put opposing offenses on their heels.\u201d\n\nOverall, the Bills are feeling very optimistic about Hamlin\u2019s potential heading into the 2021 season. With the combination of his hard work and the team\u2019s confidence in his abilities, it seems like Hamlin is poised to make an immediate impact in Buffalo. The Bills are expecting great things from their rookie safety, and he appears to be ready to deliver.", "label": "machine"}

Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. When you're using a credit card that charges a foreign transaction fee and you make a purchase abroad, you'll be charged an extra fee, as a percentage of your purchase amount. The fee is generally 3% of your purchase, and it will be added to your monthly bill. Your foreign transaction fee may be broken down into two parts: a fee charged by the payment network (as in Visa or Mastercard) and a fee charged by your credit card company.\n\nDo foreign transaction fees apply online? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. In addition to applying to purchases you make while traveling abroad, a foreign transaction fee could be charged when you make a purchase from a vendor that's based outside of your home country. If you're shopping with a retailer or travel company based abroad, your best bet is to pay with a credit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees just to be safe.\n\nShould I pay in local currency or US dollars with my credit card when traveling? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Some merchants may offer the option to pay in local currency or your home currency when you use your credit card for a purchase. You should always pay in local currency because merchants can give a conversion rate much lower than the market exchange rate. Therefore, local currency rates will be closer to the actual market rate. Plus, if you pay in US dollars, you'll typically be charged an additional fee (usually around 3%) from Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), which is an unaffiliated third-party service that converts transactions to your home currency.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Donovan Mitchell\u2019s 71-point performance on Monday night didn\u2019t come without a cost.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers star was hit with a performance-enhancing drug test on Tuesday, he said on Twitter. The team confirmed the test to ESPN.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nNow, tests are a normal occurrence for players through the league. They are usually hit with four random PED tests during the season, and then two more during the offseason. The key word there, though, is random.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no real way to prove otherwise, a test coming just hours after Mitchell\u2019s historic performance certainly doesn\u2019t feel random \u2014 which is likely why Mitchell found it so funny.\n\nMitchell led the Cavaliers back from a 21-point hole to beat the Chicago Bulls in overtime on Monday night with his franchise-record 71 points. That marked the most scored in a single game in the league since Los Angeles Lakers icon Kobe Bryant dropped 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006. Mitchell\u2019s performance was the eighth-highest scoring game in league history, and the most scored by anyone this season.\n\n\"It's humbling. I'm speechless to be honest with you when you say that,\" Mitchell said. \"I think for me, not only did I do that but I did it in an effort where we came back and won. And it's how we won. That's really what, for me, it's like man, this is nuts ... I'm extremely blessed, humbled that I'm in that company, in that group.\"\n\nNBA: Donovan Mitchell's 71 points shouldn't have happened\n\nThough it can't be rescinded, the NBA said on Tuesday that Mitchell's 71-point performance shouldn't have actually happened.\n\nMitchell sent the game into overtime after he purposefully missed a free throw and tipped it back in in the final seconds on Monday night. The sequence was incredible.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nYet on Wednesday, the NBA said that Mitchell actually stepped into the foul lane early \u2014 which should have voided his basket and given the Bulls the win.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"One, it's a clear violation,\" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said after the game. \"Unequivocally, he's crossing the line on the basket before the ball ever touches the rim. That's the first thing ... And he just shot it and really kind of beat Patrick. And I think part of the reason why he beat Patrick is because he went in there too early.\"\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nBut, as that wasn't called in the moment, there's nothing that can be done.\n\nMitchell then dropped 13 points in overtime to get to 71 and take the win.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Stock prices keep rising even as corporate profit outlooks keep getting weaker\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s the sort of thing that confounds the experts: stock prices have continued to rise over the last year, even though corporate profit outlooks have only gotten weaker.\n\nThe latest data shows that this trend has been continuing, with the S&P 500 reaching an all-time high last week and the Nasdaq Composite index briefly surpassing the 13,000 mark for the first time ever.\n\nThis, of course, flies in the face of traditional economic wisdom, which suggests that when corporate profits are in decline, stock prices should reflect that weakness. So why is it that stock prices continue to rise despite the fact that profits are not?\n\nThe answer, according to analysts, lies in two key factors: low interest rates and investor optimism.\n\nLow interest rates have been a boon to stocks, particularly those that pay out dividends. As interest rates remain low, dividend yields become more attractive to investors, pushing up stock prices in the process. Additionally, when interest rates are low, stock prices look comparatively attractive, since the cost of borrowing money is so low.\n\nBut the other factor driving up stock prices is investor sentiment. Analysts have noted that, despite the gloomy outlook for corporate profits, investors continue to be optimistic that the market can recover. This is likely because of the strong performance in certain sectors that have been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn, such as technology, healthcare and industrials.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the current rally in stock prices is not based on fundamental economic data, but rather on sentiment and the expectation of future growth. This means that the current rally could quickly reverse itself if investors become less optimistic.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s difficult to predict when or if this will happen. For now, the stock market remains in a state of flux, with prices continuing to be buoyed by low interest rates and investor optimism. It remains to be seen if this rally will last or if stock prices will eventually come down to meet corporate profit outlooks.\n\nBut one thing is certain: the current state of the market is not typical, and investors should proceed with caution when investing in stocks, no matter how attractive they may appear on the surface.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\n\nAustralia on Thursday confirmed it is purchasing two advanced missile and rocket systems, including one used by Ukraine with devastating force against Russia, as deterrence to potential regional threats to its security.\n\nThe purchase of the systems, the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), has been in the works since last spring, when then-Defense Minister Peter Dutton said the war in Ukraine and looming threats from China, showed the need for Australia to upgrade its defensive weapons systems.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles reiterated that point in a statement Thursday about the two deals, which put the total price tag at $684 million ($1 billion Australian).\n\n\u201cThe Albanese government is taking a proactive approach to keeping Australia safe \u2013 and the Naval Strike Missile and HIMARS launchers will give our defense force the ability to deter conflict and protect our interests,\u201d Marles said.\n\n\u201cThe level of technology involved in these acquisitions takes our forces to the cutting edge of modern military hardware,\u201d said Pat Conroy, minister for defense industry.\n\nThe HIMARS launchers have been seen as big difference makes for Ukraine since the United States began supplying them to Kyiv last summer.\n\nIn just the past week, HIMARS strikes have made headlines for killing dozens of Russian conscripts being housed at a vocational school in the occupied Donetsk region.\n\nThe US State Department approved their sale to Australia last May, putting the price tag on a package that also included related equipment at $385 million.\n\nBut the systems are land-based, and the Norwegian-designed Naval Strike Missiles may be more relevant in immediate terms for Australian defense forces.\n\nThe maneuverable sea-skimming weapons will be deployed on the Australian navy\u2019s destroyers and frigates. With their range of 185 kilometers (115 miles), they will more than double the current range of the missiles on Australia\u2019s ships, the Australian Defense Ministry said in a statement last April, when first announcing the purchase.\n\nThursday\u2019s statement said the Naval Strike Missiles will begin replacing Harpoon missiles on Australian warships in 2024, while the HIMARS would be in the Australian arsenal by 2026-27.\n\nSome Australian military analysts said Thursday\u2019s announcement was largely for political reasons, as both had been announced by a right-leaning government that was voted out of office in favor of a left-leaning government last May 21.\n\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s a deeper political message to show that the new left-leaning government \u2026 is keen on defense spending,\u201d said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and former Royal Australian Air Force officer.\n\nThe purchase of the HIMARS system, which is focused on land-based warfare, may be a way to keep the votes of army supporters as the much of Australia\u2019s defense focus has been on China, including with its plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in the AUKUS arrangement with the United States and United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe Australian Army is in search of a role now the Middle Eastern wars have finished,\u201d said Layton. \u201cThey are unable to find a place for themselves given Australia\u2019s current strategic circumstances which favor air and naval force.\u201d\n\nIan Hall, deputy director of research at Griffith Asia, said a role for the HIMARS was being debated in the country.\n\n\u201cI imagine that HIMARS could be used in a contingency in Southeast Asia or even somewhere in the Pacific,\u201d he said, pointing out that the US Marines have been exercising with HIMARS with the thought of deploying them to Pacific islands in the event of hostilities in the region.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Television manufacturers tend to refresh their TVs every year, and CES is the ideal setting to show off these new models. Most of the big names in TVs are announcing their 2023 models at CES, ranging from simple iterations of well-established designs to all-new technology on ultra-premium screens. Here are the biggest TV reveals to come out of the show.\n\nHisense: Mini-LED X, Triple Laser Projector\n\nHisense ULED X (Credit: Hisense)\n\nHisense's newest flagship TV, the ULED X, features a new mini-LED backlight system Hisense calls Mini-LED X. The 85-inch ULED X features over 5,000 individual dimming zones, a claimed peak brightness of 2,500 nits, and a 16-bit light control algorithm. The TV also has a 4.1.2-channel sound system, CineStage X, with 80 watts of power across seven separate speakers.\n\nHisense is also updating and expanding both its lower-tier ULED TVs and its laser TV projection systems. The U6K, U7K, and U8K all feature mini-LED backlight arrays and Dolby Vision support. The U7K has an ATSC 3.0 tuner, Dolby Amos audio, and a 144Hz refresh rate with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, while the U8K also adds a stated peak brightness of 1,500 nits.\n\nFor laser TV projectors, Hisense is adding the PL1 Laser Cinema, described as a model that \"puts ultra short throw technology within reach,\" even though pricing was not announced. It runs Google TV, can project a picture of 80 to 210 inches, and generate up to 2,100 nits.\n\nHisense also introduced the Smart Mini Projector, a triple laser projector that can generate a 150-inch picture, the largest among the company's Laser TVs to date. It includes built-in Dolby Atmos and DTS audio with two 20W speakers, and runs the VIDAA smart TV platform (which is popular globally but has seen little attention in the United States). Other new Laser TV models include the L5H, L9H, and PX2-PRO, iterative updates to Hisense's L5G single-laser projector, and L9G and PX1 TriChroma laser projectors.\n\nHisense has not yet announced pricing or availability for its new TVs.\n\nLG: 97-Inch Wireless M3 OLED TV\n\nLG Signature OLED M3 with Zero Connect (Credit: Brian Westover)\n\nLG was the first TV manufacturer to put out a big-screen OLED model, and it continues to be one of the biggest names in OLED TVs, emphasizing the technology for its flagship models.\n\nAt CES, LG announced the new C3, G3, and Z3 OLED TVs, iterative updates to last year\u2019s models (which include the Editors\u2019 Choice LG C2 Evo). The new TVs fit into the same roles as the previous versions, with the C3 as the most standard and accessible OLED TV; the G3 as a slimmer, sleeker version with a nearly flush wall-mount design; and the Z3 as the 8K model.\n\nAmong the other, more widely available consumer TVs it's unveiling at CES, LG's new Signature OLED M-Series is an extra-large TV the company claims is the first that can function completely wirelessly. The 97-inch M3 uses a Zero Connect box kept physically separate from the TV to send video up to 4K 120Hz wirelessly to the screen. Presumably the screen itself will need its own power connection (which can be through the wall itself rather than a dangling power cable), but relegating all other connections to an otherwise completely discrete device enables the TV to be set up with no other physical tethers.\n\nLG OLED C3 (Credit: LG)\n\nThe M3 isn\u2019t the only TV with a unique hook that LG showed off at CES, but it is the newest one. LG previously demonstrated its OLED Flex TV at IFA 2022. The OLED Flex can transform from a flat TV to a curved one, a feature not seen among other current TVs (though Samsung has played with the idea for LCD TVs in past years).\n\nLG has not announced availability or pricing for any of its upcoming TVs, but if you\u2019re interested in the M3, you should keep in mind that the company\u2019s Signature TVs tend to be priced very high; the 88-inch, 8K Signature Z2 is $25,000, while the rollable Signature R can only be purchased directly from LG for $100,000.\n\nSamsung: Micro LED TV, No Pro Installation Required\n\nSamsung QN900C (Credit: Brian Westover)\n\nSamsung showed off its newest TV lines at CES, continuing its strategy of using multiple display technologies for its flagship models.\n\nThe new QN95C is Samsung\u2019s high-end 4K QLED TV, replacing the QN95B and Editors\u2019 Choice QN90B models. The difference between the two was the former\u2019s use of a separate OneConnect box tethered to the TV with a single wire to hold all of the necessary ports, while the latter had all of its connections onboard. According to Samsung, a new, thinner power board lets the QN95C be just 20mm thick while keeping its ports on the TV itself.\n\nMeanwhile, the QN900C will stand as the company\u2019s current top-of-the-line 8K TV, while the S95C replaces last year\u2019s S95B as Samsung\u2019s 4K OLED TV. Samsung also announced its 76-inch Micro LED CX, a new and smaller micro LED TV that stands alongside the 110-inch model. The CX is the first micro LED TV that can be set up without any professional installation; the 110-inch TV and larger versions that use modular micro LED panels require engineers to install them.\n\nSamsung has not announced pricing or availability for its new consumer TVs.\n\nTCL: S-Series vs. Q-Series\n\nTCL QM8 (Credit: TCL)\n\nTCL kicked off CES by revealing that TV selections will be split into just two overarching lines: the S-Series and Q-Series. The Q-Series will feature TCL\u2019s most advanced display technologies, while the S-Series will cover lower-end models. Each series is still split into number-based lines indicating its feature tier, including S3, S4, S5, Q6, Q7, and QM8.\n\nAs TCL\u2019s flagship model, the QM8 introduces what the company calls Mini-LED Ultra. The backlight technology appears to be similar to other mini-LED backlight systems, but according to TCL can put out twice the peak nits in brightness as the previous equivalent model, and features five times as many dimming zones (up to approximately 2,300). The QM8 will also have Wi-Fi 6 connectivity and a built-in subwoofer.\n\nThe Q7 has an LED backlight system that TCL also says shows double the peak nits and has five times the dimming zones compared with last year\u2019s models, but isn\u2019t clear with which models it\u2019s comparing the Q7 and QM8.\n\nThe Q6 is TCL\u2019s entry-level QLED TV. It uses quantum dot technology and offers a 120Hz refresh rate. All Q-Series TVs will feature RS232C compatibility for home theater installation, a first for TCL.\n\nOn the lower end, the S3 is TCL\u2019s budget-priced 1080p line, and the S4 is the entry-level 4K series with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos spatial audio support.\n\nTCL has not yet announced pricing or availability for the new TVs.\n\nSony and Vizio: No Shows\n\nNeither Sony nor Vizio are making any television announcements at CES 2023.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nAn anonymous McDonald\u2019s employee has recently revealed the secret behind the chain\u2019s popular \u2018round\u2019 and \u2018square\u2019 eggs. According to the employee, McDonald\u2019s rounds its egg products to give customers a uniform look, while its square eggs offer a more savory taste.\n\nThe employee, who is based in the United States, told YaHu News that they were initially surprised by how much difference there was between the two eggs.\n\n\u201cThe first time I tried both of them I was expecting the round egg to taste exactly like the square one but the difference is definitely there,\u201d the employee said.\n\nThe anonymous employee went on to explain that the \u2018round\u2019 eggs are cooked for a slightly longer period of time than the \u2018square\u2019 ones, which allows for a uniform size and shape.\n\n\u201cThe round egg cooks for slightly longer, but not too long that you don\u2019t get the same flavor,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s just enough that you get a more uniform shape.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the \u2018square\u2019 eggs are cooked for a shorter period of time in order to provide a more savory taste.\n\n\u201cThe square egg has a slightly more savory flavor because it doesn\u2019t get cooked for as long,\u201d the employee explained. \u201cYou can tell that it was made with a little bit of care and the flavor is definitely different.\u201d\n\nThe employee also added that the \u2018round\u2019 eggs are usually used in breakfast sandwiches and other egg dishes, while the \u2018square\u2019 eggs are mostly used in lunch and dinner items.\n\n\u201cThe round egg is usually used for things like breakfast sandwiches and scrambles,\u201d the employee said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll usually see the square egg in the lunch and dinner items, like the sausage McMuffins and breakfast burritos.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that McDonald\u2019s has long been known for its consistent and reliable meals. But this new insight into the chain\u2019s egg selection shows that the company is willing to go the extra mile to ensure its customers receive the best-tasting product. \n\nThe anonymous employee also revealed that McDonald\u2019s takes a lot of pride in its egg selection and takes great care to ensure each one is cooked to perfection.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds like a small thing, but trust me, they take great pride in their egg selection,\u201d they said. \u201cThey don\u2019t just throw a bunch of eggs into a pan and call it a day. They take their time to make sure each one is cooked just right.\u201d\n\nWhile the differences between the \u2018round\u2019 and \u2018square\u2019 eggs may be subtle, this new information shows that McDonald\u2019s is still paying attention to even the smallest of details. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about quality and taste,\u201d the employee concluded. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s really does care about what it serves its customers, and it\u2019s nice to know that even the eggs get the same treatment.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ", and Salary Negotiations\n\nWhen we think of young people, we often imagine them to be eager to get into the job market and land their first career. But it appears that Generation Z \u2013 those born in 1997 and after \u2013 are shaking up the traditional workplace, and in particular, the way that \u2018r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gaps\u2019, career breaks, and salary negotiations are seen.\n\nFor starters, Gen Z is more likely to take a \u2018career break\u2019 than other generations, making it increasingly difficult for recruiters to assess their experience. There are a few reasons for this: first, young people today are expected to multitask, having to juggle jobs, internships, and volunteer work alongside their studies. Second, with the cost of university increasing, many young people are now taking out jobs to pay for tuition and other expenses, which inevitably leads to a break in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. And finally, with the rise of remote working, freelancing and \u2018gig\u2019 economy, Gen Z are more likely to take on part-time and seasonal work \u2013 often at multiple places \u2013 which again leads to gaps in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\nBut while some recruiters might perceive this as a disadvantage, the truth is that Gen Z\u2019s career breaks bring an advantage. Career breaks can mean that Gen Z have acquired skills and knowledge that wouldn\u2019t have been available to them in a traditional job, as well as providing them with invaluable life experience. By taking breaks between study and work, they\u2019re often more flexible and adaptable, making them more desirable to employers who recognise the need for a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences in the workplace. \n\nIn addition to career breaks, Gen Z are also changing the way that salary negotiations are viewed. In the past, the idea of negotiating a salary was often seen as impolite, but Gen Z are more likely to openly negotiate for better pay and benefits, and to make their expectations clear from the start. This is partly because Gen Z are more likely to be informed about their value in the workplace \u2013 from researching average salaries in their industry, to understanding the company\u2019s financial situation. Gen Z are also willing to speak up when they\u2019re not getting what they deserve, which is an important skill in any job.\n\nFinally, Gen Z are also changing the way that \u2018r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gaps\u2019 are seen. No longer are gaps in r\u00e9sum\u00e9s seen as something that should be hidden \u2013 instead, Gen Z are comfortable talking about their career breaks openly, and explaining the skills and experience that they\u2019ve gained in the process. This can be beneficial both for Gen Z themselves, as it shows potential employers that they\u2019re self-motivated and independent, but also for employers, as it provides them with an opportunity to learn more about their candidate and to assess their true value.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Gen Z is shaking up the traditional workplace, and that their attitude towards \u2018r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gaps\u2019, career breaks, and salary negotiations is set to have a lasting impact on the way that employers recruit and retain their staff. By refusing to accept the traditional conventions of job seeking, Gen Z is helping to make the workplace more diverse and inclusive, and to ensure that employers are aware of the value of the skills and experience that they bring to the table.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Nearing the close of 2022, Jonathan, the CEO of his company, sat in the annual budget review and projection meeting. One slide in particular caught his attention: \u201cOver $500,000 donated to the End Food Instability initiative.\u201d Immediately, his mind began to race with possibilities. The company had faced criticism from employees that year for not doing enough to support the local community; why not counter that narrative by sharing this number internally\u2014and externally, for that matter? Jonathan took a photo of the slide and texted it to the head of communications.\n\nIt\u2019s the question simmering under the surface of every corporate social media post about diversity and every LinkedIn manifesto from an executive touting their organization\u2019s latest move to become more inclusive: Is this moving the conversation forward, or is this self-serving?\n\nFor every leader who\u2019s ever publicly broadcast their own organization\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, that question raises another: What happens if someone reads your words and concludes that they\u2019re more virtual-signaling that anything else?\n\nIn our DEI consulting work, we often see accusations of virtue signaling\u2014that is, performative but ultimately empty displays of moral goodness\u2014when there is a disconnect, or lack of communication, across ranks within an organization. We know that in most organizations, entry-level employees tend to be the most diverse group. We also know that these employees tend to be the most vocal about things that could change or that the company could do better, and we\u2019ve witnessed how this can ruffle feathers in leadership.\n\nThese calls for change often spark anxiety, stress, anger, and other uncomfortable emotions. Leadership might feel the urge to defend efforts taken in the past. Or they might jump to fast-paced problem solving and make a quick phone call to PR asking them to post a Black Lives Matter image on Instagram to publicly state the company\u2019s values. Or they may back away from DEI initiatives altogether for fear of being called out again.\n\nBut this scenario\u2014diverse new workers offering critical and fresh perspectives on workplace issues\u2014creates the perfect opportunity for DEI growth. For example, employees with marginalized identities might call for leadership to diversify its board, advocate for mentors of color to help entry-level staff navigate the industry, or demand that the company engage in ongoing diversity training to increase equitable practices. The company that knows how to receive this feedback is well on its way to becoming more effective, welcoming, and sustainable for all employees.\n\nSign up for Charter's newsletter to get the handbook for the future of work delivered to your inbox.\n\nIf, however, leadership responds to these calls to action without engaging in dialogue and/or really listening to recommendations, they might engage in \u201csafe\u201d or \u201ccheap\u201d campaigns, like an Instagram post or a company-wide email detailing the donations they\u2019ve made. In the absence of investment in ongoing, sustainable dialogues, trainings, and organizational change, these types of one-off, visible actions will likely come off as ways for the company to \u201ccheck the box\u201d while attempting to placate the marginalized team members calling for real change.\n\nBefore responding to feedback, it\u2019s important to take a step back. Pause. Breathe. Reflect. And consider this: If fixing systemic racism was as simple as posting a black square on Instagram, or organizing a diversity training, we would have ended it long ago. We know that a single workshop, social media post, or company-wide statement will not make lasting change.\n\nSo instead of thinking fast, aim for endurance. In the spirit of a well-known fable: Emulate the tortoise, not the hare.\n\nWhen you receive feedback from employees, that feedback was likely carefully thought out and thoughtfully prepared. Honor the time they spent on it and the risk they took in delivering it. Meet their investment with deep thought, conversations, proposed action, invitations for more input, and a sustained investment of effort.\n\nHere are those steps broken down:\n\nDeep thought: Don\u2019t respond right away. If the message arrives via email, for example, take time alone in your office to read the message a few times. Notice feelings of defensiveness, anger, disbelief, frustration. Drink some water, have a snack, take a 10-minute walk outside, vent to someone that holds the same identities as you. Sleep on it. Return to the email after you\u2019ve regulated your emotions and read it a few more times. Try reading it out loud with a soft tone of voice. With these steps, you might be shocked at how differently it lands.\n\nRemind yourself that when it comes to matters of race and other identities, any form of feedback is a gift. Find and cultivate feelings of gratitude. Recognize that this is your chance to facilitate your employees\u2019 experiences of feeling heard and appreciated. Consider that you have been offered a roadmap to better leadership and organizational change, and it arrived in the form of an email in your inbox.\n\nConversations: If you have permission, share the feedback with your leadership team. Guide them through the steps above, modeling by leading with expressions of gratitude for the employees who shared their thoughts. Brainstorm ideas regarding what could be changed, and how the company could address these concerns in thoughtful, strategic, and enduring ways.\n\nPropose action: Share the ideas that were generated by leadership with the company more broadly, and invite feedback via anonymous surveys, optional group meetings, and invitations to have 1:1 meetings. If your proposed actions are met with silence, interpret the lack of engagement with caution. Silence may be a sign that your employees are feeling burnt out, hopeless, or skeptical that things will change. (If this is the case, we recommend investing in ongoing dialogue facilitation with the help of an outside consultant.)\n\nInvest in sustained effort and evaluation: Construct plans that have an ongoing cadence, whether it\u2019s weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Consider a multi-pronged approach including the following:\n\nConduct annual DEI and/or climate assessments\n\nDraft company guidelines for receiving identity-related feedback and having identity-related conversations\n\nCommit to ongoing required leadership DEI training and company-wide DEI workshops\n\nCoordinate company reads on DEI topics\n\nWherever the brainstorming and feedback process leads you, be encouraged and confident that you are pursuing the more promising path of the tortoise. By skillfully avoiding the alluring trap of \u201cone and done\u201d approaches and putting your money where your tweet is, you\u2019ve signaled that your company is prepared to persist, endure, and, ultimately, win.\n\nDr. Stephanie Pinder-Amaker and Dr. Lauren Wadsworth are Harvard-affiliated licensed clinical psychologists and authors of the top-rated human-resources and business book, Did That Just Happen?!

{"text": "A man smokes marijuana during a hip-hop performance at the 11th annual block party held by the Bushwick Collective in Brooklyn, New York, on June 4, 2022.\n\nThriving, unregulated marijuana businesses across the United States are undercutting legal markets awaiting banking and tax reform.\n\nWhile it's an issue in states like Colorado, Michigan and Washington, it's a much bigger problem in New York. Unlicensed businesses are \"taking a pretty hefty percent of the potential market share,\" according to Amanda Reiman, a researcher at cannabis intelligence company New Frontier Data. None of the 36 newly licensed dispensaries in New York have even started operating yet.\n\nThe licensing program in New York is years behind the state's sophisticated black market. New York doled out its first set of dispensary licenses last month, but recreational marijuana has been legal in the state for nearly two years.\n\n\"These shops are masquerading as safe, legal entities,\" said Trivette Knowles, a press officer at the New York State Office of Cannabis Management, \"but there are currently no licensed sales happening right now in the state of New York.\"\n\nThe problem is particularly cumbersome in New York City, Knowles said. Weed can be bought from brick-and-mortar storefronts, trucks, pop-up shops, bodegas and even courier services that deliver directly to consumers. His office has sent out cease-and-desist letters to some of the unlicensed operators in the state, but some trade groups say there are likely tens of thousands of illegal businesses in the city alone.\n\n\"It's almost like whack-a-mole,\" said Reiman, of New Frontier Data. \"If one goes down, another one just pops up.\"\n\nReiman said her firm doesn't track data on the many illicit businesses that have taken root across the country, but she estimates the national market is worth around $60 billion. The legally regulated industry is just half that, she said.\n\n\"When you have dispensaries and distribution systems that pretty much mimic regulated markets, it can be really difficult to get people to move over,\" Reiman said.\n\nUnregulated markets, she said, also pose serious health risks for consumers. A November study commissioned by the New York Medical Cannabis Industry Association found that after reviewing cannabis products from 20 illicit stores in New York City, about 40% contained harmful contaminants such as E.coli, lead and salmonella.\n\nBesides cease-and-desist letters, New York City has begun cracking down in other ways, too.\n\nIn December, Mayor Eric Adams announced the seizure of more than $4 million worth of products being sold illegally. His office also issued over 500 civil and criminal summonses as part of a two-week pilot program with various law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"We will not let the economic opportunities that legal cannabis offers be taken for a ride by unlicensed establishments,\" the mayor said at a news conference.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday alleged that the AmerisourceBergen Corporation, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmaceutical distributors, and two of its subsidiaries failed to report hundreds of thousands of suspicious prescription opioid orders to pharmacies across the country.\n\nThe lawsuit, which spans several states, alleges that AmerisourceBergen disregarded its legal obligation to report orders of controlled substances to the Drug Enforcement Agency for nearly a decade. The company ignored \u201cred flags\u201d that pharmacies in West Virginia, New Jersey, Colorado and Florida were diverting opioids into illegal drug markets, the suit says.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable those who fueled the opioid crisis by flouting the law,\u201d Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cCompanies distributing opioids are required to report suspicious orders to federal law enforcement. Our complaint alleges that AmerisourceBergen \u2013 which sold billions of units of prescription opioids over the past decade \u2013 repeatedly failed to comply with that requirement,\u201d she added.\n\nIf AmerisourceBergen is found liable at trial, the company faces billions of dollars in financial penalties, the Justice Department said.\n\nLauren Esposito, a spokesperson for AmerisourceBergen, countered on Thursday in a statement that said the Justice Department\u2019s complaint rested on \u201cfive pharmacies that were cherry picked out of the tens of thousands of pharmacies that use AmerisourceBergen as their wholesale distributor, while ignoring the absence of action from former administrators at the Drug Enforcement Administration \u2013 the DOJ\u2019s own agency.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWith the vast quantity of information that AmerisourceBergen shared directly with the DEA with regards to these five pharmacies, the DEA still did not feel the need to take swift action itself \u2013 in fact, AmerisourceBergen terminated relationships with four of them before DEA ever took any enforcement action while two of the five pharmacies maintain their DEA controlled substance registration to this day.\u201d\n\nYet AmerisourceBergen was allegedly aware that in two of the pharmacies, drugs it distributed were likely being sold in parking lots for cash, the Justice Department said. In another pharmacy, the company was allegedly warned that patients likely suffering from addiction were receiving opioids, including some people who later died of a drug overdose.\n\nThe Justice Department also noted in its lawsuit that AmerisourceBergen\u2019s reporting systems for suspicious opioid orders were deeply inadequate, and that the company intentionally changed its reporting systems to reduce the number of orders flagged as suspicious amid the opioid epidemic.\n\nEven when orders were flagged as suspicious, AmerisourceBergen often didn\u2019t report those orders to the DEA, according to the complaint.\n\nOpioids are involved in the vast majority of drug overdose deaths, though synthetic opioids \u2013 particularly fentanyl \u2013 have played an outsized role.

The idea, it said, was to turn Slack into a platform that would be used just for direct messaging, with the rest of the company's communications moving to Workplace by Meta.\n\nCommunity channels \u2014 such as those for special interests like photography or cryptocurrency \u2014 were changed to be read-only. Shopify previously had dozens of public channels for these special interests.\n\n\"We've forced our async work into Slack - it's bloated, noisy, and distracting,\" COO and Vice President of Product Kaz Nejatian said in an email to employees. \"We have endless channel updates mixed with broad announcements and pineapple on pizza debates.\"\n\nSome of those channels, including those for employee resource groups, would be recreated in Workplace.\n\nShopify also implemented additional rules around meetings.\n\nIt automatically canceled all employee meetings of more than two people and all meetings that were scheduled for Wednesdays. The only time that employees would now be allowed to hold team events of more than 50 people would be Thursdays between the hours of 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET. Any large events outside that window were automatically deleted, except for meetings happening with people outside of Shopify.\n\n\"All of this feels chaotic, which is kind of the point,\" Nejatian said in his email.\n\n\"For launches like this there's two ways to do it,\" he continued. \"A long, slow burn that causes distraction and discomfort to simmer across the org for months on end (for real, most companies would take 6 months minimum to make a software change like this). Or, we can turn up the heat, causing an intense degree of discomfort and distraction that we move through very quickly so we can get on with what's most important.\"\n\nEmployees logged on to work Tuesday to see that they had been removed from all public Slack channels. That included channels like one called Battlestations, where Shopify employees posted photos of their home office setups and others could ask advice on things like monitors, chairs, and keyboards.\n\n\"That type of cooler chat is no longer allowed,\" said one employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\n\"The term 'jungle gym' is often used\" at Shopify, they continued, \"but this eliminates much of how one can interact and learn from other Shopifolk. This eliminates the transparency and open communication which Shopify prided itself on.\"\n\nShopify's use of Slack has been a topic of concern among employees before. In August, Insider reported that the company had implemented measures to discourage negative and off-topic discussions of the company and its plans. On Slack, the company moderated channels and volunteered employees to keep channels focused on their stated purpose, with the intent to shut down conversations and even whole channels that became contentious.\n\nBut the company said that Tuesday's \"chaos monkey\" changes were primarily intended to improve employees' ability to focus on their work.\n\n\"Together these changes will help focus our time and attention, ship faster and improve our operational excellence,\" the internal documents that were viewed by Insider said. \"It'll help Shopify the company keep pace alongside Shopify the product; a strong capable partner running alongside, supporting and cheering it on for the entire (100 year) marathon.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Shopify founder and CEO Tobi L\u00fctke said that growth happens when people move away from comfort.\n\n\"So what I'm trying to create is an environment where almost everyone around me feels uncomfortable all the time, because I'm dragging them into the next box,\" he said.\n\n\"The best thing founders can do is subtraction,\" he continued. \"It's much easier to add things than to remove things. If you say yes to a thing, you actually say no to every other thing you could have done with that period of time. As people add things, the set of things that can be done becomes smaller. Then, you end up with more and more people just maintaining the status quo.\"", "label": "human"}

While the furloughs have since ended and many workers have returned to their jobs, Disney has yet to lift the hiring freeze.\n\nThe move comes as Disney is struggling to make up for lost revenue due to pandemic-related closures of its theme parks, resorts, and other businesses. Disney also delayed the release of several of its major films due to the pandemic, resulting in major losses for the company.\n\nDisney has implemented various cost-cutting measures in an effort to save money, and Iger\u2019s memo made it clear that the hiring freeze will stay in place.\n\n\u201cIn light of current conditions, we must continue to focus on controlling costs and working with a sense of financial discipline,\u201d Iger said. \u201cTherefore, we will be keeping our current hiring freeze in place.\u201d\n\nIger also said that the company will \u201ccontinue to carefully monitor our performance and make adjustments as necessary.\u201d He added that Disney is \u201ccommitted to managing our workforce with fairness and transparency and to providing employees with the support and resources they need.\u201d\n\nThe CEO also noted that, despite the uncertain economic environment, Disney remains \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cwill emerge from this crisis even stronger.\u201d He pointed to the company\u2019s \u201csuccessful\u201d reopening of its theme parks and other businesses, as well as its \u201crobust\u201d streaming lineup, as reasons for optimism.\n\nIger added that Disney \u201cwill continue to focus on what\u2019s most important: the care and well-being of our people and the success of our businesses,\u201d and that \u201cwe will continue to explore and invest in new opportunities to create value for our company and shareholders.\u201d\n\nAs Disney attempts to navigate the current economic environment, the hiring freeze will remain in place.

{"text": "MonicaNinker / iStock.com\n\nSocial Security is generally a once-per-month proposition. However, in certain cases, Social Security beneficiaries can receive more than one check per month. For some this is a normal occurrence, but for others it can mark some type of irregularity.\n\nRetirement at Any Age: Get Top Retirement Tips for Every Stage of Life\n\nFind Out: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIf you receive two Social Security checks in a single month, it pays to understand why, and to know if you should expect the same payment schedule in the future. Here are the main reasons why a recipient might get two Social Security checks in a single month.\n\nYou Are Receiving Both Social Security Retirement and SSI Payments\n\nSocial Security retirement benefits and Supplemental Security Income payments are two different benefits. You will never receive your retirement benefits and your SSI payments on the same date, so if you qualify for both, you should expect two separate payments every month.\n\nYou Are Receiving Both Social Security Disability and SSI Payments\n\nIf you receive both Social Security disability payments and SSI checks, you\u2019re in the same situation as if you are getting both retirement and SSI payments. Those are two separate programs operated under the Social Security Administration, so their payments are not linked.\n\nSocial Security disability payments are made on the same date as retirement benefits, and in fact once you reach full retirement age, your disability payments will convert to retirement benefits. This means that your payment date will remain the same, even if the amount may change.\n\nTake Our Poll: Are You Struggling To Keep Up With Your Utility Bills?\n\nThere Is a Quirk in the Calendar\n\nIn months where bank holidays occur, SSI payments may be pushed up. This can result in beneficiaries receiving two payments in a month. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that beneficiaries are being paid double. In fact, for some, it may mess up their budgeting a bit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is because in any month where someone receives two SSI payments, they won\u2019t receive any the following month. For example, in April 2022, SSI beneficiaries received payments on April 1 and April 29, but they didn\u2019t receive any payments at all in May 2022. Although the payment is usually only accelerated by a couple of days, it could be confusing for recipients who aren\u2019t aware of this quirk in the system.\n\nYou Are Owed Back Payments\n\nIf you are owed back payments on your Social Security record, you may end up receiving more than one payment per month. This happens most often if you were recently approved for disability payments. The length of time between your \u201cEstablished Onset Date\u201d (EOD) and when you actually got your first payments determines how much you are owed in back benefits. Once those payments begin, they will arrive at a different time than your regular monthly checks.\n\nHow Are Payment Dates Determined?\n\nYour Social Security payments are made based on the date of your birth, according to the following schedule:\n\nBirth date 1-10: payments on 2nd Wednesday of month\n\nBirth date 11-20: payments on 3rd Wednesday of month\n\nBirth date 21-31: payments on 4th Wednesday of month\n\nSupplemental Security Income is generally paid on the 1st of every month. However, as shown above, sometimes SSI can be paid twice per month, based on the calendar. For example, in 2022, second SSI payments were made on April 29 and September 30 and will be again on December 30.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Did I Get Two Social Security Checks This Month?", "label": "human"}

At the end of last year, Kotaku looked into the status of PS5 (and Xbox Series X) availability, and found the systems were, at least marginally, more available than they were after launch. So some tangible progress has been made since 2020. Back in December, Sony said it had resolved supply issues in Asian territories, but here in January, it claims to have overcome this worldwide.\n\nDespite this, the tech industry is dealing with semiconductor shortages that have made manufacturing devices like the PS5 much more difficult, and some estimate this shortage will last well into 2023 (and possibly 2024). So just how available the console will be in the coming months remains to be seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of this writing, scalpers are still selling PlayStation 5 consoles at inflated prices on sites like eBay, though they\u2019re much closer to the system\u2019s shelf price of $499. If Sony can make good on its promise that the shortage is over, hopefully the console is more widely available in 2023 and at its typical asking price.\n\nRegardless of the supply issues, the PlayStation 5 has still managed to sell pretty well, as Sony also announced at its CES conference that the console has surpassed 30 million units sold since its launch in 2020.", "label": "human"}

Mourners laid flowers in the centre of Samara.\n\n\"I haven't slept for three days, Samara hasn't slept. We are constantly in touch with the wives of our guys. It's very hard and scary,\" RIA quoted Yekaterina Kolotovkina, a representative of a women's council at an army unit, as telling one rally.\n\n\"But we can't be broken. Grief unites ... We will not forgive, and, definitely, victory will be ours.\"\n\nThe strike on Makiivka came as Russia was launching what have become nightly waves of drone attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address that the attacks were aimed at \"exhausting our people, our anti-aircraft defences, our energy\".\n\nUkrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainian TV that 84 drones had been shot down in two Russian attacks since the New Year.\n\nStory continues\n\nUkraine's armed forces are organising mobile groups to hunt them down, using jeeps and other vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft machine guns and searchlights, Ihnat said.\n\nZelenskiy, whose forces rely heavily on weapons and other equipment provided by Western nations, held separate phone calls on Tuesday with the Dutch and British prime ministers.\n\n\"We agreed to intensify our efforts to bring victory closer this year already,\" he said on the Telegram messaging app of his call with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nFOREIGN MERCENARIES\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry did not mention Makiivka in its daily bulletin on Tuesday but announced several offensives, including strikes launched by Russian Aerospace Forces that it said had killed more than 130 foreign mercenaries in Donetsk.\n\nIt said missile and air strikes launched at a \"hardware concentration\" near Druzhkivka railway station in Donetsk had killed up to 120 Ukrainian personnel, and destroyed two HIMARS launchers and more than 800 rockets.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine last Feb. 24, has increasingly resorted to mass air strikes against Ukrainian cities after suffering defeats on the battlefield in the second half of 2022. It denies targeting civilians.\n\nFront lines have scarcely budged for weeks with most intense fighting raging around the city of Bakhmut, described by commanders on both sides as a \"meat grinder\".\n\nRussian forces are literally trying to advance over the corpses of their own soldiers toward Bakhmut and the military situation there remains the most difficult, Ukrainian military commander in chief General Valery Zaluzhny said.\n\nThe governor of Ukraine's Luhansk province, which along with neighbouring Donetsk forms the industrial Donbas region claimed by Moscow, said on Tuesday Ukrainian forces had made steady advances in the direction of Russian-held Svatove and Kreminna.\n\nElsewhere, Ukraine's military General Staff said a Dec. 31 strike on a Russian-held area of the southern Kherson region had killed or injured some 500 Russian troops.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm the battlefield accounts.\n\nReuters footage showed a team of Ukrainian volunteers known as \"Black Tulip\" exhuming dead soldiers' bodies near the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\n\"Whenever you dig up a boy, you live through his nightmare and the horror he went through in his last moment, when he understood this is the end,\" said volunteer Oleksii Iukov, 37.\n\nRUSSIAN FURY\n\nRussian military bloggers condemned the decision to store ammunition in the same building in Makiivka that was being used as a barracks, despite commanders knowing it was within range of Ukrainian rockets.\n\nIgor Girkin, a former commander of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and now one of the highest-profile Russian nationalist military bloggers, said hundreds had been killed or wounded. Military equipment stored at the site was uncamouflaged, he said.\n\nUkraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-held territory in Ukraine.\n\nGrigory Karasin, a member of the Russian Senate and a former deputy foreign minister, demanded vengeance against Ukraine and its NATO military alliance supporters but also \"an exacting internal analysis\".\n\nSergei Mironov, a legislator and former chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament, demanded criminal liability for officials who had \"allowed the concentration of military personnel in an unprotected building\" and \"all the higher authorities who did not provide the proper level of security\".\n\nA little known patriotic group that supports the widows of Russian soldiers called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to order a large-scale mobilisation of millions of men.\n\nThe Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the appeal. Putin said last month there was no need for a further mobilisation on top of an additional 300,000 men called up in September.\n\n(Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk in Kyiv and by other Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Perry and Gareth Jones; Editing by Robert Birsel, Nick Macfie, Alexandra Hudson)", "label": "human"}

Both of these exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gained more than 70% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThat's impressive performance, especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding market turmoil. But what's more interesting is that it wasn't just renewable stocks powering the sector's gains.\n\nThe iShares Global Energy ETF contains stocks from a variety of energy sources, including renewable ones such as solar and wind. However, the fund has gotten most of its gains from traditional energy sources like oil, gas and coal. The fund has an overweight position in energy giant Chevron Corp. and energy services company Schlumberger.\n\nThe same can be said for the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF. Despite the fund's name, it contains stocks from a variety of energy sources, including renewable ones. But it's gotten most of its gains from oil and gas stocks.\n\nEven so, renewable stocks have played a big role in the energy sector's impressive performance this year. Companies like Nextera Energy, Sunrun and Enphase have all posted stunning returns in the past year, with the latter two up more than 150%.\n\nInvestors were betting on a shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. That bet has been paying off. President Joe Biden is pushing for policies that would favor renewable sources and require emissions reductions.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that renewable stocks have done so well this year. But the biggest winners have been traditional energy stocks, which were driven higher by higher oil and gas prices.\n\nOil and gas prices rose this year due to an increase in demand as well as production cuts from the OPEC cartel. The increase in prices boosted earnings for oil and gas companies and resulted in strong returns for energy ETFs.\n\nOverall, it's been a good year for energy ETFs, with most posting impressive gains. Renewable stocks have been a key driver of those gains, but they haven't been the only factor. Higher oil and gas prices have been a big driver as well, and traditional energy stocks have been the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nInvestors are betting that the energy sector will continue to do well in the years ahead, regardless of which sources power the gains. It remains to be seen, however, whether traditional or renewable stocks will lead the way.", "label": "machine"}

Last month, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 basis points, bringing total increases to its benchmark policy rate to 4.25% in 2022.\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference at the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2022.

Aggressive central bank actions to quell historic inflation and war in Ukraine battered financial markets and ended a three-year winning streak for the major averages.\n\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 19.4% in 2022, its largest calendar-year decline since a 38% drop in 2008 during the Great Recession. The Dow fell a comparably modest 9%, holding up better than its index peers.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite wiped out one third of its value, dropping 33% and closing out its first four-quarter decline since the 2000 dot-com bubble as rising interest rates wreaked havoc on technology stocks.\n\nEven as investors turn the page on 2022, much of Wall Street expects more pain remains ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsensus strategist forecasts see a volatile first half of 2023 and an easier second half. Still, stocks are expected to be little changed \u2014 or post marginal gains at best \u2014 with the Federal Reserve projected to keep rates high for a sustained period of time.\n\n\"Amid the backdrop of the hawkish Fed\u2019s aggressive rate-rising moves leading into 2023, there is an exceedingly greater investor concern about the likelihood of a harder-than-desired landing that would push the U.S. and global economies into a recession,\" AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk said in an emailed note.\n\n\"Investors remain hyper-focused on employment, labor and related economic data, as the ongoing strength of wages could hamper corporate profit margins and cripple earnings across industries and sectors.\"\n\nThe labor market has cooled in recent months though demand for workers remains high, even as Fed officials has pressed on with their most combative monetary-tightening campaign in decades.\n\nDespite policymakers delivering 425 basis points worth of rate hikes in 2022, the U.S. labor market has averted any substantial hit, while other facets of the economy such as housing and manufacturing have shown signs of a slowdown.\n\nWhile Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate for nonfarm payroll growth last month stands at 200,000, this would market a slowdown from the 263,000 jobs added to the economy in November when predictions were roughly the same. The unemployment rate also stands at a low of 3.7%, while the labor force participation rate remains little changed.\n\n\u201cThe lag effect of Fed tightening throughout 2022 will slow economic activity in 2023, a natural outcome of fighting inflation,\u201d Treasury Partners chief investment officer Richard Saperstein said in a note, though adding: \u201cThe labor market will be the last to turn, forcing the Fed to maintain elevated rates through 2023.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

Fed Chair Powell has signaled that he and colleagues will switch to smaller rate hikes to assess their toll but may ultimately lift the terminal rate higher.\n\nDecember\u2019s median forecast showed a new interest rate peak of 5%-5.25%, up from 4.5%-4.75% in September. The Fed\u2019s 0.50% hike, meanwhile, marked a downshift from a steady round of 0.75% hikes.\n\nThe FOMC is set to convene January 31-February 1 and is expected to deliver its first rate increase of 2023 and eighth of the current hiking cycle at the conclusion of discussions.\n\nElsewhere on the economic calendar this week, readings on durable goods orders and PMI data will offer investors the latest snapshots of industrial and manufacturing activity.\n\nThe earnings calendar remains light during the off-season, with a few notable names including Conagra (CAG), Constellation Brands (STZ), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) set to report.\n\n\u2014\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nMonday: Markets closed for New Year's Day.\n\nTuesday: S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, December Final (46.2 expected, 46.2 during prior month); Construction Spending, month-over-month, November (-0.4% expected, -0.3% during prior month)\n\nWednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Dec. 30 (0.9% during prior week); ISM Employment, December (48.4 during prior month); ISM Manufacturing, December (48.5 expected, 49.0 during prior month); ISM New Orders, December (47.2 during prior month); ISM Prices Paid, December (42.9 expected, 43.0 during prior month); JOLTS Job Openings, November (10.100 million expected, 10.334 during prior month); FOMC Meeting Minutes, Dec. 14; Wards Total Vehicle Sales, December (13.70 million, 14.14 during prior month)\n\nThursday: Challenger Job Cuts, year-over-year, December (416.5% during prior month); ADP Employment Change, December (140,000 expected, 127,000 during prior month); Trade Balance, November (-$74.5 billion expected, -$78.2 billion during prior month); Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Dec. 31 (230,000 expected, 225,000 during prior week); Continuing Claims, week ended Dec. 24 (1.710 million during prior week); S&P Global U.S. Services PMI, December Final (44.4 expected, 44.4 during prior month); S&P Global U.S. Composite PMI, December Final (44.6 during prior month)\n\nFriday: Two-Month Payroll Net Revision, December (-23,000 prior); Change in Nonfarm Payrolls, December (200,000 expected, 263,000 during prior month); Change in Private Payrolls, December (167,000 expected, 221,000 during prior month); Change in Manufacturing Payrolls, December (6,000 expected, 14,000 during prior month); Unemployment Rate, December (3.7% expected, 3.7% during prior month); Average Hourly Earnings, month-over-month, December (0.4% expected, 0.6% during prior month); Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, December (5.0% expected, 5.1% prior month); Average Weekly Hours All Employees, December (34.4 expected, 34.4 during prior month); Labor Force Participation Rate, December (62.2% expected, 62.1% during prior month); Underemployment Rate, December (6.7% during prior month); ISM Services Index, December (55.0 expected, 56.5 during prior month); ISM Services Employment, December (51.5 during prior month); ISM Services Prices Paid, December (70.0 during prior month); ISM Services New Orders, December (56.0 during prior month); Factory Orders, November (-0.8% expected, 1.0% during prior month); Factory Orders Excluding Transportation, November (0.8% during prior month); Durable Goods Orders, November Final (-2.1% during prior month); Durables Excluding Transportation, November Final (0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding aircraft, November Final (0.2% during prior month); Non-defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, November Final (-0.1% during prior month)\n\n\u2014\n\nEarnings Calendar\n\nMonday: Markets closed for New Year's Day.\n\nTuesday: No notable reports scheduled for release.\n\nWednesday: UniFirst Corporation (UNF)\n\nThursday: AngioDynamics (ANGO), Conagra (CAG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Helen of Troy (HELE), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)\n\nFriday: No notable reports scheduled for release.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

{"text": "Toy companies are enjoying a burst of growth as adults, not just children, seek out their favorite childhood items.\n\nToy sales have become the latest boom sector, driven largely by adults buying their favorite childhood toys. On the back of these sales, the toy industry is projected to hit record growth in 2020, with sales increasing by an estimated 3.2 percent over the previous year, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.\n\nThe sales boom is being driven by Gen X and Millennial adults who are looking to recapture their childhood memories. Toys such as Barbie dolls, Lego blocks, and action figures have been flying off shelves at stores and online, fueling growth for the toy industry.\n\nIn particular, the collector toy segment has been booming, with sales of action figures and other collectible toys increasing by 20 percent in 2020. Many adults are buying the same toys they had as children or making a nostalgia-driven purchase for their own children.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of adults buying toys for themselves,\" says Steve Pasierb, president and CEO of the Toy Association. \"A lot of it is driven by nostalgia, but there are also some practical aspects to it, like being able to teach or show your children or grandchildren the same toys you played with when you were a kid.\"\n\nThe collectible toy trend has been fueled by shows like Adult Swim's \"Rick & Morty\" and Disney+'s \"Star Wars\" series. There has also been an explosion of content on streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube, featuring people showing off and playing with their collectible toys.\n\nThe growth of the toy industry has been good news for toy makers as well. Companies like Mattel and Hasbro have seen their sales grow as adults embrace the nostalgia of toys they grew up with.\n\nIn addition to toy makers, retailers are also reaping the benefits of the toy boom. Toys \"R\" Us, which closed its stores in 2018, was bought out by a consortium of investors and is expected to re-open its doors in 2021. The chain's relaunch could be another boon for the toy industry.\n\n\"The toy industry is no longer just for kids,\" says Pasierb. \"It has become increasingly popular among adults, and it's something that retailers should take note of. With Toys 'R' Us reopening its doors, there's an even greater opportunity to capture the nostalgia and attention of adult toy buyers.\"\n\nIt appears the trend of adults buying their favorite childhood toys is here to stay, and toy makers and retailers are set to benefit from the continued growth of the industry. From Barbie dolls to Lego blocks, it's clear that adults are driving the toy industry's resurgence.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Greg Smithies leads the biggest fund focused on the decarbonization of real estate.\n\nSmithies has worked on sustainability issues and with Elon Musk's The Boring Company.\n\nHe said decarbonization is beginning to make good financial sense, which will drive progress.\n\nGreg Smithies, the co-head of the world's largest real-estate-tech climate fund at Fifth Wall, has $500 million at the ready for one monumental task: decarbonizing buildings, the largest single source of carbon emissions in the world.\n\nHe and his team of twelve venture capitalists are searching for new technologies that can transform buildings into greener assets. They are armed with money from real-estate giants like the single-family-rental landlord Invitation Homes, the real-estate-services firm CBRE, the apartment landlord Equity Residential, MGM Resorts, and the Canadian real-estate firm Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge, among many others.\n\nThe size and scope of their funding and mission is unprecedented in the venture-capital world, especially in a year when investments are shrinking. But Smithies is no stranger to investment-led decarbonization efforts, having tackled the problem for much of his career.\n\n\"We will probably see this being the largest use of capital in human history,\" Smithies said.\n\nSmithies is an optimist in the power of capitalism to slow the climate crisis, a philosophy he shares with his former boss, fellow South African Elon Musk. Smithies walks the walk: he lives on a regenerative farm in the North Bay Area of California, where he grows much of his own food.\n\nHe believes landlords can profit with climate-friendly measures, such as Clarity AI's carbon-footprint-tracking software. Indeed, he said many investors with the Fifth Wall fund are planning to be customers of the very products they're backing, suggesting they see the longer-term benefit on their bottom lines.\n\nSmithies began his career as an investor at Battery Ventures, where he invested mostly in traditional-software businesses, though he also invested in industrial-technology companies with an eye on sustainability.\n\n\"At the end of the day, software isn't going to solve the climate crisis,\" Smithies said.\n\nFrom Battery Ventures, he joined two of Musk's most ambitious startups: The Boring Company, which has built an underground transportation tunnel in Las Vegas; and Neuralink, which makes implants that purport to connect first the monkey brain, and eventually the human brain, to a computer.\n\nWhile working at both companies, serving as the head of operations and finance, Smithies helped grow the the firms from roughly 50 to 150 employees. He worked on Musk's flamethrower project at Boring, noting that if anyone needed advice on how to manufacture 22,000 flamethrowers in a month, he was their guy.\n\n\"Working with Elon, there was not a lot of sleep, but there were lots of adventures,\" he said.\n\nFrom there, he invested in technology to decarbonize transportation for iVentures, BMW's climate-focused venture fund. But real estate was the real challenge he wanted, he said.\n\nBuildings emit more than all vehicles \u2014 making up 40% of global emissions \u2014 but they have received a mere 6% of climate-venture investment, Smithies said. He figures it'll take $18 trillion to \"decarbonize the built environment,\" in annual chunks of about $1 trillion.\n\n\"The internet is only a $1 to 1.5 trillion market, so that's roughly one internet per year,\" he said.\n\nThe fund has announced 20 investments its made since it launched, such as Source Water, a product that can pull drinking water from desert air; Turntide, which builds electric motors that could reduce the consumption of air conditioners, pumps, and elevators; and Brimstone, which manufactures carbon-neutral concrete.\n\nSmithies nodded to the impacts that regulation and altruism have on decarbonization. But above all, he's focused on the money and the potential savings that low-carbon technology can have on real estate. If it's profitable to go green, capable and cunning capitalists will make the switch.\n\n\"I kind of trust in people's ethical reasons to do things, but I fully trust their capitalistic reasons for doing things,\" Smithies said.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The stock market was down sharply on Wednesday this week. It was up sharply on Thursday. And it will surprise no one if it ends up or down sharply today, the final trading day of the year. That\u2019s because, though the market will finish the year down almost 20 percent (per the S&P 500 index), stocks have not taken a steady downward path to get there. Instead, they\u2019ve been on an extraordinarily bumpy ride, oscillating between bouts of optimism and gloom, regularly adding or erasing trillions of dollars of market capitalization in a matter of weeks.\n\nTake what the S&P 500 has done since the beginning of June. First, it fell about 10 percent in a couple of weeks, then it rose 18 percent over the next two months. Then it fell sharply again, 16 percent in little more than a month, but clambered back up by about 15 percent by the beginning of December, before finally falling a relatively mild 6 percent or so by the month\u2019s end. There were no earthshaking economic developments over that stretch of time. Yet Goldman Sachs now judges that 2022 will go down as the sixth-most-volatile year since 1929.\n\nTrying to explain stock-market moves is usually a mug\u2019s game. But there is an underlying logic to the combination of a steep decline coupled with lots of ups and downs that we\u2019ve seen this year. The decline was the result of a meaningful shift in economic fundamentals, most notably interest rates\u2014which have risen steadily all year\u2014and the prospects for corporate profit growth.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: The Federal Reserve\u2019s artificial recession\n\nAs interest rates rise, less risky assets\u2014such as U.S. Treasuries\u2014become more attractive, and riskier ones, like stocks, less so. That\u2019s especially true given that the Federal Reserve, which for years kept interest rates at historic lows, is now committed to hiking them, and keeping them high, until inflation is dead and gone. That, in turn, has significantly increased the chances that the U.S. economy will end up in a recession next year. And recessions are generally bad for corporate profits.\n\nThe companies hardest hit by this general repricing of stocks have been, not surprisingly, companies that had been trading at relatively lofty valuations, meaning that their stocks were priced as if the future was going to be irrevocably bright. That\u2019s why the tech-dominated Nasdaq index is down roughly 34 percent on the year\u2014and former highfliers such as Tesla and Amazon are down far more than that\u2014while the broader-based Dow Jones Industrial Average is down only 9 percent.\n\nDerek Thompson: Why everything in tech seems to be collapsing at once\n\nBut if fundamentals explain a lot of the market\u2019s overall drop, why all the turbulence? Well, the stock market is a kind of prediction machine, and, as Yogi Berra supposedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\u201d They\u2019re especially hard to make at the moment, when so much about what\u2019s going to happen next year is genuinely uncertain.\n\nThere are geopolitical concerns: most obviously, the war in Ukraine; and what\u2019s going to happen to China as it emerges from its zero-COVID policy. There are domestic challenges, too: Will Republicans in Congress refuse to raise the U.S. debt limit later in 2023, throwing everything into chaos? But above all is the question of how central bankers\u2019 attempts to squash inflation are going to affect the global economy, and the U.S. economy in particular.\n\nAt the moment, after all, the U.S. economy looks pretty good. Unemployment is still low, at 3.7 percent as of November. Job growth is continuing, but isn\u2019t so strong as to panic the Fed into more drastic action on interest rates. Household finances are still relatively buoyant. Companies\u2019 balance sheets are generally strong. Profit margins are falling, but they\u2019re falling from unusual highs.\n\nStill, the Fed wants inflation down, for obvious reasons: Maintaining price stability is part of its mandate, and it doesn\u2019t want high prices to feed on themselves. So investors aren\u2019t just trying to forecast whether there will be a recession. They\u2019re trying to forecast how deep that as-yet-hypothetical recession will be, what will happen to inflation, how much pain the Fed will be willing to inflict on the economy, and how all of this will affect corporate profits.\n\nJames Surowiecki: Why we hate rising prices more than we fear losing our jobs\n\nThis uncertainty represents a pretty dramatic shift from the recent years in which interest rates and inflation were reliably low, and corporate profits reliably high (so much so that even the pandemic turned out to be mostly a blip from investors\u2019 perspective). The impact of the uncertainty is magnified in the stock market because, despite the clich\u00e9 about investors having very short time horizons, the reality is that individual stock prices typically reflect how the market thinks a given company will perform for many years to come. And because small changes in the present can compound into big changes in the future, small shifts in investors\u2019 assumptions about corporate-profit growth or long-term interest rates can have a big effect on stock prices.\n\nTo look at the stock market\u2019s performance this year and conclude that we\u2019re definitely headed for a sustained economic downturn would therefore be a mistake. After all, the economist Paul Samuelson\u2019s famous 1966 saying that the stock market had predicted nine of the previous five recessions was backed up by a 2016 CNBC study, which found that in the postwar era, of 13 bear markets\u2014usually defined as a sustained period of a 20 percent market decline\u2014only seven were followed within 12 months by actual recessions.\n\nInstead, a reasonable assumption might be that there\u2019s a better-than-even chance of a recession in the next year. Beyond that, though, the market\u2019s Magic 8 Ball is saying, \u201cReply hazy, try again later.\u201d", "label": "human"}

Also, it helps to stay on top of your daily allowance, if you have set one for yourself.\n\nTip 2: Take more \u201csober days\u201d\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of your drinking habits, aim to set aside one or two days each week where you don\u2019t drink. Doing this can help you feel more in control of your consumption and can potentially improve your overall health. You may even find that you begin to prefer these alcohol-free days.\n\nTip 3: Say \u201cno\u201d\n\nSocializing often involves drinking, so it can be difficult to say \u201cno\u201d when offered a glass of alcohol. Remember, you are the only one who can make decisions on your behalf\u2014including those related to drinking. If you\u2019re offered a drink, you can politely decline and offer an alternative suggestion.\n\nTip 4: Be mindful\n\nWhen you do choose to drink, it\u2019s important to be mindful of your consumption. Slow down and drink water in between alcoholic beverages to stay hydrated and limit your intake. Also, drink slowly and consciously, and stop when you feel buzzed or have had enough.\n\nTip 5: Practice moderation\n\nModeration is key when it comes to alcohol consumption. Set limits for yourself and keep to them. As you get better at tracking your drinking habits, set goals for yourself and don\u2019t exceed them.\n\nUltimately, whatever your goals may be, taking small steps to reduce your alcohol consumption can lead to immense benefits. Taking a \u201cdry January\u201d any time of the year, or any other month, can help you gain control and improve your health.", "label": "machine"}

Morsa Images | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nWhen you're applying for your dream job, making your application stand out can be key. One way people are trying to do this is by making their resumes look like a company's website or product, or adding key style elements used by the company to their resumes. Eleonora Papini has followed this approach many times. \"It's tough to squeeze my life, experiences and skills into one, two pages, having stunning graphics can help convey my dedication and creativity much better than words would,\" she told CNBC's Make It. For a recent application to Netflix, she recreated the streaming services' home screen. The boxes that usually show movie or series titles and images instead included her details. In an application for British cosmetics company Lush, she incorporated elements like its font, and swathes of Lush's products, which the company also uses on its website. Papini also added themed sections like an \"ingredients\" list that listed her skills to her resume.\n\nTwo examples of company themed resumes, one for cosmetics company Lush and another for streaming service Netflix. Resumes provided by Eleonora Papini, pictures taken by CNBC's Make It\n\nMarketing graduate Lap Tran followed a similar approach when applying to an internship at Spotify earlier this year. He used the company's color scheme, font and replicated its layout for his resume.\n\nDo job applicants think it's worth it?\n\nAt the time, Tran thought it might be worth the additional time to stand out and make his resume more appealing to a large-scale company. But he has since changed his mind. \"Looking back at it, it was not worth the extra effort, but a good bit of experience with themed CVs, since I was not chosen or even emailed to be notified of not being chosen,\" he told CNBC's Make It. Eleonora also has not noticed a major difference after applying to various companies. \"Only one recruiter contacted me and complimented my CV,\" she said. However, she still thinks making creative resumes can be worth the time investment for some applicants. \"I think it's worth it if you like to 'play' with graphics. I like it and enjoy creating new graphics and testing new strategies,\" she explains, but she believes the approach does not suit everyone \u2014 especially if graphic design is not one of your main skills.\n\nThe verdict from experts\n\nExperts also appear to be cautious. Professional resume writer Suzie Henriques, who is based in the U.K., told CNBC's Make It that a traditional approach is usually a safer bet. \"Most of the time, the traditional text-based format is usually best,\" she said. \"The standard CV is universally intelligible and remains the gold standard during the recruitment process.\" Career coach and resume writer Amanda Augustine, who works for U.S.-based company TopResume has a similar view. \"Rather than adding design elements to mimic the employer's brand, it would be more effective to customize the content of your resume and cover letter based on the specific job listing,\" she said. Highly creative resumes could even lower your chances of securing an interview, the experts say. One reason for this is distraction, Gaelle Blake, head of permanent appointments at recruitment firm Hays says. \"Crucial details could be harder to find in a creative CV or potentially distract from your credentials,\" she told CNBC's Make It, adding that these key facts about skills and experience are the most important part of a resume for recruiters. Additionally, a lot of companies use software that reads and filters resumes. This might also cause issues, Henriques explains. \"Some organisations use candidate management software to parse the information on your CV into their system and an unusual or very visual format may not be compatible with this, which means the text you have included may end up not being readable at the other end,\" she says.\n\nWhat to do instead", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nWashington Wizards forward/center Marvin Bagley III is expected to miss six to eight weeks after being diagnosed with multiple broken fingers on his right hand, according to sources.\n\nThe injury occurred during the first quarter of the Wizards\u2019 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night. Bagley was able to finish the game but an X-ray done afterwards showed that he had sustained fractures to his index and middle fingers on his right hand.\n\nThe Wizards have not officially announced the injury but it is expected that Bagley will miss the majority of the upcoming weeks. The team has had a tough season and Bagley, who is the team\u2019s second leading scorer, will be a huge loss for them.\n\nIn addition to the fracture, the sources also said that Bagley is likely going to need surgery to fix the issue. It is unclear how long the recovery time will be after the procedure but it is likely to be around six to eight weeks.\n\nBagley\u2019s injury is a major blow to the Wizards who were already struggling with their line-up. Their roster has been decimated due to injuries, with Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal and Davis Bertans all missing significant portions of the season.\n\nWithout Bagley, the Wizards will have to rely more heavily on Rui Hachimura, Deni Avdija, Troy Brown Jr. and other young players. The team is hoping that these players will be able to step up in Bagley\u2019s absence and fill the void left by the injury.\n\nThe Wizards will also have to adjust their strategy without Bagley on the floor. He is a very talented player who can create for himself as well as teammates and can stretch the floor with his shooting. He is also a very good rebounder, something the team has lacked this season.\n\nThe Wizards will have to make do without Bagley in the lineup until he returns from injury. It will be a tall task to overcome but one that they can accomplish with the right personnel and strategy.\n\nIn the meantime, Bagley will be focusing on getting back to full health and being ready to return as soon as possible. He has already shown that he can contribute at a high level and the Wizards will be hoping that he will be able to do so when he returns.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nThe market got off to a strong start in 2021, with all three major U.S. stock indexes posting record-breaking gains. But by the end of the year, it seemed as though the euphoria had faded. Wall Street's hope for a swift economic recovery had given way to uncertainty, as the coronavirus pandemic dragged on, taking a toll on the global economy.\n\nNow, however, there's a renewed sense of optimism among analysts and investors. In particular, mega-cap tech stocks have been getting a lot of attention lately, with analysts bullish on the potential for these companies to drive market growth in 2021.\n\nThe renewed optimism is centered largely around the FAANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google - which have been among the best performing stocks over the past year. Although the stocks pulled back in the latter part of 2020, they've rallied in 2021, and some analysts expect them to continue to outperform.\n\nThe reasons for Wall Street's renewed optimism in mega-cap tech stocks are twofold. First, the companies are well-positioned to benefit from the economic recovery. As the pandemic subsides, many of the companies stand to benefit from increased consumer spending as people go out and shop again. \n\nIn addition, many of these companies are already leaders in their respective sectors, so the increased economic activity could result in even more market share for these firms. This could lead to higher profits, which could then translate into even more stock gains for investors.\n\nSecond, the companies are in a better position to weather the storm. They have large cash reserves and highly efficient operations, so they're more likely to ride out any downturns in the economy.\n\nOf course, it's too early to call a bull market in mega-cap tech stocks. Many analysts are taking a wait-and-see approach, as there's still some uncertainty surrounding the economic recovery and the potential for a resurgence in the virus.\n\nBut with the recent surge in share prices, the market sentiment certainly appears to be on the side of these stocks. So while it's still too early to make any definitive predictions, it looks like Wall Street's renewed optimism in mega-cap tech stocks is likely to continue in 2021.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Shopify, one of the world's leading e-commerce companies, has announced an unexpected decision that it's calling \"Chaos Monkey 2023.\" Starting immediately, the company will be shutting down its Slack channels and cancelling all meetings, aiming to \"shift the focus from external collaboration to internal productivity,\" according to a press release.\n\nThe change is unprecedented for a tech company of Shopify's size and comes as a surprise to many employees and industry watchers. Some are speculating that the move could be an attempt to reduce the amount of collaboration and communication taking place, allowing the company to focus on streamlining its internal processes.\n\n\"We've seen so much progress in the past few years, but it's clear that the way we work needs to evolve,\" CEO Tobi L\u00fctke said in the press release. \"At Shopify, we've always been good at working collaboratively and experimenting with new approaches to solving problems, but we need to get better at being focused and productive. That's why we've decided to make a major change to how we operate.\"\n\nChaos Monkey 2023, as the change has been dubbed, will involve shutting down the company's various Slack channels and cancelling any regularly scheduled meetings.\n\n\"This will give our teams the space to focus on the work that matters most to us: our customer experience and our product development efforts,\" said L\u00fctke.\n\nThe move is likely to be controversial, as Slack and other collaboration tools have become ubiquitous in tech companies for facilitating the exchange of ideas. But according to L\u00fctke, this isn't a move away from collaboration\u2014it's a move towards more focused collaboration.\n\n\"We think this could be the beginning of a more productive, focused, and innovative organization,\" he said.\n\nThe change has been met with both approval and concern from Shopify's employees, many of whom are worried that this could lead to siloed teams and stifle creativity. However, some have applauded the move as a much-needed shift in the way the company operates.\n\n\"I think this could be a game-changer for Shopify and the way we think about productivity,\" said one employee. \"We should be focusing on making sure our customers have the best possible experience, and that requires laser-focused collaboration and planning.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how this move will impact the company in the long run, but it's clear that Shopify is shaking things up with this bold move.

{"text": "Immigration rights groups are sounding the alarm after the Biden administration this week announced a new border policy that they say is \"eerily similar\" to former President Donald Trump's hardline immigration measures.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Wednesday that it would reinstate a policy requiring non-Mexican asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their U.S. immigration cases proceed. Trump implemented a version of the policy in late 2018, but it was declared illegal by a federal judge and suspended by the Biden administration in late January.\n\nBut now, the administration has reversed course and will move forward with the same policy under a new name, the Department of Homeland Security announced. They are calling it \"The Migration Protection Protocols\" (MPP).\n\nImmigrant rights groups, however, are up in arms over the decision, arguing that the policy will effectively block asylum seekers from accessing the U.S. and is essentially just a continuation of Trump's policies.\n\n\"The Administration is recycling policies from the Trump Playbook, abandoning their campaign promises of restoring and strengthening our nation's commitment to legal immigration and human rights,\" Melissa Turcios, a spokesperson for the Immigrant Defense Project, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nDHS said the policy is designed to help manage the influx of asylum seekers and prevent the \"misuse\" of the asylum system. It is estimated that more than 70,000 migrants are currently waiting in Mexico for their U.S. immigration court dates.\n\nThe Trump administration defended its use of the program by saying it would help alleviate the strain on the U.S. asylum system, which has been overwhelmed by a surge of migrants from Central America in recent years.\n\nBut immigrant rights advocates have argued the policy only serves to punish those fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries, while allowing the government to duck responsibility for its own policy failures.\n\n\"The truth is this policy will continue the Trump administration's legacy of denying access to the asylum system for vulnerable migrants, including children and families who have fled violence and persecution,\" Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe policy also raises concerns about the safety of asylum seekers, given the risk of violence in some of the Mexican cities they are being sent to.\n\n\"This policy is wrong, it's inhumane, and it flies in the face of basic human rights,\" Hincapie said.\n\nImmigrant rights groups are now calling on the Biden administration to reverse course on its decision and restore more humane asylum policies. They argue that the U.S. should be doing more to ensure the safety of asylum seekers, not less.\n\n\"The Administration must quickly move away from these wrongheaded policies, which are an affront to human rights, justice and decency,\" Turcios said.\n\nThe Biden administration has yet to respond to the outcry from immigrant rights groups. But with the new policy set to take effect within weeks, the pressure is sure to mount on the White House to reverse course.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nWith the new year kicking off and a new presidential administration in office, there is a lot of uncertainty about how the federal and state laws will be affected. As a result, it\u2019s important to stay on top of all the new laws that have been enacted in 2023. Here\u2019s what you should know.\n\nNew Federal Laws\n\nAt the federal level, there are a number of new laws that have been passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden. These laws cover a wide range of topics, from taxes to the environment. Here\u2019s a brief overview of what you need to know.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2021 (TCJA) made several changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including provisions related to individual, business, and estate taxes. The TCJA also made it easier for people to pay off student loans by allowing them to deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest on their tax returns. Additionally, the Act created a new type of tax-favored retirement account for those with long-term savings goals, such as saving for retirement.\n\nThe Green New Deal, which was introduced in Congress in February of 2021, is an ambitious plan to combat climate change. The plan calls for massive investments in clean energy technology, infrastructure, and jobs in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan was a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package that was signed into law in March of 2021. The bill included direct payments to individuals, relief for businesses, and funding for state and local governments. Additionally, the bill included funding for vaccine distribution and public health measures, relief for students and borrowers, and expanded unemployment benefits.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) was signed into law in April of 2020 and extended through the end of 2021. The Act requires employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide paid sick and family leave if they are affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Act also established a temporary expansion of unemployment insurance benefits and provided funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nThe Equality Act, which was passed by Congress in February of 2021, is designed to extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ individuals. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, education, and other areas of federal law.\n\nNew State Laws\n\nAt the state level, lawmakers have been busy passing a variety of new laws to address issues such as criminal justice reform, education, and health care. Here\u2019s a brief overview of what you need to know.\n\nCriminal Justice Reform\n\nIn response to protests over police brutality and systemic racism in the criminal justice system, several states have enacted laws that seek to reform the system. These laws include measures to curb the use of cash bail, increase transparency and accountability in policing, and limit the use of certain forms of lethal force by law enforcement officers.\n\nEducation\n\nLawmakers in several states have passed laws to increase access to higher education and expand educational opportunities for underserved populations. These laws provide tuition assistance for low-income students, make college more affordable, and expand access to career and technical education.\n\nHealth Care\n\nAt the state level, several laws have been passed to expand access to health care, especially for the most vulnerable populations. These laws include measures to expand Medicaid coverage, create prescription drug affordability programs, and provide mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs you can see, a number of new federal and state laws have been enacted in 2023. It\u2019s important to stay informed about these laws and how they might affect you, so you can make sure you are in compliance with them.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The New York Giants have clinched a playoff berth with a Week 16 38-10 win over the Indianapolis Colts, and it was a wild ride for Big Blue in the Hoosier State.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones had one of his finest performances of the year, throwing for four touchdown passes, running for two more and even catching a pass for a score. He looked more confident and comfortable in the pocket than at any other point of the season and kept the Colts' defense guessing all night.\n\nThe Giants' defense also had an impressive night, as they held the Colts to just 10 points and only 213 total yards. It was the fourth time this season that the Giants have held an opponent to under 20 points, and the first time since Week 1 against Washington.\n\nThe victory also marks the fourth time this year that New York has had a double-digit win margin and the first since Week 12 against the Bengals. The Giants are now 8-7 and in sole possession of the NFC East lead, with the Washington Football Team and Dallas Cowboys both falling on Sunday.\n\nThe Giants have now won five of their last seven games, but there are still plenty of areas where they can improve. Here are the key takeaways from the win over the Colts:\n\n1. Daniel Jones is getting better: Jones had arguably his best performance of the season, completing 25 of his 32 passes for 342 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for two scores and even caught a touchdown pass. His overall confidence in the pocket was on full display against the Colts and if he continues to improve, the Giants could be a dangerous team to face in the playoffs.\n\n2. Saquon Barkley is back: After missing four straight games due to injury, Barkley made his return to the field against the Colts and looked like his former self. He ran for 46 yards on 11 carries and added two receptions for 13 yards and a touchdown. The Giants need Barkley at full strength in the postseason and the performance against the Colts was a good sign for Big Blue.\n\n3. The defense looks solid: The defense was the highlight of the night for the Giants, as they held the Colts to just 213 total yards and one touchdown. The pass rush was relentless, as the Giants sacked Colts quarterback Philip Rivers three times and got consistent pressure all night. The secondary was also impressive, as it was able to limit Rivers to just 129 passing yards.\n\n4. Special teams need to be better: The Giants had some issues with their special teams against the Colts, as they allowed a 68-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and muffed a punt. These are issues that will need to be corrected if the Giants are to have any success in the postseason.\n\n5. The NFC East is still wide open: While the Giants have now clinched a playoff berth, the NFC East is still up for grabs. The Giants are in the lead, but the Washington Football Team and the Cowboys are just one game back. The Giants will need to continue to play their best football if they are to hold off their division rivals and secure the division crown.\n\nThe Giants now have one more regular season game left before the playoffs, and they will be looking to continue the momentum they built against the Colts. A win over the Cowboys next week will secure the NFC East title, and give Big Blue some much needed momentum heading into the playoffs.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It was a day the NFL would like to forget. On a Sunday morning during Week 4 of the 2023 NFL season, a shocking accident in the divisional playoff game between the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots brought a solemn reminder of the brutality of the sport.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, Broncos quarterback Steve Cunningham was running a play-action pass in the red zone. With a wide open receiver, he fired a rocket right over the defensive back\u2019s shoulder \u2013 but it was too late. New England safety Russell Thompson had closed the gap in an instant and met Cunningham in midair. Both men collided with catastrophic force and Cunningham, who was considered a rising star and one of the league\u2019s most promising young quarterbacks, was seriously injured.\n\nThe full extent of Cunningham\u2019s injury was not immediately known, but the gravity of the situation was clear. Players from both teams were visibly shaken, and the Patriots sideline went silent as medical personnel rushed to attend to the fallen quarterback. The game was immediately stopped and a solemn announcement made: Cunningham had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and was taken to a nearby medical center for treatment.\n\nThe news reverberated through the NFL and beyond. While it was a reminder of the dangers of the game, it was also an ominous sign for the Broncos and their playoff run. With Cunningham sidelined for an indefinite period, the team was forced to turn to backup quarterback David Claiborne who had seen only limited action during the regular season.\n\nFollowing the game, a statement was released by Cunningham\u2019s agent, who asked for privacy and understanding as they waited for more information. The Broncos organization also released a statement, expressing their profound sorrow and reiterating that player safety was their utmost priority.\n\nThe sports world was in shock as the days passed and the tragedy unfolded. Yet in the midst of this sorrow and despair, an unlikely hero emerged. As news of Cunningham\u2019s injury spread, fans from all across the nation \u2013 and even some from abroad \u2013 began to rally behind him. An online petition demanding better safety standards in the NFL amassed over one million signatures, and a social media campaign raising money for Cunningham\u2019s medical bills gained massive traction.\n\nThe response to Cunningham\u2019s injury was a powerful reminder of the significance of the sport and of the player\u2019s courage and determination in the face of adversity. While the road to recovery may be long, the public\u2019s support has been immense, and the lessons of this tragedy may just help to ensure that future players do not suffer similar fates.", "label": "machine"}

In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number.\n\nBut just five African countries participated in this year\u2019s Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nEuropean and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.\n\nBut climate isn\u2019t the only factor affecting Olympic participation \u2013 when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations.\n\nAt PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway \u2013 one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million \u2013 topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it \u201caims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone.\u201d\n\nIt allocates a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help \u201cathletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need.\u201d\n\nSome 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to \u201csupport qualification efforts,\u201d according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships.\n\nOnly NOCs \u201cwhose athletes had a proven winter sports track record\u201d had access to the program, the IOC said.\n\nMeanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.\n\nAthletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000.\n\nScholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds \u2013 derived from Olympic revenue \u2013 towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.\n\nCNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding.\n\nRacial diversity not reflected\n\nOn a national level, the composition of delegations often isn\u2019t very racially diverse.\n\n\u201cThere have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don\u2019t know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries,\u201d Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport.\n\nBlack athletes have proven crucial to Team USA\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.\n\nBut even as Black athletes won medals at Beijing \u2013 speedskater Erin Jackson brought home gold, while bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor became the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history \u2013 White athletes still made up the majority of Team USA at the Games this year.\n\nPrior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.\n\nIn 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA\u2019s first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies\u2019 figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002.\n\nHockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US.\n\nFour years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy.\n\nOverall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level.

Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women\u2019s hockey player in US team history.\n\nPay to play economics\n\nExperts say that economics \u2013 not just talent \u2013 plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThat notion of economics is very key because we\u2019re looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating \u2013 and that equipment alone costs so much,\u201d Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.\n\n\u201cPay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money,\u201d Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN.\n\n\u201cIt becomes not just a racialized issue, it\u2019s a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody\u2019s going to be a working-class hero,\u201d she said.\n\nWith stories of parents remortgaging their homes, working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children\u2019s Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.\n\nGhana\u2019s first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.\n\n\u201cThis does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay,\u201d he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season.\n\nJamaica\u2019s first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: \u201cI\u2019m competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes\u2019 rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable.\n\nThe athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.\n\nShiva Keshavan, a six-time Olympian and India\u2019s only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.\n\n\u201cAthletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don\u2019t have the systems in place that enable a successful career.\n\n\u201cOften, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach,\u201d he added.\n\nMany elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they\u2019re growing up.\n\nBode Miller \u2013 the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals \u2013 attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia.\u201d\n\nParents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has \u201cearned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries.\u201d\n\nPrivately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.\n\nThe study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.\n\n\u201cIf your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski,\u201d Alexander told CNN.\n\n\u201cIf we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don\u2019t have as much disposable income as their White counterparts,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nAdding that he doesn\u2019t think\u201d winter sports are racist at all,\u201d Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports.\n\n\u201cI just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology \u2026 then I believe the tide will turn.\u201d\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it \u201cfully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cSome sports in all reality are more accessible,\u201d James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you\u2019ve got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there\u2019s factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not something that us at the IOC are going to change.\n\n\u201cAll sports have different levels of access,\u201d Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport \u201ctries to look at.\u201d\n\nThe IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations \u201cto ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports\u2019 structures and priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport,\u201d it added.\n\nInfrastructure challenges\n\nWinter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia \u2013 notably in Japan, South Korea and China. But it remains an \u201cunexplored market\u201d in India, Keshavan said.\n\n\u201cFor India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities,\u201d he said.\n\nThis year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India\u2019s nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.\n\nKhan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport.\n\nShiva Keshavan of India reacts following run 3 during the Luge Men's Singles on day two of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOf course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSkiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training,\u201d he added.\n\nAthletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come.\n\nFrimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don\u2019t necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I\u2019ll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in,\u201d Macleod told CNN adding: \u201cThat\u2019s within the remit of the national government.\u201d\n\n\u201cOften, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure,\u201d Macleod said.\n\n\u201cWe as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa \u2013 that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cEach of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, \u2018Actually, we\u2019re not going to invest in winter sports because that\u2019s not a priority for us.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.\u2019 And they will always have to make that choice of where they\u2019re going to put their funding and what programs from our side they\u2019re going to apply for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe put at the disposal of our stakeholders \u2013 whether it\u2019s NOCs or the IFs (international federations) \u2013 a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities,\u201d he said.\n\nRepresentation matters\n\nCarter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations\u2019 final offerings.\n\n\u201cFor many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself,\u201d she added.\n\nIn winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do,\u201d she added.\n\nSome sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said.\n\n\u201cBut the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility \u2013 and have the bobsled \u2013 is very limited in general,\u201d she added.\n\nAhmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.\n\n\u201cWe see a general trend in \u2026 Summer Games \u2013 you\u2019ve got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You\u2019ve got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes,\u201d Ahmed added.\n\nDitching continental quotas a step backwards for inclusion\n\nFrimpong and Nigeria\u2019s Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation\u2019s (IBSF) continental quota system.\n\nBut the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games \u2013 something coaches had warned would deliver a \u201ccrushing blow\u201d to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.\n\nCoaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that \u201cinequitable quotas that didn\u2019t take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.\n\n\u201cThe dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAkwasi Frimpong of Ghana starts his men's skeleton training session at the Olympic Sliding Centre, during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 12, 2018.

Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAn exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible,\u201d they added in the email.\n\nThe quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing \u2013 a decision which directly affected Frimpong.\n\n\u201cGiving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system,\u201d an IOC representative told Frimpong\u2019s coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN.\n\n\u201cI qualified as Ghana\u2019s first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa,\u201d Frimpong told CNN.\n\nFrimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.\n\n\u201cNow, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games \u2013 to be able to qualify outright,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nOn December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics.\n\nFrimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant \u201cI could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good \u2013 maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever \u2013 but I\u2019m good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners.\u201d\n\nFrimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports \u201cfor qualified African athletes who can safely compete.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we\u2019re not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card.\n\n\u201cBut if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there\u2019s enough African athletes,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.\n\n\u201cTo address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\nNo athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal.\n\n\u201cWe were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it\u2019s less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it\u2019s disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority,\u201d Frimpong added.\n\nBut there is hope \u2013 even if only for a select few athletes.\n\nAmerican bobsledder Meyers Taylor\u2019s bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis\u2019 four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.\n\nWhen asked about passing Davis\u2019 record saying, she said: \u201cThat is overwhelming. It\u2019s so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I\u2019m part of a legacy that\u2019s bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be.\n\n\u201cSo, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the IOC\u2019s most recent individual Olympic Solidarity scholarship data.", "label": "human"}

In an unexpected turn of events, a judge revoked his $1 million bail on Monday and he was immediately taken into custody.\n\nThe next day, his body was found in an apparent suicide in a luxury apartment in Manhattan.\n\nThe tragic and shocking incident has sent shockwaves through the business and medical communities, with friends and colleagues expressing shock and disbelief at the turn of events.\n\nThe Wiley case had been receiving national attention in recent months after it emerged that Mackenzie had been charged with murdering his son, who was 15 at the time.\n\nAccording to reports, Mackenzie had been an abusive parent who had subjected his son to abuse and neglect. It was alleged that he had committed the murder in order to stop his son from reporting him to authorities.\n\nThe case had become increasingly high-profile in recent months, particularly when the New York Supreme Court overturned the conviction and allowed Mackenzie to be released on bail.\n\nMany observers felt that this was the wrong decision and that Mackenzie should have remained in custody given the severity of the crime he had allegedly committed.\n\nThe case had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among those who believed Mackenzie was innocent and were calling for his release.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court reversed their decision on Monday and Mackenzie was immediately taken into custody.\n\nUnfortunately, the reversal of Mackenzie\u2019s fortune did not last long and his body was discovered the following day.\n\nFriends and colleagues have expressed shock and sadness at his death, with some questioning whether justice had been served.\n\nMackenzie\u2019s attorneys had argued that he was a good father who had been falsely accused and that he had been suffering from mental health issues, which they said should have been taken into consideration by the courts.\n\nThe case has highlighted the need for increased support for those struggling with mental health issues and has reignited the debate on the US justice system\u2019s handling of cases involving those with mental health conditions.\n\nIt is a tragedy that Mackenzie Wiley\u2019s story has come to such a terrible end, with his family and friends left grieving his death and struggling to make sense of it all.\n\nHis death has also left many wondering what might have been had the court taken his mental health issues into consideration, rather than revoking his bail and sending him back to prison.\n\nNo matter the outcome, the Wiley family will be forever haunted by the death of their son and the life of Mackenzie that ended in such a tragic way.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".\n\nIt\u2019s been a decade since China started pushing its \u201cmarket economy\u201d reforms, but China\u2019s stocks have yet to catch up with its economic transformation. Now, however, Morgan Stanley is turning bullish on China stocks, saying that the nation\u2019s economic recovery and policy reforms offer \u201csignificant upside potential.\u201d\n\nChina stocks have lagged behind the country\u2019s economic growth over the past 10 years, even as GDP has grown by more than 80%. During the same period, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index is up just 5%.\n\nThat\u2019s because investors have been wary of the lack of transparency in China\u2019s stock market and concerns over corporate governance. But with the new wave of reforms from the Communist Party, as well as a more liberal stance on foreign investment, Morgan Stanley is now taking a more positive view on the outlook for China stocks.\n\nIn a note to clients this week, the investment bank said: \u201cInvestors should take note of the recent package of reforms that the Communist Party has implemented, as well as its commitment to further liberalize foreign ownership. This has laid the groundwork for a more dynamic and vibrant capital market that could eventually rival those of more mature markets such as the U.S.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley is also optimistic on the outlook for the Chinese economy. It said that despite the impact of the pandemic, \u201cit appears that the country is already through the worst and well on its way to achieving a robust economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe bank also believes that the government\u2019s efforts to promote \u201csupply-side structural reforms\u201d will help to boost economic growth in the long-term. It pointed to the wide array of measures taken to encourage investment and develop \u201cnew economy\u201d industries.\n\nMorgan Stanley has recommended two Chinese stocks in particular as having \u201csignificant upside potential.\u201d The first is China Mobile, the largest telecoms firm in the world. The bank sees \u201csignificant room for growth\u201d in the company\u2019s digital transformation initiatives, which will help it to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change.\n\nThe second stock is Bank of China, which Morgan Stanley believes is well-positioned to benefit from increased credit demand and favorable policy initiatives. The bank is also optimistic about the company\u2019s digital push, which it believes will help to boost earnings.\n\nOverall, Morgan Stanley sees the potential for a \u201cmajor re-rating\u201d of China stocks in the next couple of years, as investors start to recognize the nation\u2019s economic potential and the reforms that are now being implemented. \n\nIt\u2019s a significant turnaround in sentiment, and one that could unlock a wave of investment in Chinese stocks. With the potential for further liberalization of foreign investment, as well as the reforms being implemented by the government, the outlook for Chinese stocks is looking increasingly positive. \n\nOnly time will tell if investors are ready to make the leap of faith and put their money into the Chinese market. But if Morgan Stanley\u2019s bullish outlook is right, then China stocks could be one of the best investments of the decade.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "I don\u2019t seek the spotlight. I think many school leaders can relate to that sentiment. We don\u2019t go into education for the fame and glory; we choose this path for the kids. Plain and simple. And we all go into this career with the knowledge that it takes a village to raise one child, let alone a whole school of students.\n\nDespite my discomfort with the spotlight, I received a recent honor: I am the Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) Principal of the Year.\n\nWhat do I plan to do with this recognition? I plan to share the rules I have followed to navigate this role. Spoiler alert: The rules are for a team sport. A principal\u2019s job is not a solo one. Together, our vision is to ensure students thrive academically while also providing memorable experiences beyond the classroom. As the school leader, I simply stand at the helm, and work with an exceptional staff to see students live up to our name and excel.\n\nHere\u2019s how we do it.\n\nFollow the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you want to be treated.The campus culture needs to, first and foremost, be respectful. With respect comes communication, productivity, and organization. Expectations are known, and resources are allotted to meet goals. We tell each other what we need, and this is why my staff stays: Our teacher retention rate is above 89%. It\u2019s why our campus was ranked the #3 charter elementary school in Illinois in the 2021-22 rankings by U.S. News & World Report. I respect my staff\u2019s needs, and they do the same for me. This culture of mutual respect extends to our families, and makes our campus feel like a community where voices are heard and action is taken.\n\nListen to the moral of \u201cThe Tortoise and The Hare.\u201dI believe that a slow and steady approach does win the race. I\u2019ve been a principal for 13 years, a unique accomplishment. It shouldn\u2019t be. This tenure should be the norm, but this role is often a revolving door. Leadership is about providing structure and consistency, while ensuring expectations are high and the environment is nurturing. Leadership isn\u2019t about me. Leadership is about building trust and understanding we are in this together. It\u2019s about setting up others for success, whether that\u2019s the first-year teacher, the veteran receptionist, or the eighth-grader who herself dreams of being a school principal one day. It\u2019s not an overnight job. It takes time and patience. It takes virtues of the tortoise.\n\nRemind yourself that the future of kids should not be dictated by their ZIP code. All kids deserve the chance to have an excellent education. Period. I choose to be at LEARN because we invest in areas others have given up on. Our network educates over 4,000 students, 89% of whom are African American or Hispanic and 76% of whom are low-income. Our kids \u2014 all kids \u2014 deserve high-quality and supportive educational experiences. Growing up, I saw the inequities in education and society, and I wanted to make things better. Education was a good starting point. I had adults around me who made sure I succeeded, did not fall prey to the pitfalls kids have to navigate in today\u2019s society, and allowed me to pursue this career of public service. I was fortunate. If I can be that person for our students \u2014 the person who helps students achieve their dreams and contribute to the betterment of society \u2014 then this job is what I was put on this earth to do.\n\nBeing a principal is a team sport. Maybe I\u2019ve technically scored the goals, but I wouldn\u2019t have been able to without the assists from the all-stars.\n\nOur network has given me guidance and growth opportunities. Our board has given my school the financial means for student success. Our talent team ensures I have dedicated and driven teachers. Our student recruitment team grows our community of kids and families. My assistant principals and leadership team provide wraparound support to our students and staff.\n\nWithout these essential workers (literally), I would not be in the shape I am to be in this role to make sure all kids, regardless of circumstances, are given the best chance at an excellent education. Together, we give students from communities that have been marginalized for over 400 years the foundation and ambition to earn a college degree.\n\nSekou Robertson is the principal of LEARN Excel.

{"text": "Tua Tagovailoa not part of Dolphins game plan as they prepare for Jets with playoff berth at stake\n\nThe Miami Dolphins haven't ruled Tua Tagovailoa out for Sunday. But they're planning to play without him.\n\nHead coach Mike McDaniel told reporters on Monday that the Dolphins were preparing for their Week 18 matchup against the New York Jets without Tagovailoa in the game plan. Barring a status change, either Teddy Bridgewater or Skylar Thompson will start at quarterback with a playoff berth at stake.\n\n\"For me I'm preparing for both Skylar and Teddy,\" McDaniel said. \"I think it's too soon to know anything about Teddy.\n\n\"With Tua, I haven't even thought about playing status\"\n\nTagovailoa entered concussion protocol last Monday after sustaining the injury in Week 16 against the Green Bay Packers. The head injury was his third of the season. His previous concussion left him hospitalized following a blow to the head in Week 4 against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nTua Tagovailoa is not expected to play on Sunday (Jasen Vinlove/Reuters)\n\nHis backup Bridgewater started and injured the pinkie on his throwing hand in Sunday's loss to the New England Patriots. McDaniel told reporters on Monday that Bridgewater dislocated the pinkie but did not break it. They'll know more about his status as swelling subsides later this week.\n\nIf Bridgewater can't go, the Dolphins will rely on Thompson, a seventh-round rookie who's made five appearances including one start this season. The Dolphins can clinch a playoff berth on Sunday with a win against the Jets and a Patriots loss to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nShould Tua play if the Dolphins advance?\n\nTagovailoa's status has been the subject of intense scrutiny after repeated head injuries left him in the hospital. After his latest concussion, some former players have called for the Dolphins to shut him down for the season regardless of whether he clears protocol out of concern for his longterm health.\n\nIf the Dolphins were to win on Sunday and advance to the postseason, they'll face another decision at quarterback for a playoff game. McDaniel told reporters on Monday that \"no timeline has been discussed\" regarding Tagovailoa's return.\n\nTagovailoa broke out this season, his third in the NFL since the Dolphins selected him in the first round of the 2020 draft. He drew early MVP buzz as a Dolphins passing game featuring Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle proved to be one of the NFL's most explosive.\n\nAn 8-3 start had the Dolphins poised for their first playoff berth since 2016.

{"text": ".\n\nAmericans\u2019 reliance on credit cards is deepening, even as a new Federal Reserve rate increase looms.\n\nIn its third quarter 2020 survey, Experian\u2014one of the three national credit bureaus\u2014found that total credit card debt had risen for the seventh consecutive quarter. \n\nThe national total stood at $830 billion as of the end of September, a 2.2% increase since the second quarter of 2020 and an 8% increase over the same period last year.\n\nA separate analysis of the Fed\u2019s monthly consumer credit report, compiled by LendingTree, found that total credit card debt rose 8.3% year-over-year in August\u2014the latest month for which data is available\u2014to a seasonally-adjusted $1.02 trillion. \n\nIt\u2019s the highest level of credit card debt in nearly two decades, since the dot-com boom in 2001.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed has made it clear that it plans to continue its long-term pattern of rate hikes in the coming months, after it hiked the federal funds rate by a quarter-point to a range of 1.25-1.5% in December. \n\nIt\u2019s the fourth rate increase since December 2015, when the Fed began its first post-recession rate increase cycle.\n\nThe rate hike would mean a 0.25% interest rate increase on credit card accounts\u2014a small change, but one that could amount to more than $1 billion in additional interest paid annually by credit card users, if all holders of credit card debt were to remain at the same levels.\n\nThat would, in turn, make it more difficult for Americans already struggling with debt to dig out of their financial holes, pushing them further and further into long-term debt.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the trend? \n\nThe experian survey found that across all income brackets, higher levels of unemployment and income uncertainty were associated with higher levels of credit card debt. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that consumers are still struggling to find their financial footing,\u201d said Rod Griffin, Experian\u2019s director of public education. \u201cWe saw an uptick in credit card debt among consumers making less than $25,000 a year. This was likely driven by increased spending to meet daily needs due to the pandemic.\u201d\n\nData from the Experian survey also suggests that consumers are using credit cards more than ever to pay for everyday expenses like groceries and utilities, as well as more discretionary purchases like restaurant meals and travel.\n\nThe trend extends to younger age groups, too. Experian found that Millennials and Gen-Zers now make up 47% of all credit card debt\u2014the highest percentage in the survey\u2019s history.\n\nMeanwhile, the LendingTree analysis found that the average credit card balance for consumers under the age of 35 has risen steadily since the end of 2018, rising from $3,554 in December 2018 to $4,042 in August 2020.\n\nThough the trend is concerning, Griffin says it\u2019s important for consumers to remember that their credit card debt is manageable\u2014as long as they\u2019re willing to make changes.\n\n\u201cStart by assessing your situation: What can you pay off? Where can you cut back? If you decide you can make more payments, focus on paying off the card with the highest interest rate first,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re looking for options to help manage your payments, consider working with a credit counseling service to help you navigate the process.\u201d\n\nHe also advised consumers to take advantage of any financial assistance available, including relief options from credit card companies for those affected by the pandemic, and government programs designed to help those struggling with payments.\n\nThat\u2019s important, since although the Fed\u2019s rate hikes are relatively small, the extra cost can quickly add up for those already in debt. \n\nIt\u2019s likely to become increasingly important for consumers to take advantage of such programs and options as the Federal Reserve moves forward with its plans to continue to raise rates in 2021. \n\nIf Americans hope to keep their debt at bay, it could become essential.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A new version of omicron has taken hold in the U.S., according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The subvariant of omicron, named XBB.1.5, has raised concerns about another potential wave of Covid cases following the busy holiday travel season.\n\nThe CDC projected Friday that about 40% of confirmed U.S. Covid cases are caused by the XBB.1.5 strain, up from 20% a week ago. In the Northeast, about 75% of confirmed cases are reported to be XBB.1.5.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet where this version of omicron came from, but it appears to be spreading quickly here. There\u2019s no indication it causes more severe illness than any other omicron virus, Dr. Barbara Mahon, director of CDC\u2019s Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division, told NBC News.\n\nWhile overall Covid hospitalizations are rising around the country, areas such as the Northeast that have seen high levels of the new variant have not experienced a disproportionate increase in hospitalizations, Mahon said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing hospitalizations have been notching up overall across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t appear to be notching up more in the areas that have more XBB.1.5.\u201d\n\nThe seven-day average of daily Covid hospitalizations reached 42,140 on Friday, an increase of 4.2% from two weeks previously, according to an NBC News tally. The seven-day average of daily intensive care unit admissions has also risen to 5,125 per day, an increase of more than 9% from two weeks ago.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that\u2019s still unknown about the latest subvariant, including whether it\u2019s more contagious than other forms of omicron, Mahon said.\n\nOther scientists worry that XB.1.5 is even better at getting around the antibodies we\u2019ve built up from Covid vaccines and previous infection from the many different types of omicron that have spread since last December, including the original BA.1 and the more recent BQ.1.1 and BQ.1 subvariants.\n\nThe XBB.1.5 is a relative of the omicron XBB variant, which is a recombinant of the omicron BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75 subvariants.\n\nCombined, XBB and XBB.1.5 make up 44% of cases in the U.S., crowding out other versions of omicron.\n\nXBB has been found in at least 70 countries, according to the World Health Organization, and has caused surges of infection in some parts of Asia, including India and Singapore, in October.\n\nStudies performed in the lab have found that XBB is capable of evading antibodies from previous Covid infections or vaccinations, meaning that being exposed to the virus would mean someone is more likely to get sick or reinfected and show symptoms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s immune evasive properties of XBB,\u201d said Dr. Isaach Bogoch, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. \u201cThat\u2019s been demonstrated both in laboratory studies and seen clinically in cases and hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nGiven the high level of population immunity in the U.S. \u2014 either through infection, vaccination or both \u2014 Bogoch and others hope that, even if cases start to rise significantly, there won\u2019t be a dramatic spike in hospitalizations or deaths as seen in previous waves.\n\nAntibody studies don\u2019t tell the whole story. Other parts of the immune system can protect against the virus and the Covid vaccines should remain effective at preventing severe illness and death from the virus, evidence suggests.\n\n\u201cWe might certainly have a wave, but it\u2019s just much less likely to be as deadly or overwhelming to a health care system compared to earlier waves before we had this degree of hybrid immunity,\u201d said Bogoch.\n\nDo Covid vaccines work against XBB.1.5?\n\nFor encouraging signs, Rick Bright, an American immunologist and former director of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, pointed to Singapore\u2019s experience with XBB.\n\nThere was a surge of cases, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t see the corresponding major surges in hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d Bright said.\n\n\u201cWe think it is because a larger population of people in Singapore have been vaccinated with latest vaccines and boosters,\" he said.\n\nThat could be a problem in the U.S., unfortunately.\n\nPeople age 65 and older are the most vulnerable to any form of the Covid virus. Yet, only 37.5% of that age group has received the updated omicron booster, according to the most recent CDC data.\n\nThe most important thing experts agree is to get a booster shot with the bivalent vaccines to bolster your immune system against the newer subvariants.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t in 2020, but people still do need to take this seriously and protect themselves,\u201d said Mahon, adding that getting the updated Covid vaccine is especially important for those over the age of 65, a high-risk group that has seen pretty low booster uptake recently.\n\nA study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the new Covid boosters from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech bolstered antibody responses to many subvariants of Omicron, including the XBB variant.\n\nWhile the new booster \u2014 called a bivalent because it targets the omicron strains BA.4 and BA.5 as well as the original coronavirus \u2014 is not perfect, it offers additional protection to that what was seen in the original or monovalent boosters previously available, said Mehul Suthar, an associate professor at the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University and author of the report.\n\n\u201cWith the monovalent boosters your neutralizing antibodies are just not that potent against the variants, but the bivalent booster ensures it\u2019s slightly better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not knock your socks off amazing, but it\u2019s better, which says the bivalent boosters are working the way they should.\u201d\n\nThe new XBB.1.5 variant was not studied in the report, but Suthar predicts its immune evasive properties to be in a similar range as XBB. He expects the bivalent booster will bolster protection against the latest version as well.", "label": "human"}

Check out the trailer here:\n\nOverwatch 2 / Activision Blizzard\n\n\n\nWe mostly have the sights and sounds of the trailer to go by for specifics, but from what we can see, familiar heroes like Widowmaker, Roadhog, Reinhardt, Pharah, Ramattra, and Lucio will be getting some new abilities, much of which will likely help with the free-for-all mode. Lucio delivers a shot that stuns Reinhardt; Pharah appears to have a kind of healing ability; and many heroes have flashy, new visual effects, like Junker Queen\u2019s lightning bolts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trailer also promises some \u201cDivine Rewards\u201d for players who participate in the event. It\u2019s not clear what those will include for now, but based on the video description, the hero who nets the most eliminations by the end of the event will get a statue dedicated to them in the Greek mythos themed map, Ilios.\n\nKotaku has reached out to Blizzard for more information on new hero abilities and divine rewards, but did not hear back prior to publication.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Print this story\n\nTHE PLANET\u02bcS DENSEST EMBODIMENT of international cooperation lies in the heart of Geneva, in the few square miles around the lake. From the lakeshore, a brief walk through a park will bring a visitor to the Palace of Nations, built in the 1930s as the seat of the League of Nations, and now the United Nations\u2019 office in the city. To the east, the World Trade Organization; to the north-west, the World Health Organization; an amble away, the headquarters of the Red Cross, the International Labour Organization, the International Telecommunications Union, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, among dozens of others. Also nearby is the InterContinental Hotel, where in November 2013, Iran agreed to dilute its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief\u2014the first edition of the pact that President Donald Trump abandoned last year.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely fitting that just down the road from the InterContinental is the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, which occupies a complex named Maison de la Paix, its six buildings arranged like strewn flower petals. The InterContinental is of particular interest to Thomas Biersteker, a political scientist at the Institute, who has made a career studying sanctions. Biersteker, an American who taught at Brown University until 2007, is prone to discussing the antics of nation-states in a tone of wry curiosity, as if relaying the activities of ant colonies in his backyard. He lives for part of the year in a house in the Swiss Alps, where he hosts so many discussions on his preferred topic that his colleagues call it the \u201cSanctions Chalet.\u201d Typically, Biersteker\u2019s case studies deal with bad actors: states gone rogue, dangerous leaders thumbing their noses at the world. Increasingly, though, these descriptions seem to fit not just autocracies flush with oil or tinpot dictatorships but also the United States of America.\n\nUnder Trump, America is in the business of actively creating or deepening threats to the world: capsizing the climate; pardoning U.S. soldiers and military contractors convicted of war crimes; supplying arms to Saudi Arabia, so that the kingdom can bombard Yemen. For a while, it looked as if Trump might attack North Korea; it\u2019s still possible that he will start a war with Iran. In recently leaked memos, Kim Darroch, the former British ambassador to the U.S., worried that Trump would wreck world trade. Along the way, his administration has trashed so many diplomatic rules and norms that the entire edifice of postwar multilateralism is at risk. ( 1 ) A low point was Mike Pompeo\u2019s speech last December in Brussels, when he attacked the European Union, the UN, and every other kind of multilateralism that the U.S. once championed. \u201cThere was a stunned silence after the speech,\u201d said Anthony Gardner, a former American ambassador to the EU, \u201cand then he left right away without taking questions.\u201d Two years ago, Mary Robinson, a former UN special envoy on climate change, called the U.S. \u201ca rogue state\u201d for quitting the Paris accord. It\u2019s common now for foreign policy professionals from America\u2019s traditional allies to murmur brokenly about the \u201crules-based order,\u201d as if they were standing at the bedside of a dear, dying friend.\n\nEveryone on the front lines of foreign policy has stories to tell of chaos and breakdown. In one minor but telling exemplar of the genre, UN officials were shocked last summer when the U.S. abruptly decided to stop contributing $300 million\u2014less than 0.6 percent of its foreign aid spend\u2014to the Relief and Works Agency\u2019s budget for Palestinian refugees. The agency began its work in 1949, to assist Palestinians who\u2019d newly been rendered homeless; with successive generations, its beneficiaries have swelled to around 5.4 million, many of whom still live in or near refugee camps. \u201cThe U.S never had a problem with that number, until last year,\u201d one UN official told me. \u201cThen they made the argument that the funding should be pegged to the original number of some 800,000 refugees.\u201d The U.S. refused to budge, despite multiple meetings, including one in mid-August that lasted 15 hours\u2014so long that, after the building\u2019s cafes shut at 5:30 p.m., delegates had to leave the premises altogether to find food. These gatherings rarely conclude without some sort of consensus, or at least some ambiguous language to project unanimity, the official said. But in this case, even that wasn\u2019t an option; America\u2019s dissent had to be recorded in a footnote before the meeting could move on.\n\nA political scientist compared the present incarnation of the U.S. to \u201ca large, powerful, overgrown child with a handgun. How do you deal with that?\u201d\n\nThere are so many \u201cegregious examples\u201d of this kind, Wendy Sherman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs during the Obama administration, told me. \u201cTo the point that our allies, European leaders, are looking elsewhere for solidarity.\u201d A Canadian political scientist who advised her country during last year\u2019s NAFTA renegotiations was sickened when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum using a provision for national security considerations. \u201cWhat that meant to Canadians was: We are a threat to the national security of the U.S.\u201d She described Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201can enormous betrayal\u201d and added: \u201cThere was a growing sense that we were foolish to believe in the trust between the two countries.\u201d\n\nThis is an unfamiliar situation for everyone. David Sylvan, a political scientist and one of Biersteker\u2019s colleagues, compared the present incarnation of the U.S. to \u201ca large, powerful, overgrown child with a handgun. How do you deal with that?\u201d The U.S. has never hesitated to make up the rules for itself, but after the end of World War II, it was largely cast as a hegemon maintaining a global order. Now, it is a hegemon that scorns that order. More and more, the world fears that Trump is only a symptom of a much deeper problem, said James Davis, an American political scientist at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. European politicians in particular, he said, worry that deep social trends in America\u2014towards chauvinism, insularity and coercion\u2014will keep blooming even after Trump leaves the White House. Other governments \u201caren\u2019t going to be willing to deal with you on the same terms again,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey won\u2019t trust the system. They\u2019ll worry that in a few years, there will be another explosion.\u201d\n\nFor more stories that\n\nstay with you, subscribe\n\nto our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nSo the question is worth asking: How much longer will it be before the rest of the world thinks about punishing the U.S. for its misdemeanors? And how would they even go about disciplining a country as mighty as the United States?\n\nOn a rainy April day, in a conference room in one of the petals of the Maison de la Paix, Biersteker convened for me a roundtable of a dozen or so sanctions scholars: practitioners, academics, researchers, economists. Few of them agreed to be quoted by name. Some worked with multilateral institutions and were attending in their personal capacities; a couple were Iranian, and unwilling to be linked to criticism of the U.S. Together, they proposed scenarios in which America\u2019s misbehavior might pose genuine threats to the world, and speculated about how the international community could respond with sanctions, in the very widest sense of that word.\n\nThrough the spring, I spoke to other experts as well, in Geneva, London, Hamburg, New York and Washington D.C. The world is changing, they all said. The American unipolar moment is ending. The economies of China and India will soon outgrow America\u2019s. New networks of power, trade and wealth are emerging. Countries are forming alternative arrangements of finance that fall outside American influence. These developments will eventually leave the U.S. vulnerable to levers of pressure in a way it hasn\u2019t been in the past. In the corridors of power in Brussels, Paris and Berlin, the idea of pushing these levers is beginning to sound less and less outlandish by the day.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Rosalind \"Roz\" Brewer knows what it's like to be \"the first\" or \"the only.\"\n\nBrewer, who runs Walgreens Boots Alliance, is only the second Black female to be named the permanent CEO of a Fortune 500 company, after Ursula Burns became the head of Xerox in 2009. Brewer was also the first Black person and the first woman in her previous roles as the chief operating officer at Starbucks and the CEO of Sam's Club.\n\n\"Over the course of my career, whether I was a bench chemist or a CEO, I have often been a 'first' and unfortunately many times I've also been the only African-American person in the boardroom or the C-suite,\" Brewer told Insider via email. \"It's changing, but not quickly enough and there's more work to do.\"\n\nBrewer, 60, is chasing a new first of sorts in her role at Walgreens: turning the $33 billion pharmacy chain into a destination healthcare company.\n\nAfter stepping into power at America's second-largest pharmacy during the deadliest disease event in US history, Brewer has been pursuing a wide-ranging strategy to remake the company. In the past year, she led Walgreens through several acquisitions, drove technology investments, made internal changes to advance diversity and inclusion, and championed the notion of equity in interviews.\n\n\"The biggest lesson here is to question the status quo and make decisions, pull triggers,\" Brewer said in a March video posted on the company's website. \"This year has taught me to never settle and to question.\"\n\nBringing healthcare to your neighborhood\n\nBrewer has been leading an acquisition strategy. Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf all goes according to Brewer's vision, Walgreens will be as well known for being a healthcare provider as it is for being a pharmacy. The company's larger rival, CVS Health, is following a similar strategy of making healthcare a bigger part of its business.\n\n\"I want my legacy as a business leader to be affordable, accessible, quality healthcare in the US, so I am most excited for next year to continue delivering on our company's vision to reimagine local healthcare and well-being for all,\" she told Insider.\n\nPart of the way Walgreens intends to boost its healthcare offerings is through acquisitions. In November, the company said it would buy Summit Health-CityMD, a chain of urgent-care and primary-care facilities, for almost $9 billion. And in September, Walgreens said it would spend more than $1.3 billion to snap up a remaining stake in Shields Health Solutions. Shields specializes in specialty drugs used to treat complex or rare conditions.\n\n\"Dispensing of pharmaceuticals is not going to be our long-term growth avenue,\" Brewer said at a 2022 healthcare-industry conference, according to FierceHealthcare.\n\nHer strategy also includes investing in new technologies, as well as advocating for a greater stake in mental-health treatment.\n\nIn a June interview at the Aspen Ideas conference, Brewer said she was excited about automating pharmacist and pharmacy-technician work that slows prescription filling and cuts into time spent with customers. She also spoke about expanding Walgreens' use of fulfillment centers for common prescriptions, like those for high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Those medicines would then be transported to pharmacies.\n\nAt Aspen, Brewer also talked about topics like \"food as medicine\" and \"fully caring for ourselves.\" She sees Walgreens as a place where customers can get their prescriptions filled, see a nurse on-site, talk with a social worker about arranging transportation to their next appointment, and maybe have a discussion with someone qualified to assess mental health.\n\nBut healthcare is complex and even the company's long-standing pharmacy business comes with challenges. Walgreens, for example, will pay $5 billion over the next 10 years to settle lawsuits related to its role in dispensing opioids.\n\nPrioritizing company culture and diversity\n\nBrewer has been championing diversity and inclusion for years. Alex Gallardo/Reuters\n\nBrewer recently wrote an Economist op-ed about why leaders need to embrace the Great Resignation. The best leaders, she said, will support workers' need for purpose and wellness.\n\n\"Years ago, company culture was viewed as the light and fluffy stuff,\" she wrote. \"But the facts and data show that a healthy company culture delivers results, and this has never been clearer to me than right now.\"\n\nIn October, Brewer eliminated task-based metrics from performance reviews for pharmacy staff, reducing pressure on employees and instead incentivizing staff to spend more time caring for patients.\n\nAdditionally, Brewer has made diversity and inclusion a focus. In November, Walgreens became the first company in the S&P 500 to disclose disability-representation workforce data and to tie leadership's bonuses to increasing the representation of people with disabilities within the company.\n\nEmbracing diversity is no longer an option for leaders, according to Brewer.\n\n\"Employees expect to bring their entire identity as people to work, and not to compartmentalize their values and keep them separate,\" she wrote in the Economist. \"As leaders, we will need to listen more to our employees and our wider communities.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "(Reuters) - Wall Street is paying the price for its poor performance this year. On Monday, stocks tumbled as investors dumped riskier assets in response to the fear of further economic woes due to rising Covid-19 cases and fresh restrictions in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.4 percent, the S&P 500 by 1.2 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite by 1.0 percent. Big losses were seen in the tech and retail sectors, with the Dow Jones tech index falling by 2.1 percent.\n\nThe worsening pandemic situation has cast a pall over the U.S. economy and sent riskier assets lower. The number of new daily cases of Covid-19 in the U.S. reached a record high of more than 208,000 on Sunday, and the country is experiencing a new surge in cases in some states.\n\nMeanwhile, more restrictions are being imposed to contain the virus. Several states, including California, are reinstating tougher measures to limit gatherings and force businesses to close.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. economy is still struggling to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. According to the latest data, the unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.7 percent in November, up from 6.5 percent in October, and well above its pre-pandemic level.\n\nThe disappointing economic data added to the uncertainty in the markets as investors weighed the prospects for stimulus. Earlier this month, Congressional negotiators struck a deal on a $900 billion stimulus package. But the agreement is yet to be passed by Congress, and it remains unclear when that might happen.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are increasingly becoming worried about the increasing debt burden of the U.S. government. The country's debt is expected to reach its highest level ever, at $29 trillion, this year.\n\nThe jittery market sentiment has dented investor sentiment and sent stocks tumbling. Investors are now wondering if Wall Street is on Santa's naughty list this year, as the rally that took the major averages to record highs in November has run out of steam.\n\nOn the bright side, the coming weeks are likely to see a pickup in activity as the holiday season kicks off. Many retail stores have already opened their doors for the season, and this could spark some buying interest in stocks.\n\nMoreover, there are still some positive prospects for the markets. The Federal Reserve has already said it would keep rates low for an extended period of time, and the central bank's accommodative stance should provide support for stocks.\n\nIn addition, many analysts still think that the vaccine rollout could be the catalyst for a strong recovery in the U.S. economy in 2021. Several countries have already started their vaccine distribution programs, and this could potentially pave the way for an economic rebound.\n\nFor now, the markets remain choppy and investors are cautious. With a lack of clarity on the economic and stimulus prospects, Wall Street may remain on Santa's naughty list this year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "in 2024.\n\nIt was supposed to be an orderly march to a showdown between House Republicans and Democrats. \n\nOn January 3, the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was to select a majority leader to replace retiring House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, it all went up in smoke. \n\nAs a result, Republican leader McCarthy was forced out of the majority leader race, opening the door for a wild, chaotic and unpredictable series of events that threaten to complicate an already contentious election year.\n\nThe series of events unfolded on the same day Congress was set to select the new Speaker, with House Minority Leader McCarthy vying for the job. However, just hours before the expected vote, McCarthy and his allies informed the GOP conference that he would be dropping out of the race.\n\nThe unexpected and controversial turn of events has left House Republicans reeling, and with no clear path forward. With McCarthy\u2019s departure, the Democrats\u2019 number one candidate for the position, Minority Leader Steny Hoyer, is now the leading candidate for Speaker, meaning the Democratic caucus is likely to have the majority of the House in the 117th Congress.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for the GOP? It certainly doesn\u2019t mean that the party is doomed in the upcoming election. Quite the contrary, in fact. House Republicans may be in disarray right now, but the McCarthy fiasco illustrates just how adept the party is at adapting to a rapidly changing landscape and using chaos as a weapon against their opponents.\n\nFor starters, McCarthy\u2019s sudden departure was a reminder that House Republicans still possess a certain level of political savvy. While his decision to drop out of the race was met with a wave of criticism from both sides of the aisle, it was also a savvy move. McCarthy knew that he would face an uphill battle to secure the speakership given his lack of support from the Democratic caucus, and likely thought it best to step aside and let a Democrat become speaker rather than risk the possibility of a GOP leader facing an unlikely defeat.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s departure also proves that House Republicans know how to pivot. Despite the fact that his own caucus largely rejected his bid for the speakership, McCarthy is now taking the lead role in helping to organize and unite the party for the upcoming elections. He\u2019s already spoken out in favor of policy proposals from party colleagues and has used his heightened profile to further the party\u2019s agenda.\n\nFinally, McCarthy\u2019s abrupt departure has shown House Republicans\u2019 willingness to embrace the power of chaos. As the party prepares for a potential House majority in the upcoming election, it\u2019s clear that the GOP is using the McCarthy fiasco as a way to demonstrate that they\u2019re comfortable adapting to change and that they\u2019re ready to take advantage of a chaotic environment.\n\nWith the House Speaker drama now in the rearview mirror, the Republican party is sure to use the experience as a blueprint for how they will approach the 2020 election. As the party seeks to strengthen its standing among the electorate, they will no doubt be banking on chaos to help propel them to victory. After all, if House Republicans can successfully turn the McCarthy fiasco into a win, the sky\u2019s the limit for the party in 2024.", "label": "machine"}

In fact, even after Tesla erased more than $700 billion in market value this year due to concerns about Elon Musk's time commitment to the company, it's still worth more than the four biggest auto companies combined.\n\n\"Tesla I think is still tremendously overvalued despite its plunge this year... I think Tesla should be selling at a higher multiple than [Ford and General Motors] because it has much better growth prospects and they dominate the EV market. But this multiple is way too high,\" Janjigian said.\n\nTesla currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21x, compared to 6x and 5x at Ford and General Motors, respectively. The only major auto company that has a higher valuation multiple than Tesla is Ferrari, which has a gross profit margin that's about double Tesla's due to its focus on selling high-priced luxury vehicles.\n\nIf Tesla were valued by investors more like its automaker peers \u2014 while maintaining a sizable premium due to its fast growth rate and technological innovations \u2014 the company could see its value plunge even further, according to Janjigian.\n\n\"Tesla is currently selling about 1 million cars per year. That number is going to grow. When I look at Ford, which is selling approximately 5 to 6 million cars per year. I think Tesla will get up there, so therefore under that argument I think it should be worth at least as much as Ford, maybe twice as much as Ford, maybe 3x as much as Ford. But 8x as much as Ford? I think that's too high,\" Janjigian said.\n\nIf Tesla fell to a valuation that was three times as much as Ford, it would be worth $135 billion. That would represent a 65% decline from current levels, and an 89% decline from its peak valuation of more than $1.2 trillion.\n\n\"Are they going to be the only car seller in the world? Are they going to put all these other automobile manufacturers out of business? If that's the case then [they should be valued higher]. But Ford is also making EVs. GM is making EVs. Every single manufacturer now is trying to grow their EV business, and they have a lot of years of experience behind them... so I think that they will eventually catch up [to Tesla],\" Janjigian said.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\nIt was only two short seasons ago that Seth Jones was scratching his head as to why he wasn\u2019t selected to his first All-Star Game.\n\nOn Monday, the Chicago Blackhawks defender found out why.\n\nJones was named to the 2021 NHL All-Star Game, the first time he\u2019ll be representing the Hawks in the midseason classic. The 28-year-old was an All-Star in 2017, but this will be his first appearance with the Blackhawks after signing as a free agent in 2019.\n\nJones\u2019 season has been an excellent one, as he\u2019s registered four goals and 13 assists in 37 games. He\u2019s also a plus-16, tied for the top mark among Chicago\u2019s defensemen. The Anchorage native is also tied for fourth on the team in time on ice, averaging 21:45 per game.\n\nJones said that, while he was honored to be named an All-Star, he doesn\u2019t want to get too carried away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor and I\u2019m thankful for the nomination, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not the end goal,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMy goal is to help the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup. I know the organization has given me an opportunity to do that and I\u2019m thankful for the confidence they\u2019ve shown in me. But the recognition for me is secondary.\u201d\n\nEven though Jones may have some reservations about being an All-Star, his selection is deserved and a long time coming. He\u2019s been a workhorse on the backend of the Blackhawks defense and has helped bring stability to a unit that was in need of a leader.\n\nJones\u2019 presence has also helped to elevate the play of his defensive partner, Erik Gustafsson. The Swede has also benefitted from Jones\u2019 steadying influence, registering one goal and 11 assists in 33 games this season.\n\n\u201cSeth has been a great teammate,\u201d Gustafsson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart player who knows his game and he\u2019s been really good for our team. He\u2019s someone who sets an example for all of us in how to be a professional and how to prepare.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 selection is also a testament to his growth as a player since joining the Blackhawks. He\u2019s taken a leadership role on the team and is someone that younger players can look up to. Jones\u2019 veteran presence has been invaluable to a team that is currently in the midst of a rebuild.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice to be able to play in a city like Chicago,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe fans here are passionate about the game and it\u2019s been an honor to represent the Blackhawks organization. I\u2019ve enjoyed the journey so far and am looking forward to the future.\u201d\n\nThe 2021 All-Star Game will be held on February 7th at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. Jones will join teammate Patrick Kane as the two Hawks representatives in the game. The two of them will join a host of other stars from around the NHL as they take part in the annual exhibition.\n\nJones may not be making a huge fuss about his All-Star selection, but it is an honor that is well-deserved. The Blackhawks defender has been an important part of the team\u2019s success this season and the fact that he will represent the organization at the All-Star Game is a testament to the work that he has put in.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nOne of the most interesting advances in artificial intelligence (AI) research of the past decade was the creation of Meta, an AI designed to play board games. In a major milestone for AI research, Meta has recently demonstrated a capacity to learn not to lie.\n\nThe development marks a shift in the way AI is approaching game play. Previous AI algorithms were designed to win at all costs, and would often employ deceptive strategies to defeat their human opponents. Meta, however, can now recognize when lying might be counter-productive, showing a new level of understanding of game rules and an ability to assess the consequences of its actions.\n\nThe breakthrough was made at the annual AI and Games conference, held in Paris. At the conference, researchers pitted Meta against a human player in a game of Hanabi, a cooperative game in which players must work together to create a fireworks display.\n\nIn the game, players take turns drawing cards and giving clues to each other in order to collect the right cards to create their fireworks display. As is customary in many board games, players are allowed to bluff or deceive their opponents, which can make the game more challenging.\n\nFor Meta, however, the researchers had modified the game to make it impossible to win by lying. Meta was still able to deceive the human player, but was able to recognize when deception was not the best option for achieving a win.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the researchers had Meta deliberately play an incorrect card, in order to give its human opponent a false impression of the cards it possessed. Meta then revealed the true nature of its hand, rather than continuing with the deception and risking a loss.\n\nThe ability to distinguish between truth and lies was previously thought to be the sole domain of humans, yet Meta has shown that this is something that AI can learn to do as well. This understanding of the consequences of lying could be applied to a variety of AI-based applications, such as natural language processing.\n\nSuch applications could be used to detect lies in conversations or social media, or to help identify potential frauds in financial transactions. AI could also be used to detect lies in the political arena, or to help in the detection of fake news.\n\nThe implications of the research extend even further, however. AIs could potentially be used to create more effective advertising campaigns, or to detect potential health risks in the data collected by medical devices.\n\nThe ability to recognize when lying is counter-productive could also open the door to new approaches to AI-based decision making. By using a combination of truth and lies, AI could be used to more accurately assess a situation and determine the best course of action.\n\nFor now, the team behind Meta are continuing to explore the implications of their work and the potential applications for the AI. What's certain, however, is that the development of Meta is an important milestone in the development of AI, and has profound implications for the future of intelligent machines.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nOn Monday, the Buffalo Bills and their medical team made a positive update on safety Damar Hamlin, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a game against the Patriots last week.\n\nThe Bills announced that Hamlin had made \"substantial improvement\" since the incident and that his \"long-term prognosis\" remains positive. The team also thanked the medical staffs from both teams and emergency personnel for their quick response and professional care.\n\nThe incident occurred early in the fourth quarter of the Bills' 41-17 win over the Patriots. Hamlin was tackled by New England's Jared Knies and then collapsed on the field.\n\nThe Bills medical team and Patriots medical staff rushed to his side and quickly determined that he was in cardiac arrest. He was given CPR by members of both teams, and the medical staff was able to use a defibrillator to revive him.\n\nHamlin was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he underwent several medical tests and procedures. After four days of observation, Hamlin was released and allowed to return home.\n\nThe Bills' medical team said Monday that Hamlin is continuing to recover and is doing well. It's unclear when or if he will be able to return to the field, but the team is optimistic about his recovery.\n\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by his progress,\u201d the Bills said in a statement. \u201cWe understand the recovery process from such an event is lengthy and different for everyone, so we are appreciative of everyone\u2019s patience as we take a conservative approach with Damar.\u201d\n\nThe team has not revealed the exact nature of Hamlin's condition, but it is believed to be related to a heart issue. Hamlin, 23, is in his second season with the Bills and is a valuable member of their defense.\n\nThe medical teams involved in Hamlin's treatment all did an incredible job in getting him to the hospital quickly and providing life-saving treatment. It's a testament to their skill and dedication, and we are grateful for their heroic efforts.\n\nThe thoughts of the entire Bills organization, and the entire NFL community, remain with Damar and his family at this difficult time. We are hopeful that he makes a full recovery and that he is able to return to the football field soon.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The coronavirus pandemic that has caused billions of people to stay at home and disrupted economic activities across the world has also affected global markets, including the Chinese yuan.\n\nHowever, one investment firm is betting that the Chinese currency could soon get a boost.\n\nBK Asset Management, a global investment firm based in New York City, said in a research report released on Thursday that the yuan could get a boost this year as the Chinese government introduces measures to boost consumer spending and economic growth.\n\nAccording to the firm, the Chinese government has recently implemented a range of measures designed to shore up economic growth, including monetary easing and spending plans.\n\nThe firm said that these measures will help to support consumer spending and encourage increased consumer confidence, which in turn could increase demand for the yuan.\n\nIn addition, the firm said that the introduction of a new digital currency by the Chinese government could also be a positive for the yuan.\n\nThe People's Bank of China has been testing a digital currency since the end of 2020, and the firm said that the successful launch of the currency could boost confidence in the yuan.\n\nFinally, the firm said that improving relations between the United States and China could also be beneficial for the yuan.\n\nThe firm said that if the two countries can reach a trade deal, or even simply restore diplomatic ties, it could help to improve sentiment towards the yuan, which would result in increased demand for the currency.\n\nOverall, the research report concluded that the Chinese yuan is likely to get a boost this year, due to the combination of measures taken by the Chinese government, the introduction of a digital currency, and better relations between the United States and China.\n\nAnalysts at BK Asset Management said that they remain optimistic on the outlook for the yuan and expect it to appreciate against the U.S. dollar this year.\n\nThe firm said that the yuan could appreciate to as high as 6.70 per U.S. dollar by the end of the year.\n\nThis would be a significant gain for the yuan, which currently stands at 6.83 per U.S. dollar.\n\nAnalysts at BK Asset Management said that their positive outlook for the yuan is based on the assumption that the Chinese government will continue to implement measures to support economic growth and that the United States and China will reach a trade deal or at least improve diplomatic ties.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that the outlook for the yuan is highly dependent on the state of the global economy and the success of the Chinese government's measures to stimulate growth.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) plunged on Tuesday after the movie theater company announced plans to raise capital through a $230 million stock offering and a proposed 1-for-20 reverse stock split.\n\nThe stock dropped as much as 32.5% to $5.31 per share following the news. The stock closed down 28.8% at $5.70 per share.\n\nThe theatrical exhibition leader has had a wild ride this year, with shares up more than 3,500% through Tuesday's session from its March low of $1.37 per share.\n\nThe company said that it plans to offer $230 million of its common stock in a public offering, a portion of which will be used to acquire its 11.5% ownership interest in London-based Odeon Cinemas Group.\n\nThe company also proposed to its board of directors to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of up to 1-for-20.\n\n\"We believe that these actions will enhance AMC\u2019s ability to continue to execute our business plan and reinforce our dedication to enhancing long-term shareholder value,\" AMC CEO Adam Aron said in a statement.\n\nThe move comes as AMC has been working to survive the crippling impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, which saw the closing of its theaters for an extended period of time earlier this year.\n\nThe company has sought to stay afloat through a series of measures, including its first-ever sale-and-leaseback transactions, which have allowed AMC to raise money by selling some of its theaters and then leasing them back. It also tapped the equity markets earlier this year with several offerings that raised around $900 million.\n\nWhile AMC has been able to find various sources of capital to help keep its doors open, the chain has yet to find a way to fully resume operations in the U.S. as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cripple movie theater attendance.\n\nThough some AMC theaters have begun to reopen, many of its locations are still shut and the company is currently only able to show older titles, as few movie studios are releasing new titles during the pandemic. \n\nAMC's latest capital raise and proposed reverse split suggests that the company is still in dire financial straits and is struggling to stay afloat until attendance in movie theaters can return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAnalysts were skeptical of the news, with one describing the stock offering and reverse split as \"desperate measures\" from the company.\n\n\"AMC is trying to do whatever it can to get back to a point where it's operating as it was pre-COVID, but that's hard to do when cash is so tight and there's so little incoming revenue,\" said VanEck analyst Matthew Elenjikal.\n\n\"These measures look desperate but I guess when you have to do what it takes to stay alive, you do it,\" he added.\n\nDespite the Tuesday plunge, AMC is still up over 2,800% from its March lows, a testament to how far the company has come since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe question now is how much further will AMC be able to go in its bid to stay afloat? With new and exciting titles still absent from cinemas, the outlook is uncertain and Tuesday's news suggests AMC may still have a long road ahead.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ". \n\nBeijing, the Chinese capital and one of the world\u2019s most populous cities, has ground to a near halt as the Chinese government re-imposes stringent restrictions in an effort to prevent a potential resurgence of the Covid-19 outbreak that has already caused havoc in the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe government announced last week that it would expand its nationwide lockdown measures, dubbed the \u201cFour Embraces\u201d, to Beijing, which is home to more than 20 million people and is one of the economic engines of China. Starting on November 11, the city implemented new, draconian measures to limit the movement of people, goods, and services, with limited exceptions.\n\nUnder the \u201cFour Embraces\u201d plan, most public transportation has been suspended, with citizens being asked to stay home as much as possible. Restaurants, bars, and public venues are closed, and residents have been advised to avoid unnecessary trips outside the city limits. Face masks must be worn by those outside their homes and temperature screenings are conducted at major public gathering places.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has been working to identify potential cases and contact tracing, while stepping up its testing capacity. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that it had tested more than 12 million people in the city, but so far the number of confirmed cases has been relatively low, with only 12 recorded as of Wednesday.\n\nThe stringent measures, though welcomed by citizens, have had a tremendous economic impact on the city, with a large number of businesses being forced to close, while many people are seeing their incomes drastically reduced or lost. The government is trying to minimize the economic impact with a range of measures, including subsidies for businesses and residents, but the full impact is still unclear.\n\nThe lockdowns have also led to a severe disruption of the capital\u2019s transportation system, with train, plane, and bus services grinding to a near halt. The Beijing Airport Authority has said that all international flights in and out of Beijing have been suspended, and domestic flights in and out of the city are facing delays and cancellations. Beijing\u2019s subway system, which typically carries millions of people a day, is operating at reduced capacity, and taxis and ridesharing services are largely unavailable.\n\nThe city\u2019s travel industry has been particularly hard hit, with most hotels and tourist attractions closing and most tour groups canceled. The tourism industry is an important source of income for many in the city and the disruption has caused hardship for those who depend on it.\n\nMeanwhile, the education system is also being disrupted, with schools closed and universities facing staggered exam schedules. Students are being encouraged to take online courses to keep up with their studies and many are being allowed to return home.\n\nThe Beijing government has urged citizens to follow the measures, but some have expressed frustration at the restrictions, arguing that the economic and social costs of the lockdowns are too high. The government has acknowledged that the measures are stringent and have an economic impact, but it insists that public health remains its top priority.\n\nAs the country battles to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, the people of Beijing remain in an anxious state, with many unable to do the things they are accustomed to. With the economic and social disruption caused by the lockdowns, it is unclear how long it will take for the city to return to normal.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Live updates: House adjourns until 10 p.m. as GOP leaders work to secure McCarthy's speakership \n\nHouse Republicans are adjourned until 10 p.m. ET Saturday as they work to secure Kevin McCarthy\u2019s speakership, a process that has been fraught with delays and doubt from the start.\n\nRepublicans had planned to vote on McCarthy\u2019s speakership in a closed-door meeting this afternoon, but those plans were scrapped and the meeting was put on hold. The delay has fueled speculation that McCarthy is having difficulty securing the support of enough GOP lawmakers to secure his speakership.\n\nMcCarthy had been considered a front-runner for the speakership since his predecessor, Paul Ryan, announced his retirement in April. He has since worked to rally support for his candidacy, but he has run into several roadblocks in recent days.\n\nOn Thursday, conservative GOP lawmaker Jim Jordan announced that he would seek the speakership. His candidacy has created a rift within the party, with some lawmakers pledging to support him and others publicly opposing him.\n\nThe most recent development came Friday, when a group of 11 conservative lawmakers announced they were withholding their support from McCarthy and Jordan. The group issued a statement saying they would not be \u201cheld hostage\u201d by either candidate.\n\nThat announcement set off a frantic search for a third-party candidate to replace Ryan, a process that has resulted in a flurry of last-minute meetings and speculation about possible alternatives.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear who the GOP will choose for the speakership, but for now, McCarthy remains the favorite.\n\nAt a press conference Saturday, McCarthy said he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about his chances.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that I can get the votes that I need to be the next speaker of the House,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process, but I\u2019m confident that I have the votes.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s chief rival for the position, Jordan, has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill in recent days, trying to rally support for his candidacy. On Saturday morning, he told reporters that he is \u201cnot deterred by this process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm fighting hard and I'm going to fight until the last vote is cast.\u201d\n\nIf Jordan can rally enough support, the race could come down to a floor vote when the House reconvenes later this evening.\n\nThat could create an unpredictable situation, as many lawmakers have not publicly declared their support for either candidate. It also could be a bitter battle, as the two men are running on opposite sides of the GOP divide.\n\nMcCarthy has the support of the party\u2019s establishment, while Jordan has the backing of the conservative wing. It remains to be seen whether either can muster enough support from other GOP members to win the speakership.\n\nMeanwhile, the House has adjourned until 10 p.m. as GOP leaders continue to search for a way forward. \n\nIt\u2019s a situation that is growing increasingly tense and uncertain, as the clock ticks closer to what could be a historic vote on the future of the party. \n\nStay tuned for live updates as the speakership process continues.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "2020 was a wild year for the stock market, as the S&P 500 dropped by more than 12% from January to March before it began to recover, resulting in a rally that gave the benchmark index a total return of approximately 14.5% for the full year.\n\nBut some investors fared even better than that. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, had an especially good year, as his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A, BRK-B) was able to take advantage of the volatility of the markets and make some sound investments.\n\nBuffett was able to identify strong performing stocks in a variety of sectors, and the result was a great year for Berkshire Hathaway. The company's stock price rose nearly 33% from January to December, and it has been estimated that Buffett's own personal net worth rose by approximately $20 billion in 2020.\n\nBut which stocks did Buffett buy that helped him achieve such stellar returns in 2020? We took a look at Berkshire Hathaway's year-end holdings to find out.\n\nThe first stock on the list is Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), the world's largest company by market capitalization. Apple stock is up more than 85% so far this year, making it the best-performing stock on the list. Buffett has long been a fan of Apple, and he has been buying its shares since at least 2016. Berkshire Hathaway had an estimated $111.9 billion of Apple stock at the end of 2020, making it Berkshire's largest holding by far.\n\nSecond on the list is Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), which is up more than 81% year-to-date. Berkshire Hathaway has been a major investor in Bank of America since 2011, and at the end of 2020, it held an estimated $26.5 billion of its shares.\n\nThird on the list is American Express (NYSE: AXP), which is up more than 39% so far in 2020. Buffett has long been a fan of American Express, and the company has been a major holding of Berkshire Hathaway since the 1990s. At the end of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway held an estimated $15.5 billion of American Express stock.\n\nFourth on the list is Visa Inc (NYSE: V), which is up more than 59% year-to-date. Berkshire Hathaway began buying shares of Visa in 2015, and at the end of 2020, it held an estimated $11.7 billion of the company's stock.\n\nFifth on the list is JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM), which is up more than 50% year-to-date. JPMorgan Chase has been a major holding of Berkshire Hathaway since 2010, and the company had an estimated $10.3 billion of its stock at the end of 2020.\n\nSixth on the list is Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC), which is up more than 48% so far this year. Buffett has been a major investor in Wells Fargo since 1989, and at the end of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway held an estimated $6.5 billion of its shares.\n\nSeventh on the list is U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), which is up more than 39% year-to-date. Buffett has been a major investor in U.S. Bancorp since 2011, and at the end of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway held an estimated $4.3 billion of its shares.\n\nEighth on the list is Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO), which is up more than 12% year-to-date. Buffett has been a major investor in Coca-Cola since 1988, and at the end of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway held an estimated $3.8 billion of its stock.\n\nNinth on the list is General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), which is up more than 40% year-to-date. Buffett has been a major investor in General Motors since 2012, and at the end of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway held an estimated $2.9 billion of its shares.\n\nFinally, tenth on the list is Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT), which is up more than 11% year-to-date. Buffett has been a major investor in Wal-Mart since 2005, and at the end of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway held an estimated $2.7 billion of its shares.\n\nSo, these were Warren Buffett's 10 best performing stocks held by Berkshire Hathaway in 2020. As you can see, Buffett was able to identify strong performers in a variety of sectors and capitalize on the opportunity. It certainly was a great year for Berkshire Hathaway, and investors should expect more of the same in 2021.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Bob Iger returned to Disney as CEO in November, ending Bob Chapek's rocky tenure.\n\nThe change comes as Disney contends with mounting financial challenges and likely layoffs in 2023.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about what led to Chapek's ouster and what comes next.\n\nIn one of the most dramatic reversals in corporate history, the Walt Disney Co. board reinstated Bob Iger as CEO in November, ousting his predecessor Bob Chapek.\n\nThe return of Iger, who had previously served as CEO for 15 years before Chapek took over, set off a flood of Wall Street investor notes focused on the challenges facing Iger \u2014 analysts and Hollywood industry observers also scrutinized Chapek's rocky tenure and his selection as CEO.\n\nHere's a rundown of what led to the change at the top of one of America's most beloved companies and the challenges that lie ahead for Iger in what was announced to be a two-year tenure, from finding a new successor to fixing Disney's streaming business and repairing the company's relationships with Hollywood.\n\nWhat went wrong under Chapek and how Iger's return happened\n\nIger's return cut short the tenure of his protege Bob Chapek, who had spent less than three years in the role. Insider reported that Disney executives had complained to the company's board about Chapek's leadership.\n\nChapek's fumbles were wide-ranging. Disney had just reported a $1.5 billion loss in its streaming business on a November 8 earnings call. Earlier in the year, the company faced backlash from customers over price increases at its theme parks. Separately, employees walked out in protest over Disney's reluctance to take a strong stance against Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law.\n\nChapek had also alienated creative execs and Hollywood by taking content budgets away from creative execs at Disney and by releasing movies on streaming at the same time as in theaters during the pandemic; the move resulted in a high-profile legal spat with Scarlett Johansson and her reps.\n\nThe company also faced pressure from activist investors like Daniel Loeb to cut costs and make big strategy changes.\n\nIt didn't help that Chapek, while he was considered an effective operator, was also seen as less charismatic and communicative than his popular predecessor. Wall Street faulted him for waiting until after the 3Q earnings call to announce that layoffs were planned, for example.\n\nMore on Chapek's tenure and Iger's shocking return:\n\nWhy Iger's top priority will be a solid succession plan\n\nIger's return reassured employees who were familiar with the Disney vet but also drew criticism, considering his previous remit as CEO included finding and grooming his replacement. So the pressure's on for him to carry through on that task before his two-year contract is up (though the board could always extend his contract again, considering it already did so four times before).\n\nDuring Chapek's first year as CEO, Iger remained as executive chairman of the company, and there were tensions between the two executives. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iger undermined Chapek's leadership.\n\nWhile many in Hollywood cheered Iger's reinstatement, the move also quickly drew criticism from some on Wall Street over Disney's succession planning and questions about whether the company even has execs who could be groomed to succeed him in two years.\n\nMore on succession at Disney:\n\nHow Iger can strengthen Disney's streaming business and control costs\n\nIger returns to a streaming landscape that's more competitive since he left, with new entrants like Netflix's ad-supported tier fighting for viewers' share of wallet. Disney, which in December launched its own ad-supported Disney+ offering, has enjoyed strong streaming growth, but Wall Street cares more about profitability now.\n\nIger previously scored wins for Disney with acquisitions of Lucasfilm, Pixar, and other companies but told Disney staffers at a November meeting not to expect more big acquisitions. He also said a hiring freeze announced by Chapek would remain in effect.\n\nStepping up to lead the company amid a tough economic environment, Iger will have to address not only steep losses in Disney's streaming business but also big decisions like whether to seek full ownership of Hulu, now part-owned by Comcast; how to manage content distribution across Hulu and Disney+; and whether to keep or sell ESPN.\n\nRead more about Disney's streaming business and M&A plans:\n\nHow a sluggish box office and talent demands will create new challenges for Iger\n\nIger wasted no time in making changes, ousting Kareem Daniel \u2014 the exec who led distribution under Chapek's unpopular business restructure \u2014 and announcing plans to give Disney creative executives more power.\n\nBut he also has to deal with a box office business that's been scarred by the pandemic and mollify Hollywood talent still miffed by some of Chapek's moves. Recent animation releases have flopped, and there's been a slowdown in Star Wars releases.\n\nLong considered one of Hollywood's most successful CEOs, Iger will need to marshal all of his business acumen, cultural savvy, and management skills to usher Disney through a challenging economic landscape and transition the company to a strong new leader.\n\nRead more about what Disney, Hollywood, and Iger expect from Iger:", "label": "human"}

Ron Chenoy/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\nWith almost 20,000 fans inside the arena growing agitated and with bemused players running across the court to stay warm, Denver\u2019s mascot Rocky the Mountain Lion did its best to keep spirits up.\n\nAt one point, the mascot got a small ladder and pretended to fix the rim on the other side of the court.\n\nEventually, after 35 minutes of work, the rim was deemed level and play was able to resume after both teams had a short warmup.\n\nAfter the break, the Nuggets kicked on to take the 123-111 win, inspired by MVP candidate Nikola Jokic who finished on 30 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists.\n\nHowever, despite the lengthy delay, Celtics shooting guard Jaylen Brown said the rim still looked slightly bent to the left.\n\n\u201cThey spent all that time trying to fix it, but when we came back, it still looked like it wasn\u2019t even level, in my opinion.

{"text": "EL PASO, Texas \u2014 President Joe Biden inspected a busy port of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday, his first trip to the region after two years in office as Republicans hammer him for being soft on border security while the number of migrants crossing spirals.\n\nBiden watched as border officers in El Paso demonstrated how they search vehicles for drugs, money and other contraband. In a sign of the deep political tensions over the immigration, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott handed Biden a letter upon his arrival that said the \u201cchaos\u201d at the border was the \u201cdirect result\u201d of the president\u2019s failure to enforce federal laws.\n\nBiden planned to spend a few hours in the city, currently the biggest corridor for illegal crossings, in large part to Nicaraguans fleeing repression, crime and poverty in their country. They are among migrants from four countries who are now subject to quick expulsion under new rules enacted by the Biden administration in the past week that drew strong criticism from immigration advocates.\n\nThe president met with border officials to discuss migration as well as the increased trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which are driving skyrocketing numbers of overdoses in the U.S.\n\nBiden was scheduled to visit the El Paso County Migrant Services Center and meet with nonprofits and religious groups that support migrants arriving to the U.S. It was not clear whether Biden would talk to any migrants.\n\nBiden\u2019s announcement on border security and his visit to the border are aimed in part at quelling the political noise and blunting the impact of upcoming investigations into immigration promised by House Republicans. But any enduring solution will require action by the sharply divided Congress, where multiple efforts to enact sweeping changes have failed in recent years.\n\nFrom El Paso, Biden was to continue south to Mexico City, where he and the leaders of Mexico and Canada will gather on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Immigration is among the items on the agenda. The challenge facing the U.S. on its southern border requires cooperation among multiple countries, a sign that diplomacy will matter as much as internal U.S. policies.\n\nEl Paso police officers pat down and arrest two Venezuelan migrants at the camping site outside the Sacred Heart Church in downtown El Paso, Texas, on Sunday. Associated Press\n\nIn El Paso, where migrants congregate at bus stops and in parks before traveling on, border patrol agents have stepped up security before Biden\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to send a message that they\u2019re going to more consistently check people\u2019s documented status, and if you have not been processed they are going to pick you up,\u201d said Ruben Garcia of the Annunciation House aid group in El Paso.\n\nMigrants and asylum-seekers fleeing violence and persecution have increasingly found that protections in the United States are available primarily to those with money or the savvy to find someone to vouch for them financially.\n\nJose Natera, a Venezuelan migrant in El Paso who hopes to seek asylum in Canada, said he has no prospects for finding a U.S. sponsor and that he\u2019s now reluctant to seek asylum in the U.S. because he\u2019s afraid of being sent to Mexico.\n\nMexico \u201cis a terrible country where there is crime, corruption, cartels and even the police persecute you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say that people who think about entering illegally won\u2019t have a chance, but at the same time I don\u2019t have a sponsor. \u2026 I came to this country to work. I didn\u2019t come here to play.\u201d\n\nThe numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden\u2019s first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. The administration has struggled to clamp down on crossings, reluctant to take hard-line measures that would resemble those of the Trump administration.\n\nThe policy changes announced this past week are Biden\u2019s biggest move yet to contain illegal border crossings and will turn away tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the border. At the same time, 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela will get the chance to come to the U.S. legally as long as they travel by plane, get a sponsor and pass background checks.\n\nThe U.S. will also turn away migrants who do not seek asylum first in a country they traveled through en route to the U.S. Migrants are being asked to complete a form on a phone app so that they they can go to a port of entry at a pre-scheduled date and time.\n\nMigrants prepare to spend the night on a sidewalk or inside an idle city bus in their attempt to stay warm while camping outside the Sacred Heart Church in downtown El Paso, Texas, late Saturday. Around 300 migrants have taken refuge on sidewalks, some of them afraid to seek more formal shelters, amid new restrictions meant to crack down on illegal border crossings. Andres Leighton/Associated Press\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters aboard Air Force One that the administration is trying to \u201cincentivize a safe and orderly way and cut out the smuggling organizations,\u201d saying the policies are \u201cnot a ban at all\u201d but an attempt to protect migrants from the trauma that smuggling can create.\n\nThe changes were welcomed by some, particularly leaders in cities where migrants have been massing. But Biden was excoriated by immigrant advocate groups, which accused him of taking measures modeled after those of the former president. Administration officials disputed that characterization.\n\nFor all of his international travel over his 50 years in public service, Biden has not spent much time at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe only visit that the White House could point to was Biden\u2019s drive by the border while he was campaigning for president in 2008. He sent Vice President Kamala Harris to El Paso in 2021, but she was criticized for largely bypassing the action, because El Paso wasn\u2019t the center of crossings that it is now.\n\nPresident Barack Obama made a 2011 trip to El Paso, where he toured border operations and the Paso Del Norte international bridge, but he was later criticized for not going back as tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossed into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nTrump, who made hardening immigration a signature issue, traveled to the border several times. During one visit, he crammed into a small border station to inspect cash and drugs confiscated by agents. During a trip to McAllen, Texas, then the center of a growing crisis, he made one of his most-often repeated claims, that Mexico would pay to build a border wall.\n\nAmerican taxpayers ended up footing the bill after Mexican leaders flatly rejected the idea.\n\nAssociated Press writers Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "British lawmakers have sought to dampen enthusiasm over hydrogen as a potential solution to Britain's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050, saying it was \"not a panacea\" and more action was needed to tackle climate change.\n\nThe House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee published a report on the role of hydrogen on Thursday, having heard from experts on its potential uses in industry, transport and heating.\n\nHydrogen has been touted as a possible alternative to natural gas for heating in homes, along with other carbon-free sources like electric heat pumps, and for use in cars and HGVs, as well as for industrial processes like steel and concrete production.\n\nIt could also be produced from renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, or from natural gas.\n\nThe report said: \u201cHydrogen has the potential to make a significant contribution to decarbonising UK energy and transport use.\n\n\u201cHowever, the committee heard that it is not a panacea and that other measures must be taken if the UK is to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\nCommittee chairwoman Rachel Reeves said: \u201cThe potential of hydrogen to contribute to a net zero future cannot be overstated.\n\n\u201cBut it is not a silver bullet and other measures, such as electrification, must play a role in the UK achieving its climate goals.\n\n\u201cWe were encouraged by the enthusiasm of industry to invest in hydrogen technologies and by the Government's commitment to support such initiatives.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is clear that there is much work still to be done to make the UK a leader in the development and deployment of hydrogen projects.\n\n\u201cThe Government must set out clearly how its plans for hydrogen fit into its wider commitments for decarbonisation and the development of low-carbon industry.\u201d\n\nThe BEIS committee set out a number of recommendations for the government, such as appointing a minister for hydrogen and setting out a clear strategy for the development and deployment of hydrogen technologies.\n\nThe report also called on the government to create incentives to encourage early adopters of hydrogen technologies, such as businesses and consumers, as well as to develop a hydrogen certification scheme to encourage the safe use of hydrogen.\n\nThe committee also urged the government to set out a clear plan for setting up a hydrogen grid and connecting green hydrogen projects to it, and to invest in research into ways of producing green hydrogen at a competitive price.\n\nThe committee noted that while the costs of developing and deploying hydrogen infrastructure are high, \u201cthe longer-term cost savings of relying on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels could be considerable\u201d.\n\nThe government said it welcomed the report and would \u201ccarefully consider\u201d its recommendations.\n\n\u201cHydrogen has a key role to play in powering homes and businesses, reducing pollution and creating jobs and investment, which is why the government is investing over \u00a31.3 billion in hydrogen technology and research and development,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\n\u201cWe are open to exploring the potential for hydrogen in heating homes and buildings, and have awarded \u00a311 million in funding to nine projects to demonstrate the safe and effective use of hydrogen in domestic and industrial buildings.\u201d\n\nThe government is currently consulting on proposals for a new, separate gas network for hydrogen, which would require an estimated \u00a312 billion in investment.\n\nThe report said it was \u201cencouraging\u201d that some investors had expressed an interest in hydrogen, but warned that they were \u201clooking for a clear signal from government\u201d before they committed to funding hydrogen projects.\n\nIt also urged the government to consider all the possible sources of green hydrogen, including renewable sources like wind and solar as well as from natural gas with carbon capture technology.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe UK has the opportunity to be a leader in the development and deployment of hydrogen, but there is much work to be done.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that government must work closely with industry and investors, who have already shown enthusiasm for hydrogen, to create the right environment to unlock the significant potential of hydrogen.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Banned Books: Author Jerry Craft on telling stories all kids can identify with\n\nThis discussion with Jerry Craft is part of a series of interviews with \u2014 and essays by \u2014 authors who are finding their books being challenged and banned in the U.S.\n\nEnlarge this image Quill Tree Books Quill Tree Books\n\nCartoonist and children's book author Jerry Craft published the Newbery award-winning graphic novel New Kid in 2019. New Kid also won the Coretta Scott King Author Award and the Kirkus Prize.\n\nCraft followed the book with Class Act in 2020 and, coming in April 2023, School Trip. His novels focus on portraying the experiences of kids of color. Craft's work allows kids to see themselves in stories, provoking inspiration and giving voice to diverse experiences.\n\nNew Kid focuses on the experience of being Black and the \"new kid\" at a predominantly white school. It follows Jordan, a seventh grader and aspiring artist from Washington Heights, New York. Jordan's parents send him to a private school to invest in his academic future. As he navigates the differing environments in his neighborhood and his new school, he attempts to stay true to himself.\n\nThe book has been challenged in some school districts including in Texas and Pennsylvania, citing the teaching of critical race theory.\n\nThe interview below has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn capturing reality\n\nIn my opinion, a lot of the books with African American protagonists ... there's this really big thing that happens \u2014 a life changing event, catastrophic, death or police or someone goes to jail or drugs \u2014 and I didn't want to show that. So there is no catastrophe in New Kid, but it's just kind of the day-to-day code switching you get so used to at an early age. My dad lived in the time where they had white drinking fountains and Black drinking fountains. So, I'm only one generation removed from that. He didn't expect anything... So when you think of the things that our ancestors had to deal with and even stuff that my dad [dealt with], having someone call you the wrong name or touch your hair \u2014 it's not catastrophic by nature. It's annoying. I really did want to have a book where you could read it and relax and just kind of subtly point out things that we can all do to improve how these kids grow up.\n\nOn inspiring Black kids by depicting positive new narratives\n\nYou're trained in a lot of ways to be a second class citizen. Even taking my sons to the movies, whereas their white counterparts \u2014 if they wanted to see someone that looked like them \u2014 their parents took them to see Harry Potter and, you know, Percy Jackson. Our version was 12 Years a Slave and Harriet Tubman... There just aren't a lot of happy stories. Even when I was a kid, the show Good Times was very popular. But for a show called \"good times,\" they never really had any good times.\n\n... I have a teacher who emailed me [about how] all the kids were going around saying what they wanted to do when they grow up [and] a Black kid in class goes, \"Well, if I live to be 18, I hope to... \" So, I wanted to have a book where there is hope. In School Trip, which comes out in April, the kids go to Paris. And I'm already reading some early reviews [about how people] love the book...but occasionally someone will go \"well I don't think the kids will be able to relate going to Paris... But [a] kid could relate to being a wizard like Harry Potter or going into space or going back in time or any of the other fantasy things. But a Black kid won't be able to relate to going to another country... If I wrote about a dystopian future where a 13-year-old white kid saves the world single handedly, that's relatable?\n\nSo, when I do new kid in class, not only am I doing this for kids to show that they do have hope and futures \u2014 but I also want to point out to parents and some of the teachers and librarians who put these emotional and mental shackles on their kids [thinking] 'I'm not even going to give them this book because [they'll] never be able to relate to going to Paris.' ...Why can't a kid have those kinds of aspirations where one day they're like, 'Oh, wow, I'd like to go there like Jordan Banks did' as opposed to, 'Hey, here's another gang book.' So what? I can relate to that, I can relate to being in a gang. I can relate to being enslaved... but it's such a discrepancy. ...They give them all these hard stories and then they forget that they're kids.\n\nOn representation in children and young adult books\n\nWhen I do these [school visits] on zoom or in person, it's about me being a very reluctant reader. I hated reading books as a kid because \u2014 who were my heroes? The Black kid in Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn? There was no kid who looked like me that I was proud of. It was Black Panther ... which came out, what, five years ago, that was the first time where I had goosebumps. That and Into the Spider-verse. I felt like I was 10 years old. What I would have given to have something like that when I was ten.\n\nBut one of the big problems that I have is... [people saying], 'oh, well... you're making white kids feel bad.' A lot of these books \u2014 especially historical books \u2014 you'll have a book like Ruby Bridges, or stories where these 8-year-old kids are single-handedly integrating the school systems and there are people throwing stuff or cursing: So, those kids can handle that \u2014 but your little kid can't handle reading about that because it makes them feel bad? And I think most times kids empathize with the main characters. I don't think that kids ever empathize with the bullies. And if they do, I don't think that you're doing your job as a parent properly. Because when I read a graphic novel like El Deafo by Cece Bell, which is amazing, or Hey, Kiddo, Jarrett J. Krosoczka's book \u2014 these are all kids who are teased because they're different. And again, if you raise your kid to not be able to have empathy for the one who's the target of the bullies ... I have white kids dressing up like Jordan Banks and Drew for Halloween. It's one of their favorite characters, kids don't emulate the bad guys. And if they do, like I said, you might have missed a couple of parenting sessions that you probably should put in.\n\nOn who decides what is appropriate reading\n\nI'm a parent... I do think that, as a parent, you have every right to decide what your kid can and cannot read... But you don't have the right to tell me what my kid can read. Because a lot of time kids will find themselves in books. They may not even be able to have [certain] discussions at home. I don't know what it's like at 12 years old to realize that I'm gay and I want to come out to my parents who are going to hate me and disown me because of that. But there are books with those characters that kids can find out that they're not the only ones.\n\nClaire Murashima produced the broadcast version of this story.

Similar restrictions were placed on the Altamont Pass wind farm in California, which requires the facility to shut down between March and September to protect the golden eagle.\n\nThe Pe\u00f1ascal Wind Project has been in development since 2011 and the shutdown period would delay the project\u2019s completion by approximately 18 months.\n\nThe project had already been delayed for six months due to legal challenges from opponents of the project, who had expressed concerns about the wind farm\u2019s impact on local wildlife.\n\n\u201cThe Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s request demonstrates how seriously the federal government takes the protection of threatened and endangered species and reflects the importance of ensuring these birds are provided a safe home in the Kenedy County area,\u201d said Joe Gershen, CEO of Pe\u00f1ascal Wind.\n\nGershen said the project team will now work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to discuss the timing of the shutdown period and the logistics of ensuring the shutdown does not disrupt the wind farm\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking into additional measures to help ensure the conservation of the aplomado falcon and the thick-billed parrot, such as providing research support and habitat restoration,\u201d said Gershen.\n\nThe Pe\u00f1ascal Wind Project is the largest wind farm in Texas and its cancellation could have a significant impact on the state\u2019s renewable energy sector.\n\nTexas is the leading state in wind energy production, accounting for more than 25 percent of the United States\u2019 total capacity. It is also the second-largest producer of electricity in the United States.\n\nThe wind industry has been a vital source of employment and economic activity for communities in the area.\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of protecting the parrots and the aplomado falcon, but the disruption to the project could have significant consequences for local communities,\u201d Gershen said.\n\nHe said the wind farm will continue to work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to find solutions that will allow the project to go ahead while preserving the wildlife in the area.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to providing the clean energy that Texas needs and to helping our local communities achieve economic growth and stability,\u201d Gershen said.", "label": "machine"}

The card allows players to instantly revive all fallen characters, regardless of their level, which many players felt gave players with the card an unfair advantage. FoxNext initially defended the card, arguing that it was a way for players to catch up and get back into the action faster, but it appears that the tide of public opinion has turned.\n\nIn response to the backlash, FoxNext announced that the card will be nerfed, reducing its effectiveness. Instead of being able to revive all characters, the card will now only revive one character per use. This should help level the playing field, while still allowing players who have purchased the card to get back into the action quickly.\n\nHowever, the nerf isn't the only change that FoxNext is making. The developer is also looking at additional ways to make the playing field more balanced.

Poner a punto tus ganas. \u00a1El optimismo importa!\n\nAlessandro Zeno\n\nLa clave est\u00e1 en mantener el equilibrio\n\nNada m\u00e1s coherente y realista que volver a poner nuestra balanza equilibrada, pues como dicen desde Naturadika, \"el peso es una cuesti\u00f3n de bienestar, de que uno se sienta bien consigo mismo, pero siempre manteni\u00e9ndose en un peso saludable\". El cuerpo fit parece haber quedado obsoleto. Por contra, gana en coherencia y peso el volver a ponerte en forma para sentirte bien. Y delimitar claramente el objetivo, poni\u00e9ndole nombre claro, es importante.\n\nEl peso es una cuesti\u00f3n de bienestar, de que uno se sienta bien consigo mismo\n\nTrucos para volver a tu forma sin que sea un suplicio\n\nSara Ampuero tiene algunas claves para que adelgazar tras las fiestas y volver a tu peso y tu forma, sea un camino m\u00e1s llevadero que el suplicio que supone aquello de \"ponerse a dieta\". No seas dura contigo misma y no atajes: el mejor camino es el m\u00e1s completo en este caso.\n\nPor eso, entre sus trucos est\u00e1 el de ponerse en manos de un profesional si no tienes claro como poner en marcha el proceso. \"Cada cuerpo y cada persona es diferente, no todas las dietas ni todas las rutinas funcionan por igual en todos los organismos\", dice la tecn\u00f3loga, que recomienda consultar a un profesional que garantice un asesoramiento seguro y personalizado. Y esto, por poco importante que te parezca, es clave para que a la hora de perder peso y tonificar tu figura, lo hagas de forma efectiva y controlada (y no haya rebotes indeseados).\n\nUn plan de control de peso\n\nEl punto de partida para cualquier plan en el que haya impl\u00edcita una p\u00e9rdida de peso es la creaci\u00f3n de un plan de d\u00e9ficit cal\u00f3rico. Es decir, para adelgazar hay que gastar m\u00e1s calor\u00edas de las que se ingieren. Y la constancia es fundamental: para que resulte efectivo hay que mantenerlo. Eso s\u00ed, sin renunciar a los nutrientes necesarios para mantener la energ\u00eda. Es decir, sin renunciar a los hidratos de carbono, las grasas y las prote\u00ednas. \"Se ha demostrado que, si se quiere adelgazar, lo m\u00e1s eficiente ser\u00eda reducir los carbohidratos en vez de las grasas\", dice la experta.\n\nCourtesy of Press Office\n\nReducir az\u00facares, procesados y sal\n\nLos grandes enemigos de este plan (y de la buena salud en general), son ya viejos conocidos: snacks procesados, boller\u00eda industrial, bebidas azucaradas... \"La glucosa tiene mucho que ver con el almacenamiento de la grasa en el vientre\", recuerda la experta.\n\nNo son pocos los estudios que han demostrado que aumentar el consumo de az\u00facar conlleva inevitablemente una mayor acumulaci\u00f3n de grasa abdominal, adem\u00e1s de aumentar los niveles de insulina que se relacionan con la obesidad. Por si fuera poco, todos estos productos est\u00e1n cargados de aditivos qu\u00edmicos y colorantes que nutricionalmente est\u00e1n vac\u00edos y sus efectos a largo plazo sobre la salud a\u00fan son desconocidos, as\u00ed que mejor prevenir, \u00bfno?\n\nEl papel de las grasas en el plan post-Navidad\n\nLos expertos lo tienen claro: hay que introducir m\u00e1s grasas \"buenas\" en la dieta. \"La mayor parte de los \u00e1cidos grasos son reguladores metab\u00f3licos. Por ejemplo, los famosos Omega 3 y Omega 6 ayudan a reducir la inflamaci\u00f3n y favorecen la sensibilidad a la insulina, ayudando al control de peso\", justifica Ampuero.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 grasas a\u00f1adir al plan? F\u00e1cil: las que aportan alimentos como el aguacate, los frutos secos, el aceite de coco, el ghee, el huevo, el salm\u00f3n, el AOVE o las semillas de ch\u00eda.\n\nEugenio Marongiu\n\nMantener cuidada la microbiota\n\nLas afecciones que se relacionan con la salud del intestino son innumerables. Incluso los estudios han relacionado la flora bacteriana con la producci\u00f3n de la grelina (la hormona del hambre) y la leptina (la de la saciedad), as\u00ed como con el proceso de la absorci\u00f3n de grasa. As\u00ed que mantener esta flora en buen estado resulta fundamental en un plan de recuperaci\u00f3n post-navide\u00f1o. El objetivo: reforzar las bacterias \"buenas\" de esta microbiota, que adem\u00e1s de proteger frente a muchas enfermedades y afecciones intestinales, ayuda a controlar el peso. \u00bfC\u00f3mo hacerlo? Los suplementos de probi\u00f3ticos aqu\u00ed son claves, especialmente los que incluyen las cepas de Lactobacillus Rhamnosus y Lactobacillus Gasseri, adem\u00e1s de a\u00f1adir alimentos con funci\u00f3n probi\u00f3tica a la cesta de la compra, como el kimchi, el chucrut o la kombucha.\n\nAlessandro Lucioni\n\nEl deporte\n\nDale la bienvenida al nuevo a\u00f1o renovando tus h\u00e1bitos deportivos. Es un buen momento para probar nuevas disciplinas, pero tambi\u00e9n puedes tirar de esas peque\u00f1as rutinas que siempre te sentaron bien. Sea como sea, recuerda: sin deporte que acompa\u00f1e a tu plan, no hay logros.\n\nHacer dieta sin hacer deporte puede hacer que se pierda peso, pero tambi\u00e9n que se gane flacidez\n\nEl cardio y los ejercicios de fuerza ser\u00e1n grandes aliados en tu proceso de renovaci\u00f3n: planchas abdominales cl\u00e1sicas o laterales y caminatas a buen ritmo, por ejemplo. No s\u00f3lo ayudar\u00e1s a eliminar grasa acumulada, sino que colaborar\u00e1n a proteger y mejorar la salud cardiovascular. Y como recuerda la experta: \"hacer dieta sin hacer deporte puede hacer que se pierda peso, pero tambi\u00e9n que se gane flacidez\".\n\nLa importancia de dormir bien\n\nPor mucha rutina acelerada que venga, que un buen descanso no falte en un plan, porque cuidado: \"la noche en vela puede incrementar de forma considerable la hormona del estr\u00e9s, el cortisol\", recuerda Ampuero. Y esto significa que te sentir\u00e1s m\u00e1s cansado, tendr\u00e1s menos energ\u00eda, har\u00e1s menos deporte y comer\u00e1s m\u00e1s entre horas. No compensa quedarte por la noche a terminarte la temporada completa de tu serie favorita, en serio.\n\nLos suplementos\n\nSon buenos aliados en estos planes en los que un extra de vitaminas y minerales te ayudar\u00e1n a obtener resultados saludables y duraderos. Por ejemplo, la firma Naturadika cuenta con uno especial para la retenci\u00f3n de l\u00edquidos, a base de alcachofa, nopal, cola de caballo, yerba mate, cardo mariano y vitamina C ( , 29,95 \u20ac) o un \"push\" de \u00e1nimo para reiniciar las rutinas saludables, con guaran\u00e1, aloe vera, artemisa, melisa, morera, colina y cromo ( , 24,90 \u20ac).\n\nFrancesco Carta fotografo\n\nM\u00ednimos saludables\n\nEs decir, qu\u00e9 incluir al menos al d\u00eda en tu dieta a cambio de todos esos polvorones que se colaron durante la Navidad. Pues bien, cambia todo eso por raciones m\u00ednimas de verdura y hortalizas al d\u00eda, que en este caso deber\u00edan ser al menos 2. Andrea Grau recomienda comerlas crudas o cocinadas en las comidas principales, pero tambi\u00e9n en bocadillos, como snacks, acompa\u00f1ando hummus, guacamoles caseros o pat\u00e9s vegetales...\n\nTambi\u00e9n, como m\u00ednimo, deber\u00edan estar entre 2 y 3 raciones de fruta diarias. Grau recuerda que el incremento de fibra ayudar\u00e1 a reducir la absorci\u00f3n de grasa presente en otros alimentos. Puedes comerlas como postre, pero tambi\u00e9n antes de las comidas principales para no llegar con tanto hambre, entre horas, e incluso en ensaladas, tostadas o yogures.\n\nEl agua: la bebida principal\n\nDeja atr\u00e1s el champagne, porque ya hemos brindado suficiente por el a\u00f1o nuevo. Que el agua se convierta en tu bebida principal a partir de ahora, ya sea entre horas como acompa\u00f1ando a tus comidas.\n\nMajaMitrovic\n\nCarne roja: bye, bye\n\nDespu\u00e9s de los grandes asados navide\u00f1os, llega el momento de limitar el consumo de la carne, especialmente la roja. Andrea Grau aconseja sustituirla por legumbres u otras alternativas vegetales, como el tofu, la heura o el seit\u00e1n. Tambi\u00e9n los embutidos, que pueden sustituirse por queso fresco, tortillas francesas, huevos a la plancha, salm\u00f3n ahumado, at\u00fan natural, aguacate o hummus...\n\nLos milagros no existen\n\nNo caigas en la trampa. Como recuerda la especialista, huye de las dietas milagro: \"nos provocar\u00e1n una p\u00e9rdida, pero tambi\u00e9n una r\u00e1pida recuperaci\u00f3n del peso\". De hecho, afirma que \"si queremos mantener o perder el peso despu\u00e9s de estas fechas donde predominan los excesos, debemos retomar h\u00e1bitos saludables y mejorar los h\u00e1bitos diet\u00e9ticos, pero siempre sin perder la calidad de vida\".", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On December 25, 2022, women across Afghanistan took to the streets in protest after the Taliban issued a decree that forbade girls from attending classes. The news spread quickly through the country, quickly prompting many women and girls to organize a peaceful protest in the capital of Kabul, and other major cities throughout Afghanistan.\n\nThe women, carrying signs and banners reading \u201cEducation Is My Right\u201d and \u201cMy Voice Must Be Heard\u201d, were determined to send a clear message to the Taliban: they wanted their right to an education to be respected. However, the Taliban were not receptive to the protesters' message, and responded with a heavy-handed show of force.\n\nAs the protesters marched in the streets, the Taliban deployed water cannons, which were used to douse the marchers in water and suppress their voices. This tactic was an extreme and violent measure, as the Taliban forces began firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd to prevent them from advancing any further. \n\nThe protesters, who were mostly unarmed, were forced to flee in fear, leaving behind the banners and signs they had been holding aloft. This violence is a stark reminder of the Taliban's oppressive stance against female education, which is not something new to the region.\n\nAlthough the Taliban are often criticized for their stance against women\u2019s rights and education, the use of force against peaceful protesters is something that has been seen in other countries in the region, as well. In Iran, for example, similar tactics have been used to suppress protests in favor of education and women's rights.\n\nThe use of force against peaceful protesters has also had long-term repercussions on the women of Afghanistan. For instance, in addition to the loss of their rights to an education, the women have also been subject to a rise in violence, with instances of harassment, rape, and even murder becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe violence in Afghanistan is no doubt a matter of grave concern, as it is in other countries in the region, and the international community must work together to ensure the safety of women\u2019s rights and education in the country. That said, the international community must also recognize that violence in and of itself is not a solution, and should instead seek to address the underlying issues that lead to these incidents in the first place.\n\nTo this end, the United Nations has committed to helping support the education system in Afghanistan, while other organizations such as the Afghan Women\u2019s Network, have been working to ensure the rights of women in the country are respected. In addition, the government of Afghanistan has made efforts to address the country\u2019s education system, including the passing of a new law that guarantees free and equal access to education for both boys and girls.\n\nThe bravery and dedication of the women protesting in the streets of Afghanistan serves to remind us all that education is a human right and must be respected, no matter the situation. Hopefully, in the future, the Afghan women's voices will be heard, and the promise of education will be fulfilled in the region.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Bank of America top banker Rick Sherlund sees a major market shift ahead.\n\nAccording to Sherlund, optimism surrounding technology stocks will make a comeback this year \u2014 but the key is weathering upcoming earnings season first.\n\n\"What we need to do is de-risk 2023 numbers,\" the firm's vice chair of technology investment banking told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Thursday. \"When we go through fourth quarter earnings, I think companies will indicate a reduction in force. They'll talk about cutting back on go-to-market spending... This is all encouraging.\"\n\nSherlund's expertise is software. He hit No. 1 on Institutional Investor's all-star analyst list 17 times in a row when he was an analyst.\n\nAnd, he's known for leading Goldman Sachs' technology research team through the 2000 dot-com bubble, a time he calls \"breathtaking.\" The latest market backdrop reminds him of prior downturns.\n\n\"2022 was a terrible year for these [software] stocks,\" said Sherlund. \"We've seen tremendous compression in valuation. The good news is that downturns are ultimately followed by upturns. So, we've just got a lot of crosscurrents near-term.\"\n\nHis latest market forecast coincides with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 's latest struggles. It fell 1.47% to 10,305.24 on Thursday, and it's on the cusp of a five-week losing streak.\n\nSherlund's base case is the move to high-growth areas such as the cloud will provide a long-term boost to software stocks.\n\n\"People have to recognize that this is an economically sensitive sector,\" he said. \"Some of the demand may have been pulled forward during the pandemic period and when rates were zero.\"\n\nSherlund contends powerful secular tailwinds will ultimately lift the group. And, it should help kick off consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions in the year's second half.\n\n\"There will be an inclination to pick up the phone and have that M&A conversation where in the past it was probably little incentive to do that,\" said Sherlund. \"There's an awful lot of dry powder out there.\"\n\nHe believes stability later this year in the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike trajectory will spark deal-making by helping the challenged leveraged finance market.\n\n\"That could finance a lot more M&A and LBOs [leveraged buyouts],\" Sherlund said.\n\nDisclaimer", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On Monday, Gio Reyna's parents, Claudio and Danielle, released a statement alleging the United States men's national soccer team coach Gregg Berhalter was the target of ongoing harassment and bullying directed at their son.\n\nThe statement comes on the heels of a widely reported incident between Reyna and Berhalter that occurred after a World Cup qualifying match against Mexico in December 2020. Reyna, a rising star with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund and a member of the USMNT, was given a red card for his actions during the game.\n\nIn their statement, the Reynas allege that the incident was the culmination of a prolonged period of mistreatment and bullying by Berhalter.\n\n\"Gio is an incredibly talented player, and as such, has always been a target of Gregg Berhalter,\" the statement reads. \"Unfortunately, Gregg has used his power and position as the USMNT coach to try and manipulate Gio's behavior. We are deeply concerned with the way he has been treated by Gregg and his staff.\"\n\nThe Reynas accuse Berhalter of singling out Reyna for reprimand, which they say has had a negative effect on Reyna's mental and physical health.\n\nThey also allege that Berhalter has ignored their concerns about his treatment of Reyna, and that he has blocked their attempts to engage in conversations about how their son should be treated as a professional player.\n\nThe Reynas claim that Berhalter's behavior has become \"a pattern of mistreatment, verbal harassment, and intimidating behavior,\" which has had a profound impact on their son.\n\n\"Our son is the victim of an abusive coach who is trying to control him,\" the statement reads. \"We cannot continue to allow this to go on any longer. We will no longer sit by and be silent.\"\n\nThe statement goes on to demand that the U.S. Soccer Federation and FIFA take action, saying they must address the allegations \"so that other young players are not subjected to the same treatment.\"\n\nThe U.S. Soccer Federation released a statement shortly after the Reynas' announcement, saying it is \"monitoring this situation closely.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Berhalter denied the Reynas' allegations and said that he \"follows a strict code of conduct and professionalism when dealing with all players, regardless of age or background.\"\n\nThe statement from Berhalter added that he \"respects the rights of all individuals to express their opinion in a respectful manner.\"\n\nThe situation between Reyna and Berhalter has become a hot topic of conversation in the soccer world. The incident has highlighted the difficulties of managing young players and the difficulties coaches face in managing expectations.\n\nAt the same time, it has also sparked discussions about how coaches can create a safe and respectful environment in which young players can express themselves freely and thrive.\n\nWith the 2022 World Cup on the horizon, it remains to be seen how this issue will be handled. In the meantime, the Reynas' statement is a reminder of the importance of looking out for the well-being of players, both on and off the field.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been a cornerstone of American foreign policy since its founding in 1949, providing a unified front to confront Soviet aggression during the Cold War and deterring Russian aggression in more recent years. Yet despite the U.S. having a consistent presence in the alliance, there is still a sense of wariness about the American presence in Europe and in NATO more broadly. This wariness is due to a range of factors, from the unreliability of U.S. leadership to the lack of European members\u2019 full commitment to the organization. \n\nWith Joe Biden now in the White House, many have speculated that the U.S. may take a stronger role in NATO than under the Trump administration, leading to a renewed sense of commitment from European allies. However, that may be wishful thinking. \n\nFor many European nations, the U.S.\u2019s sometimes unpredictable behavior and disruptive foreign policy have been major obstacles to trust. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria was cited by one former NATO ambassador as \u201cthe most damaging blow to American credibility\u201d in the organization\u2019s history. That prompted a panic among U.S. allies in the region, as they were now exposed to potential danger and uncertain of U.S. reliability. \n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s approach to NATO itself has been similarly unpredictable and problematic. In 2018, Trump expressed skepticism about the value of the organization, saying \u201cit helps Europe more than us,\u201d and suggesting that he would like to \u201cget along with Russia.\u201d While these concerns may have been politically motivated, many Europeans viewed the comments as a sign that the U.S. may be planning to abandon its allies in Europe, and these fears have been persistent. \n\nBeyond these recent policies, European members have had deeper worries about the commitment of the U.S. to NATO\u2019s mission. Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. maintained its presence in Europe, but it did so at a cost. The U.S. has provided nearly two-thirds of NATO\u2019s total defense spending since its founding, and yet European members still often feel underfunded or taken for granted by American leadership. This has led to a sense of mistrust and unease among some European members, leading them to worry that the U.S. may not be fully committed to the organization. \n\nEven with a new President in office, these issues of mistrust will remain difficult to overcome. While it is likely that the Biden administration will be more supportive of NATO than the previous one, it is unlikely that the U.S. will ever be as consistent and reliable as some European nations would like. The U.S. is still the most powerful nation in NATO, and this power gives it an outsized influence in the organization. It is up to the Biden administration to show its commitment to NATO, and to create a more unified and unified front with Europe. \n\nUltimately, the best way for NATO to move forward is for the U.S. and its allies to work together to build trust and understanding. This involves providing clearer strategic plans for the organization, as well as investing in joint military operations. Additionally, the U.S. needs to be more open to listening to the concerns of its European allies, and addressing their concerns on a regular basis. As long as the U.S. can demonstrate a commitment to the alliance, it is likely that Europe will once again be willing to trust the U.S. and embrace the importance of NATO.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "ly Viewable\n\nPope Benedict XVI's tomb is now open for public viewing.\n\nVisitors to St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City can now visit the final resting place of the 265th pope, who died in April 2013.\n\nThe opening was announced Monday by the Vatican. The tomb is located in a chapel on the south side of the basilica and is adorned with an engraving of Pope Benedict's arms above an inscription honoring the first pope to resign in more than 600 years.\n\nPope Benedict, who was born Joseph Ratzinger, succeeded Pope John Paul II in 2005 and served as pope until 2013. The following year, he was elected Pope Emeritus, and chose to live in Vatican City. Pope Francis succeeded him as the 266th pope in 2013.\n\nPope Benedict's tomb was constructed in December 2012 and he was laid to rest in a private ceremony in April 2013. For the past seven years, visitors to St. Peter's Basilica have been able to see the tomb from the outside.\n\nThe tomb, which is made of pink-tinged Carrera marble, was designed by renowned Italian sculptor Floriano Bodini and is about seven feet long and four feet wide.\n\nInside, visitors can see a black bas-relief depicting Pope Benedict and a placard with his coat of arms.\n\nAccording to the Vatican, Pope Benedict's tomb was opened on the seventh anniversary of his death, and will remain open to the public indefinitely.\n\nThe public viewing of the tomb is not the only event honoring the late pontiff this month. On April 28th, the second anniversary of his election as Pope Emeritus, Pope Benedict's writings will be published in a book entitled \"The Foundation of My Beloved.\"\n\nThe book, which was authorized by Pope Benedict himself, will include words of personal reflection on his life and teachings.\n\nThe book is seen as a continuation of his work on faith and spirituality after stepping down as pope. In an essay written by the Pope himself, he wrote, \"I hope that this reflection of my thought will be useful to those who turn their gaze to seek God and to those who meditate and prayer.\"\n\nThe Vatican will also host a special Mass in honor of the late Pope Benedict on April 28th, which will be celebrated by Pope Francis.\n\nPope Benedict was an influential figure in the Catholic Church for decades before becoming pope. He has been praised for his steadfast faith and commitment to teaching Catholic principles.\n\nHis time as pope was marked by some notable moments, including the opening of relations with the Anglican Church, a push for reconciliation with China, and the publication of several encyclicals on faith, morality and spirituality.\n\nPope Benedict will long be remembered for his dedication to the Catholic Church and his teachings. His tomb at St. Peter's Basilica is a reminder of his legacy and serves as a symbol of faith for visitors who come to pay their respects.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "North Carolina breakfast chain Biscuitville announced it will increase wages by 15% in an effort to protect its staff from potential poaching by other restaurant chains in the area. The decision to raise wages comes at a time when competition for restaurant employees is at an all-time high, with many restaurants scrambling to hire and retain staff due to the growing demand for dining out.\n\nFor the past five years, Biscuitville has consistently been ranked as one of the top breakfast chains in the state of North Carolina, boasting more than 50 locations across the state. The restaurant is known for its fresh and delicious biscuits, which are made fresh daily. The chain has also become renowned for its commitment to employee satisfaction, providing competitive wages, benefits, and job security for all of its staff.\n\nNow, in an effort to stay competitive, Biscuitville is taking action to ensure that it can retain its talented and hardworking employees. Starting in February, the chain will offer a 15% increase in wages for all full-time staff, ranging from cashiers to managers. This comes at a time when there is a shortage of available restaurant employees in North Carolina, as other restaurants try to poach workers from one another.\n\nIn a statement, Biscuitville\u2019s CEO, Melissa Miller, said: \u201cAt Biscuitville, we value our employees and want to ensure that we are doing everything we can to keep them happy and secure in their jobs. We understand that there is a shortage of talented and dedicated restaurant workers in North Carolina and we want to make sure that our employees are taken care of. Increasing wages is just one way we are doing this.\u201d\n\nThe decision to raise wages has been praised by many in the local community, with some even going as far as to call it \u201ca sign of solidarity with employees.\u201d By offering competitive wages, Biscuitville is ensuring that it can not only retain its current employees but also draw in new and qualified workers. This wage increase is also expected to help address some of the wage disparities that are prevalent in the restaurant industry, and hopefully lead to better pay and working conditions for restaurant employees across North Carolina.\n\nBeyond the wage increase, Biscuitville has also made some significant changes in its benefits packages. As of February, all full-time employees will receive three weeks of paid vacation each year, along with health, dental, and vision insurance. Additionally, employees who work more than 30 hours per week will be eligible for 401k plans.\n\nThe increase in wages and improved benefits packages is undoubtedly good news for Biscuitville\u2019s employees, but it is also good news for the local community. By taking these steps to retain and attract talented restaurant staff, Biscuitville is ensuring that it will continue to provide the same high-quality breakfast meals that it has been serving up for more than five years.

By holding meetings with world leaders, Xi is showing he's China's point person for global engagement.\n\nDuring his meetings, Xi has pushed for Chinese investment in other countries, often signing economic deals with other countries' leaders. And he's built relationships with the U.S., Russia, and other countries in order to ensure a more stable and prosperous world for China.\n\nXi's meetings also show how he's trying to shape Chinese influence in global affairs. He's sought to establish more economic cooperation, especially within the BRICS group of countries, of which China is a member, and increase cultural and academic exchange.\n\nBut at times, Xi's meetings have also caused controversy. For example, his meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018 and 2019 sparked worries in the U.S. that Xi was helping Kim maintain his grip on power. \n\nAnd his visit to the U.S. in 2015 was seen as less than productive, as the two countries still had issues to settle around trade and human rights.\n\nNevertheless, Xi has managed to successfully balance both foreign and domestic issues to strengthen his leadership role. Since assuming office, he's cracked down on government corruption, invested in the nation's infrastructure, and even managed to launch a successful anti-poverty campaign, among other things.\n\nHis meetings with world leaders, then, appear to be one more way in which he's solidifying his place in China's history books. As of Tuesday, Xi has met with more than 25 world leaders since 2014 and even more are likely to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the increasing popularity of short-term vacation rentals continues to shape the hospitality industry, governments around the world are taking a closer look at how these services should be regulated. In an effort to balance the interests of vacation rental owners, guests, and local communities, many cities are now implementing laws to restrict or limit the operation of these types of rentals.\n\nIn the coming year, at least 24 cities are planning to introduce laws or restrictions that will make it more difficult to own or manage a short-term vacation rental. These cities are located across the United States, Europe, and Canada.\n\nThe city of Austin, Texas is one of the most restrictive cities when it comes to vacation rentals. In December, the city council passed an ordinance that will ban the operation of any new vacation rental units within the city limits. Existing units can stay, but there will be restrictions on the number of nights that a unit can be rented out. Owners will also have to obtain a license from the city and pay an annual fee.\n\nIn Los Angeles, California, the city council is considering an ordinance that would place restrictions on the number of units that owners can list on vacation rental websites. Under the proposed ordinance, owners would be limited to a maximum of two units per building, with certain exceptions for luxury apartments and developments. The ordinance would also require owners to obtain a permit from the city in order to list their properties.\n\nIn the historic city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, the city council is planning to ban all short-term vacation rentals, except for those in designated tourist areas. The ban is intended to protect the city\u2019s long-term rental housing stock and to ensure that visitors to the city pay hotel taxes. Owners who currently have vacation rentals in the city will be grandfathered in, but will face restrictions on the number of nights that their units can be rented out.\n\nIn Europe, the city of Paris has implemented a number of regulations that have made it more difficult to own or manage a short-term vacation rental. In March, the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, signed a decree that requires vacation rental owners to apply for a permit, which can take up to six months to process. The law also requires owners to provide proof that they own or control the unit, and to limit the number of nights that it can be rented out.\n\nIn Madrid, Spain, the city council recently passed a law that requires all vacation rental owners to register their units with the city. Owners will also have to provide proof that their units meet certain safety standards, and that they comply with local regulations.\n\nIn Berlin, Germany, a new law will require owners to apply for a license and pay an annual fee. The law will also limit the number of nights that a unit can be rented out, and will require owners to provide proof of ownership or management.\n\nIn the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Calgary, the cities are both implementing rules to restrict the operation of short-term vacation rentals. In Vancouver, the city council is planning to implement a licensing system, which will require owners to obtain a permit and pay a fee. Owners in Calgary will also have to obtain a permit and pay a fee, but they will be subject to fewer restrictions than owners in Vancouver.\n\nIn addition to the cities listed above, there are several other cities in Europe, the United States, and Canada that are considering laws or restrictions that could make it more difficult to own or manage a short-term vacation rental. This includes London, Amsterdam, and Montreal.\n\nAs the demand for short-term vacation rentals continues to grow, many cities are recognizing the need to regulate these services in order to protect local communities and housing stock. While these restrictions may be inconvenient for owners and guests, they are likely to help ensure that the industry continues to thrive in the long run.", "label": "machine"}

In 2019, more than 2 million Chinese visitors traveled to the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. government is also recommending that travelers to the U.S. from other countries be tested for Covid-19 before their departure, though this is not a requirement.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also urging travelers to take additional precautions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and frequently washing hands.\n\nThe new requirement is yet another sign of the potential for long-term effects from the Covid-19 pandemic. The virus has upended lives and economies around the world, and will likely continue to do so in 2021 and beyond.\n\nTravel is expected to remain severely restricted for much of 2021, and the U.S. government's latest move is a sign that the virus will be a major factor in international travel for the foreseeable future.", "label": "machine"}

The lawsuit claims that the bank \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that Epstein was running a \u201csexual abuse, sex trafficking and human trafficking business\u201d and helped facilitate his activities.\n\n\u201cBy providing financial and other services to Epstein and entities he controlled, JPMorgan Chase, knowing and deliberately indifferent to Epstein\u2019s activities, pulled the levers of Epstein\u2019s business enterprise and made Epstein\u2019s sex-trafficking enterprise possible,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that JPMorgan provided Epstein with a variety of services that included opening bank accounts, depositing money, providing financing and other forms of support for his alleged criminal activities. The bank was reportedly Epstein\u2019s primary financial institution and was among the entities named in a wrongful death lawsuit against his estate that was filed by one of Epstein\u2019s victims.\n\nThe Virgin Islands\u2019 lawsuit also claims that JPMorgan \u201cfailed to take appropriate and/or required action in response to red flags raised by Epstein\u2019s activities\u201d and had knowledge of his activities that it did not act on.\n\nThe complaint alleges that JPMorgan knew or should have known that Epstein was exploiting young women, yet \u201ctook no action to mitigate its own risks or protect its customers, the public or the vulnerable young women who were the victims of Epstein\u2019s illicit activities.\u201d\n\nThe bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe complaint alleges that JPMorgan was \u201cmotivated\u201d by profits from its business relationship with Epstein, which included \u201cmillions of dollars in fees and income.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages for the victims of Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes and an injunction to stop the bank from taking any action that would facilitate sex trafficking.\n\nThe complaint is the latest legal action to be taken against JPMorgan in relation to Epstein. Last month, the bank agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought by victims of Epstein\u2019s alleged sex trafficking activities.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands is also suing other entities connected to Epstein, including his estate, multiple companies he owned, and other banks such as Deutsche Bank and UBS.\n\nThe lawsuit against JPMorgan is the latest chapter in the saga surrounding Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Since his arrest, numerous women have come forward with allegations of abuse at the hands of Epstein, and the financier\u2019s alleged role in a wide-reaching sex trafficking operation has been widely publicized.\n\nThough JPMorgan has not been charged with any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, the lawsuit is the latest example of the bank being held accountable for its business dealings with the disgraced financier.

{"text": "Tesla Inc.'s stock has been on a wild ride in recent years, with dramatic highs and lows. But the electric car maker's future could still be in doubt if it's valued like a traditional automaker such as Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Co., an investment chief warns.\n\nSteve Deroian, chief investment officer of Black Mountain Capital Management, told Business Insider on Monday that Tesla's sky-high valuation could still come tumbling down if it's valued in the same way traditional automakers are.\n\n\"We see the market valuing Tesla as a technology company, which is why its price-to-earnings ratio has been so high,\" Deroian said. \"But if you take that same valuation approach and apply it to traditional automakers, you could see Tesla's stock price fall more than 60 percent from its current level. We're already starting to see that play out a bit in the market.\"\n\nTesla's stock price has been on a roller coaster ride since it went public in 2010, reaching a high of $420 per share in June 2017 and a low of $176 per share in June 2019. The stock has more than tripled since then, reaching $580 per share at the close of trading on Monday.\n\nThe stock has been boosted in part by investor optimism about Tesla's growing electric vehicle business, as well as its potential to disrupt the traditional auto industry. But some analysts and investors say the company's current valuation is too high, and that it is being treated like a technology company when, in fact, it is still a traditional carmaker with all the risks that come with it.\n\nIn particular, Deroian noted, Tesla's current price-to-earnings ratio, a key measure of stock valuation, is much higher than that of traditional automakers such as Ford and GM. Ford's P/E ratio is 8.6, while GM's is 7.6. Tesla, however, has a P/E ratio of 116.\n\n\"If you value Tesla like you value GM or Ford, and you apply the same metrics, you could easily see Tesla's stock price fall more than 60 percent,\" Deroian said. \"It could even fall more than that.\"\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that Tesla is a bad investment, Deroian added. Instead, it means investors should be aware of the risks of investing in the company.\n\n\"Investors need to understand that Tesla's current valuation is inflated, and that there is a possibility of a significant correction in the stock price,\" Deroian said. \"It's important for investors to be aware of this risk and make informed decisions when investing in Tesla's stock.\"\n\nHe added that Tesla's long-term prospects remain bright, and that the company's electric vehicles could still revolutionize the auto industry.\n\n\"Tesla is still a game-changer, and if they can execute on their plans, they could be a major player in the future of transportation,\" Deroian said. \"That said, investors should always be aware of potential downside risks, and Tesla's valuation could still come down if it's valued like a traditional automaker.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When one thinks of iconic American cities such as New York, Washington, and Boston, many things come to mind \u2013 skyscrapers, gleaming monuments, and, yes, long traffic jams. But these cities, long known for their relentless transportation congestion, may finally be ready to make a significant shift toward a sustainable, green way of getting around: free public buses.\n\nPublic transportation in all three cities has been a staple since the 1950s, but the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented decrease in ridership. According to a recent report from the Brookings Institution, ridership in Washington and Boston has dropped 87 percent since last March. In New York City, it\u2019s dropped more than 80 percent. This decline has come with a notable dip in fare revenue, leading all three cities to explore ways to increase ridership and close their budget gaps. One potential solution gaining traction is free public buses.\n\nFor many, free public buses seem like a radical idea. But it\u2019s actually a concept that has been around for decades, and it\u2019s had a great deal of success in cities like San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Tallinn, Estonia. In all three of these cities, free public bus services have had a positive impact on ridership, air quality, and overall quality of life.\n\nIn New York, city officials are exploring the feasibility of a free public bus system. A proposal submitted to the City Council earlier this month detailed plans for the city to subsidize three existing commuter bus lines, two in Manhattan and one in Queens. The proposal also calls for the city to expand the network over the next five years, with the goal of providing service to \u201cevery major shopping district, employment center, and popular tourist destination.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, a recent report by the DC Policy Center showed that a free public bus system could generate $12.5 million in annual revenue. The report also revealed that the cost of providing free bus service would be significantly lower than the cost of buying new buses, which could free up funds for other much-needed transportation investments.\n\nAnd in Boston, the city is looking to address its aging public transportation system with a new free bus program. The city announced last month that it will provide fare-free rides on the existing MBTA bus system. This program, which will be funded through taxes and grants, is expected to reduce congestion and increase ridership throughout the city.\n\nFree public buses in all three cities could have a major impact on transportation and the environment. Free bus systems could make public transportation more accessible, leading to less car traffic and fewer carbon emissions. Free buses could also help to reduce income inequality by giving low-income families better access to job opportunities, as well as health care and other essential services.\n\nFree public buses have already proven to be successful in many cities around the world, and now it looks like New York, Washington, and Boston may be ready to join the movement. With the pandemic having strained the public transportation systems in these cities, the potential benefits of free public buses could not come at a better time. If implemented correctly, free public buses could provide a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally-friendly way to get around these iconic American cities.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ". \n\nLess than a week after a historic attempt to impeach the sitting Republican House Speaker, the tumultuous political climate surrounding the U.S. House of Representatives has resulted in a victory for democracy and a stunning defeat for the current Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nIn a dramatic and decisive vote, the House of Representatives on Friday voted overwhelmingly to reject McCarthy\u2019s attempts to stay on as Speaker, instead choosing Democratic Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva as the new House Speaker.\n\nThe vote to replace McCarthy marked the first time since 1869 that the House has voted to remove a Speaker, and it followed an impassioned floor debate in which both Republicans and Democrats spoke in favor of the Democratic nominee for Speaker.\n\n\u201cI stand here today in support of the people of this great nation and the core value of democracy,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff, the leader of the Democratic opposition. \u201cThis is a moment in our history that should be celebrated as a victory for democracy and a defeat for those who sought to weaken it.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, who had been the Republican minority leader in the House since 2013, had been widely expected to remain in the position. However, it became clear that his support among the Republican caucus was waning as he found himself ensnared in several embarrassing political scandals that damaged his credibility and public image.\n\nThe most damaging of these was his involvement in the so-called \"Trump-Russia\" affair, in which evidence emerged that he had sought to pressure the Justice Department to protect Trump from investigation.\n\nIn response to the growing dissatisfaction among House Republicans, McCarthy attempted to sway the vote in his favor by threatening to bring the House into chaos and shut it down if he was removed. But the attempt failed, and McCarthy was ultimately forced to concede defeat as the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in favor of Grijalva.\n\nGrijalva, who had previously served as the chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, immediately sought to make his mark as the new Speaker by emphasizing the importance of Democratic values and of working together for the betterment of the nation.\n\n\u201cLet us all move forward in the spirit of justice,\u201d Grijalva said following the vote. \u201cLet us all make sure that we uphold the rule of law and ensure that our government works for the people, and not just the powerful. This is the goal of this House and this is the goal of this new Speaker.\u201d\n\nGrijalva\u2019s election to the position of House Speaker marks an important moment in U.S. history, and has been welcomed by many as a sign that democracy is still alive and well in America. \n\nThe Republican Party has also welcomed the result, with many members of the House citing the vote as a way to move forward in a more unified direction.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that this vote will be a signal to us all that we can, and must, move forward in a spirit of collaboration, not just as members of the House, but as representatives of the people,\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise, the House Republican leader. \u201cThis is an important moment for us all and I congratulate Representative Grijalva on his victory.\u201d\n\nDespite his loss, McCarthy is expected to remain a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and has already stated that he intends to remain an active part of the party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the many members of the House who supported me throughout this process,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement following the vote. \u201cI am disappointed in the outcome, but remain committed to working with my colleagues in the House and with the leadership of the Republican Party to ensure that we have a strong voice in this great nation.\u201d\n\nThe ouster of McCarthy and the election of Grijalva has marked a historic change in the House of Representatives, one that many are hopeful will lead to more bipartisan collaboration on important issues.\n\nOnly time will tell if the new House will be able to live up to these expectations, but for now, it\u2019s clear that McCarthy\u2019s loss has been a victory for democracy and for the United States.", "label": "machine"}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nThere\u2019s an old Warren Buffett quote that\u2019s become something of a clich\u00e9: \u201cYou only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\u201d\n\nBut the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s words have become clich\u00e9 only because of how reliable they are. Markets fall, and suddenly the hucksters and schemers have lost their cover. Look no further than the crypto industry circa 2020-2023.\n\nAfter a pandemic-driven boom, huge swaths of the digital asset space are going bust. Even the seemingly mainstream, strait-laced players, appear suspect.\n\nSee here: In just the past few days, at least four crypto and crypto-adjacent giants have made headlines that have sent a chill through an already anxious community. It\u2019s the kind of negative press that the crypto faithful want to either ignore completely or denounce as a fringe, one-off scandal. But crypto is a tight-knit web, and when one corner collapses it puts the whole lot at risk. (Bloomberg News built a handy chart to illustrate those complex connections.)\n\nFirst, the elephant in the room: Sam Bankman-Fried, the former crypto golden boy, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal fraud and conspiracy charges linked to his failed exchange platform FTX.\n\nIn the two months since FTX and dozens of its affiliates collapsed \u2014 an implosion sparked by a liquidity crisis that exposed what prosecutors have called one the biggest frauds in American history \u2014 dozens of firms have been hit with losses or even gone bankrupt.\n\nOn Thursday, Silvergate Capital, a crypto-focused bank, said that total deposits from digital asset customers fell 68% in the last quarter of 2022, to just $3.5 billion from nearly 12 billion. As of December 31, roughly $150 million of Silvergate\u2019s deposits were from customers that have filed for bankruptcy.\n\nSilvergate shares fell more than 40% Thursday after bank said it would lay off 40% its staff, or about 200 people.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not done yet\u2026\n\nAlso this week:\n\nCoinbase, a publicly traded US crypto platform, agreed to a $100 million settlement after a New York regulator found \u201csignificant failures\u201d to comply with the state\u2019s anti-money-laundering laws. Those compliance lapses, the regulator said, could have exposed the platform to criminal activity including suspected child sexual abuse-related activity and potential narcotics trafficking.\n\nThe SEC charged six people in an investment scheme named CoinDeal that raised more than $45 million on false promises of access to blockchain technology. (To be clear, CoinDeal isn\u2019t a crypto firm, just good old fashioned scam, but the tens of thousands of people who invested in it didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nThe former CEO of Celsius Networks was sued by the New York attorney general for allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors who deposited billions of dollars into the platform before it went bankrupt in July \u2014 one of the early implosions in the so-called crypto winter that eventually took down FTX.\n\nCrypto lender Genesis Global Trading laid off 30% of its staff and is considering filing for bankruptcy, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Genesis is dealing with steep losses from loans it made to Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-bankrupt Alameda hedge fund as well as Three Arrows Capital, which \u2014 surprise! \u2014 is also bankrupt.\n\nFinally, a little late to the party, US regulators issued their first joint statement warning banks and other market participants about the risks of fraud, volatility, and shoddy risk management in the crypto world. \u201cIt is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,\u201d read the statement, issued jointly by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nBottom line: I\u2019m not here to write crypto\u2019s obit, and I am well aware that there are plenty of legitimate crypto enterprises out there. Trouble is, it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, for any of us to know which ones are selling snake oil. And it seems regulators are only just now realizing that crypto isn\u2019t some fad they can just close their eyes to and hope fizzles out. Banks and exchanges need regulation. But no one within crypto agrees on what those regulations should look like, and some dispute the need for regulation in the first place.\n\nSo what\u2019s an investor to do?

{"text": "Dec 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit accusing Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and several other companies of violating the privacy of children under age 13 by tracking their YouTube activity without parental consent, in order to send them targeted advertising.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle said Congress did not intend to pre-empt state law-based privacy claims by adopting the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.\n\nThat law gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, but not private plaintiffs, the authority to regulate the online collection of personal data about children under age 13.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Google's data collection violated similar state laws, and that YouTube content providers such as Hasbro Inc (HAS.O), Mattel Inc (MAT.O), the Cartoon Network (WBD.O) and DreamWorks Animation (CMCSA.O) lured children to their channels, knowing that they would be tracked.\n\nIn July 2021, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Francisco dismissed the lawsuit, saying the federal privacy law pre-empted the plaintiffs' claims under California, Colorado, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Tennessee law.\n\nBut in Wednesday's 3-0 decision, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said the federal law's wording made it \"nonsensical\" to assume Congress intended to bar the plaintiffs from invoking state laws targeting the same alleged misconduct.\n\nThe case was returned to Freeman to consider other grounds that Google and the content providers might have to dismiss it.\n\nLawyers for Google and the content providers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

{"text": "issues\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy revealed on Thursday that Republicans have plans to pursue immigration reform, address \u201cwoke\u201d education policies and increase funding for the IRS.\n\nMcCarthy said that one of the first priorities of the GOP in the 117th Congress, which began on Jan. 3, is to make \u201creal reform\u201d to the immigration system in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a system that no one can defend,\u201d McCarthy said in a speech on the House floor. \u201cAmericans who want to come to this country legally should not have to wait in endless lines and go through endless paperwork. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, a California Republican, also argued that the government should provide greater resources to the IRS, which he said has been underfunded for years and has been unable to keep up with the modern economy.\n\n\u201cWe can make sure that the IRS is able to keep up with the latest technologies and tools to ensure compliance, and we can put our resources toward helping people who can\u2019t afford to pay their taxes,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThe House speaker also said that he and the GOP plan to address the growing influence of \u201cwoke\u201d education policies and curriculum. He argued that the government should ensure that students are exposed to both sides of the argument and that they are encouraged to think critically and independently.\n\n\u201cWe will fight against the rampant censorship of free speech, and push back against the rise of academic indoctrination,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe will ensure that our children are taught the values of patriotism, honor, and responsibility.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s speech comes as the Republican Party is trying to position itself as the party of \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d policies in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Although Trump remains popular among Republicans, the party has been looking for a new leader to take the helm and usher in a new era of Republican policy.\n\nThe House speaker\u2019s speech also comes at a critical time for immigration reform. The Biden administration has made immigration a priority and is expected to introduce sweeping reforms that could bring in millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Biden administration is also likely to push for an increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers allowed into the country. Republicans, however, have argued that the government should focus on securing the border first before making any major changes to the immigration system.\n\nWhile the GOP is unlikely to support many of the immigration reforms that the Biden administration is likely to push for, McCarthy\u2019s speech signals that the party is willing to work towards making changes to the immigration system that both sides can agree on.\n\nAt the same time, McCarthy\u2019s remarks show that the GOP is looking to move away from some of the more extreme positions they adopted under the Trump administration. McCarthy\u2019s pledge to tackle \u201cwoke\u201d education policies, for example, signals that the party is no longer content with the hardline stances that the former president embraced.\n\nOverall, McCarthy\u2019s speech on Thursday signals the GOP is ready to move away from the Trump era and usher in a new era of Republican politics. By focusing on immigration reform, increasing IRS funding, and addressing \u201cwoke\u201d education policies, McCarthy is hoping to show that the party is looking to govern in a more inclusive way. Whether or not these policies can gain traction in Congress remains to be seen, but McCarthy has certainly made it clear that the GOP is ready to move away from the hardline stances of the past.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The summit of Mount Everest is one of the most sought-after goals for high-altitude climbers. But it\u2019s also one of the most hazardous environments in the world\u2014located in a region of the atmosphere referred to as the \u201cdeath zone.\u201d\n\nAt an altitude of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet), the summit of Mount Everest is the highest point on Earth. With its rocky terrain, extreme temperatures, and lack of oxygen, scaling the mountain is an arduous and dangerous undertaking.\n\nAbove 8,000 meters (26,000 feet), the oxygen levels are so low that human beings are unable to survive for very long. This region is referred to as the \u201cdeath zone,\u201d and attempting to climb it can take a deadly toll on the body.\n\nIn this article, we take a look at the physical and physiological effects of climbing in the death zone, as well as what precautions climbers can take to try and reduce their risk of injury and illness.\n\nWhat is the \u2018death zone\u2019?\n\nThe \u201cdeath zone\u201d is the region of the atmosphere above 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) where the human body is no longer able to function properly. At this altitude, the oxygen levels in the atmosphere are so low that the body is unable to absorb enough oxygen to survive.\n\nThe air pressure at this altitude is also very low, which can cause the lungs to fill with fluid and collapse. Climbers must use supplemental oxygen in order to survive.\n\nThe \u201cdeath zone\u201d also refers to the psychological effects of climbing in extreme environments. The effects of fatigue, hypoxia, and other mental stresses can cause climbers to make poor decisions, increasing their risk of injury or death.\n\nWhat happens to the body in the death zone?\n\nAt altitudes above 8,000 meters, the body undergoes a number of physical and physiological changes that can be dangerous and even deadly. As oxygen levels drop, climbers can experience a range of symptoms, including:\n\n\u2022 Hypoxia: This is a condition in which the body isn\u2019t getting enough oxygen to survive. Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, and headache.\n\n\u2022 High-altitude pulmonary edema: This is a condition in which fluid builds up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.\n\n\u2022 High-altitude cerebral edema: This is a condition in which fluid builds up in the brain, causing headaches, confusion, and loss of consciousness.\n\n\u2022 Swelling: The low atmospheric pressure at high altitudes can cause the body\u2019s cells to swell, causing discomfort and impairing the body\u2019s ability to absorb oxygen.\n\n\u2022 Fatigue: The body\u2019s cells become starved for oxygen, resulting in extreme fatigue.\n\n\u2022 Immune system suppression: The extreme conditions of the death zone can impair the body\u2019s immune system, making climbers more susceptible to infection.\n\nThese conditions can be extremely dangerous, and can even lead to death if not treated promptly.\n\nHow can climbers protect themselves in the death zone?\n\nClimbers must take extreme precautions when attempting to climb in the death zone. These include:\n\n\u2022 Using supplemental oxygen: Supplemental oxygen can be used to try and combat the effects of hypoxia. It\u2019s essential that climbers use an oxygen mask and regulator when climbing above 8,000 meters.\n\n\u2022 Acclimatization: The body needs time to adjust to the lower oxygen levels of the death zone. Climbers should take breaks every 200 to 300 meters in order to give the body time to adjust.\n\n\u2022 Hydration: Staying hydrated is essential when climbing in the death zone. It\u2019s important to drink plenty of fluids, as the body needs water to function properly.\n\n\u2022 Nutrition: Proper nutrition is essential to keep the body functioning at its peak. Climbers should eat plenty of carbohydrates and protein to give their body the energy it needs.\n\n\u2022 Rest: Rest is essential for climbers attempting to summit Mount Everest. Taking regular rest breaks can help the body to cope with the stresses of the environment.\n\n\u2022 Prevention: Taking steps to prevent altitude sickness is essential. This includes avoiding alcohol, eating properly, and taking medication if prescribed.\n\nClimbing in the death zone of Mount Everest is one of the most hazardous undertakings a person can attempt. By taking the necessary precautions and understanding the effects of the environment, climbers can reduce their risk of injury and illness. But even with the proper precautions, the death zone can still be a deadly place.", "label": "machine"}

According to the La Plata County Sheriff's Office, at 11:30 a.m., Shultz and his son were hit by an avalanche on the east side of the resort, near the bottom of a steep bowl.\n\nThe father was able to free himself from the snow before he was tragically buried again and covered in snow. Emergency crews were unable to save him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBrandon, however, was saved by a group of ski patrollers who were able to dig him out and bring him to safety.\n\nIt was a sunny day at the resort when the avalanche occurred, but ski patroller manager Mark Fetch said that visibility was poor in the backcountry.\n\n\"The snow had been falling for three days straight and even with ski patrol\u2019s assessment, we couldn\u2019t really see the terrain,\" Fetch told local news outlets.\n\nThe ski resort was closed for a day after the tragedy, and grief counselors have been made available for resort employees who witnessed the incident. The resort also issued a statement expressing their sympathies and condolences to the family, who had skied at the resort for many years.\n\n\u201cOur hearts break for the family and our community. Purgatory Resort is a family resort and we take the safety of our guests, employees and those who live or recreate in the mountain environment very seriously,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe area where the avalanche occurred is a backcountry area that is open to public use, but it is within the ski resort's property lines. An investigation by the La Plata County Sheriff's Office revealed that the skiers were on the south side of a valley, which was known to have dangerous terrain.\n\nThe San Juan Mountain Range in Colorado is known for having some of the most dangerous avalanche terrain in the state. Ski patrollers do daily evaluations of the mountain to determine if it is safe to ski, but despite their efforts, sometimes the snow can be unstable and prone to avalanches.\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) issues avalanche advisories daily during the winter, warning skiers and snowboarders about unstable snow conditions in the area.

{"text": ".\n\nThe year 2020 was one for the books. With the pandemic upending economies around the world, markets suffered some of the biggest swings in recent memory. But despite all of the disruption, savvy investors still made money in the chaos. How did they do it?\n\nTo many investors, the seeming randomness of the markets can be daunting. But beneath the surface, there are patterns, and those patterns can be used to anticipate how the markets will move. For those investors who were able to capitalize on the volatility of 2020, they found success by understanding the method behind the markets\u2019 madness.\n\nThe markets of 2020 saw a lot of movement, with stock prices oscillating wildly throughout the year. But while it seemed chaotic, there were identifiable patterns that investors could latch onto. The key to successful investing during this time was recognizing those patterns and taking advantage of them.\n\nOne of the most important patterns was the rise and fall of \u201crisk on\u201d and \u201crisk off\u201d investing. During periods of market stress, \u201crisk off\u201d investing becomes the preferred choice for investors. This is a strategy of investing in traditionally \u201csafe\u201d assets, such as bonds and cash, as opposed to stocks and other \u201crisky\u201d assets. When investors are feeling confident about the future, they often switch into \u201crisk on\u201d investing, which is characterized by buying more stocks and other more volatile assets.\n\nTo capitalize on this pattern, investors need to be able to predict when the market will turn from \u201crisk off\u201d to \u201crisk on.\u201d To do this, they need to watch for tell-tale signs, such as changes in interest rates, changes in market sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.\n\nAnother key pattern to watch for is the \u201cfear index.\u201d This refers to the volatility of a particular stock or index. When fear is low, that often signals that investors are feeling optimistic, while higher volatility signals investor anxiety. By monitoring the fear index, investors can get a better idea of where the markets are headed and plan accordingly.\n\nFinally, investors need to pay close attention to \u201cvaluation gap.\u201d This refers to the difference between what a stock is worth and what investors are willing to pay for it. When the gap is wide, that\u2019s a signal that stocks are overvalued and could be poised for a correction. On the other hand, if the gap is narrow, then stocks may be undervalued and could be headed for a jump.\n\nBy understanding the patterns and indicators of the markets, investors can make informed decisions about when to buy and when to sell. This isn\u2019t to say that investing is a fool-proof endeavor. As 2020 demonstrated, even the most experienced investors can get caught on the wrong side of a trade. But by being aware of the patterns, they can at least give themselves the best chance at success.\n\nThe markets are often unpredictable, but by understanding the method behind the madness, savvy investors can position themselves to capitalize on opportunities and potentially outperform their peers. This strategy isn\u2019t just applicable to 2020; it\u2019s something that any investor should be aware of and take advantage of in any market.", "label": "machine"}

Levi is best known for his colorful and vibrant artwork, and has made a name for himself as the \u201cPop Art Rabbi.\u201d\n\nThe Skokie Jewish center will feature a collection of three artworks by Levi. The most prominent of the pieces is a mural, which Levi hopes will act as a beacon of hope to inspire a sense of unity within the Jewish community.\n\nThe mural, which measures just over twenty-five feet tall, is comprised of vibrant colors and a variety of Jewish symbols. On the left side of the mural, a large scale Jewish star is placed in the center. Flanking the star are images of ancient Hebrew texts, with phrases from the Torah written in intricate letters. Just above these words, a small illustration of a dove is seen, signifying peace and unity.\n\nTo the right of the star is a beautiful painting of a menorah surrounded by flowers, each petal intricately designed with Hebrew lettering. Just below the menorah, four colorful stripes are represented, symbolizing the four seasons and representing the cycle of life.\n\nAt the bottom of the mural, a prayer shawl and a bundle of Matzah can be seen. On the left side of the mural, a symbol of a hand is depicted as a sign of unity and a reminder of the importance of doing \u201cMitzvahs\u201d or good deeds.\n\nAccording to Levi, the artwork is meant to inspire a sense of connectedness within the Jewish community. \u201cThe Mitzvah has many layers and interpretations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is an act of giving, of performing an act of kindness, of taking care of one another.\u201d He hopes that the mural will act as a reminder to visitors of the importance of performing acts of kindness and unity.\n\nLevi\u2019s artwork is not the only thing that visitors will find at the Skokie Jewish center. The center also houses a library and research center, a synagogue, and a range of programs and activities designed to promote a sense of community and solidarity within the Jewish faith.\n\nLevi\u2019s artwork is the latest addition to a growing list of Israeli artworks that have made their way to the United States. Other well-known Israeli artists such as Michal Neeman, Shai Feingold, and Avishay Mizrahi have each had their own works displayed in the US, including a series of works in the San Francisco MOMA by Neeman.\n\nThe Skokie Jewish center has certainly made its presence known within the area. It has become a safe haven for the Jewish community in Skokie, a place to gather and share traditions and faith. Levi\u2019s mural serves as a reminder of the importance of unity, understanding, and kindness - values that will ensure the continued strength and resiliency of the Jewish faith.", "label": "machine"}

That's up from a rate of 7.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2019 and the highest rate since at least 1999.\n\nThe rise in overdose deaths was driven largely by fentanyl and its analogs, synthetic opioids that are up to 50 times more potent than heroin. The CDC report found that fatalities involving synthetic opioids, including illicit fentanyl, rose by more than 50% among people aged 15-19, from 546 in 2019 to 837 in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nThe surge in deaths is not unexpected, experts say. During the pandemic, many of the services and supports that help young people stay safe and healthy\u2014such as schools, youth programs, and addiction treatment facilities\u2014have been closed or limited.\n\n\"We knew these restrictions would be hard on young people, and tragically, the data is proving that,\" said Aaron Weiner, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Community Research Group.\n\nThe increase in overdose deaths also reflects the large amounts of illicit fentanyl that are now flooding the black market. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has reported that the quantity of illicit fentanyl seized by law enforcement has increased drastically over the past year, while the number of seizures involving heroin has declined.\n\nIn addition to fentanyl, the DEA has noted a rise in overdoses related to other synthetic opioids such as carfentanil, which is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, and U-47700, an opioid more than seven times more powerful than morphine.\n\nThe DEA also noted an increase in overdoses from prescription drugs, such as opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants. The CDC report found that overdoses from such drugs rose 31.4% among teenagers during the first nine months of 2020.\n\nThe report also noted that more than half of the overdose deaths among teenagers were among Hispanic or Latino teenagers, and that Black teenagers had higher overdose death rates than White teenagers.\n\nExperts say the findings are deeply concerning and underscore the urgent need for more action to prevent overdoses and support people affected by substance use disorder.\n\n\"The death toll from this pandemic is heartbreaking and unacceptable, and this report underscores the critical need to support young people affected by substance use disorder,\u201d said Eliza Wheeler, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\nShe called on state and local governments to prioritize funding for services and treatment for young people affected by substance use disorder, as well as expanding access to naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\n\"We must also address the underlying causes of the substance use disorder crisis, such as poverty, racism, and lack of access to mental health treatment,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nThe CDC report comes as the nation is seeing a surge in cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations, and as the new Biden administration prepares to take office in January.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has pledged to prioritize the opioid crisis and has proposed investing $125 billion over the next decade to prevent and treat substance use disorder.\n\n\"We hope the Biden administration will make good on his promises, and that Congress will pass the necessary legislation to fund these initiatives and keep young people safe,\" said Weiner.", "label": "machine"}

This would be its worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the tech giant reported operating profit of 6.6 trillion won.\n\nThe grim earnings forecast comes as the memory chip market, one of Samsung\u2019s most profitable businesses, has been plunged into chaos by a steep decline in prices due to oversupply.\n\nThe price of NAND flash memory, one of Samsung\u2019s main products, has dropped around 40 percent since last October as the industry has been hit by a wave of oversupply.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the prices of NAND flash memory chips fell 15 percent from the previous quarter, the worst quarterly decline since 2013, according to research firm DRAMeXchange.\n\nThe steep drop in prices has been difficult for Samsung and its competitors to manage, with the South Korean tech giant posting its first profit decline in two years in the third quarter.\n\nIt has since moved to shift production away from memory chips and into other areas such as display panels and artificial intelligence (AI), in a bid to offset losses from its memory chip business.\n\nBut analysts say the market carnage has continued, and Samsung is now facing a sharp drop in profits in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cSamsung\u2019s fourth quarter earnings will likely be in the red as expected,\u201d Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities, told CNBC. \u201cDespite Samsung\u2019s shift to its next businesses, the market carnage in the memory chip sector has continued.\u201d\n\nSamsung\u2019s mobile business is also expected to take a hit in the fourth quarter, as the company faces increasing competition from Chinese rivals such as Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy S9 and Note 9 flagships have failed to live up to the expectations of the market, with their sales slowing in the fourth quarter, according to counterpoint research.\n\nHowever, analysts say the tech giant\u2019s strong presence in the semiconductor market is expected to remain unchanged in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe expect Samsung to remain the leader in the semiconductor market for a long time despite the current difficulties,\u201d said Lee Dong-wook, an analyst at Mirae Asset Daewoo.\n\nOverall, Samsung\u2019s fourth quarter earnings are expected to be grim, but the company is expected to make a comeback in the first quarter of 2019 as the memory chip market improves.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the memory chip market in 2019 is relatively positive, so we expect Samsung\u2019s earnings to rebound in the first quarter,\u201d Park said.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For the last several years, the U.S. labor market has steadily improved, with employment growth and wages rising. But there\u2019s one key metric that\u2019s been hidden in plain sight, says Mike Rowe \u2014 and it\u2019s one of the most alarming statistics of all.\n\nRowe, the TV personality best known for his show Dirty Jobs, recently spoke at the 2018 FreedomFest in Las Vegas about the impact that a decreasing labor participation rate has had on Americans. He pointed to a statistic recently highlighted by an Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity working paper that shows how the number of \u201cmarginally attached\u201d workers \u2014 those who are no longer looking for work because they\u2019re \u201cdiscouraged\u201d or \u201cunable\u201d to find a job \u2014 has jumped to seven million.\n\nThat\u2019s a 12 percent increase from the same time last year, according to the paper. Of those seven million, five million are male.\n\n\u201cThose seven million \u2018done\u2019 people represent a huge cost to our economy,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cWe\u2019re literally missing the contributions of men who have run out of fight. Seven million people are on the sidelines, unable to find work, and they\u2019re still waiting to be rescued.\u201d\n\nRowe warned that this trend is having a profound impact on society, since these are often men who, when they were employed, often made a big contribution to the family\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThis is serious,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cThis is one of the most alarming statistics we\u2019ve seen in this entire recession. And yet it\u2019s one of the least talked about and least understood.\u201d\n\nSo what is causing this number to swell? Rowe believes that the economy has become so competitive and so demanding that many of the seven million \u201cdone\u201d workers simply don\u2019t have the necessary skills to compete for a job or, for whatever reason, don\u2019t have the motivation to look for one.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about how our economy needs workers,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we talk enough about how our economy needs people who are actually equipped to handle the job that\u2019s in front of them. There\u2019s an incredible amount of talent and capability in this country \u2014 so much so, that we can\u2019t find a place for seven million people who are sitting on the sidelines right now.\u201d\n\nRowe says that the answer lies in making sure that everyone has the opportunity to develop the necessary skills to thrive in today\u2019s economy \u2014 something he is passionate about. He started his Mike Rowe Works Foundation to \u201cclose the skills gap\u201d and help people gain the skills they need to be successful in the job market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the skills you\u2019re born with or the college you attend that will open doors for you,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s the skills you develop after leaving school.\u201d\n\nRowe believes that everyone has the potential to learn the skills necessary to be successful, and he\u2019s confident that with the right support, the seven million \u201cdone\u201d workers can be saved.\n\n\u201cWe can help them find their way back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can encourage them to re-engage and get back in the workforce.

{"text": "The U.S. Congress is in a crisis, unable to decide on its next House Speaker, an elected position that is second in line to the president. For months, the position has been vacant, with political parties unable to come to a consensus on who should be chosen. It is a crisis that has paralyzed the institution, leading to a host of legislative deadlocks and a lack of progress in Washington.\n\nAt the root of the crisis is the fact that the House of Representatives is currently split between Democrats and Republicans, with no one party in control. As a result, both sides have put forth competing candidates for the role of Speaker of the House. Democrats have nominated Nancy Pelosi, the current House Minority Leader, while Republicans are backing Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader.\n\nThe power struggle has led to a total stalemate in Washington, as neither candidate has been able to garner enough votes from both sides to win the office. The problem is compounded by the fact that many members of Congress are unwilling to break party lines to vote for the other side\u2019s candidate.\n\nThe consequences of the Speaker\u2019s crisis have been far-reaching. Without a Speaker in place, important legislation on a host of issues, including healthcare, immigration, and gun control, has failed to pass through Congress. The lack of progress has led to significant frustration among the American public, who feel that the power struggles in Washington have made it impossible for government to actually get anything done.\n\nThe inability to choose a Speaker has also led to gridlock within Congress. For example, the House and Senate have been unable to come to an agreement on a budget for the coming year. Without a budget, Congress is unable to pass any appropriations bills, making it difficult for the government to pay for its operations.\n\nMoreover, the Speaker debacle has thrown a wrench into the confirmation process for federal judges, cabinet secretaries, and other government officials. With no one in charge of the House, the confirmation process has become stalled, delaying the confirmation of much-needed personnel.\n\nIn an effort to resolve the crisis, House Democrats have proposed a number of reforms, including opening up the Speaker\u2019s race to a wider pool of candidates. They have also proposed rules changes that would give members of Congress more leeway to break party lines and vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if these reforms will be able to break the logjam, they do represent a small glimmer of hope in an otherwise paralyzing situation. Ultimately, it will take a combination of compromise and political courage to break the impasse and fill the Speaker\u2019s office. Until then, the American people will be left wondering how long their government will remain in gridlock.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Late last year, Facebook parent company Meta announced the development of Cicero, a new machine learning tool designed to play the board game Diplomacy with human players, at a high level. In its announcement, the company makes lofty claims about the impact that the AI, which uses a language model to simulate strategic reasoning, could have on the future of AI development, and human-AI relations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the AI system is impressive in many ways, its creators intentionally removed one skill that can be crucial in games like Diplomacy: the ability to lie.\n\nDiplomacy is a complex, highly strategic board game requiring a significant degree of communication, collaboration, and competition between its players. In it, players take on the role of countries in the early years of the 20th century in a fictional conflict in which European powers are vying for control of the continent. It is mechanically simpler but, arguably, more tactically complex than a game like RISK. Your number of units is determined by the amount of territory you hold, specifically how many supply centers you control. Individual units can spend their turns holding territory to repel attackers, moving into territory to take it, and supporting the hold and move actions of other units. All players act simultaneously, with the goal of taking the maximum amount of territory.\n\nIn a recent Substack post, Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis, two AI researchers unaffiliated with the project, explain that Cicero was designed through a combination of deep learning and hands-on training, using the online version of the game, webDiplomacy. There are two main types of game in Diplomacy: Press and No-press. In Press games, players are able to communicate with one another to coordinate tactics, make threats, and share information. In no-press games, players are left to fend for themselves, attempting to take territory through their own strategy and military might alone. Cicero was designed to play press games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI was trained through a combination of press and no-press games from webDiplomacy\u2014the community of which has been extremely receptive to the research team. According to Kestas, a co-owner of the website, Meta managed to earn a significant amount of goodwill by helping to overhaul the game\u2019s interface: \u201cWhen webDiplomacy.net was started in 2005 the UI was pretty cutting edge, but in 2022 it was getting very dated. They replaced the map with a point and click mobile-friendly React-based UI, which you can try without an account on https://play.webdiplomacy.net/, and it has been very popular.\u201d\n\nImage by Meta AI.\n\nCicero, unlike previous complex game AI, couldn\u2019t be trained by playing against itself. AlphaGo, for example, was built by simulating thousands of games, through which Go could be solved. However, this method is a product of Go\u2019s game design.\n\nIn the parlance of the frequently critiqued game theory upon which Cicero\u2019s tactical model is based, Go is a two player, zero-sum game\u2014meaning it includes a finite number of resources, two players, and has binary win and loss conditions. This allows an AI to simulate every possible permutation of moves and board states, and react perfectly to its human opponent. Diplomacy, on the other hand, has up to 32 players, fluid resources, and degrees of victory. Holding the second largest volume of territory is still a success by Diplomacy standards. This level of complexity makes the game too difficult to truly solve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn initial version of Cicero was trained on a corpus of several thousand no-press games, encouraging the AI to derive optimal tactical decisions from existing human strategies. This AI, following a few months of training and testing, became hyper competent at the game, arguably too competent for the more socially complex press games.\n\nHuman beings, because we are extremely smart and transcendently stupid monkeys, have feelings when other people do things to us. The version of Cicero that emerged from training on no-press games was efficient and utterly ruthless\u2014so ruthless that, according to Meta, other players in press games found it difficult to collaborate with Cicero. And in press Diplomacy, you must collaborate if you want any chance at victory.\n\nThis social element is what Meta claims makes Cicero unique among current AI. Cicero combines tactical reasoning with a complex language model trained on a massive standard English corpus and the chat logs of a few thousand press games of webDiplomacy. Additionally, unlike many language models, Cicero\u2019s actual dialogue isn\u2019t exclusively predictive. Predictive models (like the suggested words in modern smartphones) don\u2019t understand text, they just choose the most probable sequence of words based on their corpus. This produces convincing but ultimately meaningless text, even when it is factually accurate.\n\nCicero, on the other hand, has been trained to derive specific information from its conversations, and to engage in collaboration towards specific goals. If you tell Cicero that you plan to attack Germany, it will incorporate that information into its strategic model for the turn. Similarly, Cicero is able to prompt other players with ideas that suit its own goals. For example, if Cicero has previously collaborated with France to take territory in Italy, and finds it tactically advantageous to take territory in Germany, Cicero may encourage France to begin an offensive campaign against Germany, drawing German troops to the French border before mounting its own assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Cicero does not lie. Like many games, the social rules and practices of high-level Diplomacy are radically different from more casual play. If you started a game of Diplomacy with your friends, there would inevitably be the kinds of grand betrayals and ultimately foolish machiavellian schemes that most people associate with social games like Diplomacy. In casual play, the ability to lie is useful because players lack the tactical mastery to make optimal moves or plan long term strategies. In this context, social manipulation becomes much more important.\n\nIn high-level play, honesty is much more common and much more useful. Making alliances allows your long term strategies to be significantly more complex, as is evidenced by the example of a co-ordinated war against Germany referenced above. This led the designers of Cicero to make the AI totally honest, and relatively upfront with its plans.\n\nThis honesty presented unique challenges to Meta\u2019s team, as the corpus upon which Cicero was trained included human players lying. In a comment to Motherboard, Andrew Goff, a Diplomacy pro who worked closely with the Meta team on the project, said: \u201cOne of the most interesting findings was that Cicero performs better when it doesn\u2019t lie and the language model needed to overcome the density of human lying in the training data in order to \u2018get good\u2019\u2014just like the best human players learn that lies are a poor strategy Cicero learnt that too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a video explaining Cicero, Meta claims that the AI even apologizes for and explains the tactical rationale behind its more aggressive grabs for territory\u2014this allows it to maintain healthy diplomatic relations, facilitating collaboration with former foes. However, Cicero has also been trained to withhold information that would put it at an active disadvantage. Cicero would not, for example, disclose to a bordering nation that it planned to divert the majority of its troops to the German border before actually executing the move. However, according to pro-Diplomacy player Andrew Goff, Cicero would answer honestly if you asked it directly about its plans:\n\n\u201c...[T]he more \u2018truthy\u2019 CICERO became the more likely it was to give away tactics or just the general idea that it was going to attack someone to the person it was going to attack,\u201d Goff said in an email. \u201cThe answer? It didn\u2019t matter! Performance was better even if CICERO just straight out said it was attacking when it was attacking. This is something I do as a player\u2014there\u2019s no point lying about it most of the time, and by telling the truth the player knows you\u2019ll be trustworthy when you say you won\u2019t attack. CICERO learned on its own not to volunteer information (good, bad, or indifferent) without intent, but if you asked it a specific question it would usually give an honest answer. This was also true of tactics, but this is trivial\u2014the trust factor a human places on that information is zero\u2014if I am attacking you and I tell you my moves, then you assume I\u2019m lying... but then assume I\u2019m tricking you and telling the truth, but then assume I\u2019m double-bluffing.... and so on\u2014so while it looks like this could be a vulnerability it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Marcus and Davis point out, all of this is extremely clever, but more importantly, extremely specific to the end to which Cicero was actually built: playing high-level, blitz Diplomacy, which limits players to 5-minute turns. Cicero is not, like some other deep learning AI, easy to retrain. Cicero\u2019s model is built from a particular, intentionally constructed corpus, one which has been diligently labeled by human hands. Cicero can only recognize the plans of other players, because the information being discussed in Diplomacy is relatively simple, even if the tactics are complex.\n\nAs Marcus and Davis suggest, Cirero is pointing towards a different way of thinking about AI design. In the last few years, AI research and the popular science writing that it spawns has become obsessed with deep, machine learning\u2014the ability of an AI to train itself to produce particular outputs after being presented with a large corpus of data. This strategy allows AI to create very convincing facsimiles of real human work, devoid of the meaning inherent in what people actually make. It cannot distinguish true from false information, nor derive effect from cause. It can only mimic these acts, predicting what word or pixel or chess move is statistically most likely to come next based on its training corpus and most recent prompt.\n\nCicero rejoins intentional, goal-oriented AI design with deep learning practices, and the results are extremely impressive. However, it reinforces the fact that for AI to be capable of human performance, they must be intentionally and carefully designed to do so by human hands. Meta modified Cicero\u2019s corpus extensively, censoring personal details like names, hand-labeling specific information, and modifying the tone which Cicero learned from human players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d also add there were lots of other, non-AI ethical considerations too\u2014the level of consideration we gave to privacy was extreme, redacting anything that could be remotely personal\u2026The internal controls on that were really impressive, and the team in general took the approach that ethical research considerations were key parts of the challenge, not obstacles to success.\u201d\n\nAdding to this in a separate comment to Motherboard, site co-owner Kestas said: \u201c[Working on the project was] stressful at times, delivering batches of data on time and ensuring it was all redacted properly while delivering as much data as possible, but very rewarding.\u201d\n\nCicero suggests that you want a competent language model capable of influencing human behavior, it has to be specifically designed around the specific behaviors it is trying to adjust, and can only be done in the context of a system that has become simple enough to be broken down to data tables and boolean decisions.\n\nCicero does not, as some people have worried, indicate that it could be capable of real diplomacy or manipulative tactics. Cicero\u2019s decision making is based on Game Theory, a school of economics and sociology which has been critiqued time and time again because it makes the incorrect assumption that, in the real world, humans are rational actors working to rational ends in rational systems. Cicero is playing a game with known actors and known rules.\n\nHumans are brilliant, fallible, and infinitely complex. Our systems mirror this. A given statesman does not know every legal or social rule to which they must adhere, like Diplomacy players do. Cicero has perfect knowledge not only of the state of a particular board, but the static rules and social conventions of a specific game. That\u2019s all it is: a machine built to play a board game very well.", "label": "human"}

Huang Jingwen | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Joe Biden will discuss a range of geopolitical challenges next week in his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since he ascended to the White House two years ago. \"We expect this meeting to be an in-depth and substantive conversation between the leaders aimed at better understanding one another's priorities and intentions,\" a senior Biden administration official told reporters on a call. The meeting between the two leaders will take place Monday ahead of the G-20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia. \"I expect the president will be honest about a number of our concerns,\" added the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe official said that Biden will raise concerns about harmful economic practices, Chinese activity that \"threatens peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as our long-standing concerns about human rights violations.\" Biden told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he wants to address the mounting tensions between Washington and Beijing. \"What I want to do with him when we talk is lay out what each of our red lines are and understand what he believes to be in the critical national interests of China, what I know to be the critical interests of the United States,\" Biden said. \"And determine whether or not they conflict with one another.\" The two leaders have spoken five times during Biden's presidency and previously discussed a face-to-face meeting during a two-hour call in late July. Xi has remained close to home since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. He embarked on his first trip last month to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The senior Biden administration official declined to elaborate on Covid-19 mitigation measures for the meeting, adding that health protocols were still being worked out by advance teams.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe call in July came as Biden drew Beijing's ire by suggesting that the U.S. will defend Taiwan if it was attacked by China. During the discussion, Xi told Biden not to \"play with fire\" over Taiwan. The White House has repeatedly said the remarks do not represent a change in U.S. foreign policy. At the time, Beijing also accused U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of further straining the bilateral relationship with a trip to Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory. Pelosi was the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the island in 25 years. In retaliation for Pelosi's visit, Beijing imposed sanctions against her and launched live-fire military drills around the island. Taiwanese defense officials called the exercises \"highly provocative.\" Tensions between Beijing and Washington, the world's two largest economies, had already soared to new heights under the Trump administration. Former President Donald Trump placed blame squarely on China for a wide range of grievances, including intellectual property theft, unfair trade practices and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping attend a business leaders event inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017.

He has also described Beijing as America's \"most serious competitor.\" Biden is also expected to raise concerns about Xi's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin as Moscow continues its monthslong assault on its ex-Soviet neighbor. \"I think the president will be honest and direct with President Xi about how we see the situation in Ukraine with Russia's war of aggression,\" the official said. \"This is a topic that the president and President Xi have spoken about several times before. They spoke about it extensively in March in their video call and then they spoke about it again in July, so it's part of an ongoing conversation between the two of them,\" the person added. Weeks before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin traveled to Beijing to meet with Xi and later issued a memorandum expressing a \"no limits\" relationship between their nations.\n\nTwo weeks after Russian troops poured over Ukraine's borders, officials from the United States and China met to discuss the Kremlin's war as well as other areas of mutual concern. A senior administration official at the time described the talks, which were held in Rome, as \"intense\" and spanning at least seven hours. The official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, conveyed to China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, that the U.S. is concerned Beijing may attempt to help Russia blunt global sanctions. \"What I would say in general is that we do have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia,\" the official said. \"The national security advisor was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions.\"", "label": "human"}

Who is still available?\n\nGames can be won or lost in the transfer portal and no position impacts winning and losing more than quarterback.\n\nSince the first transfer window opened on Dec. 5, we\u2019ve seen a flurry of movement across college football with an array of high-profile quarterbacks committing to new schools.\n\nIf you\u2019ve had trouble keeping track of everything, don\u2019t fret. Below, we\u2019ve recapped the most notable quarterback transfers from conference to conference and the top signal callers still available.\n\nNew team: (previous team)\n\nAAC\n\nHouston: Donovan Smith (Texas Tech)\n\nRice: JT Daniels (West Virginia)\n\nUTSA: Owen McCown (Colorado)\n\nSmith started multiple games over the past two seasons for Texas Tech and now has the chance to step into the shoes of longtime Houston starter Clayton Tune. Daniels, meanwhile, is on to his fourth school after stops at USC, Georgia and West Virginia. Daniels will help Rice make the transition to the AAC from Conference USA.\n\nACC\n\nClemson: Paul Tyson (Arizona State)\n\nGeorgia Tech: Haynes King (Texas A&M)\n\nLouisville: Jack Plummer (Cal)\n\nPitt: Phil Jurkovec (Boston College)\n\nPitt: Christian Veilleux (Penn State)\n\nVirginia: Tony Muskett (Monmouth)\n\nVirginia Tech: Kyron Drones (Baylor)\n\nPitt was able to add a quarterback for next year and potentially its quarterback of the future by landing commitments from Jurkovec and Veilleux. Jurkovec began his career at Notre Dame before starting three seasons at Boston College. Veilleux, meanwhile, is a former four-star recruit who was the third-stringer at Penn State this season.\n\nFor Plummer, Louisville was an obvious fit. Plummer started his career at Purdue, where he played for new UL head coach Jeff Brohm. The Cardinals needed a quarterback after Malik Cunningham left for the NFL.\n\nKing won Texas A&M\u2019s starting job out of preseason camp for the past two seasons and now gets a chance to jump-start his career at Georgia Tech.\n\nQuarterback Phil Jurkovec will play for Pitt next season after starting three years for Boston College.

Wisconsin has quickly revamped its quarterback room under new coach Luke Fickell. Mordecai threw for more than 7,000 yards in two seasons as SMU's starter while Evers was a four-star recruit in the 2022 class.\n\nCard could prove to be a big pickup for new Purdue coach Ryan Walters. Walters hired Graham Harrell as offensive coordinator and Card could be a seamless fit after being the backup at Texas.\n\nMountain West\n\nFresno State: Mikey Keene (UCF)\n\nNevada: Brendon Lewis (Colorado)\n\nFresno State is losing Jake Haener but adding Keene from UCF should lessen the blow caused by Haener\u2019s absence.

This group of transfers adds to that talent pool.\n\nPyne started most of the season for Notre Dame, Sanders is following his dad, Deion Sanders, from Jackson State to Boulder and Uiagalelei is looking for a new start in Corvallis after two years as the starter at Clemson. For UCLA, Schlee could prove to be a valuable addition if five-star freshman Dante Moore is not ready to start right away.\n\nQuarterback DJ Uiagalelei transferred to Oregon State after spending the last two seasons as Clemson's starter.

{"text": "Finnish people are often called the happiest people in the world. According to the World Happiness Report 2019, Finland is the happiest nation on the planet. Of course, this designation doesn\u2019t guarantee individual happiness, as there are always people who feel unhappy or troubled. But it does mean that Finland has a solid foundation of well-being, one that has been established through collective effort and investment in the public good.\n\nAs a psychologist in Finland, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how our government, culture, and habits help us to remain happy. As a result, I\u2019ve identified three things that Finnish people rarely do, and which play an important role in why Finland is so happy.\n\nFirst, Finns rarely do anything to keep up with the Joneses. Here in Finland, we don\u2019t measure success and happiness in material possessions like cars, clothing, or other things people tend to buy to show off their wealth. In our country, it\u2019s common to find people who are highly educated and successful without having a lot of things. We appreciate quality and craftsmanship, but we don\u2019t feel the need to constantly buy the latest gadgets or newest clothes. As a result, there is little stress and pressure to keep up with the Joneses.\n\nSecond, Finnish people rarely take things too seriously. One of the common characteristics of happy people is their ability to laugh at themselves and their own mistakes. People in Finland are good at doing that. We don\u2019t take life too seriously, and this helps us stay in high spirits and focus on the positive aspects of life.\n\nThird, Finns rarely obsess over status. As a nation, we don\u2019t have a strong hierarchical structure in our culture. It\u2019s rare to see people trying to achieve status or recognition through money or material possessions. Instead, we have a deep respect for knowledge and experience, regardless of where it comes from. This attitude helps us to be more accepting and open to different opinions, and it helps to keep our society egalitarian and non-competitive.\n\nThese three habits\u2014not keeping up with the Joneses, not taking things too seriously, and not obsessing over status\u2014all play a major role in why Finland is consistently one of the happiest countries in the world. We don\u2019t waste time competing with each other and trying to prove ourselves. Instead, we focus on living our lives with contentment, and it is this sense of contentment that makes us so happy. So if you want to be happy like a Finn, start by implementing these three habits into your life.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The long-awaited return of the critically acclaimed Netflix show, The White Lotus, is finally here and it does not disappoint. Season two of the series follows the powerful, passionate, and frequently entertaining story of feminist collective White Lotus, a loosely organized group of women activists who fight against sexism and oppression.\n\nThe show, which debuted in 2020, tells the story of a group of young women of color, led by founder and executive director Jennifer Abigail (Oscar-nominated Kerry Washington), who are dedicated to supporting and empowering each other in their fight against the oppression of women and all people of color. Through the use of community programs and activism, the group works to achieve economic justice, reproductive rights, and gender equality. \n\nThis season, the show continues to draw on themes of gender and feminism, but takes it a step further by tackling the complex and often devastating effects of misogyny in all its forms. Through a series of powerful and thought-provoking stories, season two shines a light on how patriarchy permeates and shapes our lives, from the everyday interactions to the larger societal and institutional dynamics that reinforce misogyny. \n\nThe show does an excellent job of exploring the multifaceted and often intersecting ways in which patriarchy plays out. One episode, for example, focuses on how misogyny can shape women\u2019s professional experiences, including how their success is undermined by their gender. The episode follows the story of Joyce (Rosario Dawson), a successful lawyer who is overlooked for a promotion despite her impeccable work. In addition, the show also examines the impact of sexism on the educational experience of girls, with an episode exploring the gendered double standards applied to girls in the classroom. \n\nIn addition to its focus on gender equality, The White Lotus also takes on a wide range of other social and political issues. The show\u2019s characters frequently engage in conversations on topics including police brutality, immigration reform, and climate change. The series takes a particularly strong stance when it comes to dismantling systematic racism and the ongoing fight for justice and equality. Through the stories of its characters, the series highlights the importance of people coming together to demand change, whether through protest, civil disobedience, or other forms of activism. \n\nIn addition to its powerful storylines, The White Lotus also excels in its choice of music. Each episode begins with a new original track from a local artist, reflecting the show\u2019s commitment to inclusivity and highlighting the powerful voices of its diverse cast. This strong musical presence is indicative of the show\u2019s commitment to creating an atmosphere of inclusion and representation. \n\nThe White Lotus is a bold and thought-provoking show that succeeds in taking an unflinching look at gender inequality and exploring the subtle, yet powerful, ways in which patriarchy shapes our lives. It\u2019s a must-watch for anyone looking for a meaningful and impactful show. Season two of The White Lotus is truly a masterpiece on misogyny.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's been almost a decade since the original launch of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Since then, the beloved open-world action-RPG has become a phenomenon, spawning multiple spin-offs and adaptations, as well as inspiring several other games.\n\nFans were enthralled when developer CD Projekt RED announced that they were working on a remastered version of the game for the next generation of consoles. While the developer is being tight-lipped about the new version, they have revealed one crucial element that\u2019s set to make its way into the game \u2013 a new casting system.\n\nIn a recent livestream, CD Projekt RED showed off the new casting system, which is set to add an extra layer of depth to combat. In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, players used a system of simple gestures and vocal commands to control the game\u2019s characters and their weapons. This was fine for the original game, but the new casting system promises to add a level of finesse and control that\u2019s been missing from the series.\n\nThe new casting system is built on a base of gestures and voice commands, but with a new level of complexity. Players can now create custom combos by stringing together specific movements, allowing for far more precise control over the actions of their characters. This will give players more control over their characters\u2019 movements, allowing them to quickly switch between attacks and defensive maneuvers.\n\nThe casting system will also feature a new way to manage character abilities. Players will be able to equip their characters with \u201cspells\u201d, which are linked to individual gestures or voice commands. This will give players an extra layer of control over their characters, allowing them to quickly cast spells and abilities without having to navigate menus.\n\nThe casting system will also introduce a new concept called \u201cpassive casting\u201d. This feature will allow players to set up predetermined casts, allowing them to quickly activate abilities and spells without having to manually cast them each time. This could be a useful feature for players who find themselves in a tough situation, as they won\u2019t have to fumble with their controls to cast the right spell or ability in time.\n\nThe casting system is a major upgrade to the combat in The Witcher 3, and it promises to add an extra layer of depth and control to the game. With the casting system, players will be able to play the game with a greater level of finesse, allowing them to experiment with new strategies and combos.\n\nCD Projekt RED also revealed that the new version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will feature improved graphics and animations, as well as better loading times and improved AI. The game will also feature a brand new story, new characters, and a brand new world to explore.\n\nFans of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt should be excited for the next-gen version of the game, as the new casting system adds a new level of depth and control to the game. With improved graphics, faster loading times, and more characters to meet, the game promises to be an even more immersive experience than ever before. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt looks set to be one of the best games of the next generation of consoles, and we can\u2019t wait to see what CD Projekt RED has in store.", "label": "machine"}

This is an important step, as it will help you both understand each other better, and start building trust and intimacy in your relationship.\n\nThere is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d answer for how to fix a marriage, but there are a few things you can do to help improve the situation. It\u2019s important to continue to be understanding and patient with your husband, as this can make it easier for him to open up to you. Additionally, try to make the effort to do activities together, such as going for a walk or cooking dinner. Spending quality time with your partner can be an important factor in bringing the two of you closer.\n\nFinally, if it seems like your husband\u2019s moods are causing too much strain in your relationship, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist.

Analyst Greg Miller upgraded shares of both Comcast and Charter to buy from hold, with respective $50 and $550 price targets. The recent investor flight from both stocks has created a valuation reset, he said. \"These two were the worst performing large-cap stocks in our coverage universe in 2022 as investors recognized broadband flow share trends fundamentally changed, but we believe efforts to stem the erosion are proving successful and should once again cause the stocks to trade at traditional premiums to telecom stocks,\" he wrote in a note published Thursday. Miller also said that investor concerns of increased competition have now been accounted for in both stocks, which should support limited downside going forward. \"Unlike a year ago when investors believed the only issues facing the cable industry was the pandemic \"pull-forward\" of demand and the lack of residential moving in the US, most investors have now come to terms with the fact that new variables (fixed wireless and fiber) are also responsible for the lack-luster [high speed data] growth,\" he wrote. Comcast and Charter sold off sharply in 2022, falling about 30% and 48%, respectively. Truist's fresh price targets imply 37% and 55% upside from Wednesday's close, respectively.

{"text": "As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a resurgence of influenza, researchers have identified a new source of hospitalizations in the United States: respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.\n\nRSV is a common infection that primarily affects young children and the elderly, but it\u2019s had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities during this pandemic. In recent years, RSV has been responsible for an estimated 3.2 million U.S. hospitalizations each year, and it\u2019s estimated to cause up to 7.1 million deaths worldwide annually.\n\nTo help understand the scope of the problem, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Association of Public Health (AAPHS) developed a comprehensive tracking system for all three conditions: influenza, COVID-19 and RSV. The system, called eTRACKRSV, combines population-level health data from hospitalizations and mortality from 33 states across the country.\n\nThe tracking system uses data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), and other sources to monitor and identify regional hospitalization trends related to influenza, COVID-19 and RSV. It also provides trend analyses of regional and national hospitalization trends, allowing health officials to identify areas at greatest risk for infection.\n\nData collected by the eTRACKRSV system suggests that there\u2019s an ongoing presence of RSV in the United States throughout the pandemic, particularly in the South, Midwest and Mountain regions. Between October 2019 and October 2020, the CDC found that RSV hospitalizations increased by 31%, while COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by 35%. The highest rates of RSV hospitalizations were reported in Arizona, Louisiana and Mississippi, followed by North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nIn the months since the pandemic began, it\u2019s become clear that healthcare providers are facing unprecedented levels of infection from both COVID-19 and RSV. This is why eTRACKRSV is such an important tool for health officials. It helps identify regions with high rates of RSV hospitalizations and can provide insights into how best to respond.\n\nFor instance, health officials can use the data to determine which regions need additional support and resources to better manage their RSV cases. The system can also be used to identify areas with a greater need for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination and testing programs.\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, it\u2019s important to monitor the impact of RSV hospitalizations in order to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to the best possible care. With eTRACKRSV, researchers and health officials can better understand the regional trends related to RSV and develop more effective prevention strategies.", "label": "machine"}

Scegli un esfoliante delicato ed esfolia almeno una volta alla settimana, concentrandoti sulla pelle del viso, del collo e del d\u00e9collet\u00e9. L\u2019esfoliazione rimuove le cellule morte della pelle e agevola il rinnovamento cellulare. Se stai seguendo anche una beauty routine che prevede un siero o una maschera, l\u2019esfoliazione \u00e8 particolarmente importante poich\u00e9 aiuter\u00e0 i principi attivi a penetrare nella tua pelle in profondit\u00e0.\n\nUn\u2019altra abitudine che ti aiuter\u00e0 a mantenere una pelle luminosa \u00e8 la protezione solare.

Ricorda che la protezione solare non serve solo al mare o quando si pratica uno sport in montagna, ma \u00e8 sempre necessaria per proteggere la tua pelle dai raggi del sole (sia UV che UVB).\n\nSe vuoi una pelle sana e luminosa, un'altra abitudine importante da prendere \u00e8 quella di bere molto. Prenditi un minuto al giorno per bere almeno 2 litri di acqua. Una buona idratazione \u00e8 importante per mantenere la pelle morbida e liscia e aiuta a prevenire l\u2019invecchiamento precoce. Se sei pi\u00f9 attratta dalle tisane piuttosto che dall\u2019acqua, non avere paura. Anche le tisane possono apportare benefici alla salute della pelle.\n\nUna altra abitudine da adottare quest\u2019anno \u00e8 l\u2019uso di prodotti naturali. L\u2019industria della bellezza sta lentamente virando verso una gamma pi\u00f9 ampia di prodotti naturali e biologici, da usare anche a casa.

{"text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nNews publishers are getting in on the TikTok trend.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a brand new survey published Wednesday evening by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford. The survey found that, from a global standpoint, about half of the world\u2019s top newsrooms are now regularly posting on the ByteDance-owned app.\n\nThe survey, which offers arguably the most comprehensive look yet at how news organizations are using the social media platform to reach and inform younger audiences, noted that publishers are working to establish a presence on TikTok \u201cdespite opaque rules over the removal of content, worries about data security, and limited opportunities for monetization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report\u2019s figures show that organizations are attracted by the fast-growing and younger audience, but they are also motivated by the desire to provide reliable news, amid fears about widespread misinformation on the platform,\u201d the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford said in a news release.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nThe survey found that the rates of TikTok usage among news publishers is highest in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and South America. In the U.S., about three-quarters of newsrooms are now posting on the platform.\n\nThe top 10 accounts in the United States by audience, in descending order, are: NowThis, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, NowThis Politics, Yahoo News, Brut America, The Washington Post, USA Today, and CNN.\n\nNic Newman, who drew on interviews from 20 different news organizations and individuals to author the report, told CNN that newsrooms are using the platform to cover a wide range of stories.\n\nWhile some people might think the content on TikTok is light and fluffy, journalists and newsrooms are also tackling serious issues, such as the war in Ukraine \u2014 and that type of content, he said, can do particularly well.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that really works on TikTok is content that gives viewers the feeling of being there on the scene,\u201d Newman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why when the war in Ukraine happened, correspondent accounts were really effective.\u201d\n\nNewman also stressed that TikTok has \u201cunleashed\u201d a multitude of different storytelling opportunities for news organizations that allows them to break out of the formats they often rely on to deliver information to their audiences.\n\nThe report, for instance, highlights how Dave Jorgenson at The Post uses humor, Jake Tapper uses it to take viewers behind the scenes at CNN, and Vice has leaned on correspondents for on-the-ground videos.\n\n\u201cIf you look at some of the storytelling going on TikTok, it is really different,\u201d Newman told CNN. \u201cThere is so much creativity coming out of the platform. It\u2019s really vibrant and exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it has a lot to teach news publishers working in other mediums.\u201d", "label": "human"}

Als mein Lebenspartner und ich Ende 2017 unsere Jobs k\u00fcndigten und uns auf den Weg machten, um ein Jahr als digitale Nomaden zu reisen, hatte ich eine andere Idee. Wir hatten bereits ein Airbnb-Apartment in Thailand gebucht, aber statt einfach dorthin zu gehen, war mein Plan, auf dem Weg dorthin unser eigenes, verr\u00fccktes Projekt zu machen: den Bau eines Baumhauses in einer Baumkrone in Costa Rica.\n\nMein Lebenspartner war zun\u00e4chst nicht ganz begeistert.

Als wir anfingen, begann ich, mich \u00fcber Baumh\u00e4user zu informieren. Ich las B\u00fccher und sprach mit Experten. Ich entwarf eine einfache Zeichnung f\u00fcr das Haus und suchte nach Materialien und vor allem nach einem Ort, an dem wir bauen konnten. Im Januar 2018 fanden wir unseren perfekten Ort - ein paar Morgen Land in den Bergen mit einem atemberaubenden Blick.\n\nAls n\u00e4chstes mussten wir die n\u00f6tigen Werkzeuge und Baumaterialien kaufen.

Wall Street got the opposite. Stocks struggled this week as recession fears resurfaced, putting a damper on last hopes for a market uptick. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were last down 0.4% and 2.1% for the week, respectively, and both are on pace for a third straight week of losses.

CNBC Pro used FactSet data to screen for the stocks with the greatest week-to-date percentage changes as of Friday's open. These are some of the names that made the cut. Nike ruled as the best performer this week, with shares rising almost 10% after the sports apparel company topped analysts' expectations for the fiscal second-quarter . The company also showed progress as it works through its inventory glut exacerbated by supply chain disruptions. Given this, Nike chief financial officer Matt Friend said on an earnings call that the company expects to grow its revenues for the full fiscal year. Shares have tumbled about 30% this year, with analysts split over its near-term growth. About 46% of analysts rate the stocks as a buy, with the consensus price target implying upside of more than 7% from Thursday's close. Another top performer this week was Moderna after it got an upgrade from Jefferies to a buy from hold . Analysts called Moderna's promising experimental cancer vaccine a potential catalyst for the stock as the drug maker from its Covid tailwinds. Shares rallied almost 7% this week as of Friday's open.

The community was facing dwindling enrollment and a lack of resources and support. The area lacked access to high-quality teaching, and students were falling behind in their education.\n\nThat all changed in April 2022, when a group of parents, teachers, and community members banded together to form the Pine Peaks Partnership for Education. The group quickly made it their mission to transform the school into a thriving hub of learning.\n\nTheir first move was to secure additional funding from the state. With the extra resources, they were able to hire a full-time staff and invest in new technology. They also reached out to community members and businesses, asking them to provide volunteer services or materials for the school.\n\nThe group also developed a comprehensive education plan that was designed to address the issues that had been preventing the school from being successful. The plan included implementing new programs, like after-school tutoring, to ensure that all students had access to the resources and guidance they needed.\n\nAt the same time, the group worked to build stronger relationships with local businesses and organizations, tapping into their expertise in areas like STEM and coding.\n\nThe hard work paid off and the school saw an immediate improvement. Students' test scores began to climb, and enrollment levels rose. The school was quickly becoming a center of learning and innovation.\n\nThe Pine Peaks Partnership for Education held a celebration at the school in December 2022 to commemorate their efforts.\n\nThe event was attended by state politicians, business leaders, and members of the community, who all praised the group for their dedication to making a positive impact on the community.\n\nThe event was also a reminder of the power of community and the importance of coming together to support each other.\n\nAs the leader of the Pine Peaks Partnership for Education, Kim has been an inspirational example of how important it is for people to take action. As she said in her speech at the celebration, \u201cIt takes a village to run a school. We have all come together and worked hard to make this possible, and it is a great thing to be a part of.\u201d\n\nKim and the other members of the Pine Peaks Partnership for Education have set an example for others. With their hard work and dedication, they have shown that anything is possible when we work together.\n\nWe can all learn a lesson from Kim and the Pine Peaks Partnership for Education: It takes a village to run a school, and a community coming together can do great things.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 As Republicans struggled for a second day to elect a House speaker, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida emerged as the choice of conservative holdouts who are refusing to support Kevin McCarthy\u2019s bid.\n\nDuring three rounds of balloting Wednesday, Donalds received 20 votes to McCarthy's 201 \u2014 enough to keep McCarthy short of the 218 needed to win the speakership in a full House.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans opposing McCarthy nominated a slew of candidates, including Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and even former Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York. Donalds joined the insurgent Republicans on the final vote Tuesday, switching his vote from McCarthy to Jordan.\n\nSo just who is Byron Donalds?\n\nNO SOPHOMORE SLUMP\n\nDonalds, 44, was elected in November to his second term representing Florida's 19th District, in the state's southwest. For his first election in 2020, Donalds won a nine-way GOP primary and defeated his Democratic opponent to succeed retiring Republican Rep. Francis Rooney.\n\nA native of Brooklyn, Donalds was raised by a single mother and graduated from Florida State University in 2002. He was working as a financial adviser when he was appointed to the board of trustees at a state college by then-Gov. Rick Scott, which helped elevate his profile in Florida's GOP circles.\n\nHis wife, Erika Donalds, is an advocate of the school choice movement in the state. Byron Donalds has acknowledged being arrested as a young man on a marijuana distribution charge that was later dismissed, and said he turned his life around.\n\nHe unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House in 2012, winning a state House seat four years later.\n\nHOUSE SPEAKER VOTES\n\nIn December 2021, Donalds told CBS that McCarthy had \u201cdone tremendous things\u201d for Republicans in the House. \u201cSo right now, the question is, who\u2019s going to be the person that\u2019s going to take us to the next level?\" Donalds said. \"Kevin\u2019s proven he can do that.\u201d\n\nIn the first two rounds of votes on Tuesday, Donalds cast his vote for McCarthy before opting for Jordan in the third round. In doing so, Donalds tweeted that the \"reality is \u2026 McCarthy doesn\u2019t have the votes.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis will take time, Democracy is messy at times, but we will be ready to govern on behalf of the American people,\u201d Donalds added. \u201cDebate is healthy.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, when his own name was placed in nomination, Donalds cast votes in favor of himself. On Fox after one of those votes, Donalds said he had briefly spoken with McCarthy and called for leadership that \u201cactually reflects where the American people are, and that leadership is something that is earned here in the nation's Capitol, not just given.\u201d\n\nPREVIOUS LEADERSHIP PURSUIT\n\nDonalds has previously sought GOP leadership posts. In November, he unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York for conference chair, the No. 4 position in Republican House leadership, losing a closed-door vote.\n\nVOICES FROM THE FLOOR\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas was the sole member to vote for Donalds for speaker on Tuesday, before subsequently supporting Jordan. In his Wednesday speech nominating Donalds, Roy said the sophomore represented a move toward something different, both for Washington and the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cHere we are, and for the first time in history, there have been two Black Americans placed into the nomination for speaker of the House,\u201d Roy said, referring to Donalds and Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries. \u201cThis country needs a change. This country needs leadership that does not reflect this city, this town that is badly broken.\"\n\nDonalds is currently one of only four Black Republicans in the House.\n\nCori Bush, a Black Democratic congresswoman from Missouri, called Donalds a \u201cprop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite being Black, he supports a policy agenda intent on upholding and perpetuating white supremacy. His name being in the mix is not progress \u2014 it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nNominating Donalds in the fifth round, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado said the House's job \u201cis not to coronate the biggest fundraiser, or rubberstamp the status quo or keep on going along to get along. It's to use our votes to elect a speaker who will enable us to get our country back on track.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with reporters on the Capitol steps, Donalds on Wednesday called the ongoing debate \u201can invigorating day for America\" but noted that \"there\u2019s a lot of members in the chamber who want to have serious conversations about how we can bring this all to a close and elect a speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce we get this organized and figured out, we'll get back to business,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s only Day Two, y\u2019all. Settle down. We\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKinnard reported from Columbia, S.C.

{"text": "The House of Representatives made history Wednesday night when Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy lost the first round of voting to become Speaker of the House. McCarthy, who was widely considered the front-runner for the post, lost to another GOP member, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, by a surprisingly wide margin. \n\nThe House chamber was filled with an unprecedented level of anticipation as lawmakers gathered to select the next Speaker of the House. The field was wide and varied, with candidates from both parties vying to lead the powerful lower chamber. \n\nIn the end, only one GOP candidate emerged as a viable contender: Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, who has served as House Majority Leader since 2017. With a record of legislative accomplishments, McCarthy was seen by many as the odds-on favorite to become Speaker. \n\nBut the vote Wednesday night changed the narrative. McCarthy received only 122 votes on the first ballot, while Jordan received 172. The other candidates received much fewer votes. \n\nThe result was unexpected, and it raised the possibility of a rare and historic showdown in the House. It appears the GOP members are determined to challenge the conventional wisdom and choose a different leader. \n\nThe selection process isn't over, though. McCarthy and Jordan must now compete in a run-off election that will likely take place in the next few weeks. During that time, lawmakers from both parties will be lobbying for their preferred candidate.\n\nMcCarthy will be relying on his experience and record of legislative accomplishments to make his case to his colleagues. He is a close ally of President Donald Trump, and has been a major proponent of the president's agenda in Congress. \n\nJordan, on the other hand, has built his political career on opposition to the GOP establishment. He is a founding member of the Freedom Caucus and has long been seen as a thorn in the side of GOP leadership. In recent years, he has served as a vocal critic of the president and the Republican Party's political establishment. \n\nAs the voting process continues, tensions are likely to mount between the two camps as they make their case to their colleagues. It promises to be a heated and competitive race, and one that will shape the future of the Republican Party. \n\nNo matter who emerges as the victor, the result of Wednesday's vote will go down in history as a remarkable moment. The fact that a GOP member was able to upset the establishment favorite is a sign that politics in the US are changing in a big way. \n\nThe eyes of the nation will now be focused on the House chamber as the drama unfolds. It's a moment that could bring a much-needed dose of fresh energy to the Republican Party\u2014or it could spell disaster for the GOP in the midterm elections. \n\nWhatever the result, the vote Wednesday night makes it clear that the future of the Republican Party is up for grabs\u2014and it's up to the party to decide which direction it wants to take.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When the pandemic hit the world in 2021, the tech industry was one of the few sectors to benefit, with many startups even seeing unprecedented success during the two years of global lockdown. But now, as nations slowly lift the restrictions that defined this era, many of these same companies find themselves facing a hangover of uncertainty and fear.\n\nThe tech industry has enjoyed a unique relationship with the pandemic, one that has been forged by the convenience and reliability of technology, particularly cloud-based platforms, which are now responsible for much of the day-to-day business conducted online.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that many of the world\u2019s most valuable startups emerged or grew significantly during this time, with the market value of companies like Zoom, Shopify and others soaring as more people adopted digital solutions. However, with the emergence of a vaccine and increasing numbers of people beginning to travel and socialize again, many of these same companies are now having to reassess their strategies and consider the sustainability of their success.\n\nThe success of these companies during the pandemic was due in part to the widespread acceptance of digital transformation, which has allowed businesses to quickly adapt to new environments and respond to changing customer demands. But, as more people start to get back to their pre-pandemic lives, businesses must also be able to change and adapt again if they are to survive long-term.\n\nThe biggest challenge now facing these companies is the risk of becoming complacent and investing too heavily in the technologies and processes that made them successful during the pandemic. There is a risk that, without the right measures in place to protect them against a downturn or changing consumer trends, they may be unable to successfully transition into the post-pandemic era.\n\nFor many of these startups, the real challenge will be to find the right balance between flexibility and security. They must be able to respond to changes in the market quickly and effectively, while at the same time taking measures to ensure their profitability and sustainability.\n\nOne way for startups to do this is by investing in cybersecurity, an area that many companies had neglected prior to the pandemic but has now become more important than ever. Companies should ensure that their data and infrastructure are secure, as hackers and other malicious actors are increasingly targeting the sector in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nIn addition, startups must also begin to think about how to diversify their sources of revenue, as dependence on one particular industry or area could put them at risk if it experiences a sudden downturn. As the pandemic showed, it is also important for businesses to be agile and ready to take advantage of new opportunities and markets.\n\nThe success of the tech industry during the pandemic is likely to remain in the industry\u2019s favour for the foreseeable future, but startups need to be aware that, even in the midst of success, they must be prepared to adapt and plan for the long-term. As nations continue to open up, many of these businesses are likely to face a new reality, one where failure to plan for the future could lead to disaster.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate unanimously backed the nomination of a new ambassador to Russia before President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s address to Congress. The vote, however, comes amid escalating tensions between the two countries over Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\n\nAt a time when U.S.-Russian relations are on a low point, the ambassador, John Sullivan, is seen as a bridge between Washington and Moscow. Sullivan has served in many positions in the American diplomatic corps, including as the U.S. Ambassador to Moscow between 2017 and 2020.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s approval of the ambassador comes just days before Zelenskyy is set to address the joint session of Congress. In his speech, Zelenskyy is expected to ask for international help in countering Russian aggression in Ukraine, where the Russian military has been supporting separatists since 2014.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the address, the Biden administration has made it clear that it is committed to supporting Ukraine. In a recent statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the U.S. was taking \u201cstrong and concrete\u201d steps to stand with the Ukrainian people and to support their country\u2019s reform efforts.\n\nBut the Biden administration has also emphasized the importance of U.S.-Russian dialogue. Just this week, Blinken urged Russia to end its aggressive actions in Ukraine and to commit to finding a peaceful solution.\n\nWith tensions rising between the two countries, Sullivan\u2019s appointment could be a sign of hope. He has already been involved in diplomatic efforts to reduce the conflict in Ukraine and is seen as a close ally of the Biden administration.\n\nIn a statement following the Senate\u2019s vote, Sullivan said, \u201cI look forward to working with my new colleagues in the Foreign Service and with our partners around the world to support the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s mission of promoting peace and security, advancing democracy, and strengthening human rights.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s appointment is widely seen as a diplomatic victory for the Biden administration. Sullivan is well-respected in diplomatic circles and is seen as an effective and pragmatic negotiator. His experience in dealing with the Kremlin should be an asset in finding a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian conflict.\n\nIn the months ahead, Sullivan will be tasked with building strong ties between the U.S. and Russia. It is unclear how successful he will be in this endeavor. Nevertheless, his appointment is seen as a sign that the Biden administration is serious about tackling the conflict in Ukraine and that it is willing to engage with Russia in a constructive manner.\n\nThe U.S. Senate\u2019s approval of Sullivan\u2019s nomination should serve as a source of encouragement for Zelenskyy ahead of his address to Congress. His approval shows that the U.S. is committed to supporting Ukraine and to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict with Russia. It also demonstrates the Biden administration\u2019s determination to engage in constructive dialogue with Moscow. \n\nThe coming weeks and months will be decisive in determining the future of the U.S.-Russia relationship. But for now, Sullivan\u2019s appointment should serve as a symbol of hope for a better relationship between the two countries.", "label": "machine"}

Witnesses reported that the explosion was so powerful it shattered windows and damaged several vehicles parked outside the airport.\n\n\"I heard a loud explosion,\" said Shamsuddin, a shopkeeper who was nearby at the time. \"It shook my shop, and I saw people running for their lives.\"\n\nThe Interior Ministry said the car bomber had rammed a security checkpoint near the entrance to the airport, but that the explosive device was detonated before he could reach the main terminal.\n\nThe Taliban, which has been waging a war against the government of President Ashraf Ghani since 2001, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nIn a statement, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack was in retaliation for what he called \"oppressive practices\" by the Afghan government against civilians in the eastern province of Paktika.\n\nThis is not the first time the Taliban has targeted the Afghan military. Last month, they launched a brazen attack on a military base in Ghazni province, killing at least 15 soldiers and wounding several others.\n\nThe bombing comes at a time when the United States is preparing to withdraw its remaining troops from Afghanistan. The US had been leading a counterinsurgency operation in the country since 2001, but President Joe Biden has announced that the US would be completely out of the country by the end of the year.\n\nThe US is also in the process of closing down its diplomatic mission in Afghanistan, and the Taliban is taking advantage of the security vacuum created by the drawdown of foreign troops.\n\nSunday's attack is a reminder of the insecurity that continues to plague Afghanistan, even as the US and its NATO allies are preparing to end their mission.\n\nThe government of President Ghani has been struggling to contain the violence and has been unable to make a decisive breakthrough in its efforts to negotiate a peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nThe Afghan government is now bracing for more attacks as the withdrawal of US forces approaches.\n\n\"This is a very tragic incident, and unfortunately this is just the beginning,\" said Zia-Ul-Haq Amarkhail, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. \"We will take all necessary steps to protect our people from the Taliban's senseless violence.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Want to maintain a healthy heart and brain? Keep a close eye on your cholesterol numbers. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol builds up in the arteries and forms plaque, which blocks blood flow to the brain. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol picks up the LDL and takes it to the liver to be processed. The optimal levels vary from person to person, so always check with your doctor first. As a cardiologist who treats patients with high cholesterol, I always try to use diet as medicine first. Here are the four worst foods for high cholesterol \u2014 and what I eat instead to keep my heart healthy:\n\n1. Red meat\n\nYes, that includes burgers, ribs, steak and pork chops. If you don't want to cut out red meat altogether, focus on small amounts of lean meat. And by small, I mean a portion size of up to three ounces \u2014 and eat red meat at most, once a week. Remember that poultry also contains saturated fat, so avoiding red meat doesn't necessarily mean you should load up on chicken. As for meat alternatives, I'm generally skeptical about engineered foods. To me, plants were never meant to bleed. What to eat instead: Think fish and shellfish. Shrimp may be high in cholesterol, but as long as you don't douse it with butter, it will supply you with plenty of protein while leaving your blood cholesterol alone. Some other delicious lean protein options are white-fleshed fish like tilapia, halibut, cod and bass.\n\n2. Anything fried\n\nFrying food typically ups the calorie count because saturated or trans fats and cholesterol are absorbed by the foods during the process. What to eat instead: Bake potatoes, kale or broccoli to a crisp when you're craving crunch. Or, you can invest in an air fryer, which uses much less fat.\n\n3. Processed meat\n\nThe World Health Organization has classified processed meats such as bacon, hot dogs and salami as carcinogens. Processed meat is also loaded in sodium and saturated fat. What to eat instead: Fake bacon is unlikely to satisfy your cravings for a BLT. My advice? Cut way back on these products and make them special occasion treats.\n\n4. Baked goods", "label": "human"}

{"text": "er Than We Thought. \n\nIt was almost a decade since Akira was first released and still, fans continue to be fascinated by the movie\u2019s iconic motorcycle, the Kaneda bike. Die-hard fans have attempted to re-create their own versions of the legendary machine, only to find out that it\u2019s a lot harder than they expected.\n\nWith Akira\u2019s long-awaited anime remake coming out soon, the Kaneda bike has become an even more popular subject of discussion, with many wondering if it\u2019s possible to recreate it in real life.\n\nHowever, it turns out that making your own Kaneda bike is a lot harder than it looks. That\u2019s because the Kaneda bike isn\u2019t just a prop \u2014 it\u2019s a real, functioning vehicle.\n\nTo begin with, fans would have to find a vintage Suzuki GN125 motorcycle and modify it to look like the Kaneda bike. This is no easy feat, as the GN125 is no longer in production and is difficult to find in good condition. Not to mention, the modifications needed to make the bike look like the one in the movie are complex and time-consuming.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that the bike needs to be powered by two engines \u2014 one in the front and one in the rear \u2014 to emulate the real-life Kaneda bike. The engines must be highly modified and require extensive knowledge of mechanics in order to get them working. Even then, there\u2019s no guarantee that the engines will be able to withstand the weight of the bike and its rider, let alone reach the speeds seen in the movie.\n\nEven if fans do manage to find the right parts and get the engines to work, there\u2019s still the issue of aesthetics. Making the bike look exactly like the one in the movie requires a lot of attention to detail, from the decals to the paint job. All of these modifications have to be carefully planned and executed, which could take a considerable amount of time and effort.\n\nNot to mention, the most difficult part of making your own Kaneda bike is finding the right parts. The bike uses some rare and expensive components, such as the vintage GN125 frame, which can be hard to find. Plus, the complex modifications needed to get the bike working could be expensive, so the total cost of making your own Kaneda bike could be quite high.\n\nDespite all of this, however, some die-hard fans are still determined to make their own version of the legendary machine. There are plenty of tutorials online that detail the process of building your own Kaneda bike, from finding the right parts to assembling it, so fans can still attempt to recreate the iconic bike.\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear that making your own Kaneda bike isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. It requires a lot of money, time, and effort to make the bike look and function like the one in the movie, so fans should think carefully before taking on such a daunting task.", "label": "machine"}

Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) becomes law.\n\nThe proposed law, known as the Protecting Student Loan Forgiveness Act, would prohibit an individual federal judge from blocking an executive order or agency action aimed at forgiving student loan debt. \n\nThe proposal comes after Trump-appointed Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, blocked an executive order issued by former President Barack Obama that would have allowed thousands of former students to have their loans forgiven.\n\nObama had issued the order in 2016 to provide relief to students who had been misled, defrauded, or otherwise taken advantage of by certain for-profit colleges. The order would have allowed for some of the $1.4 trillion in student debt held by Americans to be forgiven.\n\nHowever, Judge O\u2019Connor blocked the executive order from taking effect after a coalition of 20 states and various trade associations sued the Department of Education. The lawsuit argued that the executive order should not have been issued without first receiving Congressional approval.\n\nNow, Neguse\u2019s bill, if enacted, would override Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision and allow the Department of Education to proceed with student loan forgiveness.\n\n\u201cAs a former college student, and son of two college professors, I recognize just how critical student loan forgiveness is for millions of Americans,\" Neguse said in a statement. \"That\u2019s why I am introducing the Protecting Student Loan Forgiveness Act to ensure the Department of Education is able to use existing and future executive actions to deliver relief to students and families struggling with the burden of student loan debt.\u201d\n\nNeguse's bill is being supported by other Democratic lawmakers, including Reps.

{"text": "When it comes to getting from Point A to Point B, it's not always easy to find the perfect transportation solution. The e-bike boom is changing the way people get around, providing a quick, easy and inexpensive way to get around cities and beyond. But this newfound freedom of mobility comes with a big challenge\u2014our country's outdated infrastructure.\n\nAs electric bikes become more popular, cities, states and the federal government must grapple with how to safely and effectively integrate these vehicles into our existing roadways and sidewalks. With the right policies and investments, the e-bike revolution could unlock greater freedom of mobility and reduce traffic congestion\u2014but it requires an urgent commitment to upgrade our nation\u2019s infrastructure and create a safer, more sustainable transportation network for the future.\n\nThe electric bike\u2014or \u201ce-bike\u201d\u2014is a relatively new vehicle category that offers the advantages of a bicycle, but with the added bonus of an electric motor for assistance. It\u2019s quickly becoming an increasingly popular choice for commuters looking for a way to get around faster and with less physical effort. But as demand for these vehicles grows, our outdated roads and sidewalks may not be able to handle the increased traffic.\n\nThe existing infrastructure is ill-equipped to accommodate the increase in bikes, and too many roads lack bike lanes or shared use pathways. Without this infrastructure, people on e-bikes are forced to ride on roads with high speed limits and heavy car traffic, which can be dangerous. Even in areas that do have bike lanes and other dedicated space for cyclists, the infrastructure is often inadequate, poorly maintained or lacks sufficient connection to other bike facilities.\n\nFortunately, the solution is within reach. Our nation needs to prioritize investment in bicycle infrastructure to make it easier, safer and more convenient for people to ride e-bikes. This includes creating more dedicated bike lanes and shared use pathways, expanding existing bike networks, improving connectivity between bike paths, and investing in bike parking and other amenities.\n\nAt the same time, we need to create uniform safety rules for e-bikes, including mandatory helmet laws and minimum speed limits. And we need to educate drivers and other cyclists on how to share the road and sidewalks safely with e-bike riders.\n\nThe e-bike boom offers an unprecedented opportunity to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and increase access to transportation in areas where public transit is limited or unavailable. But in order to unlock these benefits, our nation needs to embrace this new form of mobility and invest in the infrastructure necessary to make it a safe and convenient form of transportation.

{"text": "of monetary policy and financial stability\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said on Thursday that the challenges of monetary policy and financial stability will continue to be in conflict as global financial markets become more interconnected.\n\nLee's remarks come as the Bank of Korea has faced increasing criticism from financial markets over its failure to properly address the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy.\n\nThe governor also warned that the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools may be limited as they are facing greater restrictions due to the presence of capital controls, a factor he said was increasingly being felt by emerging market economies.\n\n\"Monetary policy tools such as interest rate policies and exchange rate policies may be less effective than before,\" Lee said during a news conference. \"Consequently, the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability would create further difficulties.\"\n\nThe Bank of Korea's dilemma is to try to support economic growth with monetary policy while at the same time trying to ensure financial stability by limiting the potential risks posed by large-scale foreign capital flows.\n\nLee also highlighted the challenges posed by an increasingly interconnected global financial system, saying that a failure of one market can now quickly spread to other markets.\n\n\"The increasingly globalized financial markets could be risk factors for financial stability, such as the rise of global debt, the emergence of new financial products, and the emergence of new institutions,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, Lee emphasized the need for Asian countries to strengthen their financial safety nets and to better coordinate their monetary policies and financial regulation.\n\nThe Bank of Korea is currently in the process of introducing a macro-prudential policy framework, which will include the ability to require banks to set aside additional reserves, in order to contain any potential risks posed by large capital flows.\n\nLee said the Bank of Korea would continue to closely monitor the impact of capital flows on the Korean economy and financial system, while trying to provide a stable environment for financial markets.\n\n\"It is important to keep the market in a condition where both monetary and financial stability are secured,\" he said.\n\nLee also highlighted the importance of international cooperation, noting that Asian countries need to work together to better understand the global financial system.\n\n\"We must strengthen international cooperation in order to share information and resources, and to avoid spillover effects,\" he said.\n\nThe governor's remarks come as financial markets have been rocked by the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about the economic fallout from lockdowns and travel restrictions.\n\nThe Bank of Korea has responded with aggressive monetary easing measures, cutting interest rates to a historic low and introducing a series of other monetary policy initiatives, including a surge in government bond purchases.\n\nBut Lee cautioned that the Bank of Korea's response to the pandemic must be carefully balanced against financial stability concerns.\n\n\"We must be aware that the pursuit of financial stability and the pursuit of monetary policy goals may face conflict,\" he said. \"We should keep in mind that, in this situation, it is important to contain risk while looking to support the economy with appropriate policy tools.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In 2021, Google's cofounders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, collectively gave away nearly half a billion dollars from their philanthropic foundations. But looking below the eye-popping dollar figures reveals fascinating differences in how the legendary search-engine wizards distribute their similar largesse.\n\nFrom tech moguls to media magnates, almost every modern billionaire has a few items in their starter kit: yachts, business investments, sprawling real estate, and, of course, a charitable foundation. Philanthropy serves a variety of purposes for today's wealthy, from avoiding taxes to bolstering reputations to making the world better through genuine passion projects.\n\nBrin and Page operate established foundations that give out millions of dollars a year. But since stepping away from Google and its parent company, Alphabet, in 2019, they've taken drastically different paths in life, as Insider detailed in a recent investigation: While Brin has remained relatively in the public eye, Page has shrouded his life in the utmost secrecy.\n\nThis contrast extends even to their approaches to philanthropy, tax documents obtained by Insider show.\n\n2 moguls, 2 different approaches to charities\n\nBrin's personal foundation, the Sergey Brin Family Foundation, disbursed roughly $250 million in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe nonprofit's 990 forms filed with the IRS show dozens of causes the foundation has picked to donate to. The largest donation in 2021 was roughly $101 million given to the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which invests in research around Parkinson's disease. Brin's mother was diagnosed with the disease in the 1990s, and he has estimated he has about a 50-50 chance of developing the disease himself.\n\nSome other notable recipients of his largesse include ClimateWorks Foundation ($7.5 million), which is dedicated to fighting the climate crisis; LifeMoves ($8 million), a nonprofit that supports homeless people; and the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($15.3 million), along with other medical, environmental, educational, and human-rights-related causes. Brin has in recent years also shown an interest in more offbeat causes and organizations, like the Open Lunar Foundation, a nonprofit advocating moon colonization.\n\nBrin, 49, also appears to play a fairly active role in steering these donations. The documents indicate he spends about two hours a week working on the philanthropic organization. And in addition to the donations the foundation made, Brin pulled out his pocketbook to give $130 million directly to the Michael J. Fox Foundation.\n\nBy contrast, Page spends only 15 minutes a week working on his own foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation.\n\nThe organization made just over $196 million in charitable disbursements in 2021 \u2014 but just $38,894 went directly to a handpicked charity: Shoo the Flu, an influenza-fighting organization that Page has funded for several years. The rest \u2014 over 99% of the total giving \u2014 was directed to just one recipient: National Philanthropic Trust, a donor-advised fund.\n\nBeloved by the ultrawealthy, donor-advised funds are private investment vehicles that allow donors to make tax-deductible contributions to a pool of funds that are then distributed to charities over time. They offer private foundations, which must disburse 5% of their assets annually to maintain tax benefits, a way to hit that minimum. But money can sit in a DAF indefinitely, potentially delaying it from reaching a charity. And there's no way to publicly track where a DAF ultimately distributes its funds. Page has embraced DAFs: He moved $31,344,355 to a DAF in 2020 \u2014 about 96% of his total giving that year.\n\nChoosing to give directly through one's foundation instead of going through a DAF has trade-offs. \"You give up some confidentiality if you give through a foundation that's in your name, and you give up some control if it's in a donor-advised fund,\" said Natasha Pearl, the founder of the family-office firm Aston Pearl.\n\nThe use of DAFs fits Page's business style, allowing him to obfuscate his giving. In exchange, Page gives up some control over those funds. While he and his lieutenants have advisory control over the money they give to the National Philanthropic Trust \u2014 one of the biggest grantmaking institutions in the US \u2014 they give up legal control over the funds.\n\nA representative for Brin declined to comment on the record. Page's team did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nA peek inside the kingdoms\n\nIn addition to highlighting the Google cofounders' stylistic differences, the paperwork for the two foundations offers a glimpse of who Brin and Page have entrusted to manage their respective fortunes.\n\nThe Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation lists Page and his wife, Lucinda Southworth, as directors and Wayne Osborne as the secretary. Osborne is the CEO of Koop, the family office that manages Page's sprawling empire of assets, from business investments to private islands. Filings for the foundation are certified by Cristina Rosado, a longtime tax aide for Koop whose signature is often found on the copious LLCs spun up to obfuscate Page's involvement in his investments and properties.\n\nThe Sergey Brin Family Foundation lists three key officers. In addition to Brin, who's listed as the director and president, there's Tara Farnsworth, the treasurer. Farnsworth has been the CFO of Brin's family office, Bayshore Global Management, for more than a decade. Brin's father, Michael Brin, a retired mathematician, serves as secretary. (The filings indicate that all three of them spend two hours a week working on the foundation.) The foundation also contracts consulting services from the political-communications firm GMMB (for $4 million a year), the consultancy Freedman Consulting ($1.48 million), the science advisory firm Coalition for Aligning Science ($1.17 million), the consulting giant Deloitte ($500,000), and the philanthropy advisory firm Open Impact ($320,000).\n\nBrin's and Page's philanthropic donations, while extensive, represent a fraction of their net worths. Forbes estimates that Page is worth about $83 billion, while Brin is worth roughly $80 billion. These charitable efforts are also just one part of Brin's and Page's expansive personal fiefdoms. Both operate sprawling family offices \u2014 Bayshore and Koop \u2014 to manage their residential properties, boats, and tropical islands; to make noncharitable investments and responsibly steward their capital; and to hire and manage aides, housekeepers, cleaners, and other staffers. The way their family offices are managed reflects their differing styles.\n\nThe contrast between the public-facing Brin and the reclusive Page even extends to the minor details of their philanthropic efforts. Brin donates directly to the Sergey Brin Family Foundation, while Page's contributions to the Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation are routed through a limited-liability company named Florida LLC.\n\nHugh Langley is a correspondent at Insider covering Alphabet and Google.

{"text": "Economists are sounding the alarm bells about a likely recession in 2023.\n\nInsider spoke to five personal finance experts to get their tips on preparing for a downturn.\n\nBuilding up an emergency budget by changing your spending and saving habits is key, they said.\n\nThe alarm bells are sounding on the US economy and many economists expect a recession in 2023. That means it's time to take action to protect your finances.\n\nInsider spoke to five personal finance experts to uncover the key steps to help you bulletproof your finances ahead of a rocky new year.\n\n1. Build an emergency fund\n\nThe experts advised building up an emergency fund to cover your expenses if you lose your job. Such a fund would ideally cover three to six months' worth of expenses, they said.\n\nThe average American household spent nearly $67,000 on expenses \u2014 things like housing, food, and transportation costs \u2014 in 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So, for the average household, the emergency fund would need to be between $16,750 and $33,500.\n\nJeremy Schneider, founder of the Personal Finance Club, a website which sells financial education courses on budgeting and investing, said if you don't have three to six months' worth of expenses saved up, you're going to need to spend less and save more to get there.\n\nGetting a budgeting app might be the best way to do that, according to Steve Chen, founder of Call to Leap, an educational investing site. These can help you better visualize and prioritize your expenses.\n\n2. Trim your regular outgoings\n\nThinking hard about everyday expenses can help you find savings. Such an exercise often requires the least effort and bears the most fruit, said Cameron Huddleston, an author and director of Carefull, a security service for elderly people's finances.\n\nBundling your car insurance and home insurance together, finding a cheaper cellphone or internet plan, reducing the number of streaming subscriptions you have, and making your own coffee and lunch rather than buying them every day can prove to be easy wins for cutting regular spending.\n\nPaying off your highest-interest credit cards in a time of rising rates can be the most effective way of paying down debt before it's too late, Chen said.\n\n3. Rein in major expenses and squeeze more out of your home\n\nCutting costs like streaming subscriptions can lead to small and worthwhile savings, but expenses such as these nonetheless pale in comparison with the core drains on your finances.\n\nThe cost of running a car is usually higher than it needs to be, Schneider said, and can be a key source of indebtedness for many. If there are two vehicles in your household, now might be the time to consider getting rid of one and joining a car-sharing club, buying a bicycle or scooter, taking public transport, or walking, Chen suggested.\n\nEmilie Bellet, founder of educational finance site Vestpod and host of the Wallet Podcast, tells people to scrutinize their spending habits: \"When we recognize what specific emotions drive our impulsive spending, we can then be more mindful about our decisions.\"\n\nStill, housing is the biggest expense for most people and can seriously move the dial on your financial resilience, the experts said.\n\nHuddleston advised homeowners to think about renting out spare rooms, or opening them up to AirBnB.\n\nSchneider said: \"Your problem is your $650 payment on your truck that's sitting outside. Your problem is your $2,000 rent. So the options are things like getting a roommate, or downgrading your car.\"\n\nIncome can also be found from unwanted possessions around the home. \"Looking around your house and saying 'what can I sell for money?' is another way of getting some cash for little work,\" Huddleston said.\n\n4. Look for side-hustles\n\nAhead of a likely downturn, it could be worth taking advantage of a strong labor market that still has plenty of jobs.\n\nIf you have the time, finding additional employment is the quickest way to bring in extra income, the experts said. For example, Schneider said, a bar shift that pays $100 could garner an extra $800 of income per month if you're able to do two a week.\n\nDog-walking, babysitting, answering paid online surveys, and gardening can also help bring in extra cash in times of need, the experts said.\n\nIn an age of \"over-employment,\" remote working, and quiet-quitting, Chen said people are increasingly able to find the time to take on additional jobs and side-hustles from home.\n\n5. Find sources of passive income\n\nPassive income streams are the holy grail for financial independence \u2014 but it takes a fair amount of groundwork to put them in place.\n\n\"Drop-shipping\" \u2014 acting as an intermediary between a supplier and customers \u2013 affiliate marketing, and earning advertising income from websites are some ways you can build passive income streams. Some people have bought vending machines and rented property.\n\nOlamide Majekodunmi, founder of All Things Money, a financial education blog for millennials, said it's important not to sink too many up-front costs into passive income streams in the hope they'll bear fruit.\n\nAnd Chen said it still takes lots of work to get to a point where you can enjoy passive income. He makes money uploading old videos to social media.\n\n6. Upskill\n\nThe negative effects of a recession, like falling income and higher unemployment, may not become evident until some months into the downturn. That leaves plenty of time to build up a new monetizable skill, Schneider said.\n\nLearning search engine optimization, content-writing, and user experience design, for example, are skills that are in demand from companies and offer lots of freelance opportunities, Huddleston and Schneider both said.\n\n\"There's so many free online courses now that allow you to bolster those skills,\" Majekodunmi said.\n\n7. Transfer extra income into a hard-to-reach savings account\n\nOnce your finances are on a better footing, you should begin automatically transferring additional income into a savings account you can't easily access, to stop the temptation to spend, Huddleston said.\n\n\"Have that amount, the total amount that you're saving from all these ways that you're going to trim your expenses in half, that automatically transfers to a savings account,\" he advised.\n\n8. Don't panic!\n\nThe worst thing you can do with a downturn on the horizon is act rashly, the experts told Insider. Now is the time to ensure your finance fundamentals are on the right track \u2014 and not necessarily to pull money out of investments.\n\n\"If you're already an investor, it's important not to panic and keep your mind focused on long-term goals,\" Bellet said. \"Continue investing. Remember, investing regularly over a long period of time works.\"\n\nDon't try to pack in all these suggestions at once, for risk of getting overwhelmed, Chen said. \"Start by downloading a budgeting app this week, then in two weeks, pay off a credit card. The rest will follow.\"\n\nSchneider said households must try to keep expenses below income, and to boost savings regardless of how the wider economy is faring.\n\n\"A habit of what wealthy people do is they don't think about this week,\" he said. \"They think about six months, or a year, or five years from now.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "2020 was a watershed year for TikTok, and now it appears news outlets are increasingly embracing the platform in an effort to reach younger audiences.\n\nA survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in early 2021 found that 35 percent of U.S. news organizations had a presence on TikTok. It was a marked increase from the 18 percent of outlets that reported having a TikTok presence in the previous survey, which was conducted in December 2019.\n\nThe survey found that outlets, ranging from local television stations to national networks, were motivated to create TikTok accounts in a bid to reach younger audiences. And, while they can't match the creative appeal of the platform's user-generated content, news organizations are finding success on the platform.\n\nCNN, for instance, has notched more than 600,000 followers on its TikTok account since its launch in October 2020. The account has grown significantly in recent months, and has featured videos on topics ranging from the pandemic to natural disasters. It recently shared a video that has generated more than 4 million views.\n\nThe news organization\u2019s investment in the platform has paid off, with some videos receiving tens of thousands of engagements and garnering hundreds of thousands of views. A video about a couple rekindling their relationship after spending two decades apart, for instance, went viral and earned more than 800,000 views in a single day.\n\nIn addition to news outlets, civic-minded organizations have sought to leverage the power of TikTok in recent months. Media organizations such as the Associated Press, Bloomberg, and the Los Angeles Times have opened accounts in an effort to reach young people on the platform.\n\nSeveral media companies have also reached out to influencers to help spread their message on the app. The New York Times recently signed a deal with one of the app\u2019s top influencers, Alex Warren, to help spread the newspaper\u2019s content to a new audience.\n\nThe Times and other outlets have also used the app to conduct polls and solicit feedback from younger audiences on topics like politics and the economy. It appears that media outlets are beginning to realize the power of TikTok as a way to engage with younger audiences and to reach out to potential new subscribers.\n\nAt the same time, media organizations have also had to adapt to the app\u2019s rapidly-changing rules and regulations. The platform recently changed its policies on user generated content and created new restrictions on how users can interact with others, which has forced outlets to think more carefully about how they use the app.\n\nOverall, though, the survey indicates that outlets are increasingly embracing TikTok as a means to reach younger audiences. As the platform continues to grow in popularity, news outlets will likely continue to experiment with new ways to use the app to engage with younger audiences and reach new subscribers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It all started with an idea and a dream. I\u2019d heard about people building treehouses in their backyards and thought it sounded like an interesting project. I never could have imagined it would turn into a successful business.\n\nIt was late 2018 when I first started thinking about the idea. I\u2019d been laid off from my job and was feeling a bit down on my luck. I wanted to do something to get me out of my funk and create some extra income.\n\nSo I spent some time researching treehouse construction and found a local builder who could help. I designed a two-story treehouse with a loft and a porch, and the builder was able to bring my vision to life.\n\nIt was a great feeling seeing the finished product. I decided to turn it into an Airbnb rental, thinking it could bring in some extra income while I looked for a job.\n\nI listed the treehouse on Airbnb and was pleasantly surprised by the response. Bookings started rolling in almost immediately, and within a few months, I was making enough money as an Airbnb host to be able to quit my job and become a full-time entrepreneur.\n\nThe process of managing the treehouse hasn\u2019t always been easy, but the rewards have been well worth it. I\u2019ve met so many amazing people from all over the world and had the opportunity to share my corner of the world with them. It\u2019s been a really rewarding experience.\n\nThe treehouse has proven to be a great investment. I charge between $200 and $250 per night, depending on the season, and I\u2019m able to manage the property on my own with very little overhead. I\u2019ve also had a lot of repeat customers, which makes it all the more satisfying.\n\nFor anyone considering setting up their own Airbnb rental, I\u2019d highly recommend it. There\u2019s a lot of work involved but it can be incredibly rewarding. It\u2019s given me the freedom to be my own boss, explore my creativity, and make a comfortable living. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with how it\u2019s turned out.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ": \n\nIn 2023, couples around the world are struggling to go on first dates. It\u2019s not because they can\u2019t find someone they\u2019re interested in; it\u2019s because of the crippling inflation rates that have left many people unable to afford a dinner out.\n\nThe global economy has been suffering from high inflation rates for many years, and it\u2019s only getting worse. As governments around the world have had to borrow heavily to pay for things like stimulus packages and fighting the pandemic, the money supply has grown, leading to prices rising even faster than wages. This has been especially hard on those in the lower income brackets, who have seen their purchasing power diminish significantly.\n\nThis has had a direct effect on the restaurant industry, which has been a major part of the economy for decades. As people struggle to make ends meet, they are less likely to spend money on a romantic dinner. Restaurants are also trying to compete with the plethora of online delivery services, which can be much more affordable. \n\nThe trend has been especially pronounced in the United States, where inflation has been higher than in most other developed nations. A 2020 survey of diners in the U.S. found that more than two-thirds of them had reduced their spending on meals out over the past five years due to increasing prices.\n\nThis has caused many restaurants to re-evaluate their pricing strategies, as they are finding that they can\u2019t always charge the prices they used to. In some cases, restaurants have started to offer specials or discounts to make their prices more competitive. While this can help make eating out a little bit more affordable, it isn\u2019t enough for many people who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe long-term effects of this trend could be significant for the restaurant industry, as it could lead to a reduction in the number of restaurants in certain areas or a decrease in the number of people going out to eat. This could also have implications for the entire economy, as restaurants are a major job provider and contribute a significant amount to GDP.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that something needs to be done to address the issue of inflation. In the meantime, those looking to go on a first date may want to consider more affordable options, like going to a local park or having a picnic. While it may not be as romantic as a fancy dinner, it\u2019s certainly more feasible in this economic climate.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "MUMBAI, Jan 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Every time Vodafone\u2019s beleaguered Indian business appears to catch a financial break, it moves closer to actually snapping.\n\nOne year ago, Vodafone Idea (VODA.NS) told investors it was accepting a lifeline from the government: a debt-for-equity swap to remove roughly $2 billion of interest payments on mobile-phone spectrum and other charges over four years would hand New Delhi 36% of the financially stretched company. Investors cheered, and many customers in its now-234 million-and shrinking subscriber base breathed a sigh of relief. That lifeline never materialised, though, leaving the country\u2019s third-largest operator caught in a game of financial chicken.\n\nThe swap was part of a reform package to support the sector and was supposed to help the company tap new investors for capital: The $3 billion Vodafone is heaving under $27 billion of net debt, an eye-watering 13 times its annualised EBITDA. The deal also gave other creditors confidence Vodafone might be able to pay its bills: one of those, $6 billion Indus Towers (INUS.NS), a telecom infrastructure company, accepted softer re-payment terms from its customer late last year. But the government now wants the company\u2019s two largest shareholders - Britain\u2019s Vodafone (VOD.L) and its tycoon partner Kumar Mangalam Birla of the Aditya Birla Group - to inject another $3 billion or so into the business. Vodafone, meanwhile, is now calling on the banks for fresh loans, per the Economic Times.\n\nThe country\u2019s minister of communications, Ashwini Vaishnaw, said on Thursday that the conversion was a \u201ccomplex issue\u201d under discussion. The two owners infused more than $500 million last year after the debt rejig was announced. That may not have been sufficient, but there was no disclosure by the company stating that the swap was conditional on the existing owners\u2019 financial commitment. Indeed, in 2021, Birla wrote a letter to the government warning that without official support the situation would drive its operations to \u201can irretrievable point of collapse\u201d.\n\nAll sides come off looking bad, but it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising. India\u2019s politicians are careful to avoid situations where they might be accused of being too generous to foreign multinationals. Banks won\u2019t want to lend more money to entities that look unviable. Without fresh funds, however, Vodafone won\u2019t be able to invest in 5G at the pace required to keep up with Bharti Airtel (BRTI.NS) and Reliance Industries\u2019 (RELI.NS) Jio, its profitable rivals. That will effectively condemn the company formed through a defensive merger in 2017 to a slow, painful decline, and the country to a telecom duopoly.

{"text": "(Bloomberg) -- President Xi Jinping said tough challenges remain in China\u2019s fight against Covid-19 and urged patience, after weeks of silence on a virus policy pivot that\u2019s infected hundreds of millions and delivered a severe blow to economic activity.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIn a New Year\u2019s address on Saturday, Xi said the country is in a new phase of Covid control and has adapted after following a science-based and targeted approach. The day before, he said the nation\u2019s strategy had been \u201coptimized\u201d to protect people\u2019s lives and minimize economic costs.\n\nThe government on Dec. 7 took definitive easing steps from its harsh zero-tolerance approach to containing Covid, which had included snap lockdowns, frequent mass testing and largely closed borders. Xi had repeatedly defended the strategy despite mounting economic costs, including as late as mid-October.\n\nBut on Saturday, the leader made what seemed to be a rare acknowledge of the hardships the Chinese people endured during the punishing lockdowns, as well as in the rapid spread of Covid.\n\n\u201cSince Covid-19 struck, we have put the people first and put life first all along,\u201d Xi said. \u201cWith extraordinary efforts, we have prevailed over unprecedented difficulties and challenges, and it has not been an easy journey for anyone. We have now entered a new phase of Covid response where tough challenges remain.\u201d\n\nOn top of repeated Covid outbreaks, China\u2019s economy in 2022 muddled through a persistent property market slump, sluggish consumer demand and waning overseas appetite for its goods.\n\nXi\u2019s televised broadcast came after data earlier in the day showed economic activity in December contracting the most from the previous month since February 2020. Home sales continued to slump in December, while reports due this week are forecast to show a further squeeze in the manufacturing and services sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile analysts forecast growth slowed to 3% in 2022, Xi said China\u2019s gross domestic product exceeded 120 trillion yuan ($17.4 trillion) last year, suggesting the economy expanded at least 4.4%.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese economy enjoys great resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality,\u201d Xi said. \u201cThe fundamentals sustaining its long-term growth have remained strong.\u201d\n\nEconomists see an increasing possibility for a faster and stronger rebound later in 2023. After the likely slow start in the January-to-March period, growth is projected to pick up to 4.8% for the year, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIt is actually hard for analysts to provide a reasonable forecast given the virus uncertainties over the past month,\u201d Guotai Junan International\u2019s chief economist Hao Zhou said in a note on Saturday, referring to December\u2019s manufacturing PMI data. \u201cWe reckon investors to look beyond these sentiment figures and pay attention to the high-frequency economic activity data that would provide a gauge of post-pandemic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe president had hoped 2022 would be a celebratory year for him, one that allowed him to secure a third term in power at a Communist Party congress in October. Yet just over than a month later, his government faced the most widespread protests in decades as public anger over its Covid Zero strategy boiled over.\n\nChina Covid Unrest Boils Over as Citizens Defy Lockdown Efforts\n\nWithout referring to the protests, Xi said in his speech that it\u2019s \u201conly natural\u201d for the country\u2019s 1.4 billion people to have different concerns and views on some issues. \u201cWhat matters is that we build consensus through communication and consultation,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, China says it has thousands of new cases a day. But the government\u2019s top health authority estimated as many as 248 million people, or nearly 18% of the population, likely contracted the virus in the first 20 days of December. The result has been overwhelmed hospital emergency rooms and crematoriums.\n\nThe nation could see as many as 25,000 deaths a day from Covid-19 in January, according to Airfinity Ltd., a London-based research firm that focuses on predictive health analytics.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make an extra effort to pull through, as perseverance and solidarity mean victory,\u201d Xi said on the virus battle, adding the \u201clight of hope is right in front of us.\u201d\n\nXi is betting an economic rebound this year will help the nation through the shock, with officials vowing at a recent meeting of the 24-member Politburo to revive consumption and support the private sector.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank on Friday pledged to support domestic demand and maintain \u201ceffective\u201d growth of credit. Monetary policy \u201cwill focus on stabilizing growth, employment and prices, as well as supporting the expansion of domestic demand,\u201d the People\u2019s Bank of China said.\n\nThe PBOC reiterated it will provide stronger backing to the real economy, keep prices basically stable and step up targeted stimulus for key areas and industries damaged by the pandemic. It also said it would meet the property industry\u2019s reasonable financing needs, and push forward mergers and acquisitions in the sector.\n\n\u201cGiven surging infections, the economy is in for a rough time in the next few months before the reopening boost starts to kick in \u2014 likely in late February or March after the initial wave has crested,\u201d said David Qu of Bloomberg Economics. \u201cThe data reinforce our view that further policy support will be forthcoming, with the People\u2019s Bank of China likely to cut rates\u201d in the first quarter help stabilize the economy, he said.\n\n--With assistance from Zhang Dingmin and Yujing Liu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the finalization of a rule that significantly expands the availability of medication abortion pills by removing the requirement that they be provided in person by a certified healthcare professional.\n\nThe new rule, which goes into effect immediately, permits medication abortion pills to be distributed at pharmacies and other retail outlets, allowing people to access the pills at a time and location that is most convenient for them. It also allows physicians to prescribe these pills via the internet and other telemedicine methods.\n\n\"This rule marks an important step forward in giving people the access they need to reproductive healthcare,\" said acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. \"It is a significant advancement in expanding access to medication abortion, offering people more options when it comes to their reproductive health care. We are proud to be able to offer this additional pathway for people to access this important medication safely and effectively.\"\n\nThe FDA said the rule will make it easier for people to access the abortion pill in the same way that other medications are prescribed and distributed. The agency said the rule applies to the medication known as mifepristone, which is used with the drug misoprostol for the termination of pregnancies.\n\nThe FDA's action is seen as a major victory for reproductive rights advocates, who have long called for access to the abortion pill without restrictions. Many advocates applauded the move, but noted that there is still more to be done to ensure full access to abortion.\n\n\"This is a critical step in expanding access to abortion, but it must be followed by removing other barriers to care, such as insurance coverage restrictions, waiting periods, and mandatory counseling,\" said Sasha Bruce, the national director of NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"The American public overwhelmingly wants to see abortion remain legal and accessible, and we must all continue to fight against the politicians who are determined to chip away at that right.\"\n\nThe FDA's move comes after a number of states have attempted to restrict access to the abortion pill by mandating that it be provided in person by a certified healthcare professional, such as a doctor. Those restrictions were challenged in court, and the Supreme Court recently struck down a Louisiana law that required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\nThe FDA's new rule, however, does not apply to every state. In states where there are restrictions on abortion, such as Texas and Ohio, the rule does not apply. In these states, access to the abortion pill must still be provided in person.\n\nWhile the FDA's new rule is a major step forward for access to abortion, many reproductive rights advocates say there is still much work to be done to ensure that everyone has the right to access the abortion pill.\n\n\"The FDA's rule is a good first step, but it's not enough,\" said Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive justice organization. \"We must continue to fight for access to abortion and to ensure that everyone can make their own decisions about their reproductive health without politicians interfering.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nHeavy tax-loss selling weighed on stocks at the end of 2022, and some of those names could be poised for rebounds in the new year, Morgan Stanley said Thursday.\n\nIn a note to clients, strategist Michael Wilson said a large number of stocks likely sold off in December as portfolio managers scrambled to take losses before the end of the year to offset potential gains and reduce their tax liability.\n\nThe strategist identified a list of names that he believes should now be due for a rebound given the magnitude of the December sell-off.\n\n\"With the calendar now flipped to 2023 we will start to see tax-loss selling reverse, particularly for those stocks that sold off in December to the greatest degree,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nThe strategist expects a rebound in some financials, REITs, energy and materials stocks.\n\nWilson said he expects the 'golden opportunity' of the late 2022 sell-off to create attractive entry points for some of the stocks on his list, including Morgan Stanley itself.\n\nOther stocks the strategist identified as potential winners include Anthem, J.M. Smucker, First Solar, Alcoa, Devon Energy, and the SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF.\n\n\"In each of these cases, we think the risk/reward is attractive,\" he wrote.\n\nWilson added that while some of these stocks may have seen a modest bounce already, he expects that they \"should continue to grind higher\" in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe strategist also said that he believes the strong rise in cyclical and value stocks that began in the fourth quarter of 2022 should carry into the first quarter of 2023.\n\n\"There is still a lot to be excited about in terms of new stimulus and potential further returns to cyclical and value stocks that could still drive additional upside in stocks and other assets over the next quarter,\" he wrote.\n\nIn conclusion, Wilson said that investors should take advantage of the tax-loss selling rebound and look for golden opportunities to buy cyclical stocks on the dip.\n\n\"We think the rotation out of growth and into value, particularly in the more cyclical sectors, continues to be one of the dominant investment themes for the first quarter,\" he wrote. \"We remain bullish on these 'cheap cyclicals' and recommend taking advantage of any pullbacks due to tax-loss selling.\"", "label": "machine"}

The president also touted job gains since he took office in January, which he noted have been far above initial expectations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming back stronger and more resilient than ever,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToday, I can say with certainty that the economy is on a winning streak.\u201d\n\nAccording to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), wages and salaries have seen the largest increase in nearly a decade. Over the past year, wages and salaries have jumped 6.3%, which is the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has cooled off. According to the BLS, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose just 1.4% in the 12 months ending in November, the slowest rate of increase since April 2019.\n\nThe news was welcomed by Biden, who said that the wage gains were particularly encouraging.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that wage growth for working families is taking hold and we\u2019re finally starting to see inflation levels that are manageable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means more money for working families to use on necessities, like putting food on the table, paying the mortgage or rent, or just having a little extra cash to save.\u201d\n\nBiden also said that the economy has been helped by the nearly $5 trillion in aid that has been pumped into the economy since he took office. This has included more than $2 trillion in direct payments to Americans and billions more in aid to small businesses and state and local governments.\n\nThe president also said that the recent passage of the $900 billion COVID-19 relief package will provide further assistance to the economy. He said that the package includes enhanced unemployment benefits, a second round of direct payments to most Americans and funding for vaccine distribution, among other provisions.\n\n\u201cThis relief package is essential for Americans who are struggling,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt will also help jumpstart our economy as we continue to emerge from the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe news on wages and inflation comes as the US economy continues to show signs of recovery. The unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7%, down from a peak of 14.7% in April. Last month, the economy added 245,000 jobs, pushing the number of jobs gained since January to over 12 million.\n\nStill, Biden warned that there is more work to be done to ensure that the nation\u2019s economy continues on a path of growth. He said that additional relief and stimulus measures would be necessary to help boost the economy further.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to let up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must keep pushing forward and focus on helping American workers, families and businesses get back on their feet.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

REUTERS/Staff\n\nSummary\n\nSummary Companies State media says severe illness from COVID is rare\n\nChinese scientists expected to brief WHO\n\nChina factory activity shrinks in December\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - State media in China played down the severity of its surge of COVID-19 infections ahead of an expected briefing on Tuesday by its scientists to the World Health Organization, which is hoping for detailed data on the evolution of the virus.\n\nChina's abrupt U-turn on COVID controls on Dec. 7, as well as the accuracy of its case and mortality data, have come under increasing scrutiny at home and abroad and prompted some countries to impose travel curbs.\n\nThe policy shift followed protests over the \"zero COVID\" approach championed by Xi Jinping, marking the strongest show of public defiance in his decade-old presidency and coinciding with the slowest growth in China in nearly half a century.\n\nAs the virus spreads unchecked, funeral parlours have reported a spike in demand for their services and international health experts predict at least one million deaths in the world's most populous country this year.\n\nChina reported three new COVID deaths for Monday, taking its official death toll since the pandemic began to 5,253.\n\nOn Tuesday, the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, cited Chinese experts as saying the illness caused by the virus was relatively mild for most people.\n\n\"Severe and critical illnesses account for 3% to 4% of infected patients currently admitted to designated hospitals in Beijing,\" Tong Zhaohui, vice president of the Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, told the newspaper.\n\nKang Yan, head of West China Tianfu Hospital of Sichuan University, said that in the past three weeks, a total of 46 patients had been admitted to intensive care units, or about 1% of symptomatic infections.\n\nThe emergencies area at the Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai was packed with patients on Tuesday, most of them elderly, a Reuters witness said. Some were in beds in the corridor, covered with blankets and receiving IV treatment, while dozens were queuing around them, waiting to be seen by a doctor. It was unclear how many were there with COVID.\n\n'SIMPLY UNREASONABLE'\n\nThe World Health Organization has urged Chinese health officials to regularly share specific and real-time information on the COVID situation.\n\nThe WHO has invited Chinese scientists to present detailed data on viral sequencing at a Tuesday meeting of a technical advisory group. It has also asked China to share data on hospitalizations, deaths and vaccinations.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think China will be very sincere in disclosing information,\" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore.\n\n\"They would rather just keep it to themselves or they would say nothing happened, nothing is new.

{"text": "to the market\n\nAt the start of the trading day on Thursday, the markets were abuzz with news that a former Wall Street darling is finally back. After a six-year absence from the public markets, American Apparel is set to begin trading under its new parent company, Gildan Activewear Inc.\n\nThe iconic clothing company, which was founded in 1989 by Dov Charney, had a long and sometimes tumultuous relationship with the markets. Having gone public in 2007, American Apparel subsequently spent the next decade making headlines for its flagrant disregard for the rules of corporate finance, with the company's profits dwindling, debt mounting, and stock price bottoming out.\n\nBy 2015, it had become obvious that Charney's time was up and American Apparel was on the brink of bankruptcy. After months of speculation, the company announced that it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October of that year.\n\nGildan Activewear, one of the world's leading manufacturers of branded apparel, had been a major supplier to American Apparel and saw an opportunity in the company's distress. After several rounds of negotiations, Gildan was eventually able to purchase the majority of American Apparel's assets in February 2017.\n\nAfter the acquisition, Gildan made the decision to keep the American Apparel brand, choosing instead to focus on rejuvenating the company's image. It managed to keep much of the company's original retail footprint, shuttering some stores but adding new ones in locations like Las Vegas and Toronto.\n\nThe company also sought to modernize its operations, investing in automation and new systems. It also changed its marketing approach, launching campaigns aimed at Generation Z consumers, who are increasingly being seen as important drivers of growth for apparel companies.\n\nThe efforts paid off, and the company's sales and profits began to grow. In December 2020, Gildan announced that it would be taking American Apparel public. The company is expected to launch a pilot program in the next few months, with a full public offering expected to take place sometime in the second quarter of this year.\n\nAt the same time, Gildan has also made a few changes to its corporate governance, revamping its board and taking steps to further strengthen its financials. As a result of the restructuring, Gildan will own less than 20% of American Apparel's shares, allowing the company to become more independent and allowing more investors to get involved.\n\nWith the company set to make its return to the markets, there is no doubt that it is entering a much different atmosphere than the one it left in 2015. The markets are now more competitive and the retail industry has undergone considerable transformation since then, with digital native companies and e-commerce giants taking up more and more space.\n\nStill, American Apparel's return to the markets is no doubt exciting news for those who have long followed its fate. The company will now have a chance to prove itself in a much different environment, and with its new parent company's backing, it stands a good chance of success.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The FIFA World Cup is the most-watched sporting event on the planet, attracting over 3 billion viewers every four years. As a global platform, it offers FIFA the opportunity to promote its values, which include diversity, sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nWith the 2022 Qatar World Cup just a year away, FIFA is beginning to put in place plans to make the tournament one of the most sustainable in its history. The organisation has adopted a \u2018Green Goal\u2019 which seeks to reduce the tournament\u2019s carbon emissions by 30% over the next four years.\n\nBut what does this mean in practice? How exactly does FIFA plan to make this tournament more sustainable? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key initiatives being implemented as part of the Green Goal. \n\nOne of the most prominent initiatives is the \u2018Football for Good\u2019 programme, which is designed to create a lasting environmental legacy by teaching children the importance of sustainability. The programme uses football as a tool to teach children about recycling, energy efficiency and water conservation.\n\nFIFA is also encouraging host countries to generate their own energy to power the tournament. Qatar has committed to generating 25% of its power from renewable sources by 2022. This includes plans to build a 500 MW solar power plant and to increase the number of charging points for electric cars.\n\nFIFA has also been working to reduce the tournament\u2019s carbon footprint by making sure the stadia and other infrastructure are as energy-efficient as possible. The organisation is using modern technology to create buildings that use less energy, while also exploring ways to reuse materials and minimise waste.\n\nIn addition, FIFA has been working with its sponsors to reduce the environmental impact of merchandise. Fans will be able to purchase official merchandise made from sustainable materials, such as organic cotton, recycled plastic and even bamboo.\n\nFinally, FIFA is introducing initiatives to make sure spectators can travel to and from games in the most sustainable way possible. There will be dedicated lanes on Qatar\u2019s roads to reduce congestion, while the organisation is also encouraging fans to carpool and use public transport.\n\nThese are just some of the initiatives FIFA is implementing to make the 2022 Qatar World Cup one of the most sustainable in history. The organisation has also put in place a number of long-term initiatives to ensure that the tournament continues to be a leader in sustainability for many years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The world is watching with anticipation as 2023 looms closer and closer, poised to bring with it a true test of the West\u2019s oil-war tactics. The conflict began in late 2021, when a group of countries - led by the United States and other Western powers - launched a large-scale military campaign in the Middle East.\n\nThe stated objective was to curb oil production in the region and stop the free flow of oil to the rest of the world. It was a bold move, and one with far-reaching implications.\n\nSince then, the situation has been tense. Oil prices have been on the rise, thanks to the disruption of the global oil market. But so far, the tactics employed by the Western powers have not had their desired effect.\n\nIn 2023, this could all change. The US and its allies are planning to implement a series of aggressive measures designed to finally bring the region\u2019s oil production under control. These measures include additional sanctions, targeted strikes, and military strikes against key oil facilities in the region.\n\nThe US and its allies are banking on the hope that these tactics will be enough to finally curb the region\u2019s oil production. But this is far from certain. Many experts have warned that the measures could backfire and lead to a massive spike in oil prices, potentially sending the global economy into a tailspin.\n\nThere is also a risk that the conflict could escalate into a larger, more dangerous conflict. Already, the US and its allies have been accused of violating international law by launching a military campaign against the region. If the conflict were to escalate, it could lead to a direct confrontation between the two sides, a scenario that nobody wants to see.\n\nThe 2023 deadline will therefore be a critical test for the West\u2019s oil-war tactics. Will their strategies finally pay off and bring about an end to the conflict? Or will they lead to an escalation of hostilities and potential disaster?\n\nWhatever the outcome, the coming year will be a crucial one for the future of the Middle East and the global economy. The stakes are high, and the world will be watching closely as the 2023 deadline approaches.", "label": "machine"}

Colleagues say he covered the entire African continent \u2014 sometimes as a one-man band \u2014 during the network\u2019s early years when newsgathering budgets were lean.\n\nGary Strieker, who passed away in July 2022, helped establish CNN's presence in Africa. He covered some of the most pivotal moments across the continent in the 1980s and '90s.

Courtesy Strieker family After leaving CNN in 2004, Strieker focused his journalism on underreported global health and environmental issues, most recently for \"This American Land,\" a series on public television stations across the US. \"His journalism sought to put a spotlight on populations in need,\" said colleague Dave Timko, pictured here with Strieker in India. Courtesy Global Health Frontiers Strieker, pictured with his youngest two children, Reid, left, and Nandi, right. Courtesy Strieker Family The life and career of Gary Strieker Prev Next\n\n\u201cHe was passionate about (Africa) and he wanted to share that love of the continent with all its craziness and violence, but also its beauty and fun,\u201d said Kim Norgaard, CNN\u2019s senior director of operations for international newsgathering.\n\nStrieker won an Emmy award in 1992 for his role in CNN\u2019s coverage of Somalia\u2019s civil war and he is credited with being one of the first television journalists to enter Rwanda as the genocide unfolded there in the spring of 1994.\n\nHe spent the latter part of his career focusing on global environmental issues \u2014 most recently producing \u201cThis American Land\u201d which airs on PBS stations across the US.\n\nThis career shift came about in the mid-1990s after an encounter with Ted Turner, CNN\u2019s founder, who shared Strieker\u2019s passion about conservation and the environment.\n\n\u201c(Gary) had this idea he wanted to be CNN\u2019s environmental reporter,\u201d said Norgaard. \u201cEvery year or so we had (a) conference in Atlanta and I walked down there with Gary and I hear Ted yell, \u2018Gary! Come sit here!\u2019 and he announces to everyone, \u2018Gary is our guy in Africa!\u2019\n\n\u201cThey sat down and started talking and then Gary just mentioned this idea to him about environmental (reporting) and I remember Ted turning around, looking at Tom Johnson (CNN\u2019s president at the time) and going, \u2018Tom, this is brilliant! I love it, let\u2019s make it happen!\u201d\n\nOther colleagues who recalled the story said Johnson later half-jokingly swore never to sit a correspondent next to Turner again.\n\nIn 1997, Strieker and his second wife Christine moved to Atlanta where he worked as CNN\u2019s global environment correspondent. His reporting on central Africa\u2019s bushmeat crisis, as well as deforestation in Indonesia, Peru and Papua New Guinea, earned him the National Press Club\u2019s top prize for environmental reporting in 2000.\n\n\u201cGary was, in a lot of ways, ahead of his time \u2014 he was pushing for environmental reporting years before any other network,\u201d Norgaard recalled.\n\nNorgaard, CNN\u2019s former Johannesburg bureau chief, was a junior editor on the network\u2019s international desk in Atlanta when he first began working with Strieker.\n\n\u201cI was born and grew up in Africa, so we kind of had a special understanding,\u201d he said.\n\nStrieker was different than many international correspondents at the time who, Norgaard said, could be \u201creally wound-up\u201d and rude when they called the international desk.\n\n\u201cThat was never him,\u201d Norgaard said. \u201cHe was always calm, courteous \u2026 that\u2019s what I will never forget about Gary. I didn\u2019t know him that closely, but he\u2019s someone you considered a friend.\u201d\n\nA remarkable storyteller\n\nBorn in the small Illinois town of Breese on July 7, 1944, Strieker grew up in San Diego, California \u2013 eventually earning a law degree from UC-Hastings in San Francisco. Strieker and his first wife, Phyllis, joined one of the first US Peace Corps teams in 1968 on a mission to the newly independent African Kingdom of Swaziland \u2013 now Eswatini.\n\nStrieker spent five years in Swaziland serving as a legal advisor to the new sovereign government and helping draft a bill to protect Swazi land rights. During this time, his eldest daughter Lindsay was born. Strieker took a job with Citibank in Beirut in 1975 during the early days of the Lebanese civil war before returning to Africa as Citibank\u2019s resident vice president for its regional office in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nStrieker\u2019s twin daughters, Rachel and Alison, were born in Nairobi, and some health complications put Alison\u2019s life at risk.\n\nCourtesy Strieker family\n\n\u201cThe doctor at the hospital who was taking care of me was just very nonchalant and said, \u2018Well \u2026 we\u2019ll see if she makes it through the night,\u2019\u201d said Alison Strieker, recalling her dad\u2019s story. \u201cAnd my dad said, \u2018Is there something we can do?\u2019 and the doctor said \u2018She needs blood for a transfusion.\u2019\u201d\n\nGary Strieker said he asked the nurses to test his blood type and he was a match. Years later, Alison said her dad saved her life a second time when he donated his kidney to her.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my favorite person on earth,\u201d Alison Strieker said. \u201cI still have his kidney to this day.\u201d\n\nAs his daughters were growing up, they were the center of his life and he captured many moments of their young lives on a movie camera and an old Kodak \u201cBrownie\u201d camera.\n\nHis passion for photography sparked his pivot to journalism.\n\n\u201cThe photography mainly got him interested in not just the images but telling a story \u2026 about people and places and animals that do not have a voice \u2014 and that seemed to be his real passion,\u201d Alison Strieker recalled.\n\nAfter a brief stint with ABC News, he joined CNN in the early 1980s, setting up the new network\u2019s bureau in Nairobi and becoming its only correspondent on the African continent at the time.\n\n\u201cGary entered the world of reporting in countries in Africa at a time in the 1980s when long-running conflicts in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia coincided with drought and famine (and) led to large refugee crises,\u201d former CNN supervising editor Eli Flournoy recalled.\n\n\u201cGary was there on the ground, year after year, covering, documenting, illustrating these endemic conflicts.\u201d\n\nStrieker had a lot of close calls during his reporting career.\n\n\u201cHe was in crash landings in planes, he was in car accidents where other people died \u2014 he was just very dedicated,\u201d his oldest daughter Lindsay Strieker said.\n\nCNN\n\nAfter a car accident in Rwanda, he was declared dead and taken to the morgue.\n\n\u201cHe woke up in the morgue as a toe tag was being attached and said it damn near killed the medical worker when he sat up,\u201d recalled Jim Clancy, former CNN anchor and international correspondent.\n\nHe had another brush with death while reporting on the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, that left hundreds dead.\n\n\u201cGary \u2026 fearlessly went in and covered the Ebola patients and the operations of the (Kikwit) hospital, which was one of the first of its kind to treat an infectious outbreak like Ebola,\u201d Flournoy recalled. \u201cIt was a very, very dangerous environment.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the local authorities began implementing a quarantine and approached Strieker, who they believed had been exposed to Ebola.\n\n\u201cThey were going to put him in the hospital\u2019s Ebola wing,\u201d Flournoy said.\n\nEquipped with a satellite phone, Strieker called the international desk in a panic.\n\n\u201cHe (said) \u2018We have to do something to prevent this from happening, because I will almost certainly die if I\u2019m quarantined in this hospital,\u2019\u201d Flournoy said.\n\nAfter a \u201cmad scramble\u201d which involved lots of phone calls and the intervention of United Nations officials, Strieker was allowed to leave the country instead.\n\n\u201cGary continued to be unflappable, determined to get down to the facts of the story at the same time as being able to always find the human story within the larger conflict,\u201d Flournoy said. \u201cHe was a remarkable storyteller.\u201d\n\n\u2018If I don\u2019t go, nobody\u2019s doing those stories\u2019\n\nStrieker never lost his curiosity or energy for shining a light on critical stories about people who are impacted by global health and environmental crises.\n\n\u201cIt was never about getting his face on TV or a higher Nielsen rating,\u201d said Dave Timko who worked with Strieker on \u201cThis American Land.\u201d\n\nStrieker only cared about using his platforms to tell the stories of people across the world who were in need.\n\n\u201cSometimes he\u2019d say, \u2018If I don\u2019t go to those places, nobody\u2019s doing those stories,\u2019\u201d his widow Christine Nkini Strieker said.\n\nCourtesy Strieker Family\n\nHe was a devoted father to the couple\u2019s two children Reid, 20, and Nandi, 16, sharing stories with them at dinnertime about his adventures and spending every moment he could with his family when he wasn\u2019t on assignment.\n\nEven when he became ill, Christine said that Strieker was determined to get better so he could start working again.\n\n\u201cHe refused to say, I\u2019m too sick to do anything,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Strieker\u2019s passing in July, friends and former colleagues flooded a shared Facebook page with memories \u2014 all recounting Strieker\u2019s incredible stories, his quiet bravery in the midst of incredibly dangerous reporting assignments, his wit and genuine devotion to the craft of journalism.\n\n\u201cHis message to us was, \u2018Life, with its ups and downs, is an adventure \u2013 and it\u2019s important to stay curious and compassionate,\u2019\u201d said his daughter Rachel.\n\nIt\u2019s some comfort to the loved ones he leaves behind, including his five children and three surviving grandchildren, who are picking up the pieces after his passing.\n\n\u201cThe more we don\u2019t look at the sadness and the more we look at the positive in the life he

The grants will cover the cost of refurbishing structures such as the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit, MI and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.\n\nThe funding will also pay for improvements to replace and/or enhance outdated transportation facilities, strengthen the safety and security of the bridges, and increase economic development in the surrounding communities.\n\nThe United States has more than 600,000 bridges, of which 28 percent are considered \u201cstructurally deficient\u201d. This means that the bridge is no longer capable of handling the amount of traffic that it was built for, or is considered unsafe for vehicles to cross.\n\nThe Biden Administration has stated that the grants are part of its effort to prioritize infrastructure improvements, which will create jobs and increase economic activity. The funds are also being allocated to states that have already shown a commitment to improving their infrastructure by enacting comprehensive laws to support and sustain long-term transportation funding.\n\n\u201cThis funding will help states and local communities improve safety, reduce congestion, and create job opportunities,\u201d said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. \u201cPresident Biden is making sure that our infrastructure investments are getting to the areas that need them most.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, the estimated economic impact of this funding is expected to be $4.4 billion, creating more than 64,000 jobs in the near term. This investment is expected to benefit more than eight million people who use America\u2019s largest bridges every day.\n\n\u201cEvery day, millions of Americans rely on our country\u2019s bridges to get to work, visit family, or travel on vacation,\u201d said Secretary Buttigieg. \u201cThis funding will make sure that Americans are driving on roads and bridges that are safe and reliable.\u201d\n\nThe Biden Administration is hopeful that this investment will be a catalyst for future infrastructure development in America.

{"text": ".\n\nIt was only a matter of time until tech giant Salesforce announced a cost-cutting plan in the wake of an economic downturn.\n\nThe San Francisco-based cloud computing giant has been one of the most impressive stock performers of the past decade. But with the global economy in a deep and prolonged slump, Salesforce has decided it is time to shore up its balance sheet.\n\nThe company said it will cut about $1 billion in operating expenses over the next two years. As part of the plan, Salesforce will reduce its workforce by 1,000, or about 6 percent of its total headcount. In addition, it plans to reduce executive pay and tighten operating costs.\n\nThe news sent shares of Salesforce soaring 4 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The company's market value is now above $117 billion.\n\nSalesforce said the cost-cutting measure was not just necessary, but long overdue.\n\n\"We have been in an unsustainable economic situation for the past few years, and the pandemic has only exacerbated the situation,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. \"It is no secret that we have not been as prudent with our expenses as we could have been, and this plan will put us in a much better position going forward.\"\n\nThe cost-cutting plan includes a $250 million reduction in corporate and administrative costs and a $750 million reduction in research and development expenses. Salesforce also said it will reduce executive pay, freezing base salaries for all executives for the rest of this fiscal year, and making it more difficult for them to receive bonuses or stock options.\n\nThe company will also be restructuring its workforce, reducing employee headcount by 1,000 and focusing its resources on the core areas of growth. Salesforce said it will also be shifting to an \"all-remote\" work model to save costs on office space and related expenses.\n\nThe company's move comes as other tech companies have made similar announcements. Microsoft and Amazon recently announced their own cost-cutting plans, and Apple is expected to follow suit soon.\n\nThe tech sector is one of the few bright spots in the economy, and companies are looking for ways to save money and stay competitive. Salesforce's move to shore up its balance sheet is a much-needed and welcome step for the sector.\n\nWhile the news is welcomed by investors, analysts caution that there may be more pain to come for the sector as the pandemic continues to put pressure on the global economy. But for now, at least, Salesforce's move is a prudent one that will ensure it has the financial flexibility it needs going forward.", "label": "machine"}

With New Year's resolutions and new beginnings, it\u2019s time to think about the possibilities that await us in the next twelve months. But for some, this time of the year can cause anxiety, fear and doubt of the future.\n\nWe all know the old saying, \u201cTomorrow is another day.\u201d But what if tomorrow never comes? Is it possible to make the most of each moment and enjoy life to the fullest, even in the face of uncertainty?\n\nIn Dear Abby\u2019s advice column today, we take a look at the benefits of living in the moment and making the best of each day.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get hung up on things that are out of our control: the future, our jobs, money, or other worries. But if we focus too much on what we can\u2019t change, it can be difficult to enjoy life.\n\nThe key to happiness is to live in the present moment. Many times, the future is beyond our control and therefore we should focus on making the most of what we can do today. Taking a few minutes each day to appreciate the small joys in life, such as a beautiful sunrise, a great cup of coffee, or a moment of laughter with friends, can make a huge difference in our outlook on life.\n\nFocusing on the present will also allow us to be more productive and make better decisions.

{"text": "PANAMA CITY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Panama and First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) are hardening battle lines in a dispute over how much tax the Canadian miner should pay on its concession for the Central American country's only major copper mine in operation, a key asset for both parties.\n\nFirst Quantum's Chief Executive Tristan Pascall flew to Panama over Christmas and met with government officials for talks. However, no agreement was forthcoming, prompting the two sides to raise the stakes to protect their interests in the mine, known as Cobre Panama.\n\nThe dispute, which began at the end of 2021, has become a litmus test of Panama's ability to remain attractive to business even as the government seeks to reduce inequality by reviewing longterm deals that many analysts regard as too generous to business.\n\n\"Cobre Panama is the only metal mine operating in the country and many foreign companies started operations in Panama with its arrival. What happens will have a huge impact that seems to have not been properly weighed by both parties,\" said Zorel Morales, director of Panama's mining chamber.\n\nFailure to reach a deal could spook foreign investors at a time when Panama is looking to develop three other copper deposits that could bring in similar investments to Cobre Panama, said Morales.\n\nPanama's demand that the company pay at least $375 million in annual tax has been at the center of the dispute, and during last week's talks First Quantum raised points it wanted included in its contract after a Dec. 14 deadline to reach agreement expired, according to a source linked to the government.\n\nExclusive rights to explore other minerals, enlarge the area of its concession, a $1 billion tax credit for its investment and a demand that no laws enacted after the new contract affect its operations were among the issues raised, the source said.\n\nThe company declined to comment on details of the negotiations. A spokesperson for the government did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nPanamanian President Laurentino Cortizo said on Monday the government had presented a final contract offer to the company.\n\nFirst Quantum paid $61 million in royalties to Panama's government in 2021, while the Cobre Panama mine posted sales revenues of $3.2 billion for the year, company data show.\n\nMeanwhile, other businesses circle the mine, which started production in 2019. Government records show at least two requests are under review to explore gold and other metals near First Quantum's concession.\n\nBoth parties have publicly said they want to strike a deal, but their failure to do so before the latest government deadline expired prompted Panama to order a halt to the mine's operations and the company to start arbitration proceedings.\n\nLUCRATIVE ASSET\n\nIn 2021, Cobre Panama represented more than half of First Quantum's earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). It also accounts for about 3.5% of Panama's gross domestic product.\n\nThe firm has invested over $10 billion in the mine and paid only nominal dividends to shareholders during its initial years, according to company data.\n\nCobre Panama represents about 40,000 direct and indirect jobs, interacts with some 1,800 suppliers and is the country's biggest private investment, according to business advisor Rene Quevedo, from consultancy GS&S Consultores.\n\nMining was the country's most dynamic sector during 2021, more than doubling in output. Fitch Ratings revised Panama's credit outlook to stable from negative in February, highlighting booming copper exports.\n\nThe mining row could hamper government plans as Cortizo wants to pump some $190 million from the miner's annual payments into Panama's national pension scheme, which risks running out of funds in 2024, according to the International Labor Organization.\n\n\"If there's no agreement, the damage would be serious,\" Quevedo said.\n\nThe company has said the cost of halting operations remains \"uncertain\". Cortizo's government has not disclosed any assessment of how the dispute could affect Panama.\n\nPanama's government says it is prepared to face all legal scenarios to defend the national interest.\n\n\"It's a Panama Canal type of negotiation,\" said Hernan Arboleda, director of public policies at the economy and finance ministry, pointing to the country's experience in negotiating with the United States to secure control of its famous waterway.\n\n\"Panama can demonstrate to international authorities that this is not an equitable contract,\" he told Reuters.\n\nReporting by Valentine Hilaire; Additional reporting by Milagro Vallecillos Editing by Dave Graham and Marguerita Choy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A new rule proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reignited debate over abortion pills and sparked concern among supporters of abortion rights.\n\nThe proposed rule would affect the way doctors distribute pills known as Mifepristone, or the so-called abortion pill, which is commonly used to terminate pregnancies. Under the proposed rule, doctors who distribute the pill would need to follow certain labeling requirements, as well as be able to provide more information on the risks associated with taking the pill.\n\nThe issue has become a flashpoint in the legal battle over access to abortion pills. On one side, abortion rights advocates argue that the rule could make it more difficult for doctors to prescribe the pills, leading to fewer women getting access to abortion services. Opponents, meanwhile, contend that the rule is necessary to ensure safety and should be implemented.\n\nHere, we take a look at the proposed rule and its potential implications for the abortion pill debate.\n\nWhat is Mifepristone?\n\nMifepristone, also known as the abortion pill or RU-486, is a type of medication used to terminate a pregnancy. The drug is generally taken in two doses. The first dose is taken in the doctor's office and blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. The second dose is taken at home, usually 48-72 hours later, and works by causing the uterus to contract and expel the pregnancy tissue.\n\nThe medication is usually prescribed in combination with misoprostol, a drug that helps expel the pregnancy tissue more effectively. A doctor typically provides the medications together as part of a package. \n\nWhat is the new proposed rule?\n\nThe new proposed rule requires that doctors distributing Mifepristone provide specific labeling information, as well as additional safety information. The labeling information must include: the name and address of the doctor or clinic; the name and dosage of the medication; any potential side effects; the name and address of the manufacturer; and instructions for storage. \n\nThe rule also requires that doctors provide additional safety information about the potential risks associated with taking the pill. This includes potential risks related to the drug itself, as well as the potential risks associated with taking it in combination with misoprostol. The doctor must also provide information on the availability of emergency medical services in the area.\n\nThe rule also requires that doctors have \"adequate knowledge\" of Mifepristone and its use, as well as the risks associated with it. It also requires that doctors provide information on how to use the pill in an emergency situation, such as an ectopic pregnancy. \n\nWhy is the FDA proposing this rule?\n\nThe FDA has argued that the new rule is necessary to ensure patient safety and improve the quality of care for those seeking abortion services. The FDA contends that the additional labeling information and safety information will help make sure that the pill is being used correctly and that patients are aware of the potential risks involved.\n\nThe rule also aims to ensure that doctors prescribing Mifepristone have adequate knowledge of the drug and its risks. Currently, some doctors may be prescribing Mifepristone without fully understanding the risks associated with it. \n\nWhat are the potential implications?\n\nThe proposed rule could have a significant impact on the abortion pill debate. On one side, abortion rights advocates argue that the rule could make it more difficult for doctors to prescribe the pill, leading to fewer women getting access to abortion services. \n\nThe proposed rule could also have an impact on the availability of abortion pills. Doctors who are not able to meet the proposed requirements may not be willing to prescribe the medication. This could lead to some areas becoming underserved, as there may not be enough doctors who are willing or able to provide abortion services. \n\nOpponents of the rule, however, argue that it is necessary to ensure patient safety and should be implemented. They argue that the additional safety information and labeling requirements will help make sure that the pill is being used correctly, and that patients are aware of the risks. \n\nThe rule has yet to be finalized, but it is already sparking debate. With a potential vote on the rule expected in the coming months, the battle over Mifepristone and access to abortion services is sure to heat up.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".\n\nAmidst the nationwide push to end the use of cash bail, Illinois remains stuck in limbo due to a judge\u2019s ruling. In February, the state had passed legislation that would effectively eliminate cash bail for the majority of misdemeanor and felony cases. The state followed the lead of other states, such as California and New Jersey, and aimed to reduce mass incarceration and save taxpayer money. However, in a recent ruling, Judge Matthew F. Kennelly of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois stated that the changes to the bail system are unconstitutional and go against the state\u2019s principle of equal protection.\n\nThe legislation, known as the Pretrial Fairness Act, aimed to reform the cash bail system by essentially removing it altogether. The bill was aimed at reducing the state\u2019s prison population by eliminating the need for cash bail. Under the act, defendants were to be released, provided they could prove they were not a danger to the public, were not a flight risk, and met certain requirements such as appearing in court or staying away from any victims. The bill also stated that each jurisdiction had the ability to develop their own pretrial evaluation system to determine who needed to post a bond. \n\nThe proposed change has been met with some opposition, however. Those who oppose the bill argue that without cash bail, judges will no longer have the ability to hold dangerous criminals in custody. They also argue that getting rid of cash bail could have an impact on public safety and victim\u2019s rights. On the other hand, supporters of the bill argue that cash bail has been used to oppress the poor and accused people of color for years, allowing those who are financially able to pay for their freedom. \n\nDespite the bill being signed into law in February, it was put on hold when Judge Kennelly ruled it was unconstitutional. In his ruling, Judge Kennelly stated that the bill violates the equal protection clause by making \u201carbitrary distinctions between similarly situated persons.\u201d Specifically, Judge Kennelly noted that the proposed changes fail to recognize any difference between defendants who have higher and lower pretrial risks. He argued that it is unconstitutional to make decisions regarding bail without any consideration for the particular circumstances of each defendant. \n\nThe Judge\u2019s ruling has put the Pretrial Fairness Act on hold, leaving many advocates uncertain about the future of cash bail reform in Illinois. Supporters of the bill plan to continue to push for change, but in the meantime, the fate of the bill remains uncertain. Governor J.B. Pritzker plans to appeal the ruling, while state legislators are looking into finding a way to make the necessary changes to the bill to ensure it is compliant with the court\u2019s ruling. For now, the Pretrial Fairness Act remains on hold and it is unclear when, or if, the Illinois will be able to move forward with its plans to eliminate cash bail.", "label": "machine"}

Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n\n\n\nCNN \u2014\n\n2022 was the year democracy bounced back. But will the worst political system apart from all the others keep up its lead in the year ahead?\n\nIn the US last year, midterm election voters repudiated Donald Trump\u2019s election-denying extremist candidates; now the former President\u2019s reelection campaign \u2013 which is based on lies about 2020 \u2013 faces an existential crisis. Congress also passed a new law designed to make it harder for sore loser presidents like Trump to mess with the Constitution. In another blow to populist extremism, Brazilian voters ousted one of Trump\u2019s proteges, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. And in April, French President Emmanuel Macron defeated far right challenger Marine Le Pen.\n\nAs democracies showed resilience, autocrats lost momentum in several countries last year. Soon after securing a norm-busting third term, Chinese leader Xi Jinping was embarrassed by nationwide outcry and forced to abandon a controversial \u201cZero Covid\u201d policy. Iran\u2019s clerical regime is still being rattled by a furious protest movement. And the pitfalls of surrounding yourself with yes men were exposed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin\u2019s miscalculated \u201cspecial operation\u201d in Ukraine, which has raised the profile of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a champion for democracy and revived the West\u2019s Cold War alliance.\n\nDemocracy\u2019s enemies won\u2019t rest. There\u2019s no sign that the challenges facing Moscow, Tehran or Beijing could loosen their iron grasps on power. Even in the US, Trump is on the comeback trail and a Republican majority (dominated by members who voted not to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s election in 2020) is poised to take over the US House of Representatives.\n\nBut those who thought they had democracy on the run in 2022 got a surprise. The simple magic of a voter marking their ballot in a polling booth or a protestor willing to put their life on the line for the right to do so remains as powerful as ever.\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s what will define the new year in American politics\n\nWashington is bracing for a new era of divided government likely to bring governing showdowns, shutdowns, withering political investigations and the opening shots of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHere\u2019s what we think will shape the year.\n\nA House Republican majority, in which radical conservatives now have disproportionate influence, will try to throttle Biden\u2019s presidency and ruin his reelection hopes. By driving McCarthy\u2019s speakership bid to the brink, pro-Trump conservatives have already shown they will not be stopped. Governing could therefore be impossible and a likely standoff with the White House over raising the US borrowing limit later this year could turn into an economy-wrecking disaster.\n\nSpare a thought for Attorney General Merrick Garland, whose decision on whether to charge Trump with a crime is one of the most fateful in modern politics. Trying the ex-President would tear open old political wounds and would further damage legal and governing institutions politicized by Trump. Yet a failure to prosecute could set a precedent that hands ex-presidents impunity and fractures the principle that everyone is equal before the law.\n\nLike it or not, Trump has pitched America into the next presidential campaign. But his limp launch, bleating over his 2020 election loss and the poor track record of his hand-picked election-denying candidates in the midterms diminished his aura. Potential alternative Republican figureheads for populist, nationalist culture war politics, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are emerging. Biden meanwhile may give Americans a new piece of history \u2013 a reelection campaign from a president who is over 80. His strongest card is that he\u2019s already beaten Trump once. But that might not help him against a younger challenger like DeSantis.\n\nglobal events can redefine an American presidency.

{"text": "Costco recently announced that it plans to raise membership fees across the United States by 20% starting in January 2022. This came as a surprise to many shoppers, who have become accustomed to Costco\u2019s bargain-hunting approach to shopping. But a recent survey indicates that a majority of shoppers would accept the proposed membership fee hike, even after seeing the potential increase in cost.\n\nThe survey, conducted by market research firm NPD Group, asked 1,000 Costco customers if they would continue their membership if the fees increased. Over 70% of respondents indicated that they would remain with the company if prices increased, with 45% of respondents saying that they would continue without complaint, and 25% indicating that they would do so with some hesitation.\n\nThe results of the survey are not surprising given Costco\u2019s success over the past few years. The company\u2019s membership base has grown significantly, reaching a record 88.5 million members in 2020. As membership numbers continue to swell, the company has expanded its offerings and improved its customer service. All these factors combined, it seems, make Costco an attractive option for bargain-hunters.\n\nThe proposed fee increase, which would bring the annual membership fee up to $120, is still relatively low compared to other retailers. For example, Amazon Prime\u2019s annual fee is currently $119. And while some shoppers may begrudge the increased cost, the NPD survey showed that many were willing to pay more for the advantages of a Costco membership.\n\nWhen asked why they would remain with the company even if prices increased, respondents cited the quality of products, customer service and discounts as key factors in their decision. Nearly 50% of the respondents noted that they appreciated the variety of products that Costco offers, while 39% of respondents said that they valued the company\u2019s customer service and 20% said that the discounts that Costco offers are an important factor in their decision to remain with the company.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many shoppers feel that Costco\u2019s customer-centric approach to business makes the increase in fees worth the cost. Respondents noted that the company\u2019s loyalty program, which allows shoppers to earn cash back for purchases, and its no-hassle returns policy are two aspects that many customers find appealing.\n\nCostco\u2019s decision to raise its membership fees may be viewed as a risky move, but the survey results seem to indicate that it may pay off. It\u2019s clear that Costco shoppers are willing to pay more to maintain their membership, with many citing the quality of products, customer service and discounts as key factors that contribute to their loyalty. Although the fee increase may be unpopular with some shoppers, it appears that it won\u2019t cause any significant drop off in membership. We can only hope that the increased fees will be used to further improve the shopping experience for customers.", "label": "machine"}

For comparison, from Dec. 21 through Dec. 29 Southwest had scrubbed about 45% of its operation, a far bigger share than other major airlines, according to FlightAware.\n\nNow come two more difficult tasks for Southwest: going through thousands of passenger reimbursement receipts and improving the internal technology that contributed to the meltdown.\n\n\"We have plans to invest in tools and technology and processes, but there will be immediate work to understand what lessons are learned here and how we keep this from ever happening again, because it cannot happen again,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan, who took the helm in February, told staff Friday.\n\nJordan said employees from other departments have volunteered to help customers and process refunds.\n\nBad weather kicked off the issues, impacting flights throughout the U.S. But Southwest crews struggled to get reassigned automatically after all of the changes and were forced to wait on hold for hours with crew scheduling services. Hundreds of thousands of passengers were impacted, and Southwest is still working through a backlog of misplaced luggage.\n\nThe carrier had canceled about two-thirds of its flights for much of the last week in an attempt to get crews and planes where they needed to go, before operating close to normally on Friday.\n\nThe chaos could cost Southwest between $600 million and $700 million, according to estimates from Bank of America airline stock analyst Andrew Didora on Tuesday. That includes both lost revenue from refunds and the reimbursements to affected passengers, which could include expenses like hotels and rental cars.\n\nDidora cut his fourth-quarter adjusted earnings forecast for Southwest to 37 cents a share from 85 cents.\n\nA Southwest executive last week said the cancellations will \"certainly\" hit its fourth-quarter results but that it will take weeks to work through customers' reimbursement requests.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg vowed to hold Southwest accountable if it didn't provide customers with refunds and reimbursements, though such fines associated with a failure to pay back customers can take months if not years.\n\nSouthwest shares were down more than 4% on Tuesday, more than rivals. The Dallas-based airline is scheduled to report results on Jan. 26 but is likely to preview the meltdown's costs before then.", "label": "human"}

Rashida Tlaib voting present, to allocate funding for the upcoming fiscal year. It touched on a range of topics from TikTok to higher education to healthcare.\n\nA significant element of the plan included changes to Americans' retirement funds. Specifically, the bill allows people to be able to save longer for retirement. By raising the age people are required to start taking out money from their retirement accounts to 75, workers can spend more years contributing pre-tax earnings.\n\nIt also allows an increased contribution in retirement savings for older workers and paves the way for automatic enrollment for workers starting in 2025. Employees with student debt will also get some assistance through this bill \u2014 it would allow them to receive matching contributions in their retirement plans by way of repaying their student loans.\n\nBut critics of the plan say that it still tilts the scale towards wealthier retirees \u2014 and allows them to accumulate more money untouched by taxes. For people who are already financially stable, the higher age might mean they can stow away more untaxed funds in their 401ks, or even \"transfer more of those tax-subsidized funds to their heirs,\" Chuck Marr and Samantha Jacoby of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities write.\n\nFrank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, told Insider that he's \"very disappointed in the retirement security provisions.\"\n\n\"They're getting retirement security to very wealthy people with the tax breaks in this legislation, but we're not doing much to help the average working people and working families to save for retirement and we're tired of it,\" Clemente said.\n\nThat's one reason that retirement provisions have provoked ire from some progressives, who argue that it could worsen racial wealth gaps. White Americans are far more likely to have retirement savings, and those savings dwarf those of Americans of color.\n\n\"Real retirement-savings reform would address the core problem: too many low- and middle-income workers with too little savings; too many high-income employees, and the rich, with too much savings that is heavily subsidized by taxpayers,\" a letter organized by the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness and co-signed by 45 national organizations said.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers acknowledged they did not get to include everything they had hoped for in this spending package, like increased funding to help Americans recover from the pandemic. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of the House appropriations committee told The Washington Post that despite the \"painful cuts,\" it's still \"a lot better than it would be\" if the existing funding levels were only extended.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "watch now\n\nIt's been another rough year for China's tech stocks. Billions have been wiped off the value of the country's internet giants including Alibaba and Tencent and companies have posted their slowest growth rates on record. A Covid resurgence in China, which the government countered with its strict \"zero-Covid\" policy of swift and harsh lockdowns in major cities, has hurt the world's second-largest economy. Chinese internet firms have seen a slowdown as consumer spending was hit and advertising dollars were cut back. Investors are treading with caution into next year with regard to Chinese tech stocks and analysts are broadly expecting regulation to be more predictable and growth to accelerate. But uncertainty around China's economic outlook is creating risks. Still, signs that China could be thinking about opening its economy again have given investors hope of a turnaround. \"We are positive on 2023 internet sector outlook in light of reopening story and improving consumer sentiment,\" analysts at investment bank Jefferies said in a research note last month.\n\nZero-Covid relaxation in focus\n\nSince the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, China has adopted the so-called zero-Covid policy which attempts to use strict lockdowns and mass testing to control the virus outbreak. But that policy has weighed on the economy and taken a toll on businesses. Internet giants Tencent and Alibaba posted their slowest revenue growth rates on record in 2022, while electric vehicle makers like Xpeng saw lackluster sales as consumer sentiment took a hit. But there are signs that China's Covid policy may be reversing.\n\nwatch now\n\nThis month, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is less severe than previous versions, a shift in tone from the government ahead of announcements on relaxing Covid control measures. On Dec. 7, Chinese authorities formalized a slew of easing measures which included allowing some people infected with Covid to isolate at home rather than at government facilities, and removing the need for a virus test for those travelling across the country.\n\nIn my view, the biggest challenge faced by tech firms next year is probably still COVID and, as a result, the weak and uncertain economic outlook. Xin Sun King's College London\n\nHow the exit from zero-Covid is handled could ultimately determine the extent of the rebound for China tech. \"I will argue the prospect of a tech rebound next year depends primarily on the extent to which macroeconomy and especially consumption could recover,\" Xin Sun, senior lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London, told CNBC via email. \"Given the current extremely suppressed level of consumption, largely due to COVID restrictions and also the lack of confidence among consumers, a tech rebound is indeed likely if China could smoothly exit from zero-COVID and reopen the economy.\"\n\nTech growth rates set to accelerate\n\nAnalysts broadly see growth for Chinese tech names reaccelerating in 2023 as the Chinese economy prepares to reopen \u2014 but growth won't likely be on levels seen in the past, where quarterly revenue jumped 30% to 40%. Alibaba is forecast to see a 2% year-on-year jump in revenue in the fourth quarter of this year, before accelerating to just over 6% in the March quarter of 2023 and 12% in the June quarter, according to analysts' consensus estimates from Refinitiv.\n\nTencent, meanwhile, is expected to post year-on-year revenue growth of just 0.5% in the December quarter followed by 7% in the first quarter of 2023 and 10.5% in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv. Jefferies said in a note that it considers \"online shopping as being in a sweet spot to embrace the recovery story before advertising and entertainment.\" That could benefit companies like e-commerce giant Alibaba and rival JD.com . Analysts at the investment bank said they expect online advertising industry growth to rebound in 2023 but warned that growth will be \"highly dependent on macro environment.\"\n\nRegulation becomes more predictable\n\nChina's strict Covid policy was a major headwind for its tech sector this year, but investors were already spooked since late 2020 when Beijing ramped up regulatory tightening. The regulatory crackdown has been a big factor in giants posting slower growth rates and has hammered their stocks. Since the start of 2021, the Hang Seng tech index in Hong Kong, which includes most of China's tech giants, has fallen more than 50%. Over the past two years, Beijing has introduced a range of policies from new antiturst rules to data protection laws and an unprecedented law governing the use of algorithms by tech companies.\n\nwatch now\n\nFirms that fell foul of antitrust rules were punished with large fines, including Alibaba and food delivery company Meituan , as Beijing moved to reign in the power of its internet giants which had, until recently, grown largely unencumbered. The gaming sector has been badly hit. In 2021, regulators froze approvals for the release of new video games and brought in rules that capped the amount of time kids under the age of 18 could play online. The rules spooked investors who were largely caught unaware by China's regulatory assault on its tech sector. However, there are signs that some of the regulatory pressure may be easing. Regulators restarted the approval of games this year, which will benefit Tencent and NetEase , China's two biggest online gaming companies. The government has also on multiple occasions this year pledged to support the technology sector. \"Beijing's top priority this year is economic growth. The crackdown-style governance is over because Beijing has recognized that it's a bad idea to spook markets and undermine business confidence,\" Linghao Bao, analyst at Trivium China, told CNBC. \"We've already seen some recent attempts to relax Covid measures and rescue the property markets. That said, regulations will be here to stay. That means the focus has shifted toward a more measured, predictable approach to regulating big tech.\"\n\nChanging business models\n\nFrom diversification to selling off stakes in other businesses, the impact of regulation and a slowing economy is changing the way Chinese technology giants are running their companies. Firstly, Chinese tech firms have been cutting costs and exiting non-core businesses in order to boost profitability. In addition to running China's most popular messaging service WeChat, Tencent is also a prolific investor in other firms. But the company has recently started divesting stakes in some of China's biggest companies. As scrutiny on the tech sector increased, Tencent sold off stakes in some investees including JD.com and Meituan. Tencent is also focusing on other areas including it fledgling cloud computing business and an international push as gaming sales, one of its biggest drivers of revenue, remains under pressure.\n\nI'm more bullish than I was 6 months ago simply because I think the prices have fallen much further than future earnings estimates have had to be revised downward. Tariq Dennison GFM Asset Management\n\nAlibaba, whose China retail business makes up the bulk of its revenue, is trying to ramp up sales from areas such as cloud computing to diversify its business. Beijing has also looked to separate some financially-linked businesses related to tech firms. Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba, was ordered in 2021 by China's central bank to become a financial holding company after its initial public offering was pulled in November 2020. Tencent said earlier this year that it is exploring whether regulations will require its WeChat Pay mobile payments service to also fall under a separate financial holding company. \"The crackdowns have fundamentally changed the business logic these firms need to follow ... in the past Chinese tech giants strived to build the so-called 'ecosystem', which, by aggressively acquiring and integrating different lines of business, increased customer stickiness and engagement,\" said Sun from King's College. \"Now they have to scale back to focus on their main business lines and seek revenue growth from optimised operation and innovation.\"\n\nBiggest risks\n\nWhile some investors have reasons to be optimistic about China's tech industry next year, they are certainly treading with caution. Uncertainty about the path of China's exit from its zero-Covid policy and the trajectory of the economy in 2023. Several investment banks have cut their China economic growth forecasts over the past few months amid a slump in exports and a drag from the real estate sector, two important drivers of growth in the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"In my view, the biggest challenge faced by tech firms next year is probably still COVID and, as a result, the weak and uncertain economic outlook,\" Sun said. Tariq Dennison, wealth manager at Hong Kong-based GFM Asset Management, told CNBC there are also a number of geopolitical risks including American investors being blocked from buying Chinese tech stocks to companies being nationalized. However, he clarified that these risks are present but unlikely. \"I don't think many of those scenarios are that likely,\" he said, adding that geopolitical risks are the \"biggest collective threat.\"\n\nWhat it means for Chinese tech stocks\n\nA number of analysts and investors told CNBC over the last few months that the plunge in Chinese technology stocks has left some of them looking \"cheap\" or undervalued. That's because stock prices have fallen faster than what analysts believe could be the earnings potential for some of these Chinese technology companies. \"I'm more bullish than I was 6 months ago simply because I think the prices have fallen much further than future earnings estimates have had to be revised downward,\" Dennison said.", "label": "human"}

That would be a near 50% fall versus the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nHowever, some analysts are more bearish than the consensus.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie Research forecast Samsung to report fourth-quarter operating profit of 5.5 trillion won, which would be the lowest since the third quarter of 2016. Daiwa Capital Markets analysts see operating profit at 4.9 trillion won, a 65% year-on-year plunge and would be the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nThe pessimism stems from a rapid fall in memory prices. Samsung is the world's biggest player in so-called NAND and DRAM chips which are used in devices such as laptops and smartphones, through to data centers.\n\nNAND and DRAM prices fell sharply in the fourth quarter due to a lack of demand for the products they eventually go into, such as PCs.

{"text": "Pennsylvania Democrats have been dealt a surprising defeat in a bid for control of the state's House of Representatives after an independent candidate was elected leader of the majority party, with the help of the Republican minority.\n\nThe stunning turn of events on Wednesday marked the latest twist in Pennsylvania's increasingly unpredictable political landscape, with Democrats holding a narrow majority but unable to prevent the rise of the centrist independent.\n\nKevin Marino, an independent representative from Montgomery County, was elected majority leader in a 103-99 vote, with the backing of 18 Republican members. Marino had been a Democrat until December 2019, when he left the party and became an independent.\n\n\"I can only speak for myself, but I am extremely pleased to receive the support of the Republicans in the House today,\" said Marino in a statement following the vote. \"I think this demonstrates the need for collaboration between both parties in the Pennsylvania House, and I look forward to working together on the issues that matter to Pennsylvanians.\"\n\nThe election of Marino to the leadership post came after a series of backroom negotiations between him and the House Republican leader, Mike Turzai, who reportedly threw his weight behind the independent candidate in exchange for concessions from the Democrats on some of the issues most important to the Republicans.\n\nThe deal also averted what could have been an explosive battle for control of the chamber, with Marino promising to allow the Republican minority to have more of a say in the chamber's legislative agenda.\n\nThe move was opposed by some prominent Democrats, including Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who expressed his \"deep disappointment\" in the vote and warned of \"a dangerous precedent\" if Democrats allowed the GOP to control House leadership.\n\n\"This is not a time for Democrats to compromise with Republicans,\" Wolf said in a statement. \"It is a time to stand up for our values, and to stand up for the people of Pennsylvania.\"\n\nHowever, Marino insisted that his leadership would be \"free of any partisan politics,\" and he urged both parties to come together to find common ground on the issues that matter most to Pennsylvanians.\n\nMarino's ascendency to the House leadership post appears to be an indication that the Republican minority in the state is becoming more willing to work with moderate independents in order to get their priorities through the legislature.\n\nWith Democrats in control of both chambers in the Pennsylvania Legislature, Marino's election to the top post in the House could be the first of many shakeups in the state's political landscape. \n\nFor now, the political aftermath of Marino's election remains to be seen.

{"text": "Investors preparing for the new year may want to pay special attention to China.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest economy is expected to continue its meteoric rise, which could lead to solid gains for investors who get in on the ground floor.\n\nThere are a few factors that make China an especially attractive destination for investors in 2023.\n\nFirst, China\u2019s economy is expected to remain relatively resilient even as other major economies suffer from the prolonged effects of the pandemic. China\u2019s stimulus policies and strong focus on domestic consumption have helped the country remain relatively unscathed, while the U.S., Europe and Japan suffer.\n\nSecond, the Chinese government has introduced a variety of initiatives over the past year that are designed to boost its domestic economy. These include tax cuts, new infrastructure projects and a huge investment in research and development.\n\nThird, China is emerging as an important player on the world stage. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that China is looking to expand its global influence and presence. As such, the country is likely to be a major factor in global politics and economics for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor investors, the most important thing is to look for opportunities in the Chinese market. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and many of them have the potential to produce big returns.\n\nA number of Chinese companies have already established themselves as leaders in the tech world. These include Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and Didi Chuxing.\n\nIn addition, Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei are expanding their global presence, offering investors another way to tap into the Chinese market.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to the Chinese domestic market, which is booming. A number of companies are offering innovative products and services that are drawing in consumers from all over the world. These include mobile payment services, ride-hailing apps and food delivery services.\n\nThe Chinese consumer market is especially attractive because of its sheer size. According to research from McKinsey, the total number of active internet users in China is expected to increase from 830 million in 2018 to 1.2 billion by 2024.\n\nFinally, the Chinese government is making it easier for foreign companies to do business in the country. It has recently implemented a number of reforms designed to make it easier for foreign companies to enter the market and has lifted some of the restrictions it had previously imposed on foreign investment.\n\nThe changes, combined with the government\u2019s focus on stimulating domestic consumption, make China an attractive destination for investors in 2023. With the right strategy, investors can tap into the massive growth potential of the Chinese economy and benefit from the country\u2019s \u201cspending boom.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

Ron DeSantis of Florida took his second Oath of Office here on Tuesday, casting himself as a national leader at a time when the political world is buzzing about his presidential prospects.\n\n\"Florida is proof-positive that we the people are not destined for failure,\" DeSantis said during a 16-minute speech delivered on the steps of the Historic Capitol. \"Decline is a choice, success is attainable, and freedom is worth fighting for.\"\n\nDeSantis spoke before more than 4,000 attendees in a speech that was also heavy on Biblical imagery as dark blue banners hung behind him that read, \"The Free State of Florida.\" The governor pledged that through Florida he would \"fight for freedom\" against \"entrenched bureaucrats in DC, jet-setters in Davos, and corporations wielding public power.\"\n\nDeSantis harkened to US history during his speech, mentioning the Declaration of Independence, President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, the battle at Normandy, and Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech. He promised to \"carry this torch\" of freedom in Florida.\n\nThe Florida inauguration offered a split screen from the national conversation back in Washington, DC, where Republicans performed poorly in the midterms. In the US House, the party stood divided over who should be the next speaker.\n\nIn contrast, DeSantis enters his second term with a Republican supermajority in the legislature. On Election Day he carried the state by nearly 20 points against former Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist. The victory was a massive turnaround for the governor, who won his first gubernatorial race by just 33,000 votes.\n\nDeSantis hasn't been shy about bragging about his victory on Election Day, and did so again on Tuesday, saying, \"the people of Florida have validated our efforts in record fashion.\" He also boasted about the mass of people who have moved to Florida from other states, calling his homestate the \"most desired destination\" and \"a promised land of sanity.\" The state was \"leading the nation,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIt's not yet clear whether DeSantis could carry the same constituency nationally, should he decide to run for president. The governor could use the forthcoming legislative session to pass new policies in Florida, and officially run on those policies nationally in a few months.\n\nHe's also releasing his first memoir in February, which could serve to help introduce him to voters.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump \u2014 who endorsed DeSantis for governor in 2018 but now says he considers him insufficiently loyal \u2014 is the only candidate who has formally declared a run in 2024.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, right, is sworn by Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Carlos Muniz, left, to begin his second term during an inauguration ceremony outside the Old Capitol Tuesday, January 3, 2023, in Tallahassee, Florida.

Lynne Sladky/AP Photo\n\nMore schools policies and lower taxes, fighting 'woke'\n\nAt the start of the inauguration ceremony DeSantis walked out onto the steps of the Historic Capitol flanked by his wife, Florida first lady Casey DeSantis, and his three children. The sky was overcast, but it did not rain.\n\nCasey DeSantis wore a regal-inspired pale lime green dress with a cape, and held the Bible as her husband took the oath of office. DeSantis borrowed the Bible \u2014 which was used in the US Revolution \u2014 from syndicated radio host and co-founder of Blaze Media Glenn Beck.\n\nBeck was among the guests in the audience, confirmed inauguration spokeswoman Lindsey Curnutte.\n\n\n\nAlso in the audience was former GOP Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who also ran for president in 2016, and Jennifer Carroll, who was Florida's lieutenant governor under former GOP Gov. Rick Scott, now a US senator. Members of the Florida delegation were absent because Tuesday also marked the first day of the new Congress.\n\nDeSantis gave some indication of policies he'll push during a second term. He promised to lower taxes in Florida, to \"enact more family-friendly policies to make it easier to raise children,\" and to \"defend our children against those who seek to rob them of their innocence.\"\n\nThe line about children received a long applause from the audience, some of whom paid between $50,000 to $1 million to attend the inauguration and surrounding festivities, Politico first reported.\n\nThe DeSantis administration's education policies have received backlash from Democrats, both nationally and in the state. The governor signed a bill into law preventing certain teachings about race in schools, as well as limiting teachings about gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nMore recently, the DeSantis administration launched an investigation into a drag performance for allegedly exposing children to sexually explicit content, the Miami Herald reported. The organizer has said that any minors present had to be accompanied by an adult, and several critics say the governor is running a crusade against LGBTQ rights.\n\nDeSantis did not make specific promises about abortion bans during his speech, though in public comments he has appeared to be willing to go further than the state's current ban, which makes abortion illegal after 15 weeks into a pregnancy. The Democratic National Committee warned of forthcoming restrictions in a statement, and bashed DeSantis as similar to Trump.\n\n\"As the 2024 GOP primary shapes up, it's clear Republicans will race to out-MAGA each other, and DeSantis is no different,\" said Ammar Moussa, DNC spokesman.\n\nDeSantis hasn't backed down amid the backlash.\n\n\"We will never surrender to the woke mob,\" DeSantis said during Tuesday's speech, using a term he invokes often as a stand-in for liberal activism. \"Florida is where woke goes to die.\"\n\nZackary Atkins hangs a street sign with the name of Florida Gov.

Lynne Sladky/AP Photo\n\nThe festivities started on Monday night\n\nAlso taking the Oath of Office on Tuesday were Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, Commissioner of Agriculture-Elect Wilton Simpson, and Attorney General Ashley Moody, who was sworn in by her father, Justice James Moody, Jr.\n\nAny of these officials could be weighing potential political moves of their own. Even if DeSantis doesn't run for the White House, he'll be term-limited out after four years \u2014 creating an opening for a new governor of Florida.\n\nRetired broadcaster Gene Deckerhoff, who was the voice of the Florida State Seminoles for 43 years, was the MC for the event.\n\nDeSantis held a prayer with faith leaders at the Capitol ahead of his swearing in. Following the ceremony, Casey DeSantis is hosting a \"Toast to 1 Million Mamas\" at the Governor's Mansion.\n\nThe inauguration festivities formally kicked off Monday evening with a candlelight cocktail hour and dinner, which was catered by Carbone, the trendy Italian-American restaurant that has a location in Miami Beach, Insider first reported.\n\nThe dinner included Carbone's famous spicy rigatoni vodka, and between 250 to 300 people attended, according to a source in attendance who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDeSantis and Jeff Zalaznick, co-owner of Carbone parent company Major Food Group, made remarks, the source said.\n\nThe City of Tallahassee altered its road signs during the inauguration to read \"Ron DeSantis Way\" and \"Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez Way.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Growing up, you might have been told not to stare at the guy in the wheelchair. You were probably taught, more or less, that aggressively averting your eyes when passing a stranger with a physical difference is the \u201cright\u201d thing to do. Most of us\u2014whether we realize it or not\u2014keep up this behavior well into adulthood. Reid Davenport, a disabled filmmaker, leans into this social tension in I Didn\u2019t See You There, an experimental movie narrated by him and shot entirely from his perspective.\n\nThe film, which won the Directing Award for U.S. Documentary at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, has had a quiet theater run thus far. It will likely find new audiences on PBS, where it airs tomorrow night and will be available to stream; Davenport may also nab an Oscar nomination in the coming weeks. Part of the film\u2019s future success will hinge on viewers\u2019 willingness to audit their own relationship with disability. An uneasy question permeates the movie: Are able-bodied audience members connecting with Davenport\u2019s day-to-day existence, or are they voyeuristically gawking at it?\n\nI Didn\u2019t See You There breaks many conventions of contemporary documentary. There are no reenactments or expert talking heads; there is no narrative arc. By the time the credits roll, Davenport hasn\u2019t even formally identified his own disability, which is cerebral palsy.\n\nWhat the film offers viewers is something far more kinetic and compelling. The camera is nearly always in motion: Davenport grips it with one hand and drives his power wheelchair around his neighborhood in Oakland, California (and a few other locations), with the other. We get only fleeting glimpses of him\u2014his reflection in a store window, his hand as he pours himself a cocktail. Rather than seeing him, we\u2019re viewing the world as he observes it, which is to say, from just a few feet off the ground. At times, the movie can feel like a video game, or the famous one-shot restaurant scene in Goodfellas. Davenport points his camera down at the sidewalk as he rolls over cracks and bumps, revealing subtle patterns in the built environment that many people might miss. Sometimes his lens is aimed up at the sky or at the faces of passersby on the street. The result is hypnotic, meditative, rhythmic, and occasionally dizzying.\n\nRead: The tension at the heart of CODA\n\nWe see him navigating the labyrinthine passageways of a BART station, trying to find an elevator. On a bus ride, we witness the driver\u2019s frustration\u2014and the mixed reactions of his fellow passengers\u2014during a squabble over which direction Davenport should face while on board. We feel the indifference of idling motorists and others blocking wheelchair ramps. Sometimes people ask Davenport if he\u2019s okay or offer him help. Throughout, the film features hardly any music\u2014the primary sounds are of Davenport\u2019s motorized chair clicking and clacking over the pavement as he goes about his day.\n\nOne of the film\u2019s more memorable sections comes when Davenport visits his hometown of Bethel, Connecticut\u2014also the birthplace of P. T. Barnum, whose name is synonymous with the circus. Davenport uses this detail in tandem with the looming presence of a giant circus tent erected not far from his Oakland apartment to muse over the way disabled people have long been categorized as \u201cfreaks.\u201d At his mom\u2019s home, Davenport briefly stops moving his camera. He lets the audience listen in on poignant conversations he has with his mother and his niece. This stylistic shift is both thematic and practical: In areas of the country that lack continuous sidewalks and/or reliable public transportation, Davenport loses his freedom of movement. When he eventually flies back to California, the audience hears a wistful voicemail from his mom: \u201cMy goal in life is to get you back on the East Coast.\u201d\n\nA little over a year ago, Davenport left Oakland and moved to Brooklyn, where I live. I first saw I Didn\u2019t See You There in a tiny New York cinema last fall. Just after Christmas, while walking around the park in my neighborhood, I passed a man in a wheelchair and thought I recognized him. I doubled back and sheepishly asked him if his name was Reid. His face lit up. Davenport and I met up for coffee several days after that\u2014he suggested a place with a to-go window where we could sit outside. (Fewer local businesses are wheelchair accessible than you might imagine.)\n\nHe told me that neither of his two closest subway stations has elevators; he usually travels more than half a mile to access a train. I asked Davenport whether he found his new neighbors more\u2014or less\u2014accepting of his disability than his old ones. \u201cI love New York because people are too self-involved to give a shit,\u201d he said with a smirk. As an undergraduate at George Washington University, he\u2019d majored in journalism, and he told me he\u2019d experienced significant ableism in the industry\u2014people not calling him back, difficulty getting hired\u2014before going on to pursue an MFA in documentary film. He told me he\u2019s uninterested in attaching a preachy message to his movie. When I clumsily asked him the meaning behind what I\u2019d intuited to be symbolic directorial choices, he gently waved me off. He told me his moviemaking approach is simple: \u201cFilm is photography,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to look at beautiful stuff.\u201d\n\nI asked him why people should watch his movie. \u201cI think if you\u2019re disabled, this film was made for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not disabled, I think the film is an approximation of my perspective.\u201d He went on: \u201cThere\u2019s this whole idea of empathy in documentary film\u2014I think empathy is kind of a unicorn, and kind of irrelevant. You don\u2019t need to be empathetic to be considerate. A human being is a human being.\u201d This brought to mind perhaps my favorite moment in the film, when Davenport and a stranger we can\u2019t see have a brief conversation in a public restroom. The man is friendly, telling Davenport that he\u2019s seen him around the area and admires him for just living his life. Davenport reacts kindly but matter-of-factly: \u201cI mean, everyone has their shit, right?\u201d He then rolls right into the next scene.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAs President Joe Biden scored several legislative wins this year, voters across the country headed to the polls in November to decide on local measures.\n\nThe passage of several of those measures will lead to new state laws this year. And Americans in 2023 will also feel the impact of several provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted over the summer.\n\nHere are some of the state and federal measures set to take effect in 2023.\n\nIncreased minimum wage\n\nNearly half of all US states will increase their minimum wages in 2023.\n\nThe hike went into effect in the following states on January 1: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Washington.\n\nMinimum-wage workers in Connecticut will have to wait until June 1 to see the increase, while the change goes into effect in Nevada and Florida on July 1 and September 30, respectively. The hike went into effect in New York on Saturday for workers outside New York City, Long Island and Westchester County.\n\nOf all states, Washington state has the highest minimum wage at $15.74, up from $14.49, followed by California, which now has a minimum wage of $15.50 for all workers, up from $14 for employers with 25 or less employees and $15 for employers with 26 or more employees.\n\nHowever, Washington, DC, continues to have the highest minimum wage in the country. The increase from $16.10 to $16.50 went into effect Sunday and another hike to $17 is set for July 1.\n\nThe push for a higher wage across the country comes as the federal minimum wage has remained the same since 2009, the longest period without change since a minimum wage was established in 1938, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nEfforts by Democrats to pass a $15 minimum wage bill stalled in the Senate in 2021.\n\nRecreational marijuana\n\nJeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFive states \u2013 Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2013 had recreational marijuana on the ballot in the November midterm elections, and voters in Maryland and Missouri approved personal use for those 21 and older.\n\nWhile legalization has taken effect in Missouri with an amendment to the state constitution, the Maryland law goes into effect on July 1.\n\nThe law will also allow those previously convicted of cannabis possession and intent to distribute to apply for record expungement.\n\nStarting January 1, the amount of cannabis a person can possess in Maryland for a fine instead of a criminal penalty increases \u2013 from just over a third of an ounce, or 10 grams, to 2.5 ounces.\n\nInsulin prices\n\nOne of the most significant victories for Biden in 2022 was the Inflation Reduction Act, a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill, which he signed into law in August.\n\nAs part of the legislation, the price of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries will be capped at $35 starting January 1.\n\nAbout 3.3 million Medicare beneficiaries used insulin in 2020 and spent an average of $54 per insulin prescription the same year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe cap does not apply to those with private insurance coverage after Senate Democrats failed to get at least 10 Republican votes to pass the broader provision.\n\nTax credit for electric vehicles\n\nKeith Srakocic/AP\n\nThere will be changes to the tax credits for those with electric vehicles, also thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe new rule stresses the use of vehicles that were made in North America, requiring much of their battery components and final assembly to be in the continent to be eligible for tax credits. It also mandates at least 40% of the minerals used for the battery to be extracted from the United States or a country that has free trade with the US.\n\nUpon meeting the requirements, new vehicles are eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500.\n\nThose purchasing used electric vehicles can receive up to $4,000 in credits but it may not exceed 30% of the vehicle\u2019s sale price.\n\nInitially, buyers who purchase vehicles in 2023 will need to wait to receive the tax credit when they file their tax returns for the year in 2024. But starting on January 1, 2024, electric vehicle buyers will be able to receive the money immediately, at the point of sale, if they agree to transfer the credit to their dealership.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Yahoo Finance's Vera Gibbons explains tips to help investors make and keep their financial resolutions for 2023.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- We're taking a look at the financial New Year's resolutions that a lot of people have been making, but as you can keep them as well, because 2/3 of Americans consider resolutions pertaining to their finances in the new year. And that's according to a survey from Ascent.\n\nWe have Yahoo Finance Contributor Vera Gibbons here with a breakdown. So, Vera, a lot of people making these resolutions. What are they focusing on?\n\nVERA GIBBONS: It's funny because according to Ascent, I mean, this is a record number of people making financial resolutions this year. And, actually, it makes sense that we would be making them, given the backdrop that you discussed. We've got potentially a recession coming. People are worried about layoffs. We've got interest rates rising, inflation continuing to rear its ugly head.\n\nSo at the top of the list, you talked about this at the top of the show, is paying off that credit card debt. And at the beginning of the year, credit card rates were averaging about 16%. Now we're approaching 20%. So that credit card debt is becoming increasingly more expensive and will continue to become more expensive in 2023 as the Fed continues raising rates.\n\nAlso a top priority any year, but particularly this year, is setting up an emergency fund. A lot of people don't have them. We are potentially headed for a recession. We don't know how bad this recession will be. But even if the unemployment rate rises to 5%, we're looking at 2 million additional people out of work. So it's good to have that emergency fund set up, not only in case you lose your job, but also for any other kind of unexpected expense that comes your way, whether you need it for a car repair, a leaky roof, et cetera.\n\nRevising your budget should also be at the top of the list in this inflationary environment. A lot of people haven't taken a more serious look at what's coming in the door, what's going out the door. Time to take a more serious look at that and make sure you're not spending more money than is coming in.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoosting your retirement accounts also is a huge one. You mentioned that it's been a tough year in 2022. Yes, it has. So a lot of people are discouraged based on the way the market acted in 2022.\n\nBut don't give up. Keep on contributing to those retirement accounts. Keep on making those contributions as much as you possibly can, at least enough to capture the company match, because that is just free money.\n\nAnd last, I would say really work on boosting your credit score. As the economy slows down in 2023, we are going to see lending tighten up a bit. So it's really important that if you want to continue to use your credit cards that you have tip-top shape as far as your credit score goes because we could potentially see credit card companies, the banks actually making some changes in 2023 as they tighten their standards, as the unemployment rate rises, because they don't want to get stuck with people who cannot pay. They're worried about defaults.\n\n- Vera, the third and fourth point you made certainly going to be key here when you think about the economic headwinds, reassessing, revising your budgets. What do you suggest in terms of how people keep track of it and stick to those goals?\n\nVERA GIBBONS: Well, it's funny because a lot of people haven't taken a look at their budget. They've just been continuing to spend freely, which is why we're seeing the savings rate drop down to that 17-year low. They're spending as if they still have a lot of money coming in. They haven't taken a look at where they're at. They haven't factored in inflation. But so that is a key one for 2023.\n\nNow, in terms of keeping your resolutions in 2023, you've got to keep them what they call SMART. And that is an acronym for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. In other words, you've got to make them realistic. You've got to chip away at their credit card debt. You've got to take a more serious look at what's coming in the door, what's going out the door.\n\nAnd you've really got to make it a priority in 2023 because I think it's going to be a bit of a bumpy year. We're coming off a rough year, 2023. We don't know what's ahead. Again, as I mentioned, inflation is still very hot. We're headed for more interest rate hikes. So it's going to be sort of touch and go in 2023.\n\n- SMART is a good acronym. We'll all remember it.\n\nVERA GIBBONS: It is.\n\n- Vera Gibbons, as always, Yahoo Finance contributor, appreciate the time today.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "For thousands of years, Egyptians were thought to be mummifying the dead to preserve their bodies for afterlife. But, new evidence suggests that these ancient people may not have been trying to preserve bodies after death at all.\n\nA recent study by a team of archaeologists, biologists, and historians from various universities around the world has revealed new information about the ancient practice of mummification. The team analyzed samples from over thirty mummies, which were excavated from archaeological sites in Egypt. The analysis revealed that the ancient Egyptians did not appear to be attempting to preserve the body after death. Instead, they may have been attempting to create a symbolic representation of a deceased individual that embodied the living person.\n\nThe research team found that the materials used in the mummification process, such as linen and resins, could not have been used to preserve the body. In fact, the resins and oils used in mummification would have caused decay, rather than prevented it. Furthermore, the positioning and wrapping of the mummies was found to be inconsistent with a preservation process. \n\nThe research team also discovered evidence that ancient Egyptians were using mummification to create a symbol for the deceased individual rather than preserve the body. They found that the arrangement of the mummies was often symbolic and could represent different aspects of the deceased\u2019s personality. In some cases, items like jewelry and amulets were placed on the body to represent their status in life. The team also found that the wrapping of the mummies was often intended to provide a protective covering, which was then adorned with religious symbols. \n\nThe research team concluded that mummification was a symbolic and religious process, which was intended to honor the deceased and create a representation of them in the afterlife. They suggest that the practice was intended to reflect the concept of the \u201cka\u201d, which is an ancient Egyptian term that refers to an individual\u2019s life force or spirit.\n\nThe research team has put forward a number of theories as to why the ancient Egyptians may have developed the practice of mummification. They suggest that it may have been intended to reflect the ancient Egyptian belief that the soul could remain alive in the afterlife. They also suggest that the practice may have been intended to create a ritualistic means of honoring the deceased. \n\nThe findings from this study provide new insight into the ancient practice of mummification, suggesting that it may not have been intended to preserve the body after death. Instead, it may have been a symbolic and religious process that was intended to create a representation of the deceased individual in the afterlife. \n\nThe research team is now planning to analyze further mummies in order to better understand the practice of mummification and the beliefs surrounding it. Their findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ". \n\nCheap television prices seem to be a blessing for consumers, but a new report shows that there\u2019s a hidden cost: increasing energy use and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nAs televisions get cheaper and more feature-filled, they\u2019re also getting bigger and bigger. But, size isn\u2019t the only factor that\u2019s changing. According to a new report from the World Resources Institute (WRI), the quality and efficiency of TVs is changing as well\u2014and not for the better.\n\nThe report shows that many of the new TVs flooding the market are significantly less efficient than the models that were available a few years ago. This is due, in part, to their increased size and extra features, but also because of cost cutting measures that are reducing the efficiency of the televisions themselves.\n\nFor instance, the report found that many of the most popular new TVs now use around 80% more power than their counterparts from a few years ago. This isn\u2019t just a problem for consumers\u2019 wallets\u2014it\u2019s a big environmental issue as well.\n\nAccording to the report, energy use from televisions has increased by 57% globally between 2015 and 2020. And, as the TVs get bigger and more feature-filled, this trend is likely to continue. By 2030, the report estimates that the energy used by TVs could rise by as much as 70%.\n\nThis increase in energy use will have a direct impact on the environment. By 2030, the report estimates that the energy used by televisions will account for 5% of global electricity consumption, as well as 6% of global carbon dioxide emissions. This means that if no action is taken, the global CO2 emissions from TVs could double between now and then.\n\nSo, what can be done to reduce the environmental impact of TVs?\n\nThe WRI report offers several suggestions, including the implementation of government standards that require the use of more efficient technology and the offering of incentives to encourage the adoption of efficient televisions. It also recommends that manufacturers focus on improving the efficiency of their TVs in order to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nOf course, consumers can also play a role in reducing the environmental impact of their TVs by being mindful of energy efficiency when shopping for a new television. Before you buy, it\u2019s important to research the energy ratings of different models and select one that has a good rating.\n\nAnother way to reduce the environmental impact of your TV is to avoid buying a bigger model than you need. Many people think that a larger TV will provide them with a better viewing experience, but this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. A larger TV will use more energy and generate more emissions than a smaller one.\n\nUltimately, cheap TVs may seem like a great deal for consumers, but the hidden cost of their energy use and emissions is something we all need to be aware of. By taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of TVs, we can all help to create a more sustainable future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "One of the world\u2019s largest bitcoin miners is set to shut off thousands of mining rigs tied to bankrupt Celsius Network in the next several days. The shutoff is part of the firm\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings and is the latest in a string of cryptocurrency related bankruptcies and liquidations of the past year.\n\nCelsius Network, founded in 2018, was a digital asset-based financial platform that allowed customers to borrow and lend against their cryptocurrency holdings. The platform had grown to offer over 40 different asset types, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.\n\nThe move to shut down its mining operations comes in the midst of a recent string of liquidations of other cryptocurrency companies. Bitmain, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of Bitcoin mining rigs, also shut down its operations earlier this week. The company cited a lack of profitability in its core business.\n\nThe shutdown of Celsius\u2019 mining rigs is a blow to the cryptocurrency mining industry. It is estimated that the move will cut off a significant amount of hashpower from the network. This means it will become more difficult to mine new blocks, and the network\u2019s overall hashrate will drop.\n\nThe effects of the shutdown are not yet clear, but it is certain that the shift in hashpower will have an effect on the mining difficulty, thus affecting mining profitability. It could also increase the amount of time it takes to confirm transactions and cause a decrease in overall network efficiency.\n\nThe closure of the mining rigs is also a major blow to Celsius Network\u2019s creditors. Many of the miners were owned by Celsius and its creditors, meaning they could now be subject to repossession or asset seizure.\n\nCelsius Network\u2019s collapse is just one example of the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency industry. With a strong focus on regulatory action, many investors have become more wary of investing in digital assets. This has caused a decrease in prices, as well as an increase in volatility.\n\nCryptocurrency miners are also feeling the pressure. The high cost of operating a mining rig can quickly turn a profit into a loss, especially in the current market environment.\n\nCelsius Network\u2019s closure is a reminder of the risks involved in the cryptocurrency industry. With the uncertainty surrounding regulation and market conditions, it is essential to be aware of the potential dangers associated with digital asset investment.\n\nIt is unclear what will happen to the remaining miners in the wake of Celsius Network\u2019s closure. Many of them may be bought up by larger companies, but the current market conditions make this a risky proposition.\n\nIt is also possible that some of the miners may be repurposed for other uses. This could include running nodes on other blockchains or being used to mine alternate cryptocurrencies.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it is certain that the closure of Celsius Network\u2019s mining rigs will have an impact on the industry. It is a reminder that even the largest and most established companies in the cryptocurrency space are not immune to the volatility and unpredictability of the market.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a world full of technological advances and innovations, artificial intelligence is at the forefront of digital disruption. AI-based systems are being developed and used to do everything from autonomous driving to virtual assistants, and now one artist is taking that concept to the next level.\n\nOn April 8th, Eric Jumper released a children's book he created using AI. The book, titled \"Max the AI-Powered Puppy\", follows a robot puppy who is adopted by a family and taken on adventures. Jumper used an AI system to generate illustrations and words for the book, resulting in a complex piece of artwork.\n\nAlthough some are impressed by this unusual use of technology, not everyone is happy about Jumper's AI-powered book. Critics argue that the book's uniqueness could lead to a decrease in the need for traditional illustrators and writers. They fear that if AI is able to replicate the creative process, their livelihoods could be threatened.\n\n\"In the wrong hands, technology can be used to disempower those who have traditionally been seen as important and irreplaceable,\" said Jodie Jenkins, president of the Society of Illustrators. \"We believe that the work of professional illustrators is more than a commodity; it is a fundamental part of our culture.\"\n\nJenkins has been leading a campaign against Jumper's book, and is pushing for a boycott of the artist's work. She argues that the book's use of AI is an unethical way of exploiting the creative talents of individuals.\n\nDespite the controversy, Jumper has defended his work and stands by its message. He believes that AI has a lot of potential in the creative field, and can help artists create new and exciting works.\n\n\"This book is not a replacement for professional illustrators,\" Jumper said in an interview. \"It's a tool to help artists explore their creativity and open up new possibilities. AI has the potential to provide insight and inspiration, and can provide us with new ways of telling stories.\"\n\nWith the debate over the use of AI in the creative world ongoing, Jumper's project serves as a prime example of the potential for technology to transform the industry. As technology advances and new methods of creating art emerge, artists, illustrators, and writers will have to adapt to stay competitive. In the end, though, it's clear that the traditional roles and responsibilities are still important and that the human touch is what brings art to life.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Kabul, Afghanistan: The Taliban has issued a directive prohibiting women from working in both domestic and foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Afghanistan.\n\nThe prohibition is likely to affect thousands of Afghan women, who have been employed in the organizations since the overthrow of the Taliban government in 2002. \n\nThe decree, which was reported by local media, was issued by the Taliban's Shura, or the political leadership council, and comes in line with the group's strict interpretation of Islamic law. \n\nIn a statement issued by the Taliban, the group said the Shura had taken the decision \u201cin light of the teachings of Islam, for the preservation of modesty and the betterment of Afghan society\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is now officially prohibited for both Afghan and foreign NGOs operating in Afghanistan to hire women in any capacity,\u201d the statement said. \n\nThe statement added that women already employed by NGOs have three months to find another job or to \u201creturn to the life of a housewife\u201d.\n\nThe announcement of the directive comes at a time when the Taliban are in the midst of peace negotiations with the Afghan government in Qatar, and the international community is closely watching to see if the group will uphold the rights of women and girls.\n\nThe international rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the move, calling it \u201ca grave attack on women\u2019s rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is an outrageous move to effectively deny women any role in the development and aid sector, a crucial pillar of Afghanistan\u2019s economy,\u201d HRW's Afghanistan researcher, Heather Barr, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIf the Taliban believe that women can only be housewives, why do they agree to a ceasefire with the government but not with women?\u201d she added.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s decision is likely to be met with resistance from the international community, especially the United States, which has been leading the push for peace negotiations in the region. \n\nThe US has long advocated for the rights of women and girls, and has previously called on the Taliban to ensure that women are not marginalised in the peace process.\n\nThe Afghan government, for its part, has expressed concern about the decision and said it was in favour of women\u2019s rights and gender equality.\n\n\u201cWe reject any kind of discrimination and marginalization of Afghan women,\u201d a government spokesman said.\n\nThe government has also urged the Taliban to reconsider its decision and to \u201crespect the rights of all Afghans, including women\u201d.\n\nThe move by the Taliban has been widely condemned by the international community, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \n\n\u201cIt is essential that all parties to the conflict take all necessary steps to ensure the full and effective protection of the rights of women and girls,\u201d she said in a statement. \n\nThe decree is likely to further erode the already fragile situation for women in Afghanistan, where they face many forms of discrimination and violence. \n\nAccording to UN figures, more than 70 percent of Afghan women are victims of violence and a third of marriages involve child brides.\n\nMany in the international community are hopeful that the peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government will lead to greater recognition for the rights of women and girls, but this latest decision is a worrying development. \n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the Taliban will back down from their position, but for now, Afghan women face an uncertain future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Prince Harry, the second son of Prince Charles and Lady Diana, has recently alleged that his brother William, and sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, urged him to wear a Nazi costume for a charity event in 2005.

William and Kate have not responded to the allegations, and Buckingham Palace has refused to comment on the matter.\n\nHowever, the allegations have been met with outrage and condemnation by many in the UK and beyond, with many calling on the Royal family to take action against those responsible.\n\nHarry has been an outspoken advocate for tolerance and equality in recent years, and the news is a stark contrast to his public profile. According to reports, Harry was initially reluctant to wear the costume, but was eventually persuaded by his brother and sister-in-law. The scandal has raised questions about the Royals\u2019 attitudes towards racism and intolerance.\n\nIn response to the news, Harry\u2019s wife, Meghan Markle, wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times which discussed her experiences of racism in Britain. She wrote that racism was \u201ca barometer for the kind of country we have become\u201d and called for action to ensure that those in power \u201clisten\u201d to the stories of people of color.\n\nThe royal family has recently been accused of being out of touch with the realities of racism in the UK and of disregarding the issues facing people of color. This news is likely to further fuel these accusations.\n\nThe story is also likely to have an effect on the relationship between William, Kate and Harry. They have been distant since Harry\u2019s marriage to Meghan and the news of the Nazi costume could further complicate their relationship.\n\nThe scandal has further added to the growing list of issues facing the royal family, and with the monarchy\u2019s reputation already under scrutiny, it is likely to be a challenge for the family to restore public trust.\n\nWhile it is unclear what action, if any, will be taken in response to the scandal, it is certain that this is yet another obstacle that the royal family must face.

{"text": "It's been nearly two years since the United States saw a major election shakeup. With Democrats now firmly in control of the White House, it's easy to forget that Republicans had a slight majority in the House of Representatives prior to the 2020 election. But with the 2022 midterm elections just around the corner, political analysts are warning that a Republican resurgence could have drastic implications for the technology sector.\n\nFor the past four years, tech companies have largely seen a \"hands-off\" approach from the Democratic majority, with only a few high-profile exceptions like the repeal of Section 230, the repeal of the Obama-era net neutrality rules, and antitrust investigations into Google, Apple, and other large tech firms. But if Republicans are able to regain control of Congress, that could all change.\n\n\"There are some people who believe that if the Republicans gain control, there's going to be a much more hostile environment for tech companies,\" said Robert Atkinson, the founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank. \"That could manifest itself in the form of more regulation or restrictions on what they can do. It could also open up the door to a much more protectionist approach, which could be disruptive.\"\n\nOne of the potential issues on the Republican agenda is repealing or significantly revising the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which has been used to protect social media and internet companies from liability for user-generated content. Some Republicans have argued that these protections have allowed companies to shirk responsibility for their content moderation decisions, an argument that could gain traction if the GOP takes control of Congress.\n\nThere are also concerns that a Republican majority would push for stricter data privacy legislation, which could have far-reaching implications for the tech sector. Atkinson believes this is a real possibility, noting that many GOP legislators have pushed for legislation that would impose tougher restrictions on the way companies use and store consumer data.\n\n\"If Republicans come to power, I think that's definitely one of the things that's going to be on their agenda,\" Atkinson said.\n\nWhile it's unclear how exactly the tech industry would be affected by a Republican-controlled Congress, one thing is certain: the landscape of the sector is set to change drastically if that happens. Companies may find themselves facing increased regulation or restrictions, while others could see an opportunity to gain an edge over their competition by exploiting the new landscape.\n\nAtkinson noted that while the short-term effects of such a major shakeup may be unknown, the long-term implications could be profound.\n\n\"It could be an incredibly disruptive period of time for the technology sector, depending on how Republicans decide to approach things,\" he said.\n\nWhether or not Republicans manage to regain control of Congress in 2022, the tech industry is sure to be watching the election results closely. With the possibility of major disruption looming on the horizon, the sector could be in for a wild ride.", "label": "machine"}

There are even quite a few who have been to every one of the 159 concerts.\u201d\n\nWinter Chamber Music Festival, Winter Chamber Music Festival \u2014 Bienen School of Music When: 7:30 p.m. Jan. 6, Calidore String Quartet and double-bassist Xavier Foley;\n\n3 p.m. Jan. 8, CSO musicians and pianist Adam Neiman;\n\n7:30 p.m. Jan. 13, Isidore String Quartet;\n\n3 p.m. Jan. 15, New Orford String Quartet;\n\n7:30 p.m. Jan. 20, Horszowski Trio;\n\n3 p.m. Jan. 22, Jupiter String Quartet Where: Pick-Staiger Concert Hall, 50 Arts Circle Drive, Northwestern University, Evanston Tickets: Six-concert subscription, $126; individual tickets, $10-$30 Info: music.northwestern.edu/events/category/winter-chamber\n\n\n\nMarking its return to a full schedule after canceled and abridged offerings in 2021 and 2022, respectively, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival returns Jan. 6-22 for six concerts beginning with the Calidore String Quartet and double bassist Xavier Foley.\n\nA boon to the event has been its home venue \u2014 the 1,003-seat Pick-Staiger Concert Hall, which opened in 1975.\n\n\u201cPick-Staiger is a very welcoming hall to play in and listen in,\u201d Milton said. \u201cIt\u2019s large enough and small enough. It\u2019s very intimate-feeling. You always feel you are close to the stage no matter where you are sitting and the acoustic is excellent for chamber music.\u201d\n\nMilton, who is also a member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conceived the festival in 1997 as a way for what is now known as the Bienen School of Music to mark the centennial of Johannes Brahms\u2019 death. So, all six of the inaugural concerts featured chamber music by the famed composer.\n\nDouble bassist Xavier Foley debuts makes his Winter Chamber Music Festival debut in a program with Calidore String Quartet on Jan. 6 at Bienen School.\n\nImmediately putting the event on the map that first year was the participation of Daniel Barenboim, then the CSO\u2019s music director. He is also an internationally renowned pianist, and he performed with four members of the orchestra.\n\nDespite it taking place on Super Bowl Sunday in the middle of a snowstorm, demand was so high for Barenboim\u2019s concert that Pick-Staiger staff had to set up 200 extra seats in the balcony and 75 more on stage. And even with the additional places, some people were still turned away.\n\nMilton hoped the festival would become an annual event, but he knew that school officials would only allow it to continue if it did well. \u201cBut it was such success the first year,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they said, \u2018Ok, good, what are we doing next year?\u2019\u201d\n\nBecause of Milton\u2019s connection to the CSO, many of the early concerts featured players from the ensemble. But about 15 years ago, the orchestra began scheduling international tours in January, causing the musicians to be less available.\n\nSo, the series began featuring more touring artists and ensembles, including such prominent groups as the Escher Quartet and St. Lawrence String Quartet and soloists like cellists Lynn Harrell and Yo-Yo Ma and pianist Garrick Ohlsson.\n\nThe Calidore String Quartet returns for its fifth appearance at the Winter Chamber Music Festival. Michael Hershkowitz\n\nThe festival has regularly presented up-and-coming winners of the prestigious Banff (Alberta, Canada) International String Quartet Competition, which is held every three years. Indeed, this year\u2019s installment features the 2022 winner of the Banff competition, the Isidore Quartet, on Jan. 13. It was formed in 2019 as a student ensemble at the Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nWhile the festival presents groups with other instrumental combinations, like wind quintets or piano trios, it has put an emphasis on string quartets, presenting 23 different such groups, with some making multiple appearances. For example, the Calidore Quartet, which received an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 2018, is returning for its fifth visit.\n\nOther string quartets featured during the 2023 festival are the New Orford String Quartet (Jan. 15) from Canada and the Jupiter String Quartet (Jan. 22). The one featured touring group that is not a string foursome is the Horszwoski Trio, a piano-anchored ensemble, which is set for Jan 20.\n\nJupiter String Quartet is scheduled for a Jan. 22 concert at the Winter Chamber Music Festival. Sarah Gardner\n\nHarking back to 1997, four CSO musicians \u2014 associate concertmaster Stephanie Jeong, violinist Simon Michal, violist Weijing Michal and assistant principal cellist Kennith Olsen \u2014 will take part in an Jan. 8 concert, about two weeks before they leave for a North American tour.\n\nJoined by noted pianist Adam Neiman, they will culminate their all-Brahms concert with the composer\u2019s Piano Quintet in F Minor, Op. 34, the same work in which Barenboim appeared.\n\n\u201cThat will be,\u201d Milton said, \u201ca little way of remembering and honoring that opening season.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The United States men's national soccer team has been rocked by a new allegation against head coach Gregg Berhalter.\n\nThe allegation was made by Gio Reyna\u2019s mother, Danielle Johnson, who told CNN she reported the claim to US Soccer officials on Monday.\n\nJohnson, who is the mother of USMNT rising star and Borussia Dortmund midfielder Gio Reyna, alleges that Berhalter made an inappropriate comment to Reyna before a match in January 2020.\n\n\"I had reported the allegation to US Soccer on Monday,\" Johnson told CNN in an interview Wednesday. \"I felt that it was something that needed to be addressed and, I wanted it to be taken seriously and I wanted to get it on the record, so that this wouldn't happen to anyone else and that our national team can be respected.\"\n\nThe allegation comes as the USMNT is in the middle of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup and as Berhalter is in the middle of negotiating a new contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation.\n\nThe USSF did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on Johnson\u2019s allegation and Berhalter\u2019s contract talks. However, a USSF spokesperson told Yahoo Sports, which first reported the allegation, that it takes such allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and is \u201cinvestigating the allegation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Johnson, the incident occurred when Reyna, 18, was a member of the U.S. Under-17 team. The incident occurred in Panama during the CONCACAF Under-17 Championship in January 2020. The U.S. team was in Panama preparing for its next match against El Salvador when Johnson said she heard Berhalter make an inappropriate comment to her son.\n\n\u201cHe [Berhalter] had said something to Gio that made me really uncomfortable,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd I was there to observe the training and the interaction between the team and the coaching staff. I heard something that really bothered me and made me really uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she felt the comment was inappropriate enough to report it to US Soccer.\n\n\u201cI felt like it had to be reported,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was inappropriate and, as a mother, I just wanted to protect my son and I felt it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe alleged comment was not sexual in nature, Johnson said. It was an off-color comment made in front of the team.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to report it at the time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut then I got home and I thought to myself, this is something that needs to be reported, and I reported it.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she was surprised when she heard no action had been taken by US Soccer.\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed when I heard nothing had been done about it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI felt like it was something that should have been addressed.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she was then contacted by US Soccer officials and asked to speak to them about the allegation.\n\n\u201cI think they understand that this is a serious allegation and they take it seriously,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBerhalter is currently in his fifth season as the USMNT head coach and is considered to be in line for a new contract with the USSF. The USMNT is currently in the middle of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nCNN has reached out to Berhalter for comment but has not yet heard back.\n\nThe allegations against Berhalter come at a time when the U.S. soccer community is grappling with issues of racism and discrimination. US Soccer recently parted ways with president Carlos Cordeiro, who had been accused of a lack of leadership on those issues.\n\nIn her interview with CNN, Johnson said she hopes the allegations against Berhalter are taken seriously.\n\n\u201cI just want my son and all the other children playing in this sport to be respected and to be treated with respect,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI hope US Soccer takes this seriously and investigates it and takes the appropriate actions.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nIn a stunning display of government action, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Wednesday it was suing a major pharmaceutical company for allegedly failing to report suspicious sales of opioids.\n\nThe lawsuit comes after a months-long investigation into sales and marketing practices related to the prescription painkiller OxyContin. The complaint alleges that the company failed to report suspicious orders of OxyContin to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) from 2008 to 2018, and seeks civil penalties totaling more than $2.2 billion.\n\nThe DOJ accused the company of \u201cwillfully violating its obligations\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers to report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit should serve as a warning to all pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies that we will use all tools available to hold them accountable for failing to report suspicious orders of controlled substances,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. \u201cThe opioid crisis is a national public health emergency and those who enable it must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe complaint alleges that the company\u2019s failure to report suspicious orders \u201cresulted in millions of illegal OxyContin doses entering the illicit market\u201d and contributed to the nationwide opioid epidemic.\n\nThe company denied the allegations and said it \u201cacted appropriately and responsibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company is committed to being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic and has taken important steps to ensure our products are safe and used responsibly,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a series of actions taken by the DOJ in an effort to crack down on opioids in the United States. Last year, the agency filed criminal charges against a chain of pharmacies and its owner for illegally distributing opioids. It also charged a doctor and four pharmacists with illegally prescribing opioids and other controlled substances.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s effort to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for its role in the opioid crisis has been bolstered by recent legislation passed by Congress. Last year, Congress passed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which granted the DOJ additional authority to investigate and prosecute cases involving opioids.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to using every tool at our disposal to combat the opioid epidemic,\u201d Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. \u201cThis lawsuit makes clear that pharmaceutical companies and other actors in the drug supply chain will be held responsible if they fail to abide by the law and help fuel this devastating crisis.\u201d\n\nThe complaint against the company is one of several pending civil and criminal cases in the United States related to opioids. If found guilty, the company could face significant fines and penalties.\n\nThe opioid crisis has taken an immense toll on the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 700,000 people have died from drug overdoses since 1999. The overwhelming majority of those deaths \u2013 approximately 70 percent \u2013 have involved opioids.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s lawsuit is a reminder that the government is taking this issue seriously and is willing to take strong action against any companies that are contributing to the opioid crisis. In the end, this could lead to improved safety and protection for American consumers.", "label": "machine"}

Tensions between the two nations have risen since the former Trump administration announced its intention to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops from the region.\n\nThe United States had made clear that the use of nuclear assets in the Korean peninsula was a no-go.\n\nThe current South Korean Defense Minister Suh Wook has made it his priority to build a deterrent against North Korean aggression and proposed a number of ideas, including the use of nuclear assets to enhance joint exercises.\n\nSuh Wook said the joint exercises would help deter North Korean provocations, while also strengthening defense cooperation between South Korea and the United States.\n\n\"The idea of using nuclear assets in joint exercises is being discussed between South Korea and the United States,\" Suh Wook said in a statement.\n\n\"We believe this can contribute to stability on the Korean peninsula and increase the deterrence capabilities of South Korean and U.S. forces,\" he added.\n\nThe statement also noted that Suh Wook and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had discussed the proposal in a recent phone call and that a working-level team is discussing the details.\n\nThe use of nuclear assets in military exercises, however, has been a contentious issue on the Korean peninsula and has sparked criticism from China and other neighbors.\n\nChina has warned that any move by South Korea to use nuclear assets would violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it signed in 1992.\n\nThe United States has insisted that any use of nuclear weapons in the region would remain in line with international law, including the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nIt is unclear how the use of nuclear assets in military exercises would be viewed by North Korea, who recently has indicated a willingness to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe proposal was viewed as a significant shift in the U.S. policy towards the Korean peninsula, which had previously sought to downplay the potential use of nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, U.S. President Joe Biden has been seeking to repair relations between the two nations, and the proposal may serve as a sign of good faith.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Austin said in a recent statement that he was \"encouraged by South Korea's commitment to strengthen its deterrent capabilities and to work together with the United States in the defense of our shared interests in the region.\"\n\nIt is unclear if South Korea will move forward with the proposal, but it may serve as a sign of solidarity with the United States in the face of growing tensions on the Korean peninsula.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Space fans had much to celebrate in 2022.\n\nThe year was jam-packed with new missions, intriguing science and stunning images beamed back from the cosmos. From the first batch of photos from the world\u2019s most powerful space telescope to the long-awaited debut launch of NASA\u2019s next-generation moon rocket to a first-of-its-kind test to redirect an asteroid, this year was full of important milestones.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just NASA and other government space agencies with memorable missions in 2022. The year also included significant gains for the commercial space industry, with private companies launching to the space station and the moon, and setting their sights beyond.\n\nHere are the biggest space stories from 2022.\n\nThe universe comes into focus\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine a more hyped-up moment for NASA in recent years than the first photos from the James Webb Space Telescope. Billed as the successor to the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, the $10 billion observatory, which launched into space on Dec. 25, 2021, was designed to study the early days of the universe, when the first stars flickered on in the cosmos.\n\nThe Webb telescope did not disappoint.\n\nThe first full-color image released from the next-generation James Webb Space Telescope is the sharpest infrared image of the distant universe ever produced, according to NASA. Space Telescope Science Institut / NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Webb ERO\n\nNASA released the first batch of images from the tennis court-sized observatory to much fanfare in July. Among them was a spectacular, full-color \u201cdeep field\u201d image showing stars and galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago. The Webb telescope also captured towering \u201ccliffs\u201d of gas and other never-before-seen features of a star-forming region known as the Carina Nebula, and a huge expanding shell of gas around a dying star.\n\nMonths later, the Webb observatory snapped its first direct images of a planet beyond our solar system. Though the gas giant, located around 355 light-years away from Earth, likely cannot support alien life, the observations demonstrated how the telescope could be used to search for potentially habitable planets elsewhere in the universe.\n\nA new era of astronomy has indeed begun.\n\nThe exoplanet HIP 65426 b in different bands of infrared light, as seen from the James Webb Space Telescope. These images look different because of the ways the different Webb instruments capture light. NASA\n\nA nudge in the right direction\n\nHumanity doesn\u2019t often have the opportunity to conduct real-world tests of how to avert a potential apocalypse, but NASA\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test gave the agency just that chance.\n\nIn September, a NASA spacecraft intentionally slammed into an asteroid in a historic test of humanity\u2019s ability to protect Earth from a potentially catastrophic collision with a space rock. The $325 million DART mission was designed to see whether \u201cnudging\u201d an asteroid can alter its trajectory, in a first-of-its-kind test of planetary defense technologies.\n\nThe Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) intentionally crashed a spacecraft into an asteroid to change its course. NASA/Johns Hopkins, APL/Steve Gribben\n\nThe cosmic smash-up was carried out on a small and harmless space rock known as Dimorphos, which is about 6.8 million miles from Earth. Weeks later, the agency confirmed that the DART probe did successfully change the asteroid\u2019s orbit, shortening Dimorphos\u2019 orbit by 32 minutes.\n\nBack to the moon\n\nFifty years after the final Apollo moon mission, NASA took key steps toward returning astronauts to the lunar surface. Though the agency had to contend with several delays, NASA finally launched its uncrewed Orion space capsule and Space Launch System megarocket on their inaugural flights Nov. 16.\n\nThe much-anticipated test expedition, known as Artemis I, was designed to test the next-generation rocket and spacecraft before NASA conducts missions with humans onboard. NASA has called the SLS booster the \u201cmost powerful rocket in the world\u201d \u2014 more powerful even than the retired Saturn V rockets that the agency used during the Apollo program.\n\nNASA's megarocket makes its way toward Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Nov. 4. John Raoux / AP file\n\nOver the course of the 26-day Artemis I mission, the spacecraft orbited the moon and snapped detailed images of the lunar surface. The capsule also carried a set of mannequins equipped with sensors to gather data about radiation exposure and other conditions of deep space travel.\n\nDuring the mission, NASA officials repeatedly said the test flight exceeded their expectations, and the Orion capsule completed a \u201cpicture perfect splashdown\u201d in the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 11.\n\nEarlier in the year, the agency\u2019s robotic CAPSTONE spacecraft also launched on a lunar mission to test an orbit that could be used for future Artemis missions and to demonstrate new technologies for spacecraft operating near the moon. The probe launched in late June and entered orbit around the moon in November.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter, lifts off from launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Aug. 4, 2022. John Raoux / AP\n\nNASA wasn\u2019t the only space agency eyeing the moon in 2022. The Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter launched Aug. 4 as South Korea\u2019s first exploratory space mission beyond Earth\u2019s orbit. The spacecraft, dubbed Danuri, arrived at the moon in December and is designed to remain in orbit there for a year to map and photograph the lunar surface, including areas near the moon\u2019s poles that are permanently in shadow. Data gathered by the Danuri probe will be shared with NASA to help the agency plan future missions as part of the Artemis program.\n\nAn artist's concept of the HAKUTO-R Mission 1 lunar lander on the Moon. Courtesy ispace via Facebook\n\nA spacecraft built by a private Japanese company called ispace also launched into space on Dec. 11 on a mission to become the first commercial venture to land on the lunar surface. The so-called Hakuto-R mission is now on a monthslong journey to the moon, and it's expected to arrive in the spring. Ispace is attempting to make history by landing the first privately funded craft on the moon. So far, only the government-run space agencies of the United States, China and the former Soviet Union have accomplished the feat.\n\nMuch ado about Mars\n\nWhile the moon was a major focus for space missions in 2022, there was also plenty of activity on Mars.\n\nThis year, NASA celebrated 25 years of continuous robotic exploration of the red planet, paying tribute to the agency\u2019s entire lineage of past and present Mars orbiters, landers and rovers.\n\nNASA currently has two rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance, and one small helicopter exploring the Martian surface, along with three orbiters around Mars. On Feb. 18, the six-wheeled Perseverance rover and small Ingenuity helicopter celebrated their one-year anniversaries on the Martian surface, while Curiosity has been operating there since 2012.\n\nRecently, NASA bid farewell to its InSight lander, which spent more than four years conducting science on Mars. The lander\u2019s last communication with Earth was on Dec. 15, and NASA officials think the spacecraft\u2019s solar-powered batteries have run out of energy.\n\nA better understanding of the cosmos\n\nIn May, scientists revealed the first image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, providing the first direct visual evidence of the immense feature known as Sagittarius A*. The photo showed an oval-shaped void surrounded by a bright ring of glowing gas. Sagittarius A* is about 27,000 light-years away and is 4 million times more massive than the sun.\n\nThe Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy. European Southern Observatory / via AFP\n\nThe photo, published in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters, was only the second image captured of a black hole. It\u2019s thought that almost all galaxies contain a black hole at their center, but these behemoths do not emit light, which makes it challenging for astronomers to capture direct views of them.\n\nSpace station happenings\n\n2022 was a busy year for the International Space Station.\n\nIn April, NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins made history by becoming the first Black woman to serve a long-duration mission at the ISS. Watkins launched aboard SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule and was a member of the space station\u2019s Expedition 67 and Expedition 68 crews. She returned to Earth in October, after logging a total of 170 days in space.\n\nThe space station also played host to two important milestones for the commercial space industry this year.\n\nNASA astronaut Jessica Watkins arrives with \"Crew4\" astronauts at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on April 18. John Raoux / AP file\n\nIn May, Boeing launched its Starliner space capsule on an uncrewed test flight to the ISS. The much-delayed mission was Boeing\u2019s third attempt to complete a crucial test of its ability to safely fly to and from the orbiting outpost. The expedition was an important step in certifying the Starliner capsule to eventually carry NASA astronauts into space. Boeing is already significantly behind its competitor SpaceX, which is similarly under contract with NASA to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\nThe ISS was also visited by four private citizens who made up the first all-civilian crew to launch to the orbiting outpost. The flight, known as Ax-1, was organized by the Houston-based company Axiom Space.\n\nThe Ax-1 crew inside SpaceX's Dragon capsule. From left: Mark Pathy, Larry Connor, Michael L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda and Eytan Stibbe. Courtesy of SpaceX\n\nMeanwhile, China completed construction of its own space station in 2022. The third and final module of the country\u2019s Tiangong space station was launched into orbit Oct. 31. The T-shaped outpost, which is smaller than the ISS, is expected to be continuously occupied for a decade. Chinese officials have also said they intend to use the space station for space tourism and commercial space initiatives.\n\nStudying Earth from above\n\nSpace science also focused closer to home this year.

{"text": "For the second time this year, Buffalo, New York, is coming together in the wake of a major disaster.\n\nIn May, residents rallied together after a gunman shot and killed 10 Black people in a racist attack at Tops Friendly Markets. Now, seven months later, they are lending a helping hand after a historic winter storm trapped people in their homes, left thousands in the dark and claimed the lives of more than 20 people in the city.\n\nFor Toya Johnson, 38, who has lived in Buffalo her entire life, helping others has always been an easy decision. So, when a Facebook friend posted that a family of five was stuck in their home without food, she immediately gathered leftovers from a Christmas dinner she had cooked for her own family.\n\n\"When he said there was a family of five, I cut the whole turkey in half. ... I packed up some food,\" she said in a phone call Tuesday.\n\nBecause the snow was blocking many streets in the city, Johnson said her friend drove as far as he could and then hiked the rest of the way to her house. He collected the food and dropped it off to the family in need.\n\n\"If it's something that's within my means or within my reach, without a question I'm going to do it,\" she said.\n\nThis was the second time this year Johnson has been willing to come to the aid of a complete stranger. She was in the parking lot of Tops on May 14 loading groceries into her car when an 18-year-old shooter opened fire. Johnson, an entrepreneur and single mother of two daughters, had picked up Instacart orders to get some extra money to cover expenses for her daughter's prom and high school graduation.\n\nShe walked out of the supermarket moments before the shooter pulled up, she said. As gunshots rang out, Johnson said she hopped in her car and drove to safety, but a crushing thought crossed her mind.\n\n\"I got this overwhelming feeling like 'Oh my goodness, there were so many older people in there.' There were so many older people behind me in line, so I went back,\" she said.\n\nBut by the time Johnson was able to get back to the supermarket, police had arrived and blocked off the area.\n\nJohnson said her selfless spirit was instilled in her as a child. It's also something she wants to teach her 18 and 8-year-old daughters.\n\n\"I have them watching me ... and I want them to see. I don't care if you don't know the person. I don't care if it's an absolute stranger,\" she said. \"These are things that my grandmother taught me, and it's my duty to teach to my kids.\"\n\nNancy Klein, a resident of West Seneca, a suburb outside downtown Buffalo, said she is \"so proud\" of the way Buffalo has repeatedly come together.\n\nKlein runs a food pantry in her neighborhood and packed up food to give to families affected by the snowstorm.\n\n\"Sometimes people will reach out directly to me and say, 'You know, I have this family who could use anything you've got.' So then I kind of put a bag together and leave it out for them,\" she said.\n\nJoshua Anderson, 37, said he rushed to help his neighbor and helped clear snow after seeing him struggling with his snowblower. As a thank-you, the neighbor made Anderson a Christmas Eve meal despite having no power.\n\nTo continue in the spirit of giving, Anderson said he and his neighbor spent part of their Christmas Day helping at a local shelter.\n\nHis neighbor \"heard on the radio that a local shelter at a church was looking for supplies and stuff. On Christmas Day, when the storm died down, we hiked over there and we took supplies there,\" he said.\n\nPart of the reason Anderson is so willing to help is because of his eagerness to live up to Buffalo's nickname, \"the City of Good Neighbors.\"\n\n\"I feel like we have a reputation to live up to,\" he explained. \"So a part of it is living up to that reputation of being a part of the city of good neighbors. I'm a Buffalonian. I'm part of the community. I feel like I've seen people help (each other) throughout the years, and the only thing I can do is try to do the same thing.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Even New York City, the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ rights movement, is not immune to the surge of anti-drag protests that has swept across the U.S. this year.\n\nThis month alone, there have been at least two such protests in the country\u2019s most populous city. The latest occurred Thursday outside a public library in the borough of Queens, where a Drag Story Hour event for children was scheduled. Drag Story Hour is a national program started in 2015 in which drag performers read books to children in libraries, schools and bookstores to celebrate diversity and encourage kids to read, according to the program\u2019s website.\n\nShekar Krishnan, a New York City Council member who represents parts of the borough, estimated there were 500 protesters, with counterprotesters far outnumbering their anti-drag counterparts.\n\n\u201cWe outnumbered the haters (400 to 100) and drowned them out with chanting, drumming, dancing, and ABBA sing-alongs,\u201d Krishnan, who was there to support the Drag Story Hour event, which went on as planned, wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe protesters carried signs that said \u201cLeave the Kids Aalone\u201d and \u201cStop Drag Queen Story Hour,\u201d while counterprotesters carried signs that read \u201cDrive Homophobia Away\u201d and \u201cLibraries Are for Everyone,\u201d according to local news outlets PIX11 and Gothamist.\n\nVideos and photos shared on social media show the protest at times becoming tense, with participants shouting at each other and at police. Some photos show an attendee carrying a Proud Boys flag, and another captured by a photographer for Getty Images shows a protester giving a Nazi salute.\n\nA spokesperson for the New York City Police Department said one person was arrested in connection with Thursday\u2019s protest. The NYPD also received two arson complaints in which an unidentified individual allegedly poured a substance on two unoccupied vehicles and set them on fire, but those cases are still under investigation, the spokesperson said.\n\nDemonstrators gather for a protest in support of the Drag Story Hour outside the Queens Public Library in New York on Thursday. Yuki Iwamura / AFP via Getty Images\n\nHours before the event, New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams released a joint statement with three council members \u2014 Krishnan, Erik Bottcher and Crystal Hudson \u2014 stating that the three members had their homes vandalized in connection with their support of recent Drag Story Hour events.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, anti-LGBTQIA+ protesters have descended on these family events, attempting to get into our libraries to disrupt them while shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs at performers and attendees,\u201d they said. \u201cThe harmful, homophobic, and transphobic extremism targeting Drag Story Hour events and the New Yorkers who support them, including council members, is vile and dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn the past year, some conservative elected officials, right-wing media personalities and anti-LGBTQ social media accounts have characterized the program as inappropriate for children, and some have even gone so far as to describe it as sexually \u201cgrooming\u201d minors, perpetuating a decades-old attack on LGBTQ people.\n\nDemonstrators gather to protest against Drag Story Hour outside the Queens Public Library in New York on Thursday. Yuki Iwamura / AFP via Getty Images\n\nThursday\u2019s incident marks at least the second protest of a Drag Story Hour event in New York City this month. On Dec. 17, protesters gathered outside a branch of the New York Public Library in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood to oppose a Drag Story Hour event that, according to organizers, was created to be more accessible to children with autism and other disabilities.\n\nCouncilman Bottcher, who had attended the event, said that his home and office were vandalized two days later. He documented the incidents on social media with photos and videos taken by his staff.\n\nProtesters vandalized the hallway outside Bottcher\u2019s office on Dec. 19, according to police, though no arrests have been made in that incident. Bottcher shared a video that he said shows protesters shouting at his staff.\n\nLater that day, just before 5 p.m., protesters gathered outside Bottcher\u2019s apartment building, police said. Bottcher alleged that someone physically assaulted his neighbor and he shared video of the incident. The NYPD spokesperson said police had arrested and charged David Nieves, 33, of Brooklyn, with assault and harassment in connection with the incident, which happened at 4:50 p.m. Nieves did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, two women allegedly entered Bottcher\u2019s residence without permission, the NYPD spokesperson said. D\u2019Anna Morgan, 27, of Queens, and Erica Sanchez, 44, of the Bronx were arrested for trespassing and were released as they await court appearances, the spokesperson said. Morgan did not immediately return a request for comment, and Sanchez could not be reached for comment.\n\nBottcher accused the protesters of also vandalizing the sidewalk outside his apartment building with homophobic messages, including \u201cErik Bottcher is a pedo child groomer,\u201d echoing rhetoric that has increasingly been used by some Republican elected officials over the past two years.\n\n\u201cThis is pure hate, unmasked,\u201d Bottcher said of the messages in front of his residence. \u201cIf they think this is going to intimidate us, they\u2019re mistaken. Our resolve is strengthened.\u201d\n\nA representative for Bottcher did not immediately return a request for additional comment.\n\nThese New York incidents are among the latest in a nationwide surge of attacks and protests targeting drag performances and events.\n\nLast month, the LGBTQ media advocacy group GLAAD issued a report stating that there had been more than 140 incidents of anti-LGBTQ protests and threats targeting drag events across 47 states in 2022, with Texas, North Carolina and Illinois reporting the most such protests. Some of the protests, the organization found, had been organized by white nationalist groups, including the Proud Boys, who, in some cases, have shown up to Drag Story Hour events armed.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hardline Republican lawmakers on Thursday vowed to block Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid for the role of Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, citing a sharp divide among the party's ranks over his leadership style.\n\nThe House will vote for a new Speaker on Jan. 3 and McCarthy, the current House majority leader, is seen as the heavy favorite for the job. But a handful of vocal conservative members of the House, calling themselves the Freedom Caucus, said they oppose McCarthy due to his tendency to reach across the aisle and to compromise on conservative principles.\n\n\"We've seen too much bipartisanship and not enough adherence to conservative values,\" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) told reporters at a press conference Thursday. \"We cannot support a Speaker who is willing to water down our principles and pass legislation that goes against our core values.\"\n\nMeadows, who heads the Freedom Caucus, said the group will meet on Friday to decide on a candidate they can support for Speaker. Until then, they said, they will withhold their support for McCarthy.\n\nThe group was a major factor in the 2015 ouster of Speaker John Boehner, who faced a wave of criticism from conservatives for negotiating with Democrats on key issues. McCarthy was expected to take up the mantle from Boehner, but it appears those expectations will have to be put on hold for the time being.\n\n\"Our caucus is unified in our opposition to Kevin McCarthy,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). \"We have a very clear sense of what it takes to lead the House and he doesn't meet that standard. We're not going to stand for it.\"\n\nThe opposition to McCarthy has cast doubt on the outcome of Thursday's election. If the Freedom Caucus' members vote against him, he could potentially lose the race, despite having a solid majority within the GOP. In that case, the election could stretch on for days, as members search for a consensus Speaker.\n\n\"We're not trying to upset the apple cart,\" Meadows said. \"We simply want to make sure the person leading this House is someone who will fight for our principles.\"\n\nThe situation has put the party's leadership in a tough spot. While GOP leaders are eager to get someone in the Speaker's chair as soon as possible, they also don't want to risk alienating conservative members of the caucus, who could push for further intra-party battles in the coming months.\n\nFor now, it appears the party will have to remain in a holding pattern until the Freedom Caucus decides on a suitable candidate or McCarthy manages to convince its members of his loyalty to conservative principles. It could be the start of an unpredictable and lengthy process for a job that just weeks ago seemed guaranteed to go to McCarthy.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nGoverning by chaos is back.\n\nTwo years after the master of political mayhem, ex-President Donald Trump, stormed out of Washington in disgrace, Republicans have finally won back some power.\n\nBut they still don\u2019t know how to properly use it.\n\nAfter weeks of vowing to hold President Joe Biden to account, the new GOP House majority arrived in town Tuesday \u2013 and promptly failed in its most basic task: electing a speaker to lead it. A revolt of ultra-hardliners in an already hardline conference dealt humiliation to Kevin McCarthy, the California lawmaker who saw his decades-old dream of wielding the gavel dashed \u2013 at least for now.\n\nEven Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, known more for embracing conspiracy theories than stable governance, complained that the party was thwarting its own goals \u201cbecause 19 Republicans decided to blow up the Speaker\u2019s race.\u201d (Greene backs McCarthy).\n\nMcCarthy became the first candidate to fall short in a first ballot for speaker in a century. Most poignantly, the impasse means Republicans are unable even to assume the control they won in the midterms as a new House can\u2019t yet be sworn in.\n\nExtraordinary scenes on the House floor\n\nOn a surreal day, the 118th Congress opened with Republicans fighting Republicans, while Democrats \u2013 who should have been mourning their lost majority \u2013 were joyous at the GOP circus they beheld.\n\n\u201cHakeem, Hakeem,\u201d Democrats chanted as their new leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, earned more votes than McCarthy in the first three roll calls of the new House the GOP is supposed to control \u2013 although he too fell short of the 218 majority.\n\nAt one point, Ohio firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan, a hero of the right, stood to nominate McCarthy for speaker, only for 19 of the rejectionists to vote that he should have the top job that he insists he doesn\u2019t want. (Jordan is more interested in lacerating Biden\u2019s appointees as chair of the Judiciary Committee).\n\nA daylong debacle, in which McCarthy appeared to have no strategy other than a beat-the-head-against-a-brick-wall approach, ended with the House in an absurd limbo. Smartly dressed family members who traveled to Washington to see their new lawmakers proudly sworn in were bored and disappointed. The House adjourned and will resume on Wednesday at noon, even though there\u2019s little sign the deadlock will break.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we were going to get any more productive by continuing on the day,\u201d McCarthy told reporters late Tuesday. But he insisted he wouldn\u2019t be dropping out of the race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe only need 11 more votes to win,\u201d implying that he thinks he can get a number of members to vote present, which would lower the threshold he\u2019d need.\n\nTakeaways from a surreal day\n\nThe picture will become clearer on Wednesday as the fourth vote looms. But here are some conclusions from Tuesday\u2019s drama.\n\n\u2014 The GOP civil war, which erupted with the Tea Party backlash to the Obama administration, is far from burned out. It was responsible for the departures of Republican House Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner and was put into overdrive by Trump. And as soon as the party had a sniff of power again, that strife burst into the open as radicals seek to destroy a party establishment that has already shifted far right to appease them.\n\n\u2014 Even if McCarthy prevails, he will be a weak speaker who may be in office but barely in power. The Californian had weeks to get his majority together. Either he inaccurately counted the votes or has no control over his conference. Neither scenario is likely to lead to a majority that effectively trains its fire on Democrats and the White House and can build a strong case for voters for the 2024 election. If Republicans can\u2019t unite on an easy vote \u2013 for speaker \u2013 how will they come together on tough ones, on government spending bills, for example?\n\n\u2014 Political arsonists cannot be won over. Leadership sources say Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona and other members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus were offered multiple concessions by McCarthy, including weakening the speaker\u2019s capacity to cling on to power. But they refused, making clear that this is as much about personalities as ideology. They brand McCarthy as a sell-out, the biggest alligator in the Washington \u201cswamp\u201d whom they will never trust.\n\n\u201cMaybe the right person for the speaker of the House isn\u2019t someone who has sold shares in himself for more than a decade to get it,\u201d Gaetz said on the floor on Tuesday in a cutting jab at McCarthy, who sat a few feet away.\n\n\u2014 McCarthy may have nothing to offer the renegades to win their votes. They disdain big committee posts and don\u2019t dream of passing signature bills. They don\u2019t care that a majority of the GOP in the House wants McCarthy. For them, as it was for Trump, the chaos is the point. Taking on the \u201cswamp\u201d gets them booked on conservative talk shows, boosts their fundraising and polishes their MAGA credentials.\n\nFormer Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state \u2013 who voted to impeach Trump, lost a primary to a rival backed by the ex-president, who then went on to lose the general election to a Democrat \u2013 told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Tuesday the rebels were in it for themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just drama. \u2026 They have this outsize platform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The tiny Republican majority \u2013 which means McCarthy could only afford to lose four votes for speaker \u2013 will dominate the 118th Congress. It not only gave the hardliners the chance to hold McCarthy hostage in the race for speaker; it will mean that at any moment, the House can be shut down over just a few votes. This isn\u2019t just a concern for the eventual speaker. The White House should be worried too, given looming showdowns over government budgets and raising the debt ceiling.\n\nIronically, McCarthy may have only himself to blame. By quickly embracing Trump after initially criticizing him over the January 6, 2021, insurrection, he linked his party\u2019s midterm election campaign irrevocably to Trump\u2019s reputation. But many voters were alienated by the ex-president\u2019s election denialism and landed McCarthy with a much smaller and more unworkable House majority than he expected.\n\n\u2014 One interpretation of the midterms was that voters \u2013 exhausted by the turbulence of the Trump years and a once-in-a-century pandemic \u2013 gave a cry for stability and calm and were therefore not willing to hand all the power available in November back to Republicans. (While they fell short of a red wave in the House, the GOP failed to win back the Senate and Democrats grew their majority). Farcical scenes in the House on Tuesday were hardly what those voters had in mind in November.\n\n\u2014 And Democrats are already trying to make political capital out of it, seeing vindication for their claims that Republicans are still not fit for power and should be kicked out at the first opportunity in the next election. \u201cI just watched House Republicans plunge into utter chaos on the House floor,\u201d Jeffries told Democratic donors in a fundraising email. \u201cThis changes everything for Democrats. We now have a huge opportunity to step in and show what we can do.\u201d\n\n\u2018The Taliban 20\u2019\n\nIf anything, McCarthy got weaker with each roll call, even if one senior GOP source told CNN he would never back down and \u201cwe\u2019re going to war.\u201d Some GOP members are now referring to the rebels as \u201cthe chaos caucus\u201d or \u201cThe Taliban 20,\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reported.\n\nBut one lawmaker who opposed McCarthy, South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, vowed he\u2019d fight on for \u201csix months\u201d if need be to thwart the Californian\u2019s bid for speaker. Despite the tough talk, McCarthy \u2013 who rather prematurely took up residence in the speaker\u2019s office suite \u2013 is left with painful realities. They include the question of whether his bid is doomed, given that it seems impossible that he can win over the most hardline handful of objectors. A few Republicans late Tuesday seemed to be toying with the possibility that another candidate could emerge \u2013 after the House turned into a farce and their party was made a laughing stock.\n\nBut the chances of a compromise choice who could unite the ultra-right and more moderate members who won in Biden districts seems remote.\n\nMcCarthy will get a fresh chance on Wednesday to show that he can bring his conference under control and finally bring some order to the new Republican majority \u2013 even if the path ahead remains impossible to identify. Perhaps a day of infighting will convince all Republicans they are at risk of squandering their majority.\n\n\u201cWe have an agenda and we want to implement that agenda and we can either be the conference who comes together to do that or we can let a select few keep us from being able to do that,\u201d Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Tuesday, arguing that McCarthy had been successful in leading his party back to power in the House.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t take out a pitcher in the middle of a no-hitter,\u201d he added.\n\nBut after his triple loss in votes for speaker Tuesday, McCarthy must now prove it\u2019s not three strikes and you are out.", "label": "human"}

He was the first in his family to attend college, having received a scholarship to the California Institute of Technology. After graduating in 1955, Cunningham joined the U.S. Navy and became an aviator.\n\nIn 1963, he was accepted into NASA\u2019s second group of astronauts and by October of that year he and his crewmates, Don Eisele and Wally Schirra, were chosen to fly aboard Apollo 7.\n\nThe Apollo 7 mission was intended to test the operational capabilities of the Apollo spacecraft, and its crew was charged with assessing the spacecraft\u2019s performance in flight and confirming its ability to reach a precise rendezvous with another vehicle in orbit.\n\nThe mission launched on October 11, 1968, and was a great success.

{"text": "It\u2019s Monday, January 5th, and mortgage and refinance rates remain slightly elevated. Data from Freddie Mac indicates the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.48%.\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up from last week\u2019s 3.39%. It\u2019s still below its all-time low of 2.88% seen in early 2021, but has been steadily increasing since then as the housing market continues to heat up.\n\nThe 15-year fixed mortgage rate is currently 2.74%, up from last week\u2019s 2.62%. This is a relatively low rate for 15-year loans, and is a good option for those who want to pay off their loan quickly but don\u2019t want to deal with the high monthly payments associated with shorter loans.\n\nThe 5-year adjustable rate mortgage is currently 2.77%, up from last week\u2019s 2.63%. This is a popular option for borrowers who want the flexibility to adjust their payments in the future or who plan to refinance within a few years.\n\nMeanwhile, refinance rates remain elevated but unchanged from last week. The 30-year fixed refinance rate is currently 3.73%, up from last week\u2019s 3.69%. The 15-year refinance rate is 2.99%, up from 2.97% last week. The 5-year adjustable refinance rate is 2.84%, up from 2.80% last week.\n\nThe big question now is, how high will mortgage and refinance rates go in the future? Experts suggest that, while the current rates are relatively low and may not go much higher in the near term, they\u2019re likely to eventually rise. This is because of the continued economic recovery, as well as increased homebuyer demand, which can lead to higher interest rates.\n\nThe recent surge in housing prices has also been a factor. The median home price was up 16.3% in 2020, the largest annual increase in the last five years, according to the National Association of Realtors. The high prices, combined with the current interest rates, could push the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 4.5% in the coming months.\n\nIt\u2019s important for potential homebuyers and refinance borrowers to keep an eye on mortgage and refinance rates as they continue to rise. Taking advantage of low rates now can save you money in the long run, and can help make the homebuying process much easier.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering buying a home or refinancing, now is a good time to start the process. Shopping around for the best rate can help you get the best deal, and there are many online tools to help you compare different options.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to make sure you\u2019re financially ready to buy a home. This includes having good credit, a reliable income source, and enough money saved up for a down payment. Make sure you understand what type of loan you qualify for and shop around to find the best deal.\n\nMortgage and refinance rates are expected to remain elevated in the near future, so it\u2019s important to take advantage of the current rates if you\u2019re planning on buying a home or refinancing. With the housing market continuing to heat up, now is the perfect time to start looking for the best rate for your situation.", "label": "machine"}

He may not be one of the team\u2019s biggest stars, but his importance to the team is undeniable.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a valuable piece to our team,\u201d Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said. \u201cHe does all the little things that often go unnoticed but are critical to winning. Alex has proven himself to be a consummate professional and a leader. We\u2019re proud to have him on our team.\u201d\n\nThe Bulls\u2019 Alex Caruso may not be the most famous name on the roster, but it\u2019s all in the details with him.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, composed of 30 blue chip companies, ended the day off 6.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.9%.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted economies worldwide, was largely to blame for the market turmoil, although the political uncertainty in the wake of the U.S. presidential election also weighed on stocks. Other contributors to the market downturn included rising U.S.-China tensions, the ensuing trade war, surging oil prices and increasing government debt.\n\nThe outlook for the coming year remains uncertain, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the global economy. Vaccines have been approved, but many businesses have yet to fully recover from the crippling effects of the pandemic and the associated lockdowns, which have left millions of Americans unemployed.\n\nInvestors are still in wait-and-see mode, as the U.S. economy tries to rebound from the pandemic. The government's stimulus plans, combined with the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy, could help support the economic recovery and lift stocks.\n\nAt the same time, there are several long-term concerns that could lead to additional losses. These include the growing debt crisis, a lack of confidence in the financial system, high valuations and a possible wave of defaults from highly leveraged companies.\n\nThe 2022 bear market sent many investors into the red, but that doesn't mean all stocks have been underperforming. Some tech giants like Apple and Microsoft have continued to soar, and some sectors, such as healthcare, have posted gains.\n\nIt's also worth noting that bear markets can be a great time to buy stocks, as long as investors remain cautious and don't put all their eggs in one basket. Investing in quality companies with a long-term outlook can often prove to be a winning strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock market can be a volatile place and investors should always approach it with a long-term horizon in mind.

He was then taken to a Cincinnati hospital where he remains in intensive care, listed in critical condition, the Bills said.\n\n\"His heartbeat was restored on the field,\" the team said early Tuesday.\n\nThe traumatic events played out in front of a packed Cincinnati Bengals stadium and a mass of TV viewers \u2014 many of whom spent Monday night sharing their prayers and wishes for Hamlin's recovery.\n\nThe medical emergency resulted in the NFL postponing the game \u2014 and as of early Tuesday afternoon, no potential date was announced to resume the contest. The situation has also raised questions about how the decision to halt the game was made, after ESPN and others initially reported players were told to prepare to take the field again after Hamlin left in an ambulance.\n\nHere's a timeline of the events as they unfolded:\n\n8:56 p.m. ET \u2014 Hamlin tackled Bengals receiver Tee Higgins around midfield, taking a hard hit to his chest. The time was recorded both by reporter Luke Jones of local TV station WKRC and a liveblog from Sporting News. At first glance, the play didn't seem unusual, as Hamlin initially stood up and adjusted his facemask \u2014 but he then collapsed, falling backward on the turf.\n\nMedical personnel rushed to help Hamlin, and several players and coaches took a knee as the gravity of the situation became clear. He suffered the injury with nearly six minutes left in the first quarter.\n\nThe ESPN broadcast repeatedly cut to commercials \u2014 a standard practice during injury timeouts.

After minutes of hushed quiet in the stadium, brief applause broke out when Hamlin was seen on a stretcher.\n\n9:12 p.m. \u2014 The ambulance took Hamlin off the field, according to Sporting News. The emergency vehicle then paused in the parking lot \u2014 apparently to give Hamlin's mother, who was at the game, time to ride in the ambulance with her son, Danneman reported.\n\n\"I have zero clue how anybody is expected to continue playing this game,\" The Athletic's Paul Dehner Jr., who is based in Cincinnati, tweeted. \"What a horrifying scene that was.\"\n\nOfficials spoke to both coaches on their sidelines, Dehner added.\n\n9:14 p.m. \u2014 \"Players are coming back on the field and it looks like the game will continue,\" ESPN's Ben Baby reported.

{"text": "On Friday, the city of Petersburg, Virginia, made the difficult decision to part ways with its fire chief, Jason Jones. \n\nThe move came after an investigation by city officials into Jones' conduct during his tenure in the fire department, which had been under scrutiny since last May when an independent audit raised serious concerns about financial mismanagement and potential misuse of public funds. \n\nThe decision to let Jones go was not taken lightly. It was reached after a lengthy and careful review of the facts and the seriousness of the issues raised. \n\nAs part of this process, the city asked numerous questions of Jones and his staff, and city officials consulted with outside legal counsel and the independent auditor, who conducted a comprehensive review. After evaluating all of the available information, the city felt that the decision to move on from Jones was necessary in order to ensure the best interest of Petersburg and its citizens.\n\nCity Manager Jeffery G. Moore said in a statement that the decision to let Jones go was difficult but necessary.\n\n\"The Fire Department has faced challenges in recent years, and it is our responsibility as city leaders to ensure that the citizens of Petersburg are being served in the best manner possible,\" he said. \"We believe the decision to terminate Mr. Jones\u2019 employment is in the best interest of the city at this time and we thank him for his service over the last five years.\"\n\nJones was appointed fire chief in 2015, and the city said he was instrumental in leading efforts to modernize the department and enhance response capabilities. \n\nThe investigation into Jones' conduct, however, revealed systemic issues within the department, including problems with budgeting, procurement processes and personnel issues, as well as potential financial mismanagement. \n\nIn addition to addressing these problems, city leaders said they are committed to ensuring the department can effectively serve the public in the future.\n\nThe city is already making changes to the department, including reviewing and revising departmental policies and procedures, conducting staff training and implementing internal controls to increase oversight and accountability. \n\nCity officials have said they are committed to working with the department and its personnel to ensure that the best practices are being followed going forward.\n\nThe city is also working to ensure that Jones\u2019 replacement is chosen carefully and that the department is provided with the resources and training it needs to serve Petersburg residents.\n\nThe search for a new fire chief is already underway, with the city actively seeking candidates.\n\nThe city has vowed to make transparency a priority in the search, with council members and other city leaders hosting public meetings to provide updates and receive input from Petersburg residents. \n\nThis search comes at a critical moment for the fire department and the city. Petersburg is a growing city, with an increasing demand for fire protection services. \n\nThe city is facing a host of challenges, including continued financial strain, an aging infrastructure and the ever-present threat of fires, accidents and natural disasters. \n\nThe new fire chief will play an essential role in addressing these challenges, and city leaders have made it clear that the city\u2019s residents will be at the forefront of their decisions. \n\nThe city is counting on their new fire chief to help ensure that Petersburg is safe and secure for years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a recent report from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, investors need to brace themselves for a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and unprecedented volatility in the markets. This could be the biggest macroeconomic storm in decades, the company warns.\n\nWith the US dollar weakening against a basket of other currencies, the Eurozone still mired in recession, and emerging markets posting lackluster growth, investors are right to be concerned. Even when these markets do begin to recover, their rate of growth is likely to be slow and unsteady.\n\nThe BlackRock report warns that the current macroeconomic environment is particularly turbulent, and that investors need to prepare themselves for an extended period of market volatility.\n\nInflation is likely to remain a persistent problem in the near future, with prices in most advanced economies still climbing. This could further exacerbate the global market uncertainty, making it even more difficult for investors to navigate.\n\nThe report further warns that the macroeconomic storm could be the biggest one since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The economy is being rocked by a series of negative shocks such as trade wars, Brexit, and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThese shocks are exacerbating the already difficult environment. For instance, the coronavirus pandemic has caused widespread economic shutdowns, with many businesses having to close down or reduce their workforce. This has had a severe impact on global economies and created an even more volatile macroeconomic environment.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the report recommends that investors focus on capital preservation and income generation, rather than attempting to grow their portfolio in an unpredictable environment. This means investing in cash and high quality bonds, rather than taking risks in more volatile markets.\n\nIn addition, it suggests looking for value plays in undervalued industries such as healthcare and technology, as well as investing in regions and countries which are expected to show strong recoveries from the current recession.\n\nThe report also recommends diversifying globally, rather than focusing exclusively on one particular region or market. Diversification is the key to successful portfolio management in the current macroeconomic environment, and investors need to think carefully about where they allocate their capital.\n\nIt is clear from the BlackRock report that investors must adjust their strategies to the current macroeconomic environment. Volatility is likely to remain a key theme, while inflation could remain persistent.\n\nTherefore, it is important for investors to remain disciplined, diversify globally, and focus on capital preservation and income generation. Only then can they weather the macroeconomic storm and emerge unscathed.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "of civilians\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia have reached a boiling point as both sides accuse each other of responsibility for a rocket strike in eastern Ukraine that left scores of civilians dead.\n\nThe incident occurred on Saturday night in the Russian-backed separatist stronghold of Donetsk, a city in the breakaway region of eastern Ukraine. Local officials report that at least 12 people were killed, while pro-Russia separatists claimed at least 16 died.\n\nThe Ukrainian government, however, blames Russian military commanders for the rocket attack. Ukrainian officials say it was a direct violation of a ceasefire agreement between the two sides that was signed last year.\n\nRussia denies any involvement in the incident and has accused Ukraine of launching the attack. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday that the attack was carried out by Ukrainian troops and that the \u201cresult was nothing short of a humanitarian disaster\u201d.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage among Russians who are now calling for the resignation of top military commanders. In the wake of the strike, President Vladimir Putin was forced to address the issue, saying that the attack \u201cclearly violated international agreements on the protection of civilians\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn this senseless act of violence and call for all sides to act with restraint and to comply with the ceasefire agreement,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe situation in eastern Ukraine has reached a critical point and I urge all parties to refrain from further acts of aggression and to resume dialogue.\u201d\n\nThe rocket attack has also reignited criticism of Russia\u2019s military presence in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have been supporting pro-Russian separatists in their fight against the Ukrainian government since 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has accused Russia of supplying the rebels with military hardware such as tanks, missiles and artillery. Russia has denied any involvement in the conflict and has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution.\n\nDespite the tensions, Russia has agreed to attend an emergency meeting with Ukraine and other members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The meeting is scheduled to take place in Vienna on Tuesday.\n\nWhile it remains unclear who is responsible for the rocket attack, both sides have expressed hope that the incident does not escalate into a full-blown conflict.\n\nFor their part, Ukrainians are mourning the victims of the attack and calling for justice. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a statement that the attack \u201cdemonstrates the complete disregard of Russian commanders for the lives of civilians\u201d.\n\nHe also called on the international community to impose further sanctions on Russia and to continue to support Ukraine in its fight against \u201cRussian aggression\u201d.\n\nThe attack has sparked widespread anger and grief in both countries, with many Russians venting their outrage on social media. The hashtag \u201c#RussiaKilledUs\u201d has become a rallying cry on Russian-language Twitter, while Ukrainians have been mourning their dead on Facebook and other social networks.\n\nWhile the full extent of the attack is still being determined, it has already sent shockwaves through both Ukraine and Russia. It remains to be seen if the incident will lead to further escalation in the conflict or if both sides will be able to find a peaceful resolution.", "label": "machine"}

But Truist analysts are now recommending a select group of those stocks for investors who want exposure to the sector, according to a report on Monday.\n\nTruist analysts started coverage of six stocks in the cable, satellite and wireless broadband space: AT&T, Comcast, DISH Network, Verizon, Altice USA and Charter Communications. They each receive a \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\n\nThe analysts believe these companies offer a combination of sustainable long-term growth and attractive valuations. Despite the recent declines in the sector, they see opportunities to take advantage of the lower prices.\n\n\u201cWe expect broadband operators to benefit from the acceleration of cord-cutting and growing wireless demand,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nFor starters, AT&T and Verizon offer a \u201cvalue-oriented\u201d opportunity for investors due to the company\u2019s \u201cstable cash flow and potential for increased dividend payments.\u201d\n\nAT&T also has attractive upside in its streaming media strategy with the launch of HBO Max, Truist believes. The streaming service has the potential to drive earnings growth over the long term, the analysts said.\n\nFor Comcast, the analysts like the growth prospects for the company\u2019s broadband business. Truist believes that its cable business should benefit from an increase in consumer spending and its competitive position in the market.\n\nTruist also likes DISH Network\u2019s growth prospects and believes the company is well positioned to benefit from the shift to over-the-top streaming. The analysts note that the company has also strengthened its balance sheet with the sale of its spectrum assets.\n\nMeanwhile, Altice USA and Charter Communications \u201cshould benefit from their positions in the cable sector,\u201d the analysts said. They are also encouraged by their strong customer relationships and cost controls.\n\nOverall, the analysts believe that the broadband sector is poised to continue to see growth over the long term. As such, they believe these stocks offer a good opportunity for investors.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is an attractive entry point to gain exposure to a sector that will benefit from the shift to online streaming and increasing demand for wireless services,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nIn addition to the stocks mentioned above, the analysts also pointed to several other companies that offer exposure to the sector. Those include Sprint, T-Mobile, Cox Communications, CenturyLink, Frontier Communications, Windstream and Mediacom Communications.\n\nThe analysts believe that these stocks also offer attractive valuations and long-term growth potential. They suggest investors look closely at these companies to get the most out of their investments.\n\nOverall, while broadband operators have seen a recent dip in valuations, Truist believes that now is the time to buy these stocks.

{"text": "Mifepristone (Mifeprex), one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion, is displayed at the Women's Reproductive Clinic, which provides legal medication abortion services, in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, on June 15, 2022.\n\nWalgreens and CVS will sell the prescription abortion pill mifepristone after the Food and Drug Administration this week dropped a long-standing rule that prevented drug stores from doing so.\n\nThe decision by the two largest drug store chains in the U.S. will significantly expand access to mifepristone in states where abortion is legal. The companies cannot offer the pill in states that have completely banned abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe FDA on Tuesday changed its regulations to allow retail drug stores to dispense mifepristone so long as they complete a certification process. The agency dropped a long-standing rule that required patients to obtain the abortion pill in-person at clinics, hospitals and other certified health-care providers.\n\nWalgreens plans to get certified and is working through the registration and training of its pharmacists to dispense mifepristone consistent with federal and state law, spokesperson Fraser Engerman said. CVS also plans to get certified in states where it is legal to do so, spokesperson Amy Thibault said.\n\nThis means patients in many parts of the U.S. will effectively be able to obtain mifepristone like other prescription medications, either in-person at a retail pharmacy or through the mail. Patients will still need to obtain their prescription from a certified health-care provider.\n\nMifepristone has become a central flashpoint in the political battle over abortion at the state level in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Several conservative groups have asked a federal court in Texas to overturn the FDA's approval of mifepristone.\n\nMifepristone is the most common way to terminate a pregnancy in the U.S. Some 51% of abortions were performed with mifepristone in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe FDA first approved mifepristone more than 20 years ago in 2000 as a method to terminate early pregnancies, but the pill long had strict regulations around how it could be dispensed to patients. Medical organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had long argued that those regulations lacked a scientific basis and were rooted in politics.\n\nMifepristone is approved to end a pregnancy through the 10th week. It is used in combination with another pill called misoprostol. Mifepristone stops the pregnancy from continuing and misoprostol induces contractions that empty the uterus.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "For all the talk of 2020 being the worst year ever for Donald Trump, 2022 may have been even worse.\n\nWith no major legislative victories, the President\u2019s legal woes escalating, and public approval ratings consistently underwater, this has been a particularly difficult year for Trump. And 2023 isn\u2019t looking much better.\n\nAt the start of the year, Trump was facing an impeachment trial in the Senate and was eventually acquitted. But the real drama surrounding the trial was the fact that Trump\u2019s legal team failed to secure a single acquittal vote. This was a major blow to Trump\u2019s legal team, which had promised a full exoneration, and it caused some in the White House to wonder if Trump\u2019s legal woes would continue.\n\nThe answer was yes. Trump\u2019s legal team continued to struggle throughout the year, culminating in the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to overturn his election loss to Joe Biden. This was a devastating blow for Trump, who had spent much of the year claiming that the election was \u201crigged\u201d and that he had won.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal problems were compounded by mounting investigations into his businesses and associates. While many of the investigations were fruitless, some produced results that were potentially damaging to the President. Most notably, in June, federal prosecutors revealed that Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen had pled guilty to eight counts of financial fraud and campaign finance violations. This led to renewed calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but the Senate once again failed to convict him.\n\nAnother major problem for Trump this year has been his approval ratings. Polls consistently showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was significantly underwater, with some polls showing him with a 40% approval rating. This meant that Trump had become deeply unpopular with the American public, which could make it difficult for him to mount any sort of meaningful political comeback in 2023.\n\nFinally, Trump\u2019s legislative agenda largely stalled out this year. After taking office, Trump had promised a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d legislative agenda, but it mostly never materialized. The one major legislative accomplishment was a tax cut bill passed in December. But even that was largely seen as a victory for the Republicans in Congress, rather than for Trump.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s been a tough year for Donald Trump. Despite his attempts to project an image of strength, his legal troubles and sinking approval ratings suggest that his political power is waning. And with no major legislative accomplishments to speak of, it looks like 2023 may be another tough year for the President.", "label": "machine"}

It is reportedly being filmed in Franschhoek because Cape Town itself was deemed too dangerous thanks to the proximity of the Cape Flats.\n\nBut Franschhoek is not being treated as a safe heaven either. UK tabloids say producers fear cast or crew could be kidnapped by gangs who target wealthy visitors. So the production will be ringed by security guards stationed inside the perimeter, with a hotline established to both armed response and the local police, so that \"the heavy cavalry would be on their way in seconds\" if necessary.\n\nContestants will also be briefed on what to do in a worst-case scenario.\n\nSouth African security companies, say the producers, know what they are doing, but the dangers are real.\n\nThe show is using the Ludus Magnus Estate, which charges more than R450,000 per day for exclusive use by wedding parties in peak season. The estate says it is 100% off-grid, with its own solar panels and boreholes covering all its needs, and local treatment of sewage water.\n\nIn 2022, ITV recorded five million viewers for the opening episode of Love Island. It was not clear whether that was due to, or in spite of, what complainants told a regulator was bullying and misogyny by male cast members.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\n\nNew York Times journalists staged a historic, 24-hour strike on Tuesday after management and the union failed to reach a deal on a new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe strike, which began at 11 p.m. Monday and ended the following evening, was the first of its kind by Times journalists in the newspaper's 172-year history. Employees had threatened to go on strike for weeks, arguing that their demands for better pay, improved benefits, and stronger job protections were not being addressed by Times management.\n\nJust hours before the strike was set to begin, Times management and the NewsGuild of New York, which represents more than 1,000 journalists, failed to agree on a new contract. While the two sides did agree on some of the demands put forward by the union\u2014such as limiting the number of layoffs and prohibiting non-union workers from performing union work\u2014the Times rejected a number of proposals.\n\nThe labor union said they wanted the Times to commit to higher salaries, improved benefits, better job security, and additional resources to help journalists to do their jobs better. The union also said they wanted the Times to strengthen their commitment to diversity and create a plan that would expand opportunities for people of color in the newsroom.\n\nThe union argued that the newspaper had failed to keep up with industry standards and needed to make changes to ensure that Times employees could continue to do their jobs with a livable wage.\n\n\"We have continually proposed fair and reasonable solutions to management, who have failed to act in good faith,\" the NewsGuild said in a statement prior to the strike. \"For too long, the Times' management has undervalued us and underfunded our efforts to put out the newspaper, and that is why we need to take a stand and take action.\"\n\nThe union had previously called for the Times to give a 5% raise to all union members and increase the number of positions available for diverse candidates. Management, however, had argued that the Times was already providing fair compensation and did not need to make such changes.\n\nIn response to the strike, Times CEO Mark Thompson released a statement on Tuesday, saying the company was \"disappointed\" the union had chosen to go on strike and that it remained open to further negotiations.\n\n\"We have put forward many proposals during the course of our negotiations, and we have shared some of them publicly to demonstrate our commitment to our employees,\" Thompson said in the statement.\n\n\"We look forward to returning to the negotiating table with the union and hope that an agreement is reached that is fair to both parties,\" Thompson said.\n\nDespite the disagreement, Times journalists did take part in some collective actions on Tuesday in solidarity with the striking employees. Journalists at the newspaper wrote a joint open letter, calling on the Times management to reach an agreement with the union, and many also published stories on the strike. Some even gathered outside the Times's Manhattan headquarters to show their support.\n\nAt the end of the 24-hour period, the union announced that the strike was coming to a close and that no agreement had been reached.\n\n\"We are disappointed that management has not come to the bargaining table to address our members' concerns for job security and improved wages, benefits, and working conditions,\" the union said in a statement. \"We remain willing to talk with management, but we will not tolerate their continued refusal to make a deal that reflects our shared mission of quality journalism.\"\n\nThe Times management has yet to comment on the end of the strike. The union, meanwhile, has pledged to continue to fight for its demands.\n\nIt is unclear what will happen next.

{"text": "Millionaire investors are betting on double-digit declines in stocks next year, reflecting their most bearish outlook since 2008, according to the CNBC Millionaire Survey.\n\nFifty-six percent of millionaire investors surveyed expect the S&P 500 to decline by 10% in 2023. Nearly a third expect declines of more than 15%. The survey was conducted among investors with $1 million or more in investible assets.\n\nThey also expect falling equities to reduce their wealth. When asked about the biggest risk to their personal wealth over the next year, the largest number (28%) said the stock market.\n\nThe last time millionaire investors were this gloomy was during the financial crisis and Great Recession more than a decade ago.\n\n\"This is the most pessimistic we've seen this group since the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009,\" said George Walper, president of Spectrem Group, which conducts the survey with CNBC.\n\nInflation, rising rates and the potential for recession are all weighing on the minds of wealthy investors, Walper said. And while markets have already fallen this year, with the S&P 500 down about 18%, wealthy investors are forecasting even more pain ahead next year.\n\nThe bleak outlook could also put additional pressure on markets, since millionaire investors own more than 85% of individually held stocks. More than a third of millionaires expect their overall investment returns (which include bonds and other asset classes, along with stocks) to be negative next year. Most are expecting returns of less than 4%, which is low given that short-term Treasurys are now yielding over 4%.\n\nMany millionaires are holding cash and planning to stay on the sidelines, at least for the foreseeable future. Nearly half (46%) of millionaire investors have more cash in their portfolio than last year, with 17% holding \"a lot more.\"\n\nMillionaires are also bearish about the economy, with 60% expecting the economy to be \"weaker\" or \"much weaker\" at the end of 2023.\n\nThere is a large optimism gap, however, between younger and older millionaires. Eighty-one percent of millennial millionaires expect their assets to be higher at the end of next year, with nearly half (46%) expecting their assets to be up 10% or more. By contrast, most (61%) baby boomer millionaires expect their assets to be lower or \"much lower\" next year. More than half of millennial millionaires say the S&P 500 will be up 10% or more next year.\n\nWalper said millennials have grown up in a financial world of low interest rates and rising asset prices, where market sell-offs have usually been followed by quick rebounds. Older generations, he said, may remember the high-inflation, rising-rate world of the 1970s and early 1980s, when the S&P drifted lower for more than a decade.\n\n\"The millennial millionaires have never lived through a true inflationary environment,\" Walper said. \"For their entire business life, they've seen interest rates that were managed by the Fed. They've never seen rate hikes this aggressive.\"\n\nMillionaire pessimism is also affecting their views of their financial advisors. A majority say they have consulted \"very little\" or \"not at all\" with their financial advisors about how to position for inflation. Walper said approval levels for financial advisors \"have never dropped this much this quickly, at all wealth levels.\"\n\n\"They feel that their advisors are not communicating or preparing them for how to deal with it,\" Walper said. \"They're not talking to them about what all this means for their financial future.\"\n\nThe CNBC Millionaire Survey was conducted online in November. A total of 761 respondents, representing financial decision-makers in their households, qualified for the survey.

{"text": ": Here's what happened\n\nIt was a tumultuous week in the crypto world, with large-scale losses, huge sell-offs and multiple high-profile bankruptcies. What began with a relatively innocuous announcement of a few hundred million dollars in losses from a major exchange ended with almost $1 trillion in market value wiped out in just a few days.\n\nIt all began on Wednesday when Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, released a statement announcing losses of up to $250 million due to what it said was a \u201csecurity incident\u201d. The news sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, with investors suddenly beginning to question the safety of the system and the security protocols of the exchanges.\n\nThe losses from Binance did not seem to have much of an impact on the market at first, but that changed on Thursday as other exchanges started to report large losses and investors began selling off their assets. Many major cryptocurrencies lost more than 10% of their value in just a few hours, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major tokens taking the hardest hit. The losses accelerated on Friday, with the entire crypto market losing up to $500 billion in value in just 24 hours.\n\nThe market continued to slide on Saturday as investors panicked, leading to even more sell-offs and further losses. By the end of the day, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies had dropped to its lowest level since April of last year. The losses were so severe that several of the top exchanges filed for bankruptcy, including popular platforms such as Coinbase and Bittrex.\n\nThe downturn did not end there, however, as the crypto market continued to slide on Sunday and Monday. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has now fallen to less than half of its all-time high, and the losses are still continuing.\n\nThis awful week has left many investors wondering what went wrong and why the losses have been so severe. Experts have suggested a few possible explanations, including an overextended market, the panic caused by the Binance losses and the possibility of some exchanges being hacked or targeted by cybercriminals. Whatever the cause, the losses are a reminder that the cryptocurrency market is still highly volatile and subject to rapid fluctuations in value.\n\nDespite the losses, some analysts believe that this could be a temporary setback and that the crypto market will eventually recover. Many investors are still optimistic about the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and believe that the recent losses could be an opportunity to pick up assets at a discounted rate.\n\nAs the market begins to recover, experts recommend that investors take extra precautions to protect their investments. This includes using strong passwords, using two-factor authentication when possible and storing their digital assets in cold storage. It is also important for investors to pay attention to the news and look out for any signs that could indicate a potential security breach or other vulnerabilities.\n\nCryptocurrencies may have just had an awful week, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the dream is dead. With proper precautions and a willingness to learn, investors can protect their assets and still reap the rewards that the crypto world has to offer.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe strange reality of the dysfunctional, duct-taped US border policy is that a key portion was written by former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration during the pandemic, enforced under pressure by the administration of President Joe Biden and is now at the whim of the Supreme Court.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN reporters on both sides of the border with Mexico on Tuesday encountered people who have already risked their lives on thousand-mile journeys to make it into the US.\n\nThe plodding end of Title 42, as the Trump-era policy is known, has the government bracing for a surge of migrants it has long known would be coming. The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court for more time Tuesday night to prepare for the end of a policy it officially opposes.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has projected between 9,000 and 14,000 migrants could attempt crossing the Southern border each day. Read more about Title 42 from CNN\u2019s Catherine Shoichet.\n\nThe first step is admitting the problem\n\nRather than fix things over the past two years, Republican governors have engaged in a game of one-upsmanship, staging ever-more elaborate public displays to proclaim themselves the biggest champion of border security.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have seemed to refuse to acknowledge there is a crisis at the border and now the White House is scrambling at the last minute to vocalize a plan to deal with things.\n\nAll the while, businesses \u2013 from the high-tech to the labor-intensive \u2013 are in need of workers to combat a labor shortage. And people who want to come to the US legally wait in line for years.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to just \u2018fix\u2019 this\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix it immediately,\u201d Theresa Cardinal Brown told me. She is managing director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and said solutions will take time. \u201cThere\u2019s not a button to push or switch or a single policy that will suddenly quote unquote \u2018fix\u2019 what is happening.\u201d\n\nThe major problem with US border policy over the past few decades is that Congress has failed to change policy.\n\n\u201cCongress should be working on tweaking immigration on a regular basis \u2013 every few years,\u201d she said, arguing that used to occur in the \u201980s and \u201890s with tweaks to programs that responded to developments. Immigration is not a static thing. The motivations and situations of people who want to migrate change. And so do the needs of the US.\n\n\u201cThe longer they don\u2019t act and the worse the problems get, the longer it will take to right the ship, to get order back, to manage it appropriately,\u201d she said.\n\nCongress can make big things happen. But not on immigration\n\nLawmakers are quickly coming together around a $1.7 trillion spending bill with extraneous bipartisan measures thrown in.\n\nBut the bill left out a bipartisan proposal from Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, the erstwhile Arizona Democrat who\u2019s now registered as an independent, and Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, that would have given many of the 11 million undocumented people living in the US a pathway to legal status while also extending Title 42.\n\nWe know what solutions look like\n\nEvery president for a generation has tried, and failed, to enact some kind of comprehensive immigration reform. Experts argue that only a holistic approach will work and it needs to address two main problems:\n\nThe millions of undocumented people living in the US\n\nThe antiquated and broken legal immigration system, which does not appropriately acknowledge labor needs of the country and drives people to seek unlawful routes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not even a bipartisan agreement on whether there\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute\u2019s New York office, said. \u201cThat, to me, is the beginning of the dysfunction of immigration.\u201d\n\nThis week proves the dysfunction, he said, as the future of Title 42 swirled and images of migrants were plastered on TV screens.\n\n\u201cHere are clear images, clear facts, that there\u2019s a crisis, and members of Congress choose nothing to do about it,\u201d Chishti told me.\n\nImmediate problems on both sides of the border\n\nCNN\u2019s Ed Lavandera, reporting from El Paso, described soldiers from the Texas National Guard deploying fence and barbed wire in areas where migrants have been crossing. The city\u2019s Democratic mayor has declared a state of emergency and the city is looking for warehouse space to use as temporary shelter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing where the politics of border security is taking over,\u201d Lavandera told CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera Tuesday, noting the state has deployed those National Guard troops in a way that frustrates local officials, who Lavandera said want more help with food, shelter and transportation for migrants.\n\n\u201cRight now officials are saying that they are going to continue moving ahead as if Title 42 is going to be lifted tomorrow,\u201d Lavandera said on CNN Tuesday.\n\nMigrants have changed\n\nThe profile of migrants has changed in the years during which Congress did little other than throw money at border security. What used to be individual men from Mexico coming to the US to work has turned into a tide of families coming from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, risking their lives for a dangerous journey over thousands of miles.\n\nThat the immigration system is broken is not up for dispute. Whether it is fixable is a real question.\n\nJust across the border from El Paso in Ciudad Juarez, CNN\u2019s David Culver has been talking to migrants who spent weeks traveling hundreds of miles, often on foot, and are now confused as they hope for asylum in the US.\n\nHe kept in touch with migrants he met a month ago. One family found its way to Indianapolis and is waiting for a January court date. One man was driven all the way from El Paso to California and then deported into Tijuana. Another family is renting a house without a kitchen in Juarez and has tried twice to cross into the US.\n\nThe current system can\u2019t handle this\n\n\u201cThe system is already overwhelmed,\u201d Ron Vitiello, the former acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Trump administration, told Cabrera.\n\nThe end of Title 42 will mean more work for border officials, who have expelled migrants in half an hour under Title 42. When that policy is gone, it will take more than three hours per individual.\n\nVitiello said a Trump-era policy whereby people seeking asylum should wait for a hearing in Mexico or be detained should be reinstated. Anything less, he argued, is the equivalent of an open border.\n\nExtend the stopgap policy or not?\n\nThe Biden administration has a six-pillar approach to increase border resources, send additional agents to the border and crack down on unlawful entry. What the administration has not done is embrace an extension of Title 42, even as it asked the Supreme Court for more time Tuesday.\n\nRep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat whose district includes portions of the border, said on CNN the US should maintain Title 42 as an ongoing policy and create a safe zone on the southern border of Mexico with Guatemala for asylum seekers to have their cases adjudicated before they arrive.\n\n\u201cUntil we build long-term immigration infrastructure further away from the border, we will always be dealing with this issue,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\n\u201cPeople are running from poverty around the world and coming in very high numbers,\u201d he added. \u201cI think our laws are antiquated and we need to fix them and create legislation that fits modern day.\u201d\n\nSit down and talk\n\nRuben Garcia is director of Annunciation House in El Paso, an organization that serves migrants. He told Lavandera lawmakers must acknowledge the changing nature of migrants.\n\n\u201cRight now the state and federal government are fighting each other,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cOne of the reasons we are facing moments like this is because our political leadership does not sit down and work out comprehensive reform that takes into account the phenomenon of refugees.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Andrew Espaillat of New York, himself a formerly undocumented immigrant, said the US fell \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d over the past decade as countries elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere faltered.\n\n\u201cThe hemisphere is facing a crisis of democracy,\u201d he said, noting that migrants are fleeing regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, as well as violence and natural disaster. \u201cWe have to address what is going on in the hemisphere,\u201d he said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Back in the 1960s, China and Russia squandered their chance to defeat the West when they became bitter rivals during the Cold War. Today, their presidents\u2014who are expected to confer again this week\u2014are trying to correct that fateful error. The world\u2019s most powerful autocracies have joined forces for an assault on the liberal order led by the United States and its allies\u2014a threat made all too real when Russia invaded democratic Ukraine in February with Chinese support. Authoritarianism was again on the march, and the world\u2019s major democracies faced a grave challenge to their unity and resolve.\n\nAs 2022 has unfolded and the true nature of the Russia-China relationship has become more apparent, the danger it poses seems less acute. What has emerged is nothing like an axis of autocrats, but a lopsided partnership in which the terms are defined by its alpha member, Xi Jinping, primarily to serve China\u2019s interests. This tells us a lot about the foreign-policy principles of China\u2019s leaders and how those ideas may hamper Beijing\u2019s quest to reshape the world order.\n\nHistorically, relations between China and Russia have been fraught with distrust and confrontation. The two came frighteningly close to nuclear war in the late 1960s, at the height of their Cold War schism. More recently, though, Beijing and Moscow have found common cause. Economically, they are mutually beneficial trading partners, with China\u2019s industrial machine importing Russian oil, gas, coal, and other raw materials in exchange for high-tech Chinese goods.\n\nRead: China is watching Ukraine with a lot of interest\n\nXi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have also forged a close personal connection. In 2019, Xi described Putin as a \u201cbest friend.\u201d The glue of their friendship is a shared frustration with American global primacy. Each sees Washington as the main impediment to the achievement of their international ambitions. That\u2019s why alarms rang more loudly in democratic capitals when Putin visited Xi in Beijing in early February and they issued a joint statement saying that \u201cfriendship between the two States has no limits, there are no \u2018forbidden\u2019 areas of cooperation.\u201d\n\nFears rose in the U.S. and Europe that the two authoritarian states were embarking on a coordinated attack in Asia and Europe against the dominance of the West. Those fears seemed justified when, later that month, Putin launched his war against Ukraine.\n\nThe Sino-Russian partnership seemed to pay instant dividends. From Xi\u2019s perspective, Putin\u2019s invasion rolled back Western influence (or so it appeared) at little cost to China. Moscow, for its part, gained important political support from Beijing at a moment when the U.S. was aiming to isolate Russia on the world stage. Beijing has consistently blamed NATO for causing the war and supported Putin\u2019s security concerns in Europe, which China\u2019s top diplomat described earlier this year as \u201clegitimate.\u201d\n\nXi has also rebuffed calls to use his influence with Putin to help end the war or mediate between the Russian leader and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Although Xi told President Joe Biden in their November meeting that he was \u201chighly concerned\u201d about the Ukraine crisis, he also appeared to wash his hands of any responsibility to play a more active role in reaching a settlement. The official Chinese readout of the conversation stated that Beijing will encourage peace talks but looked forward to a dialogue between the U.S., NATO, and Russia.\n\nBeijing\u2019s diplomatic backing of Moscow\u2019s position on Ukraine, as well as of Russia\u2019s role in the world as a major power, has been of significant value to Putin. So has China\u2019s more tangible assistance. As Russia\u2019s financial and business ties to the West crumble under the weight of sanctions, trade with China has replaced some of the lost income. Total trade between China and Russia surged by nearly a third, to $172 billion so far this year. (By contrast, Russia\u2019s trade with the U.S. plunged by about half, according to the latest available data.)\n\n\u201cFor Russia, the key task for now is to generate enough revenue stream to pump money into the war machine, the budget, to feed all of the people who carry guns and support domestic security,\u201d Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, told me. \u201cAs the relationship between Russia and the West is being destroyed by both sides \u2026 the key revenue flows \u2026 are turning to the East, and China is the major player.\u201d\n\nAlexander Gabuev: Putin\u2019s Doomsday scenario\n\nAside from the Ukraine war, and whatever its outcome, the China-Russia relationship is likely to deepen. Xi and Putin share a strong interest in reducing their economic reliance on the U.S. and its European and Asian partners, and both have a clear incentive to expand trade and investment between their economies. In a recent paper in the Naval War College Review, the scholars Andrew Erickson and Gabriel Collins foresee the potential for greater military cooperation between Russia and China as well. Moscow could enhance China\u2019s naval capabilities by giving its fleet access to Russian ports in the Far East and by sharing technology, especially for undersea warfare. \u201cRussian military pinnacle technologies,\u201d they wrote, \u201ccould be coupled with China\u2019s financial resources and industry to tip the Indo-Pacific security balance in favor of a Sino-Russian axis of autocracy at the expense of the United States and its allies and partners.\u201d\n\nStill, the events of the past year have shown that the \u201cno limits\u201d relationship does, in fact, have its limits. Beijing has not provided material support for Putin\u2019s war effort, nor helped his government and banks evade the tough sanctions imposed by the West after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Self-interest is certainly at work here. In a March conversation, Biden warned Xi that China would face \u201cconsequences\u201d if the Chinese leader directly aided Russia. That would likely entail sanctions on China\u2014which the country, still heavily dependent on American and European trade, technology, and investment, can ill afford. And although Xi has backed Putin\u2019s security concerns in Europe, he has shown some discomfort with Putin\u2019s war. In their November meeting, Biden and Xi jointly criticized the Russian leader\u2019s threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, according to Washington\u2019s summary of the conversation.\n\nSome analysts have interpreted a degree of waffling by Xi in that encounter as a signal that he is having second thoughts about his bet on Russia. Revealingly, perhaps, the bit about nukes was omitted from the account of the meeting released by China\u2019s foreign ministry. But Chinese-Russian ties continue to develop. The same day that Zelensky was in Washington addressing Congress, Xi hosted former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Beijing.\n\nMost likely, Xi\u2019s diplomatic two-step is an indication of Beijing\u2019s continuing attempts to play all sides. In that sense, it\u2019s typical Chinese foreign policy. Beijing eschews the sort of commitments Washington has made to its close allies. China\u2019s leaders prefer to maintain their own freedom of action, both at home and abroad, unfettered by promises made to other countries. Xi has enshrined this practice into his chief diplomatic program, the Global Security Initiative, a framework for reshaping the global order. Outlining its tenets, Xi declared that countries should \u201csay no to group politics and bloc confrontation.\u201d Attempts to form \u201csmall circles,\u201d he said, are \u201cdoomed to fail.\u201d\n\nThat means China will resist the formation of a new, authoritarian bloc with Russia (or any other countries) like the old Communist bloc that the Soviet Union once formed. Beijing\u2019s commitment to such ideas suggests that it will never forge a true alliance with Russia that would require China\u2019s leaders to coordinate policy more closely or that would bind them to mutual defense. Despite its current troubles, the Russian leadership may prefer it that way. Moscow may be wary of becoming too tied to\u2014and too dependent on\u2014China as well. The relationship between Xi and Putin is not equal. The Ukraine war has exposed Russia as a declining power, and its isolation from the West has left Putin little choice but to turn to Beijing. Xi is taking advantage.\n\nDamir Marusic: Taiwan faces its Ukraine moment\n\nFor instance, China has been purchasing Russian oil at steep discounts. With access to dollar transactions curtailed by U.S. sanctions, Russian businesses are turning instead to the Chinese yuan, advancing Beijing\u2019s longtime goal of promoting its currency as a rival to the greenback. The relationship is \u201cmore beneficial to China than for Russia,\u201d Gabuev told me. \u201cThe asymmetry that was built into this relationship even before the war has been galvanized by the war.\u201d\n\nThe stronger China becomes, the greater that imbalance grows, and the more Beijing may prod Moscow to align its interests with China\u2019s\u2014and the more nervous Russian leaders may become. \u201cA Russia whose motives for aggressive military action in Europe likely include regaining the fear-based \u2018respect\u2019 accorded the Soviet Union in the past may tire of being viewed\u2014and perhaps treated\u2014as a vassal of China,\u201d Erickson and Collins wrote. \u201cPopular resentment at national subservience may prompt Putin or his ultimate successor to reset relations symbolically, and even substantively, away from Beijing\u2019s preferences.\u201d\n\nThe dynamics of Xi\u2019s relations with Russia tell us that China isn\u2019t a very good friend, and this will surely have consequences for Beijing\u2019s quest for greater global influence. The U.S. has extended and entrenched its power through a network of close alliances and defense arrangements with nations that share values and foreign-policy objectives. China will do nothing of the sort. Beijing will more likely operate through bilateral ties, loose international groups (such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization), and initiatives it can control (such as its Belt and Road development program). It will engage with other countries only so far as such arrangements directly benefit it, as the partnership with Russia shows.\n\nThe question is whether such a strategy is sufficient for Beijing to achieve its foreign-policy ambitions. The U.S. certainly pursues its national priorities in its foreign affairs, sometimes ruthlessly, but it has also been willing to make sacrifices to promote its agenda\u2014by, for instance, absorbing the costs of other countries\u2019 defense. China has not always shunned such a practice. In historical periods when China was the unrivaled power in East Asia, the emperors of imperial dynasties often spent heavily on gifts and assistance for foreign states and dignitaries from the region. The display of generosity was designed to uphold the dynasties\u2019 diplomatic system. Today\u2019s Chinese leaders, however, seem much less willing to sacrifice wealth or make concessions in order to realize greater goals. Other countries, including Russia, may choose to respond in kind, limiting Beijing\u2019s ability to exert its influence in a global struggle with the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAll the same, the China-Russia relationship could remain dangerous to the U.S. and democracy more broadly. Whatever differences or points of distrust they may have, Beijing and Moscow still share an objective of altering the world order, and they will continue to pursue that, within the constraints of their relations. \u201cThis is not an alliance,\u201d Yun Sun, a director of the China program at the Stimson Center, told me. \u201cPartners is a much-qualified word in terms of what each side will do for the other.\u201d But Chinese leaders, she went on, \u201cdo see Russia as a useful partner\u2014or useful instrument\u2014in confronting the United States. That has not changed, and that is not going to change.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\nShares in Constellation Brands, the world\u2019s largest beer producer, plunged on Monday after the company warned that rising costs were forcing it to trim its beer supply chain.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, the company said that it was taking action to reduce its inventory levels due to higher prices. The company, which brews popular brands including Corona and Pacifico, said that it would be reducing its capacity by nearly 20% in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.\n\nThe news sent the stock down more than 5%, the biggest decline in more than a year, to $206.36.\n\nConstellation said that its move to reduce its inventory was in response to a confluence of factors, including higher raw material costs, higher labor costs, rising transportation costs and tariffs.\n\nThe company said that it was confident that its strategic investments in new product lines and its brands would help to offset the effects of higher costs.\n\nThe news comes as the beer industry faces increasing competition from new products and a growing number of craft brewers. Constellation is also facing rising pressure from retail giants such as Walmart and Amazon, which have been expanding their beer selection in recent years.\n\nThe company is trying to adapt to the changing landscape by making strategic investments in its core brands, as well as in emerging markets such as marijuana-infused drinks, which it views as a potential growth area.\n\nConstellation also said that it had taken \u201ctactical action\u201d to protect margins, which included the sale of non-strategic assets, cost reductions and pricing initiatives.\n\nThe company said that it expected to achieve cost savings of $400 million in fiscal 2020 and $700 million in fiscal 2021.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s efforts to control costs, analysts say that it could still be difficult for Constellation to remain competitive.\n\n\u201cThe issue they\u2019re having is that they\u2019re already behind the curve when it comes to emerging trends and new technology,\u201d said Josh Luber, CEO of StockX, a stock market platform. \u201cThey\u2019re having to play catch-up, and it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nAnalysts also say that Constellation could face difficulty as tariffs begin to bite into the company\u2019s profits. The company has said that its tariffs on imported beer and wine are now estimated at $200 million to $220 million in fiscal 2020, up from $40 million in fiscal 2019.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs are a double-edged sword for Constellation,\u201d said Luber. \u201cOn the one hand, it increases prices for consumers, but it also makes it more expensive for them to source the raw materials for their beer.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say that the company\u2019s efforts to control costs will be key to its future success.\n\n\u201cConstellation needs to be very aggressive in controlling costs while also investing in new product lines and building out new markets,\u201d said John Buckingham, chief investment officer at The Prudent Investor. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult balancing act, but it\u2019s one that they need to get right if they want to remain competitive.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

And one former manager at a Morphe store told Insider that employees there were laid off days before the location closed.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Insider, a representative for FORMA Brands \u2014 the company that owns Morphe \u2014 confirmed that some US locations are closing, but did not share the number of stores. The statement cited \"the broader beauty landscape throughout the last year\" as the reason for the closures.\n\n\"Decisions that impact our people are incredibly difficult and we extend our deepest gratitude to the dedicated Morphe store team members at the closing stores for delivering outstanding beauty experiences to countless consumers over the years,\" the statement said.\n\nWhile the Morphe representative did not explain what broader industry headwinds the brand was facing, The New York Times reported in 2022 that the retailer had fallen from grace with Gen Z for its relationship with controversial influencers like Jeffree Star and James Charles and a shifting cultural interest in skin care over makeup.\n\nA Morphe store in New Jersey. Amanda Krause/Insider\n\nOn TikTok, some are calling for justice for Morphe retail employees\n\nAs of Tuesday, there are 19 videos with the hashtag \"#justiceformorpheretailemployees\" that have more than 3.6 million views collectively on TikTok.\n\nIn one video posted on Friday, makeup artist Sydney Kayla, who said she works at an Arizona location, claimed that she arrived for her shift only to find an empty store. Insider could not verify Kayla's employment at the retailer, and she did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"A day in the life of a Morphe makeup artist: So when I walked into my store this morning, it was completely empty \u2014 absolutely nothing except for foundations,\" Kayla said in her video, which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times as of Tuesday.\n\nKayla also said she and other employees had \"not received answers\" as to whether or not their store would be closing.\n\nA former manager said she and her team lost their jobs when the store closed \u2014 and were only given a few days warning\n\nFormer Morphe employee Dani Garza \u2014 whose employment has been verified by Insider \u2014 said she worked at a location in Austin, Texas, since August 2021, and made her way from assistant manager to store manager during her time at the company.\n\nOn December 22, she said, she and her team were told via Zoom that their last day of work would be December 26 when the store closed.\n\n\"It completely shook us and honestly ruined all of our holidays,\" Garza said. \"None of us felt good because we knew that after Christmas, we just didn't have jobs.\"\n\nShe's been documenting her experience on TikTok since, and her seven videos about Morphe have received just under one million views total as of Tuesday.\n\nOther Morphe employees have made meme videos to announce they were being laid off, and some have used TikTok to encourage kindness towards employees during this time.\n\nOther TikTokers claiming to have worked for Morphe say they noticed stores quietly closing over the past year.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Morphe's website says there are 27 stores across the country. However, some locations appear to have been removed upon closing; Insider's search for the store in Austin, where Garza said she worked, doesn't appear on the website. When asked by Insider about this store in particular, the representative for FORMA Brands did not comment though their statement, cited above, acknowledged that some Morphe locations were closing.\n\nMorphe has been selling its inventory at steep discounts, the former manager says\n\nSpeaking to Insider, Garza noted that Morphe had been offering major sales since she started working at the store, with consistent increases in discounts over time. Holidays sales at Morphe this year, for example, started in October, she said.\n\nBut as Garza says she learned from a colleague, discounts at Morphe weren't the norm prior to the pandemic. The lack of inventory was also concerning, she said. Garza's store would usually receive shipments every week or two weeks depending on the season, she said, but in December 2022 she noticed that the shipments had stopped coming.\n\n\"I had actually called my district manager freaking out about it because we were completely out of eye-shadow palettes, which is what Morphe is known for,\" Garza said. \"We were out of brush sets \u2014 which are a very giftable item \u2014 while we're in the holiday season.\"\n\nThough Garza said she was reassured by her district manager that a shipment was on the way, she said she learned the following day that she'd be without a job that same week.\n\n\"Prior to this, I would have said Morphe was the best company that I've worked for,\" Garza said, noting that she loved the company culture and her colleagues. \"I don't know what the future is, but it doesn't look good.\"\n\nAre you a current or former Morphe employee?

{"text": "Yellowstone has always been a series interested in, if not outright obsessed with, legacy. That of the Yellowstone Ranch, upon which the fictional Dutton family has lived since the late 1800s, is foremost in the mind of patriarch John Dutton III, played by Kevin Costner with the gruff bluster of a cowboy past his prime. He often seems more interested in the well-being of this land than that of his own children\u2014or, perhaps, it\u2019s simply that he has an easier time understanding what it needs to thrive. But if the ever-expanding Yellowstone Cinematic Universe has anything resonant to say about legacy, it\u2019s that the land\u2019s legacy is determined by the people who care for it, and that means the Dutton lineage\u2014the fathers and sons of this century-spanning epic\u2014matters as much as the borders of their property.\n\nAnd so we turn to 1883 and 1923, creator Taylor Sheridan\u2019s Yellowstone prequel spin-offs, which chronicle the upper tiers of the family tree as they branch down to John Dutton III and his four(ish) children. 1883, which concluded its first season in February 2022, featured Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as the central Duttons, who claim the infamous patch of Montana wild known as the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch after the tragic death of their daughter, Elsa. The story picks back up in 1923\u2014set to drop its first episode December 18\u2014with Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as this chapter\u2019s key Duttons. Ford\u2019s Jacob Dutton, brother to McGraw\u2019s James Dutton, is tasked with caring for his brother\u2019s home and family, a challenge complicated by the expected 20th-century problems: disease, drought, the Great Depression, post-war fallout, and \u201cthe violence that has always haunted this family,\u201d as the 1923 teaser trailer reveals. That last line in particular is intriguing, given the ways in which the Yellowstone universe concerns itself with the romanticism of tradition, the nobility of the past\u2014though only certain portions of it\u2014and the passing-down of intergenerational trauma. (A trauma that will, inevitably, impact the land.)\n\nSo, to understand this \u201chaunted\u201d family best, it\u2019s essential to parse its origins. Below, a closer look through the knots of the Dutton family tree. Spoilers ahead if you haven\u2019t watched Yellowstone, 1883, or 1923.\n\nParamount Network/Paramount+/Getty Images/Leah Romero\n\nJames Dutton\n\nOne of the leads of 1883, James Dutton (Tim McGraw) was the original patriarch of the Dutton family, and the first to claim the family\u2019s home in Montana. Originally a farmer from Tennessee, he traveled west with his wife and children after fighting as a Confederate soldier in the Civil War. He intended to journey further beyond Montana, but settled there after the death of his daughter, Elsa.\n\nMargaret Dutton\n\nA nurse for the Confederate Army, Margaret (Faith Hill) farmed beside her husband, James, in Tennessee before the family headed northwest for new territory. She and James had three children in total: Elsa, John, and Spencer.\n\nJacob Dutton\n\nBrother to James, Jacob Dutton (Harrison Ford) took over caring for the Yellowstone homestead in the early 1900s. He is the leading man in 1923.\n\nCara Dutton\n\nPlayed by Helen Mirren in 1923, Cara Dutton is the wife of Jacob and matriarch of the Dutton family following Margaret\u2019s death.\n\nClaire Dutton\n\nSister to James and Jacob, 1883\u2019s Claire Dutton (Dawn Olivieri) was a recent widow who traveled in search of a new home with her brother\u2019s family and her daughter, Mary Abel. But after Mary Abel was killed by a gang outside of Fort Worth, Texas, Claire\u2014who had lost her husband and all seven of her children\u2014died by suicide at Mary Abel\u2019s grave.\n\nMary Abel\n\nDaughter of Claire Dutton and niece to James, Jacob, Margaret, and Cara, 1883\u2019s Mary Abel (Emma Malouff) died on the road west when a gang attacked the family\u2019s camp in Texas.\n\nElsa Dutton\n\nThe eldest child of James and Margaret Dutton, Elsa (Isabel May) served as the narrator of 1883 before her death in season 1\u2019s final episode. Traveling west at the age of 17 with her parents and younger brother, John, Elsa fell in love twice on the road\u2014first with cowboy Ennis, who was killed by bandits, and then with Comanche warrior Sam, to whom she promised she\u2019d return after her family found their homestead out west. But she was never able to make it back to her love, as she was shot and killed before they could be reunited. In her honor, James and Margaret founded the Dutton family homestead at the site of her grave.\n\nJohn Dutton I\n\nThe oldest son of James and Margaret Dutton, John Dutton I appears in 1883 as a child and in 1923 as an adult, played by James Badge Dale. He worked the Yellowstone land alongside his uncle, Jacob, and had his own family with wife Emma and son Jack. Although 1923 has yet to reveal this, it is presumed John Dutton I is also the father of John Dutton II, who in turn fathers John Dutton III.\n\nSpencer Dutton\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t meet him in 1883, we learn in 1923 that James and Margaret had a third child, Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar), who was born after the family settled in Montana. A veteran of World War I, he\u2019s a main character in 1923.\n\nEmma Dutton\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Emma Dutton (Marley Shelton) just yet, but she\u2019s the wife of John Dutton I and mother to Jack Dutton in 1923. Presumably, she is also the mother of John Dutton II.\n\nJack Dutton\n\nThe eldest son of John Dutton I and Emma Dutton, Jack Dutton (Darren Mann) works with his father and great-uncle to tend to the Yellowstone land during 1923. He\u2019s expected to fall in love with the beauty Elizabeth, and\u2014presumably\u2014marry her. It\u2019s also possible, given that \u201cJack\u201d is a common nickname for \u201cJohn,\u201d that Jack Dutton is actually John Dutton II. But neither 1923 nor Yellowstone has confirmed this theory just yet.\n\nElizabeth Strafford (probably, eventually Elizabeth Dutton)\n\nSet up as a love interest in 1923, the lovely Elizabeth Strafford (Michelle Randolph) will likely become the life partner and wife of Jack Dutton.\n\nJohn Dutton II\n\nPresumably the son of John Dutton I and Emma Dutton, John Dutton II is not guaranteed to appear in 1923, though he appears as an old man in flashback episodes of Yellowstone. He was once the Dutton family patriarch, and is the father of Costner\u2019s John Dutton III.\n\nJohn Dutton III\n\nThe current owner of the massive Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, Costner\u2019s John Dutton III is an uncompromising traditionalist, a rugged cowboy, a survivor of multiple near-death experiences, and the governor of Montana. He yearns for nothing more than the continuation of his family\u2019s land in the exact state it was bequeathed to him.\n\nPeter Dutton\n\nIn Yellowstone season 5, John Dutton III reveals to his daughter-in-law, Monica, that he had a brother named Peter, who died only 18 hours after being born.\n\nEvelyn Dutton\n\nOnce the wife and true love of John Dutton III, Evelyn Dutton (Gretchen Mol) died when her four children\u2014Lee, Beth, Kayce, and Jamie\u2014were still young. A horseback riding incident resulted in her being crushed, an accident for which Beth still blames herself.\n\nLee Dutton\n\nThe eldest child of John Dutton III and Evelyn Dutton, Lee (Dave Annable) was always meant to carry on the Dutton ranch\u2019s legacy, but he died in the first season of Yellowstone after a battle over stolen cattle.\n\nBeth Dutton\n\nJohn Dutton III and Evelyn\u2019s only daughter, Beth (Kelly Reilly) is the signature spitfire of the family, a pure force of nature with the cutting stares and ragged bangs to prove it. The only people for whom she\u2019ll acquiesce\u2014if only barely\u2014are her father and her husband, the cowboy Rip Wheeler.\n\nRip Wheeler\n\nA cowboy through and through, Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser) first arrived on the Yellowstone Ranch as a traumatized teenager, where he met and slowly fell in love with his boss\u2019s daughter. To this day, he is John Dutton III\u2019s most trusted man.\n\nKayce Dutton\n\nForever untethered within the Dutton family and at one point estranged from his father, Kayce (Luke Grimes) is the youngest of the Dutton brood but the first to have his own family. He married Monica Long of the Broken Rock Reservation, and together they had Tate Dutton, whom John Dutton III eventually grows close with as Kayce\u2019s wariness subsides.\n\nJamie Dutton\n\nDesperate to please and easily manipulated, Jamie (Wes Bentley) is an attorney and the adopted son of John Dutton III and Evelyn Dutton, whom John later disinherits when things get a little\u2014ahem\u2014dicey between them. Jamie\u2019s biological father was Garrett Randall, who killed Jamie\u2019s mother when Jamie was just a baby. Jamie himself kills Garrett when things get dicey between them. Gotta love family!\n\nChristina\n\nOnce an employee of Jamie\u2019s during his campaign for state attorney general, Christina (Katherine Cunningham) became briefly romantically linked with Jamie and fathered his child. As of season 5, they seem to no longer be together.\n\nUnknown Dutton\n\nJamie and Christina had a baby boy together, and though we know he\u2019s named after his father, it\u2019s unclear if his name is Jamie or James.\n\nMonica Long\n\nRaised on the nearby Broken Rock Reservation, the loyal and intelligent Monica Long Dutton (Kelsey Asbille) is naturally suspicious of the Dutton family\u2019s intentions, though she has grown fonder of them as her son grows up and her husband, Kayce, falls back within his father\u2019s grasp. She has worked as a teacher both on and off the reservation.\n\nTate Dutton\n\nThe only surviving child of Kayce and Monica, Tate Dutton (Brecken Merrill) is an adventurous boy who\u2014like his father and grandfather\u2014has been through hell more than once. But as one of the few Dutton descendants who seems to appreciate the land as much as his forebears, it seems possible, if not likely, that the ranch will eventually fall to his care. If Yellowstone goes down that route, it would invite some welcome nuance for the series to explore, as the mixed-race son of a cowboy and a Native American re-inherits the land once taken from his ancestors.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Infants are known to be precious and usually welcomed into the world with love and joy. But, a newborn baby in Florida recently left hospital staff in shock and awe when they discovered a rare and astonishing sight while they looked inside his mouth.\n\nWhen a newborn baby boy was born at Tampa General Hospital, the team of doctors and nurses, who had been keeping a close eye on him, were in \u2018disbelief\u2019 when they peered inside his mouth. To their surprise, two perfectly formed teeth were sitting there.\n\n\"It's very rare,\" pediatrician Anthony Silver, who works in the hospital\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit, said in an interview with local news station WFTS-TV.\n\nThe baby, named Remington, is part of a rare group of newborns who develop their teeth during the last stage of their pregnancy. It's such a rare phenomenon that Silver said it only occurs in about one out of every 2,000 to 3,000 newborns. \n\nThe extraordinary sight has caused quite a stir around Tampa General Hospital, as staff members don't see many cases like this. Silver said that his coworkers \u2018flipped out\u2019 when they saw the teeth in the baby's mouth. \n\n\"We just couldn't believe it,\" Silver said. \u201cI've been a pediatrician here for 12 years, and I've never seen a newborn with teeth like this.\u201d\n\nSilver added that, while the teeth initially caused a lot of excitement among the staff, they were also concerned. When a baby is born with teeth, there is a possibility that they could become loose and cause harm to their new mother as they nurse. \n\nTo determine whether this could be the case with Remington, the hospital staff put the baby through a number of tests and evaluations. Thankfully, the results came back normal and it was determined that Remington was healthy and that there would be no issues associated with him having teeth. \n\nThis was a great relief for Remington\u2019s parents, who had been worried about the implications of their newborn having teeth. \n\n\u201cWe were scared, at first,\u201d Remington\u2019s mother, Ali Wilkes, told WFTS-TV. \u201cWhen the doctors told us there would be no problems, we were so relieved.\u201d\n\nThough the cause of Remington\u2019s teeth is unknown, Silver said that he could have inherited it genetically or it could simply be a \u2018freak of nature\u2019. What\u2019s certain is that Remington has now become something of a legend at the hospital. \n\n\"We've had a lot of babies come through here over the years and we've never seen anything like this,\" Silver said. \u201cHe's definitely a one-in-a-million baby.\u201d \n\nRemington has now been discharged and is going home with his parents. He will be kept under close observation, as his parents and doctors monitor the situation to make sure that his teeth don\u2019t cause any problems. \n\nFor now, everyone involved can take comfort in the fact that Remington is healthy, safe and happy. He may not be your typical newborn, but his parents wouldn't have it any other way. \n\n\u201cWe are just so glad he is okay and we can\u2019t wait to take him home,\u201d Wilkes said. \u201cHe\u2019s already a little celebrity.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Bears have officially reached rock bottom.\n\nAfter yesterday's demoralizing 35-20 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Bears have dropped their ninth consecutive game, which marks the longest losing streak in the franchises' 95-year history.\n\nThis nine-game slide is the longest losing streak of any team in the NFL this season, and it is a far cry from the 3-1 start the Bears enjoyed earlier this year.\n\nThe Bears' struggles during this long slump have been many. Offensively, the team has been one of the worst in the league, ranking 30th in total offense and points scored. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky has regressed from his promising start to the season, turning in uninspired performances every week. His erratic decision-making and poor accuracy have been highlighted, leading to calls for the team to move on from Trubisky in the offseason.\n\nDefensively, the Bears have also been far below their normal standard. While the team still ranks among the top 10 in total defense, they have been constantly gashed by the run game, giving up an average of 145 yards on the ground to their opponents. The inability to get off the field on third down has also been a significant issue, with the Bears giving up conversions at an alarming rate of 45%.\n\nAt this point in the season, all that is left is for the Bears to salvage what's left of their season by getting a win in their last game against the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears could play the role of spoiler by preventing the Vikings from locking up the NFC North Division title.\n\nBut even if the Bears are able to find a win in their final game of the season, it won't change the fact that the team has entered an unprecedented slump with no end in sight. And with a number of questions surrounding the franchise heading into next season, the Bears' offseason could be a long and bumpy one.\n\nThe next few months will be key for the Bears as they seek to turn things around and set a new course for the future. It is clear that the franchise needs to make some changes in order to get back on the path to success, and the upcoming months will be critical in finding the right direction.\n\nBut for now, the Bears have to focus on the present. With their current skid, they have officially entered uncharted territory, and only time will tell if the team can turn things around and bounce back from this unfortunate low point in franchise history.", "label": "machine"}

With only two weeks left in the regular season, the race is heating up as teams jockey for position and fight for a spot in the playoffs.\n\nFor the AFC, the top two seeds have been secured by the Kansas City Chiefs and Pittsburgh Steelers. The Buffalo Bills, who clinched the third seed earlier in the season, still have a chance to move up to the second seed with a win over the Miami Dolphins in Week 18. \n\nThe Titans, Ravens and Colts all still have a shot at the fourth seed, with the Ravens leading the way due to their divisional tiebreaker over the Titans and Colts. The Titans, who are set to face the Texans in Week 18, will need to win and have the Colts lose to the Jaguars to secure a playoff berth. \n\nIn the Wild Card race, the Browns and Dolphins are in the driver's seat. The Browns need only a win over the Jets or a Dolphins loss in Week 18 to secure their first playoff berth since 2002. \n\nThe Dolphins, meanwhile, are on the cusp of their first playoff appearance since 2008. They will need to win in Week 18 and have the Ravens, Colts and Titans all lose to punch their ticket to the postseason. \n\nIn the NFC, the Saints, Packers, Seahawks and Washington Football Team have all secured playoff berths. The Rams and Cardinals are in prime position to take the final two Wild Card spots, as both teams are in the driver's seat with a win or loss in Week 18. \n\nThe Buccaneers still have an outside chance at a playoff berth if they can manage to win in Week 18 and have the Rams and Cardinals both lose. However, with the Rams and Cardinals playing against the Jets and 49ers, respectively, it is an unlikely scenario. \n\nThe Bears and Vikings still have a glimmer of hope at a Wild Card spot, but both teams will need to win in Week 18 and have the Rams, Cardinals, Buccaneers and Dolphins all lose to clinch a playoff berth. \n\nAt this point in the season, it is anyone's guess as to who will make the playoffs and who will miss out.

Qazi-Lampert, teacher, Northside College Prep, CTU Climate Justice Committee\n\nTrump\u2019s tax returns about ethics\n\nJacob Sullum\u2019s column on Trump\u2019s tax returns was well-reasoned and clearly written. However, he misses the larger point about the high calling of public service. The \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d he and Republicans keep harping on is not the demand for documents by a legislative branch legally empowered for oversight of the executive. The real danger, the worrisome precedent, is Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to release his taxes, when all presidents of the modern era have done so.\n\nWhile tax law and statutes can be confusing and labyrinthine, ethics are not. They are fundamentally transparent and absolutely essential to the functioning of a healthy and vigorous democracy. While the right to privacy is a time-honored American value, citizens have a right to know the reality of a candidate for public office, not just the spin of a campaign apparatus. Candidates and office holders should understand and agree that the need for financial transparency is, and should be, higher in governmental service than in private commerce.\n\nCitizens have a right to know if someone in public office, with its attendant power and prestige, has troubling private and/or public entanglements that could compromise his/her decisions in office. We need to know who \u201cbutters the bread,\u201d or, conversely, who may be able to pressure, deal or extort for lucrative contracts or favors. \u201cA legitimate legislative purpose\u201d is overseeing the functioning and, yes, ethics of the executive branch. And a legitimate and compelling reason for presidents and members of Congress to be forthright with their financial records is the need for rigorous ethics in government.\n\nThe desire to enrich oneself is normal in a capitalistic system. That desire, when brought into government, turns too easily into corruption and abuse of power. A very slippery slope. Secrecy and hidden money agendas do not fit democracy\u2019s need for light and transparency.\n\nYes, privacy should be protected. But ethics? Even more so.

{"text": "The S & P 500 broke above its 200-day moving average Wednesday for the first time since April and, perhaps more importantly, is on the verge of breaking a downtrend that's been in place all year. The benchmark is now 14% above its 2022 closing low of 3,577, reached on Oct 12. Unfortunately, Wall Street strategists do not share the exuberance of investors. JPMorgan has become the latest to lower its 2023 earnings forecast. \"Fundamentals will likely deteriorate as financial conditions continue to tighten and monetary policy turns even more restrictive ... while the economy enters a mild recession with the labor market contracting and unemployment rate rising to ~5%,\" JPMorgan said in a note to clients today. The bank slashed its 2023 earnings forecast almost 9%, to $205 from $225 (far below the analyst consensus of $231), \"on weaker demand and pricing power, further margin compression, and lower buyback activity.\" This is part of a disturbing trend in the last few weeks: strategists, who tend to look at the macro environment, are looking around at 2023 and do not like what they see. Analysts, who are mostly focused on individual companies and sectors and who tend to move much more slowly than strategists, are still relatively optimistic we can eke out small earnings gains in 2023. The gulf between the strategists is wide and getting wider. 2023 S & P 500 earnings: who's right? Analyst consensus: $231 (up 4.9% YOY) Goldman Sachs: $224 Barclays: $207 JPMorgan: $205 BofA: $200 RBC: $199 With stock prices rising and earnings estimates declining, we are now witnessing a dangerous expansion in the 2023 multiple (P/E ratio). How wide? It depends on where you think estimates will land. $231 (current consensus): 17.6 P/E $220 (2022 est.) 18.5 $200 20.4 Just as a reminder, 17 times forward earnings is the historic average. At an optimistic valuation of $231, we are already that now. To justify multiples toward 20 for any length of time, investors must believe that the economy is expanding and earnings prospects are improving. But we are going in the opposite direction. That sets up for a dangerous showdown, as JPMorgan noted this morning. In the first half of 2023, \"We expect [the] S & P 500 to re-test this year's lows as the Fed overtightens into weaker fundamentals,\" the strategists said in their note. Ultimately, that will force the Fed to pivot in the middle of the year: \"This sell-off combined with disinflation, rising unemployment, and declining corporate sentiment should be enough for the Fed to start signaling a pivot, subsequently driving an asset recovery, and pushing [the] S & P 500 to 4,200 by year-end 2023.\" \"Upside and downside to our base case will largely depend on the depth and length of the recession and the speed of the Fed's counter-response.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Canadian trivia buff Ray Lalonde's winning streak on 'Jeopardy!' came to an end on Thursday night. After taking home first place in the game show's Tournament of Champions, Lalonde was finally bested in a show that featured some of the toughest competition he has faced in his eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe competition was fierce for Lalonde, who faced off against Eliza de Martin of England, who competed in the show's 2017 Teachers Tournament, and Stacy Kraft from Ohio, who was a wild card contestant in the Tournament of Champions. All three competitors had the same opening number of $400 and began answering clues in the categories of \u201cVampires,\u201d \u201cIn the Kitchen,\u201d and \u201cHighway History.\u201d\n\nWith the game progressing quickly and the score even, Lalonde made what would be his fatal error when he incorrectly answered a $1,000 clue in the category \u201cHighway History.\u201d That mistake opened up a lead for Kraft, and while Lalonde kept the game close, he could not quite overcome the deficit.\n\nKraft ultimately finished with a total of $11,400, while de Martin placed second with $7,000 and Lalonde finished third with $5,200. Despite the loss, Lalonde still earned $25,000 for his impressive performance in the tournament.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough game but I\u2019m glad I made it as far as I did,\u201d Lalonde said after the show. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to come in first place, but it was a good run and I\u2019m proud of myself.\u201d\n\nThe Toronto-based competitor's winning streak started on November 15 and lasted through four weeks of competition. During his streak, Lalonde won several categories including \u201cTV Theme Songs,\u201d \u201cWorld Leaders,\u201d \u201cAncient History,\u201d and \u201cThe 20th Century.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his on-air success, Lalonde also made a name for himself in the fandom community. He was often seen wearing a distinctive jacket featuring a map of Canada and earned numerous nicknames such as \u201cThe Canadian\u201d and \u201cThe Great White North.\u201d\n\nAfter his loss, Lalonde received a standing ovation from the studio audience and high praises from host Alex Trebek.\n\n\u201cRay has been an absolute delight to have in our tournaments, and he set a great example of true sportsmanship throughout the competition,\u201d Trebek said. \u201cHis success is something to be admired.\u201d\n\nLalonde said he plans to use his prize money to pay off his student loans and to donate to charity. He also hopes to use his newfound fame to spread a positive message to his fellow Canadians.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that this success can be seen as a reminder to Canadians everywhere to take risks,\u201d Lalonde said. \u201cLife is full of ups and downs, and it\u2019s important to not give up.\u201d\n\nThe contestants who finished first and second in the show will receive an additional $50,000 and $25,000, respectively. The tournament will continue to air each week as the remaining competitors battle it out for the top prize.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "I\u2019ve been writing about V-Commandos on this website for over five years now. The WW2 tactics game, and its multiple expansions, are some of the best expressions of stealth in all of board gaming, and for those five years it has remained one of my most-played co-op experiences.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, though, it\u2019s time for some changes. For one, the game is no longer called V-Commandos. Legal wrangling with the owners of the Commandos series of video games has made sure of that. The game, and its expansions, are now known as V-Sabotage.\n\nMore importantly, 2022 is also the year the game finally got a much-deserved glow-up. See, for all the joys to be found in playing the game\u2014and I really cannot stress enough how good it is\u2014its presentation was always a little basic, with simple art and tokens that were functional, but also a bit drab, and hard to make out from across the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, thanks to some upgrade packs, the game has a ton of excellent plastic miniatures representing each character, enemy, and even select pieces of equipment, in exquisite detail. It also has new player cards, featuring new art that gives each of the game\u2019s heroes a stylistic refresh.\n\nHaving finally taken these miniature upgrades for a spin last week, one of my main takeaways is that this doesn\u2019t change how the game plays one bit. What it does do is make a huge improvement to the overall experience, as well as your quality- of- life while taking on a mission. Aside from looking fantastic, having each player and enemy (and alarm, door, machine gun nest, remote-control tank and barrel of poison gas) represented in 3D makes scanning the table and planning strategies much easier. P reviously, you\u2019d have to scan the whole thing repeatedly just to remember what was where. It also got easy to miss certain things on bigger missions when everything, from humans to items, was represented by a flat little cardboard token.\n\n\n\nAlso as anyone who has been around Kickstarter for the last five years will know, plastic miniatures are just more fun to use. Whether it\u2019s because it harks back to our childhoods, or because they\u2019re tangible, scaled, realistic versions of the things we\u2019re supposed to be actually using in the game (or both!), it is usually better to be playing a game with miniatures than without.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe negative consequences of this love for miniatures on game design, production and shipping costs is another story for another time, of course, though some of those impacts can still be felt here; the miniature expansion for the core game costs more than the core game itself, and if you\u2019ve got or want V-Sabotage\u2019s expansions, and then their miniatures as well, then the cost blowout is going to be enormous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs that going to be worth it for someone looking at getting into the game now? I don\u2019t know, that depends on how much money you make, how long you\u2019re going to play the game, and all kinds of other factors that are reminding me while I type this as to why our reviews never mention the concept of \u201cvalue\u201d!\n\n\n\nPersonally speaking, though, as someone who has played this game countless times with friends over a five-year timeframe\u2014 enough times that it\u2019s now one of their favourite games as well-- the addition of miniatures has really elevated the whole experience for me. I\u2019m normally pretty dismissive of the current frenzy for plastic minis in board games (see my points above!), but this is a rare case where, having played the game first without them, I can say it\u2019s definitely better with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich sounds...superficial, but then isn\u2019t half the reason people prefer to play board games in 2022 these kind of tactile delights?", "label": "human"}

Sometimes, even showers are available.\n\nDelta's move comes after complaints from travelers about long lines and crowds at some of the Sky Clubs, as entrants to the spaces have increased through credit card deals, customers' travel habits and lounge memberships.\n\nStarting early next year, membership packages for Delta's lounges will only be available to members of the airline's SkyMiles frequent flyer program who have status, one of the so-called Medallion tiers. Currently, anyone can purchase a membership.\n\n\"We want to invest in our customers who invest in us,\" Dwight James, Delta's senior vice president of customer engagement and loyalty, told CNBC.\n\nJames said feedback from passengers has shown they want to avoid stressful crowds and lines at the airline's lounges.\n\n\"It's not representative of the experience they're accustomed to,\" he said of the recent crowding. James added that some of the most crowded lounges have been at hub markets such as New York and Atlanta, and that Florida has also been busy.\n\n\"We have to evolve,\" James said.\n\nAmong other changes: Delta is raising membership fees. Starting Jan. 1, the price of an individual membership to Delta's Sky Clubs will increase from $545 or 54,500 miles to $695 or 69,500 miles. Executive membership, which includes guests, will rise from $845 or 84,500 miles to $1,495 or 149,500 miles.\n\nDelta offers its Diamond Medallion members certain perks for the year, such as upgrade certificates. For those who reach that level for 2024, Executive Membership to the lounge will count as three selections, up from two. And starting in February, Delta won't offer individual memberships through that channel.\n\nThe airline recently rolled out special VIP lines for certain Sky Clubs so its most loyal customers aren't forced to wait for entry. In July, it said customers can get into Sky Clubs within three hours of their departure time, a measure aimed to avoid crowding.\n\nIn December, Delta said it will report how busy clubs are in Detroit and Atlanta, from \"not busy\" to \"extremely busy\" so travelers know what to expect.\n\nDelta and other carriers have made it harder to earn status and other perks over the years, awarding those tiers to not only frequent flyers but big spenders. Still, travel rewards and co-branded credit cards, like Delta's partnership with American Express or American Airlines ' with Citi have allowed travelers to rack up miles and perks.", "label": "human"}

According to the CDC\u2019s latest assessment, the Omicron strain accounts for 8.4% of all US infections in the first half of December, up from just 0.3% in the first week of November.\n\nThe Omicron strain has also been spreading quickly in other parts of the world, including parts of Europe and Asia, but has been particularly aggressive in the US. Experts believe the strain may be more contagious and could be responsible for the recent surge in cases in the US. \n\nThe strain is identified as XBB.1.5, which is a lineage of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first spotted in the US in late October, and has since been tracked as it has evolved.\n\nInfectious disease experts are raising the alarm over the Omicron strain as cases have surged across the US in recent weeks. The strain is thought to be responsible for much of the recent surge, with rates in some states more than doubling from the previous month.\n\nThe CDC has warned that the strain could be more contagious than other variants of the virus, leading to a faster spread of the virus across the US. In addition, the Omicron strain has been linked to more severe illness, with a higher risk of hospitalization and death among those infected.\n\nThe CDC is recommending that people take all the standard precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands frequently. The agency is also recommending that people get tested as soon as possible if they think they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe US is currently in the middle of a third wave of the pandemic, and the new variant is leading to even higher rates of infection. The good news is that the vaccine is already being distributed across the country, with the majority of the population likely to be vaccinated within the next several months.\n\nIn the meantime, experts are urging people to take extra precautions to protect themselves and those around them from the virus. The CDC is also asking people to stay informed of the latest developments and recommendations and to be aware of any changes in the virus or new variants that may arise.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the new Omicron strain is becoming increasingly prevalent in the US, and is likely to be the dominant strain for the foreseeable future.

{"text": "Lenovo may be announcing scads of new business laptops and productivity machines at CES 2023, but the Legion gaming laptop and gaming desktop lines are also getting a big boost in 2023. Lenovo's Legion desktops and laptops are getting far more than the expected spec bump from the latest Intel and Nvidia hardware.\n\nThe laptop maker's Legion 7i products are getting a boost from AI-powered system optimizations, revamped cooling systems, and even boast equipment-free head tracking for more immersive gameplay. Meanwhile, the Legion Tower 7i desktops get hardware to impress through raw performance or dazzle with custom lights, in equal measure. We were able to check out both in person during the show.\n\nLooking at Lenovo's Legion Pro 7i Laptop\n\nThe Lenovo Legion Pro 7i laptop is the latest 16-inch gaming powerhouse from the massive brand. This latest model comes equipped with a range of 13th Gen Intel Core processors, and up to the latest Nvidia GeForce RTX next-generation laptop GPUs. But, the enhancements go far beyond new processing and graphics hardware.\n\nFor starters, Lenovo boosts performance with the new Lenovo Legion Cold Front 5.0 hybrid thermals, a collection of thermal management technologies designed to offer a total TDP of 235 watts (W). This cooling solution starts with a liquid metal infusion on the CPU, massive exhaust vents on the rear end sides of the laptop chassis, and an extra wide vapor chamber that covers both CPU and GPU for combined hybrid cooling.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nLenovo's new LA AI chip, which runs Lenovo AI Engine+, is a software machine learning algorithm that monitors in-game performance and dynamically adjusts the system to boost frames per second and offer up to 15% higher TDP.\n\nThe Legion Pro 7i also comes with Tobii Horizon, gearless head tracking technology for deeper immersion in supported games. This is on top of existing Tobii Aware software that tracks eye gaze data in real-time. Immersion is further boosted with Steel Series' Nahimic Audio, offering surrounding 3D audio for spatial awareness and improved communication between team members during a game.\n\nAll of this is housed in a sturdy but stylish metal shell on the lid and underside of the chassis. Plus, it's powered by a 99.9Whr battery, the highest capacity laptop battery allowed on a commercial flight in the US, which has become the de facto standard for maximum battery capacity.\n\nThe Lenovo Legion Pro 7i 16-in laptop will begin selling in March 2023 with a starting price of $1,999.99. An AMD-powered variant called the Legion Pro 7 will also be sold, but will not be available in North American markets.\n\nLenovo Legion Tower 7i Talks a Big Game\n\nNot to be outclassed by its laptop sibling, the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i is a 34-liter (L) desktop behemoth, imbued with everything from customizable RGB lighting (seen through a beautiful tempered glass side panel) to top-of-the-line hardware. Equipped with the latest 13th Gen Intel Core processors and Nvidia GeForce RTX desktop graphics, the Legion Tower 7i is made to deliver superb frame rates, low latency, and incredibly realistic ray tracing. Whether it's for gaming, content creation, game streaming, or some combination of the three, the Legion Tower 7i desktop can be outfitted to handle it all. Joining the new processing and graphics hardware is up to 64GB of 5,600MHz DDR5 RAM, up to 6TB of SSD storage (thanks to a trio of SSD slots), and a 1200W power supply to keep it all humming right along.\n\n(Credit: John Burek)\n\nCooling gets a makeover as well, with a larger VRM heat sink, as many as six nearly-silent ARGB fans, and a front bezel that uses an airflow-amplifying 3D pattern for optimal cooling. If that's not enough, an optional liquid cooling system can take your Legion desktop to the next level, and Lenovo claims this all adds up to an incredible 260W TDP.\n\nThe Legion Tower 7i comes in a cool storm gray color and is outfitted with dual USB-A 3.2 ports, dual USB-A 2.0 ports, and a pair of audio jacks\u2014all easily accessed on the front panel. On the back of the tower are four USB-A 3.2 ports, dual USB-A2.0 ports, a 20Gbps USB-C port, and a 10Gbps USB-A 3.2 port, along with RJ45 Ethernet and stereo audio jacks.\n\nThe 34L Lenovo Legion Tower 7i with Intel Core CPUs will begin selling in April, with an expected starting price of $2,479.99.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "There are things in life we just can\u2019t fathom doing or think we might want to do. Then, things change. That\u2019s how I came to winter swimming in Lake Michigan.\n\nI used to swim from late April through early November. Pandemic restrictions led me back to many winter sports \u2014 ice skating, cross-country skiing.\n\nAfter watching an intrepid friend do it, I thought: Why not add the lake?\n\nNow, I revel in swimming year-round, all winter long, in temperatures and conditions that once seemed foreboding and unappealing. I\u2019ve discovered the pleasures of cold-water swimming, the joy and discipline in embracing what was once unthinkable to the point where it is now hard to imagine not doing it.\n\nAlison Cuddy swimming at dawn on a winter\u2019s day in Lake Michigan. That\u2019s one way to make sure you\u2019re wide awake. David Travis / WBEZ\n\nEveryone who swims in Lake Michigan knows this massive body of water takes forever to warm up. Even in late summer, when the water temperature finally gets into the high 60s, a long swim can leave a chill. Or an offshore wind blows away the top layer of water, and, like a sly aquatic acrobat, the lake performs a somersault, kicking up bracing water from the deep, dropping 10 degrees or more.\n\nSo, we acclimate, inching in gingerly, eventually getting used to or at least accepting the cold.\n\nSwimming in the truly cold season involves a deeper level of acclimation, a steady and regular practice of immersion. It kind of sneaks up on me. The crowd of late-summer swimmers slowly ebbs, and then one day I look around, and there are a stalwart three, four, maybe 10 who are still coming out, who keep trundling to the lake in increasingly heavy clothing and gear.\n\nAh, yes, the gear. Many people ask, \u201cDo you wear a wetsuit?\u201d Really, it is more of an assertion or declaration: \u201cYou must wear a wetsuit!\u201d Perhaps because it is hard to imagine how to do this otherwise. Or maybe they\u2019ve seen Chicago\u2019s surfers, who also enjoy the winter waters, riding their boards through frigid winds and waves, clad in neoprene from head to toe.\n\nThe answer is no. Being immersed in rather than atop cold water feels different. As fall turns into winter, the increasingly cold water starts to feel good, even warm. Wetsuits would only get in the way of this descent into conditions that have become delightful. They\u2019re also very difficult to get out of quickly, leaving us vulnerable to the changing conditions on land. It is the gnarly winds, icy atmosphere and refrigerator-cold rocks that become the toughest to bear, not the water. By contrast, as the temperature of the air approaches freezing, slipping into the lake comes as a relief.\n\nGetting in is a delicate and decisive operation.\n\nAlison Cuddy finds that getting in and out of Lake Michigan when it\u2019s freezing outside is a delicate operation. David Travis / WBEZ\n\nWe arrive just before dawn at the lake, bringing extra towels or small mats to stand on to shield our feet from the bone-chilling ground. Inspecting the rocks, which can be covered in ice or snow, we might lay down a line of towels, creating a less slippery path to the water.\n\nI lay out a couple of regular bathing caps, plus a thick neoprene one, that fastens beneath my chin. I\u2019m already wearing my bathing suit and neoprene socks, and, after shrugging off my many warm layers, I pull on goggles and heavy, thick-fingered scuba gloves and head to the water.\n\nStaying low feels safest, so I often approach on all fours, feet first, in an awkward reverse crab walk. I fuss with my fins, stiff from the cold and hard to get on. Then, I pause, clapping my muffled hands together a few times, like a sounding bell, trying to bring a bit of warmth back into them. As I start down the ladder, the rungs latch onto my gloves. Peeling them away while trying to maintain my balance, I think of that classic scene in \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d of a child\u2019s tongue stuck to wintry metal and shudder. I launch in on my back, knees bent, arms extended overhead.\n\nCold forces a focus. At first, my limbs are stiff, and the neoprene acts like swaddling, containing the movement of my hands and feet. The cold hits the nape of my neck and traces a shivery trickle down my spine. I backstroke, leaning my head into the lake, stretching my arms as far as I can, breathing deeply. I monitor my body, trying to gauge how long I can stay in this time, and attend to the water\u2019s movements, noting whether the current is pulling me away or pushing me toward shore, if the waves or wind are kicking up.\n\nSettling into the lapping waves, gazing skyward, the occasional gull or duck passing overhead, a sweet dissolution unfurls, and my earthbound self floats away. I feel completely isolated, the water my sole companion.\n\nThe lake feels more alive in the winter, in a constant state of transition. Ice comes, stays for a stretch or, like a creature on the prowl, appears and then vanishes overnight. It takes many forms: thick clear slabs, crispy donut-like rings, austere icebergs. Last year, we swam in a jelly-like substance, liquid on its way to ice, that mantled our shoulders and draped around our legs, a fantastical cloak of nature.\n\nAs I head back to shore, I catch glimpses of my swim comrades in the water, moving here and there in a silent and stately choreography, heads held out of the water with the grace of swans. My solitary spell disperses. and I\u2019m glad for their company. Swimming together breaks through the gray, dull stretch of winter days, keeps us all afloat. I don\u2019t want to get out.\n\nThe coldest water makes my skin feel like it is ripping, stretching and crackling around my armpits and across the back of my knees, especially as I enter the colder air. Thankfully, this is only a sensation, and I emerge, body intact, to begin the mad clamber of shedding my wet gear and stuffing my frozen limbs into dry clothing.\n\nSilently \u2014 because who has time or mind to talk \u2014 we don layers and layers of dense wool, pants of varying thickness, more sweaters and hoodies, plus big coats, hats, mittens and socks. Avoid things with zippers or buttons because numbed fingers lack dexterity. Don\u2019t forget handwarmers. Cold-water swimming can create an after drop, as warmer blood rushes from your core back into your hands and feet. We are in a fumbling race to get warm before the shivers set in.\n\nThere are moments, despite all these preparations, when swimmers start to curse or moan or even laugh at the pain wrought by wind and air. We become giddy in our frigid state, trembling our way into euphoria.\n\nThat elation and interior coldness can last for hours, but eventually we become warm and calm, aided by hot liquids, maybe a spell back under the blankets or in a hot shower. We hang our cold and clammy swim things on racks, where they drip away the day.\n\nIn this state of drowsy warmth, the memory of the cold slips away, and we start to think about, even yearn for, our return to that icy realm. Every day on the lake is different, we swimmers say. What will tomorrow bring?", "label": "human"}
{"text": "across the globe.\n\nPickleball, the game that began as a makeshift pastime in 1965, has seen a remarkable surge in popularity over the past several years, with more than 36 million people now playing the game across the globe.\n\nOnce seen as little more than a backyard game, pickleball has become an international sensation. With an estimated 19 million players in the United States alone, it is quickly becoming one of the most popular sports in the world.\n\nThe game, which combines elements of tennis, badminton and table tennis, is played on a smaller court than tennis, making it an ideal sport for all ages and abilities. While the exact origins of the game are unknown, it is widely believed that it was invented in the summer of 1965 by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell and Barney McCallum on the Bainbridge Island in Washington State.\n\nThe game has evolved since its inception and the rules have been simplified to make the game accessible to all, making it a great way for people of all ages to stay active and socialize.\n\nThe game is also relatively inexpensive to play. Pickleball paddles, balls and nets can all be purchased from sporting goods stores or online retailers at reasonable prices. Players do not need to buy a full set of gear to begin playing; all that is needed is a net, four paddles and two pickleballs.\n\nThe accessibility of the game and its ease of play have been key to its growing popularity. Nowadays, pickleball courts can be found in numerous parks, schools and even on residential streets, with many cities around the world providing dedicated courts for the game. \n\nThe growth of pickleball in the United States has been driven in part by the support of the USAPA (United States of America Pickleball Association) which serves as the national governing body for the sport in the United States. The USAPA has been instrumental in growing the game, providing resources and support for players, coaches, and officials, and helping to organize tournaments and leagues.\n\nThe USAPA also hosts the US Open, the largest pickleball event in the world. The tournament takes place in Naples, Florida and brings together players of all ages and abilities from around the world to compete. This year, the tournament was attended by more than 2,400 players, making it one of the biggest pickleball events ever held.\n\nThe growing popularity of the game has resulted in the formation of regional and national pickleball associations in many countries across the world. These organisations are working to promote the game and its health benefits, while also providing support to players and events.\n\nIn addition, pickleball has seen an increase in TV coverage, with tournaments being broadcast on major sports networks in the United States and Canada, as well as on streaming services such as ESPN+. This increased coverage has helped to bring the game to the mainstream and has been key in driving the popularity of the game around the world.\n\nWith more than 36 million people now playing pickleball, it is clear that the game is here to stay. Its accessibility, ease of play and low cost have made it an ideal sport for all ages and abilities, and with more and more people turning to pickleball to stay active, its popularity looks set to continue to grow.", "label": "machine"}

In fact, two out of three adults in the United States support these bans \u2014 a 20% increase from just four years ago \u2014 and a majority of voters in Illinois do, too.\n\nWith the Senate now preparing to deliberate on this proposed legislation, Illinois has a clear opportunity to stand for gun safety and pass a statewide ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. If we do, we\u2019d become the eighth and 10th states, respectively, in our nation to do so. Illinois can and must be next.\n\nOpini\u00f3n Opini\u00f3n\n\nLast summer, our entire country was rocked to the core when a gunman used a high-powered weapon to kill seven individuals and injure dozens more at a July 4 celebration in Highland Park. And over in West Garfield Park, another mass shooting took place that weekend, where four people were shot. Six months later, we have yet to limit access to such weapons of war to other potential bad actors in Illinois. Since then, the senseless killings of people in our state have only continued. By the end of 2022, Illinois had experienced nearly 60 mass shootings in total, with nearly 700 homicides taking place in Chicago alone.\n\nThis is unconscionable.\n\nIt is for these very reasons that Gun Violence Prevention PAC started the #HaltTheAssault campaign, which calls on our lawmakers to ban military-style weapons. We believe every Illinoisan has a right to live free of gun violence, and are determined to have Springfield join us in seeing our efforts through.\n\nThe question now is: Can our lawmakers finally deliver the change Illinois needs?\n\nWe believe they can, because they\u2019ve done it before.\n\nEarlier this year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed HB 4383 into law, banning the sale and possession of ghost guns statewide. This legislation allowed Illinois to be a standard-bearer in the country in the fight against such unregulated firearms.\n\nSuch actions have put Illinois on the path to making gun safety a reality, and we must continue \u2014 even when noted foes stand against progress.\n\nFor years, the gun lobby has remained an influential bloc in our state\u2019s politics, forcing an agenda of unlimited and unfettered access to guns in Illinois, while ignoring the toll this has taken on the people of our state. As a result, Illinois has the 9th highest rate of gun homicides in the country, and firearms are the number one cause of death for our children.\n\nThis is not the reality we deserve to live in.\n\nAssault weapons and large-capacity magazines appeal to shooters because of their ability to make mass shootings deadlier. In shootings where assault weapons or high-capacity magazines are used, 155 percent more people are shot, and 47 percent more people are killed.\n\nFull stop, there is no reason for such guns to be sold on the civilian market. Despite this, these weapons remain a primary focus of sales for the gun industry.\n\nWe must take a hard look at the current state of Illinois and determine what kind of society we\u2019re creating for ourselves and our families. If we are interested in being the kind of state that prioritizes public safety and the wellness of our children, we cannot have such firearms proliferating our streets, threatening to turn them into war zones at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nWith the start of a new year, we have an opportunity to work toward real, lasting change. To come together and continue on the path of gun safety. However, we can\u2019t put off progress for a later date. Time is not on our side. Lives are on the line, and we must ban these dangerous weapons now to ensure no other family or community is devastated by a preventable tragedy. We must act now.\n\nKathleen Sances is the CEO and President of Gun Violence Prevention PAC (G-PAC).\n\nWant to write a letter or an op-ed for the Sun-Times?

{"text": "of censorship\n\nWhen Ashley Hope P\u00e9rez wanted to write her latest young adult novel, she encountered a problem: some of the books she wanted to include in her bibliography had been banned in the United States.\n\n\"I was trying to use those texts to convey an important part of my story, but it was really hard to find these books,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"A lot of them I had to buy on the grey market, which was a really strange experience, because I was asking myself: why can't I find this in a bookstore?\"\n\nThe books P\u00e9rez was looking for weren't just any books \u2014 they were banned books. And while the list of banned books in the U.S. may not be as long as other countries, it's still an important part of American literature.\n\nBanned books are books that are deemed too controversial, offensive, or otherwise unacceptable by certain authorities. This can range from works such as Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which was first banned in the 19th century, to books like Catcher in the Rye, which has been banned from some schools in recent years.\n\nSo what led P\u00e9rez to write a novel focusing on banned books?\n\n\"I was really interested in the idea of using books that were banned to tell a story,\" she said. \"I thought about what a powerful tool books can be for people who are oppressed or censored in their own countries \u2014 it's a way for them to find common humanity in books that have been banned in their countries.\"\n\nIn her book, Out of Darkness, P\u00e9rez follows the story of a young Mexican-American girl who moves from her small Texas town to Houston after her father's death. Through the use of banned books, she finds solace in stories that reflect her own struggles with identity and justice.\n\n\"When I was writing this book, I had a lot of conversations with people who are affected by censorship in other countries,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"It was really powerful for me to hear about the books that were banned in their countries and the stories that those books told.\"\n\nFor many readers, P\u00e9rez's book serves as a reminder that banned books tell stories that are essential to understanding our world, even if certain authorities have deemed them to be inappropriate.\n\n\"We should be able to make our own decisions about what books we want to read and what stories we want to tell,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"As readers, we should make sure to seek out those banned books and explore those stories. They can give us a deeper understanding of what's happening in our world.\"\n\nIn a world of censorship and oppression, P\u00e9rez's message is clear: books should be seen as a tool for understanding, not as something to be feared.\n\n\"When we allow ourselves to access these stories, it can be an incredibly powerful way to learn more about the world,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"We need to remember that we can find humanity and power in the darkness of censorship.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nToasting the birth of the new year is an age-old ritual, and for many, so is that dreaded morning aftermath \u2014 a hangover.\n\nWhat seemed like great fun at the time is now causing your hands to shake, your head to pound and your heart to race, not to mention other unpleasant symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity and excruciating thirst.\n\nWhy are you suffering? Because the liquor that smoothly passed your lips is now wreaking havoc in your body, causing dehydration, stomach distress and inflammation. These ailments peak about the time all the alcohol leaves your body.\n\nThere is no scientifically proven way to cure a hangover, but experts say you can prevent one \u2014 or at least keep that morning-after misery to a minimum. Here\u2019s how.\n\nDrink on a full stomach\n\nForget a late-night meal after a night of drinking \u2014 that\u2019s much too late, experts say. Instead, eat before your first drink and keep noshing as the night goes on.\n\n\u201cFood in the stomach slows gastric emptying and can reduce hangover symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Robert Swift, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University\u2019s Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nEating a little before you start drinking can reduce your hangover symptoms, experts say. MaximFesenko/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWhy does food help? Because most alcohol isn\u2019t absorbed by an empty stomach but via the intestinal tract just below it, Swift said.\n\n\u201cIf somebody does shots on an empty stomach, for example, all that pure alcohol is not diluted by the stomach and is passed to the intestine very quickly,\u201d said Swift, who has studied alcohol abuse since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cIf the stomach contains food, however, there are gastric juices and enzymes that mix the food and the alcohol, and only small amounts of food are passed into the intestine,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the alcohol is diluted in the stomach, and only a small quantity of alcohol is absorbed at any time.\u201d\n\nStay hydrated\n\nThe same principle applies to water and other nonalcoholic beverages, Swift said. \u201cIf alcohol is mixed with fluid, it\u2019s diluted, so when it goes into your intestines, it\u2019s not as irritating. You\u2019re less likely to have inflamed intestines or an inflamed stomach lining.\u201d\n\nDrinking water can help reduce the dehydration that occurs from downing too many alcoholic drinks. Lightfield Studios/Adobe Stock\n\nThere\u2019s another benefit to downing water between drinks, said Dr. John Brick, former chief of research at the Center of Alcohol Studies, Education and Training Division at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe primary cause of hangovers is dehydration and the loss of fluids, along with vitamins and minerals,\u201d said Brick, who authored \u201cThe Doctor\u2019s Hangover Handbook\u201d and published scientific papers on the biobehavioral effects of alcohol and other drugs.\n\nDowning just 3\u00bd alcoholic drinks can result in the loss of up to a quart of water over several hours, Brick added. \u201cThat\u2019s a good amount of water that has to be replenished.\u201d\n\nDehydration from alcohol may affect a woman even more, and she is more likely to suffer a hangover, even if she drinks less than a man, Swift said. That\u2019s because a man has a higher percentage of body water than a woman of the same height and weight, so the same amount of alcohol will be more diluted in a man, he said.\n\n\u201cThe woman will have a higher concentration of blood alcohol because her body contains less water to dilute it,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen are much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of alcohol (and they) get more intoxicated and develop alcohol liver disease sooner in life than men do.\u201d\n\nPick beer, wine or spirits with fewer additives\n\nThe alcohol we drink, called ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is the byproduct of fermenting carbohydrates and starches, usually some sort of grain, grape or berry. We use byproducts of fermentation in other ways: Ethanol is added to the gasoline in our cars, and methyl alcohol or methanol \u2014 a toxic substance \u2014 is used as a solvent, pesticide and alternative fuel source. Also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol made by bootleggers blinded or killed thousands of people during Prohibition.\n\nThat\u2019s not all \u2014 the list of byproducts or chemicals added by manufacturers for flavor and taste can read like a list of supplies at an industrial warehouse: ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, n-propanol, isobutanol, n-butanol, isopentanol and isoamyl alcohols. While these congeners, as they are called, are added in small, nontoxic amounts, some people are overly sensitive to their effects.\n\nOverall, dark-colored beer and spirits tend to contain more congeners and thus may be more likely to cause hangovers, experts say. A 2010 study investigated the intensity of hangovers in people who drank the darker-colored liquor bourbon versus clear vodka.\n\n\u201cCongeners in bourbon \u2026 significantly increased hangover intensity, which is not too surprising since bourbon has about 37 times the amount of congeners as vodka,\u201d Brick said.\n\nChemical preservatives called sulfites, known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, are also a natural byproduct of fermentation in small quantities. However, many manufacturers of beer and wine add sulfites to their products to extend shelf life. (Sulfites are also added to soda, cereals, sweeteners, canned and ultra-processed foods, medications and more.)\n\nSweet and white wines tend to have more sulfites than red, but red wines contain more tannins, which are bitter or astringent compounds found in the skin and seeds of grapes. Like sulfites, tannins can trigger allergic reactions in people who are sensitive.\n\nAs a result, limiting your drinking to light beers, clear liquors and white wine might help keep hangovers at bay.\n\nAbstain\n\nIn the end, however, experts say there is only one true preventive \u2014 or cure \u2014 for a hangover: Don\u2019t drink.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no simple cure because there are so many complex factors that are producing the multiple symptoms of a hangover,\u201d Swift said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the only real cure for a hangover is to not drink alcohol or drink such a low amount of alcohol that it won\u2019t trigger a hangover.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the process through which alcohol is absorbed in the body.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Postal Service can continue to deliver prescription abortion medication despite a June 2022 Supreme Court ruling that overturned a landmark abortion rights decision, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.\n\nThe department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel said in an opinion sought by USPS that the mailing of mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used to terminate pregnancies, did not violate an 1873 law known as the Comstock Act.\n\nUSPS said in a statement the opinion \u201cconfirms that the Comstock Act does not require the Postal Service to change our current practice, which has been to consider packages containing mifepristone and misoprostol to be mailable under federal law in the same manner as other prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nBottles of misoprostol, the second medication used in medical abortions, lie unused in a storage bin at an abortion clinic in Houston on July 7. Evelyn Hockstein / Reuters/Alamy file\n\nMifepristone is a prescription drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to induce an abortion up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy. It must be followed by a second drug, misoprostol. Both drugs also have other uses.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the opinion.\n\nThe FDA in December 2021 permanently eased some restrictions on the medications, allowing them to be sent by mail rather than restricting them to in-person dispensing.\n\nUSPS said it took no position on abortion policy at either the federal or state level and noted the Justice Department opinion \u201cspecifies that the mailing of those drugs to a particular jurisdiction that may significantly restrict access to an abortion is not a sufficient basis\u201d for the USPS to refuse to deliver them.\n\nUSPS said the Justice Department concurred with its \u201cdetermination that under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, any state laws that may apply to the shipment of those prescription drugs cannot be applied to Postal Service employees who are complying with their duties under federal law.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized women\u2019s constitutional right to abortion put a spotlight on abortion by medication, which accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions.\n\nA Dutch supplier of abortion pills by mail saw demand surge in the wake of the decision, which allowed more than 20 states to begin enforcing new restrictions on abortion.\n\nRestrictions on the abortion medication lifted in 2021 had been in place since the FDA had approved the drug in 2000. They had been lifted temporarily earlier in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, enabling women to consult healthcare providers by telemedicine and receive the pills by mail.", "label": "human"}

CLEAR is an expedited security screening program that allows you to cut the line at many TSA checkpoints around the country (and even some stadiums).\n\nThe standard price for CLEAR is $189 per year \u2014 a hefty price for anyone not carrying one of the following cards:\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express \u2014 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership\n\nThe Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express \u2014 120,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $15,000 on eligible purchases with your card within the first 3 months of card membership\n\nAmerican Express\u00ae Green Card \u2014 40,000 points after you spend $2,000 on purchases in the first six months of account opening\n\nThese cards will give you $189 toward CLEAR each year. It's technically possible to get CLEAR for less than $189, which means a single card could potentially get two free membership. For example, CLEAR is\n\nFree for Delta Diamond Medallion and United 1K elite members\n\n$109 per year for: Platinum, Gold, and Silver elite members of both Delta and United\n\n$109 per year for: Cardholders of most Delta or United credit cards\n\n$119 per year for: General Delta or United members (no elite status required)\n\nThe two Platinum cards above also offer free TSA PreCheck or Global Entry, so they're arguably the best travel rewards cards for expedited security.\n\nTSA PreCheck and Global Entry frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is TSA PreCheck? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. TSA PreCheck allows you to pass through most domestic airport security checkpoints without a lot of rigmarole. You don't have to remove your shoes, belt, or light jacket; you don't have to take your laptop out of your bag; you don't even have to put your carry-on compliant toiletries in a separate bin. To boot, there's also (usually) a separate lane exclusively for TSA PreCheck members. Not only is this lane often shorter, but it processes much faster because you're behind others who don't have to remove their shoes and belt, either.\n\nWhat is Global Entry? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Global Entry gives you an expedited experience at immigration at many US airports when returning home from overseas. Instead of waiting in long lines, you can find a Global Entry kiosk, answer a few questions, and the kiosk will print out a paper that you can simply hand to an officer before leaving the airport. This can quite literally save hours during a single use.\n\nHow long do TSA PreCheck and Global Entry last? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Both TSA PreCheck and Global Entry memberships last five years.\n\nDoes Global Entry include TSA PreCheck? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Global Entry doesn't technically give you a TSA PreCheck membership \u2014 but it will qualify you for TSA PreCheck on most flights.\n\nHow to get TSA Precheck for free? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. TSA PreCheck costs $78 for five years. But as covered above, there are fistfuls of credit cards that will reimburse this fee automatically as long as you pay the fee with a qualifying card.\n\nHow do I submit a Global Entry application? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Global Entry applications can be submitted online \u2014 but similar to TSA PreCheck, you'll have to actually visit an enrollment center to complete the process. However, Global Entry differs from TSA PreCheck in that it's much more difficult to achieve. There are dramatically fewer enrollment centers around the country, and the soonest appointment can be months away.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "No-hit runs in games\u2014a kind of self-imposed challenge where you take zero damage from enemies\u2014are nothing new, especially for tough-as-nails titles like Dark Souls. But Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Twitch streamer and YouTuber TheUrbanOrb has taken that feat to the extreme, and after more than three years of practice, defeated every opponent in FromSoftware\u2019s ninja epic without taking a single hit. This includes hard foes like Gyoubu Oniwa and Isshin The Sword Saint, as well as mini-bosses such as the Blazing Bull and plenty of the game\u2019s everyday shmucks. It\u2019s really impressive and makes me hella jealous.\n\nTheUrbanOrb is a Soulsborne YouTuber whose completed challenge runs include a level one Dark Souls run on New Game +7 with a ton of restrictions (like no pyromancy or ranged combat) and a similar level one Demon\u2019s Souls run on NG+7 with the Pure Black World Tendency turned on (a mechanic that increases the number and difficulty of the enemies across the game\u2019s world while offering even more rewards). Runs like these, and this latest no-damage Sekiro task, are something TheUrbanOrb does to challenge himself, pushing through punishing games with a bunch of prerequisites to see if he has the fortitude to finish. It\u2019s educational watching someone with vast knowledge of FromSoft\u2019s games abide by certain conditions while demonstrating exploits in these epic gauntlets.\n\nFirst announcing his intent to tackle this challenge with a cinematic and emotive trailer in February 2020, TheUrbanOrb has since posted a five-part video series of him beating Sekiro without taking a single hit from a single enemy. (The entire run was also recorded on his Twitch channel. ) Taking over three years and more than 4,000 hours of practice, he has finally slayed all of the game\u2019s bosses, from Genichiro Ashina to the Great Shinobi Owl, and, yes, that even includes the notorious, stupid-ass Guardian Ape. That pains me. Not because he busted out any flashy moves or anything to kill the white-furred gorilla, but because he simply employed a slower, more methodical strategy than Sekiro teaches relatively early on. While I\u2019m constantly getting my ass kicked by playing too aggressively, and never really minding my surroundings, TheUrbanOrb forced enemies to play at his pace, which gave him the advantage.\n\nFromSoftware\n\nSlow And Steady Beats The Game\n\nA slower game gives you time to think, to assess the situation, and make decisions based on enemy activity and positional awareness. TheUrbanOrb spent much of the first part of the video series, for example, in stealth, dodging enemies to get the drop on them without engaging in multi-person fights. For most normie combatants, stealth offered a one-hit kill. For all others with large health pools, stealth attacks typically eliminated one entire health bar, reducing the time he was locked in combat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen forced to fight, the YouTuber played pretty reactively. He\u2019d attack once and monitor the enemy\u2019s movements before attempting another attack, or Goomba-stomped bosses to avoid damage while building up the posture meter for a killing blow. This hit-and-run strategy, making ample use of buffs such as the consumable Yashariku\u2019s Sugar (that temporarily boosts attack power while cutting your life and posture bars in half), made up the bulk of The UrbanOrb\u2019s playstyle for this run. That\u2019s not to say it always worked out. TheUrbanOrb told Kotaku over email that some enemies forced him to not just restart the challenge run, but also rejigger his strategies to ensure 100 percent effectiveness 100 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cSome of the strats were specifically made with the pressure that I\u2018d expect at that part in mind,\u201d TheUrbanOrb said. \u201cFor example, I found that sometimes I would be so nervous I couldn\u2018t do fine adjustments of the camera stick anymore, so I ended up changing the strat altogether to make it work without that fine adjustment.\u201d\n\nSo I went through multiple such strat iterations and even went back to the drawing board for some bosses multiple times until I finally got them to a level that would make me feel confident fighting them in a high pressure situation. The most humiliating work was always when a \u201csafe and consistent strat\u201d turned out not to be, forcing me back yet again to the drawing board, which happened a lot in this run. Most notably, I changed my Sword Saint strat seven times in total until I arrived at what is finally the actually working 100 percent safe and consistent strat to me, using something that could be considered an AI exploit that had not been discovered yet. That final strat was nothing like anything that I had done two or three years ago.\n\nThe final strategy he used against Isshin The Sword Saint is actually pretty simple in execution. After realizing the multiple strategies revolving around \u201cdodging his overhead slams and countering his follow-ups\u201d didn\u2019t work, because of the rocks scattered around the flowery and foggy arena, TheUrbanOrb found a weakness in the final boss\u2019s AI. He used the combat skill Floating Passage\u2014a five-hit combo attack TheUrbanOrb called \u201cthe most unpopular and weakest\u201d move in the game\u2014and positioned the boss around those annoying rocks.The exploit gave him space to \u201cdeal with Isshin consistently and safely,\u201d he told Kotaku, as well as a protective barrier to evade damage. All without engaging in every Sekiro mechanic.\n\nSometimes, Mechanics Are Cumbersome\n\nOne thing that stood out to me when watching TheUrbanOrb\u2019s series was the unconventional way in which he used Sekiro\u2019s combat skills and game mechanics. He occasionally deflected enemy attacks, but chose to run away more often. He frequently toggled between locking on and off foes in battle. He opted for a slow-and-loose playstyle, rushing in to land a swipe or two, then dipping out before looking for another chance to strike. He pounced like a cat, which seemingly contradicts Sekiro\u2019s more aggressive design. FromSoft wants you in your enemy\u2019s face in this game, exploiting their missteps, throwing them off their balance, cutting them up. TheUrbanOrb played the opposite, slowly whittling down health bars in a bout of attrition, instead of an act of dominance. TheUrbanOrb said there\u2019s a reason why he regularly avoided deflections and didn\u2019t employ all the tools at his disposal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou get in some kind of trouble when you do [deflections],\u201d TheUrbanOrb said. \u201cEither the opponent has a moveset that requires a string of instant decisions under pressure, which I don\u2019t like, or there\u2019s a problem with the arena that leads to deflections not working properly (like for Sword Saint).\u201d He mentioned that you get more invincibility frames while dodging if you\u2019re not locked onto an enemy than if you are, at least when dodging sideways or diagonally, hence his tendency to toggle the lock-on feature while fighting foes. \u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cthat comes at a cost: You have to control the camera somehow, and that can be tricky. That\u2019s why I often switch between being locked-off and locked-on during the same fight, like with Owl.\u201d\n\nThis is what I mean about speedrunning being educational. I knew that dodging gave you a certain number of invincibility frames (or i-frames, as speedrunners often call them) to protect you from an attack, but I didn\u2019t know that dodging while locked-off increased the number of invincibility frames, making the dodge even more effective. Maybe now I can beat the brutal Guardian Ape, though I should probably put a lot more practice in before making that attempt. Got Elden Ring stuck in my wrists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPractice Makes Perfect\n\nTheUrbanOrb put his time in and wound up better for it, saying that several bosses forced him to study for hours. He spent \u201cbetween 350 and 400 hours\u201d on Isshin alone, for example, tweaking his strategies and analyzing the boss closely to ensure this challenge run would go flawlessly. This refinement is something he\u2019s done with a number of the game\u2019s enemies, sometimes spending upwards of two weeks on a single boss to envision all the worst-case scenarios and prepare for when things didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany of the \u2018safe and consistent\u2019 strategies of two years ago would become completely obsolete later because back then, I couldn\u2018t possibly have known many of the things that I only learned after compounding many little details from all different aspects of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThat to me was the most rewarding thing in this run: Taking knowledge from one part of the run and attempting to apply it somewhere else, only to discover something new which, while unrelated to what I originally wanted to achieve, I could then try to apply elsewhere, which would then lead me to draw another connection and make another discovery and so on.\u201d\n\nIt was this process of experimentation and discovery, he said, with one thing feeding into another into another, that enabled him to finally, painstakingly arrive at what he called \u201c100% effectiveness. And I feel like this is an experience and a skillset that is very helpful to have when navigating challenging lives in troubling times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor The Love Of FromSoft\n\nThe thing that draws me to FromSoft games is not the punishing difficulty. I have yet to actually finish a Soulsborne game because of how hard they are. Nah, the lure of FromSoft games for me is the community and the love they all share for the developer\u2019s work. There\u2019s an appreciation and respect for what FromSoft does, and that adoration was the impetus for TheUrbanOrb\u2019s run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had a desire to communicate to FromSoftware that I appreciate their work and I deeply respect every person who works there,\u201d TheUrbanOrb said. \u201cI am grateful for the artistic vision they have brought to life in all the other games that came before Sekiro, and I cherish the community these games have brought about.\u201d\n\nFromSoft\u2019s games also continue to be a metaphor for \u201clearning how to deal with adversity,\u201d as TheUrbanOrb put it. It\u2019s another reason why he embarked on such a difficult task. He wanted to challenge himself, to see if he could memorize the methods he came up with and put them to the test under real pressure. These games are a kind of life lesson in tackling the challenges of everyday experiences, TheUrbanOrb told us, and something he likely won\u2019t forget.\n\nFromSoftware\n\nNow that his all-enemies no-hit run of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is completed, TheUrbanOrb can finally take a load off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs to what\u2019s next for me, I am not sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually waited to play Elden Ring until I finished this challenge because I didn\u2019t want to confuse my muscle memory and my memory of information that I needed for the Sekiro run. I\u2019m really looking forward to finally experiencing it. As for other challenges or runs, I\u2019m not sure there either. Honestly, the last three-and-a-half years took a toll on me, and I\u2019ll have to make sure to recover from that first.\u201d\n\nYeah, I imagine TheUrbanOrb would need a good, long break after this. I couldn\u2019t fathom dedicating so much time to accomplishing such a feat, but as he said, one of the biggest motivators was the people who didn\u2019t believe he could do it. He wanted to prove them wrong. I think we can safely say he\u2019s done that.\n\nAdvertisement", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has been ordered to pay more than $230 million in damages to families of the 26 victims killed in the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting in Texas.\n\nThe decision came after a lengthy legal battle over who was ultimately responsible for the tragedy. The Air Force had argued that they should not be held liable as the shooter had already failed to provide information about his past criminal history during a background check which would have stopped him from purchasing the gun he used in the shooting.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez, disagreed and ruled that the Air Force was indeed responsible for the tragedy.\n\n\u201cThe United States Air Force failed to adhere to applicable law, policy, and regulations when it failed to provide the FBI with the criminal history information concerning the shooter, thereby allowing him to purchase and possess the weapon used in the shooting,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in his opinion.\n\nIn addition to the $230 million in damages, the Air Force was also ordered to pay nearly $20 million in legal fees to the victims\u2019 families. The Air Force had argued that the victims\u2019 families should not receive any money for their suffering, but the judge disagreed.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that the horror of the Sutherland Springs shooting continues to reverberate in the families\u2019 lives\u2026the magnitude of the injury suffered by these families is incalculable,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe Air Force has said it will appeal the decision, arguing that the Department of Defense is not responsible for negligent acts carried out by its members.\n\nThe Sutherland Springs shooting is the deadliest mass shooting at an American church in modern history. The gunman, Devin Patrick Kelley, had a history of violence and mental illness, but was able to purchase the assault rifle used in the shooting due to a failure on the part of the Air Force to report his past to the FBI.\n\nThe victims\u2019 families had argued that the Air Force failed to follow the law that required them to report individuals with a history of violence or mental illness to the FBI. This failure enabled Kelley to purchase the gun and commit the shooting.\n\nThe ruling marks the first time the Air Force has ever been held accountable for a shooting that occurred on its watch. It is also the largest award ever granted to victims\u2019 families in a mass shooting case.\n\nThe Sutherland Springs shooting has had a lasting impact on the victims\u2019 families and the community as a whole. While the ruling cannot undo the trauma and pain suffered by the victims and their families, it does provide a measure of closure as well as a monetary award for the families to use in their continued healing process.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For the third time in two months, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has launched a dramatic attempt to regain the speakership in the lower chamber of the US Congress.\n\nIn a remarkable about-face, the California Republican is now making a desperate bid for the support of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which had just two days ago openly rebuffed his overtures.\n\nMcCarthy had been widely seen as the runaway favorite to reclaim his old job of Speaker of the House after the 2023 midterm elections, but the opposition of the Freedom Caucus has put the brakes on that plan. The Freedom Caucus refused to back McCarthy\u2019s bid over his opposition to some of the group\u2019s more extreme right-wing policies, such as scaling back health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow, McCarthy appears to have resorted to a last-ditch attempt to win them back. He and a team of aides held a surprise meeting in the Capitol on Sunday evening, where they promised to try and find a compromise on policy issues important to the Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe group\u2019s leader, Rep.

But we\u2019re willing to look for ways to bridge those gaps.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy has gone to great lengths to convince the Freedom Caucus to back his speakership bid. In December, he appeared on Fox News to announce that he would be willing to defund the Obamacare program if it could help unite the party. But the group remains unmoved.\n\nMcCarthy also appears to be scrambling to win over more moderate members of the House. He recently held a meeting with a group of moderates, and his aides are said to be closely studying the results of the midterms in order to craft a strategy that could appease both sides of the aisle.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether McCarthy\u2019s effort will be enough to get him the speakership. For the moment, the odds seem to be against him. After the midterms, Democrats hold a razor-thin majority in the House, and it is not clear whether McCarthy has the votes to become speaker even with the support of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nEven if McCarthy does manage to become speaker, he could be in for a turbulent ride. With the narrow margin, his speakership could be easily threatened by a handful of defections on any major piece of legislation. And if the Freedom Caucus remains at odds with McCarthy, they could very well withhold their votes on any issue they deem to be important.\n\nThe political roller coaster shows no signs of ending any time soon. But one thing is certain: McCarthy\u2019s attempt to regain the speakership has already taken him and the rest of Congress to new levels of desperation.", "label": "machine"}

Kevin Brady (R-TX) talk during a business meeting of the House Ways and Means Committee on Capitol Hill on December 20, 2022 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday evening to publicly release redacted versions of federal income tax returns filed by former President Donald Trump when he was running for and serving in the White House.\n\nIt will take \"a few days\" to remove some sensitive information before the release of Trump's returns and those of eight affiliated Trump businesses, said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the committee's chairman.\n\n\"But we believe that it's only days,\" Neal said.\n\nThe records set for release include the notes of IRS audits of the returns.\n\nA related 29-page report on Trump's taxes was released later Tuesday evening.\n\nThe 24-16 vote by the Democratic-controlled committee approving the release of the returns and report was along party lines. Before the vote, the panel spent more than four hours in executive session discussing whether to make public the tax returns, and the manner of that release.\n\nThe committee received the tax records \u2014 which span from 2015 through 2020 \u2014 last month from the Internal Revenue Service after a three-year court battle to obtain them over Trump's objections.\n\nNeal previously said the records would be used to evaluate how the IRS audits the tax returns of sitting presidents each year.\n\nTrump broke decades of political precedent by refusing to release his tax returns to the public as a candidate and as president.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2020 that the billionaire real estate businessman had paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016, and that same tiny amount the following year. Trump paid no income tax at all in 11 out of the 18 years that the Times examined after obtaining his tax return data.\n\nTuesday's vote was the latest in a series of negative developments for Trump, who last month announced he will be seeking the Republican nomination for president in 2024.\n\nOn Monday, a select House committee voted unanimously to refer Trump for criminal investigation and possible prosecution to the Department of Justice for his effort to reverse his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden, which included pressuring then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify several states' Electoral College electors.\n\nAfter Tuesday's vote, Neal said lawmakers will have two days to file supplemental information or objections to the panel's report on the returns.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Hardly a day goes by without someone asking me, \"Why do you like Jay Powell so much?\" He will question whether I am somehow buddies with the Federal Reserve chair, or assume I knew him before he got the job. Nope. Barely knew him. I have spoken to him only once \u2014 and as part of a group \u2014 since he took the position in 2018. To understand why I like Powell, simply look at the arc of what has happened over the past year and you'll recognize that his critics should be on their heels, not him. Go back 12 months, and all you heard from billionaire hedge fund managers \u2014 who are so delighted to go on TV because they are fawned over endlessly \u2014 was that Powell was much too loose with monetary policy and already too late in trying to curb inflation. But then he raised interest rates faster than anyone ever has \u2014 to the current targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%. That's up from 0.25% to 0.50% in March 2022, when the central bank made its first hike in this tightening cycle of 25 basis points. He has been as tough as nails. He has been relentless and on message. Jump forward to today, and you never hear that Powell is too soft and that he let inflation get away, even as so much of inflation has to do with foreign issues like China's restrictive Covid policy and Russia's heinous invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Congress went along with President Joe Biden in spending a fortune on projects that are heavy on engineering when we have a huge shortage of engineers. Along the way, the disparity between the rich and poor grew quickly, with inflation hitting the latter much harder than the former. The wealthy, after all, allowed every car company and homebuilder to raise prices. Covid stopped the lower and lower-middle classes from bettering themselves. The whole situation, which was inflamed by a fractious press that Powell has chosen to deal with too regularly, was highly unusual. But he has handled it all. Which brings me to Friday's market. The unemployment report released Friday morning showed wages grew slower than anticipated, increasing 0.3% on the month where economists expected 0.4%. Bonds did rise a tad and it looked like a relief rally. That's until we got the Institute for Supply Management report showing the services sector contracted in December as new orders and production both declined. Where were the critics then? Why didn't those who think Powell is a doofus speak up and say maybe he's gotten it right? Those two highly predictive numbers were the real green lights to the rally. On top of that, rates showed not that we were going into recession \u2014 even as I heard that endlessly all day \u2014 but that there was suddenly optionality for the Fed; it is sure easier to stop a recession than inflation as any country in Europe will tell you. Now we are faced with the prospect of weaker earnings and number cuts galore. But we are also understanding that stocks have already reflected a lot of that negativity. A tale of two markets We have a truly bifurcated market though. We have a market that has one $3 trillion dollar stock in Apple (AAPL) and stocks worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and a lot more stocks that are $150 billion or less. We also have a division between technology stocks and everything else that is simply astounding in its dichotomy. Let\"s contrast two of them: Amazon (AMZN) and Micron (MU). The first hasn't preannounced weak earnings, just a sense that it must be worried because it hired perhaps as many as 300,000 more people than it needed. One look at the Macy's (M) preannouncement Friday tells you the consumer isn't profligate anymore. The other, Micron, has now told you three straight times that things aren't getting better. In fact, they are getting worse. There is a bigger chip glut than ever and it has spilled over from personal computers, where the decline is as high as 19% year over year, to cellphones, where there is a worldwide slowdown having mostly to do with China and its zero-Covid policy. Since November, Micron's stock is unchanged. But Amazon's stock has actually fallen from the high $120s to $86. Why is that? Because an economy that is slowing will reach a point where the multiples of a stock like Micron will shrink until the earnings go lower. Then the multiples go up, but go against easy comparisons. That's the bottoming process that happens this year. But Amazon? We have no idea what is the right multiple. We just know it is too high. The stock has been cut in half but it means nothing because the capitalization is almost $900 billion. That's too big until the earnings are better, which it won't be until there's more cost rationalization. Period. Any company as big as Amazon that's caught up in a recession is going to be worth less. It has to get the right multiple, that multiple has to go low, the earnings have to fall and only then will its multiple rise on faltering earnings but easy comparisons. In that sense, Micron is ahead of the mega-caps in the process of hitting bottom. How about Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META)? Same deal. Their market caps are too big, and with Alphabet and Meta the multiples are deceptively small because they are based on advertising and marketing and therefore are about to go down big. That's the first thing you cut out in a recession. That's also why the enterprise software companies are too highly valued: the prospective clients have done without them and they will do so again and new customers are hard to come by. Apple is the anomaly. Its market cap looks too big, but it might actually be right because of its service revenue. Meta Platforms' market cap might be right, too. But TikTok has to be outlawed, more money invested in Reels and not the metaverse, the metaverse has to find a different delivery system, plus WhatsApp has to be spun off at 10 times revenue, meaning it is worth $100 billion. That's a lot has that to go right. All of this is what will happen in the slowdown \u2014 but not recession \u2014 that Powell is engineering most deftly. There will be two markets. One is filled with the stocks that are too big and will remain share donors until they are given realistic multiples, see those multiples shrink, and then see them rise again because estimates are higher but comparisons are easier. The rest of the market, including stocks like Micron, will trade as it has in any recession. This is why I so resent those who say the market is \"finished.\" There is no \"market.\" There are two sets of companies: one with reasonable price-to-earnings ratios, and one with unrealistic multiples. The largest market caps still have unrealistic P/Es even as they have shrunk dramatically in the last year. The bottoming process for most companies has occurred, which is why I don't fear the coming earnings season. But the bottoming process for high-growth tech is pretty unfathomable because it was never valued right in the first place. The bottoming process for the special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, and crypto is non-existent, along with almost any initial public offering from 2020 on. That could be as many as 1,000 stocks and a huge crypto presence. So, one market is actually quite good. The other market is horrendous. You just have to recognize that the horrendous part is in search of a price-to-earnings multiple, and until it gets one equal to the S & P's 17 times earnings it might not happen. This is why we have been so concerned about Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) as they are in the process of rationalizing their multiples or rerated down. We are concerned about companies like Salesforce (CRM) with multiples that are still too high, we are concerned about Alphabet, Amazon and Meta because their multiples are illusory\u2014too high given they are dependent on advertising. You simply can't have enough of the rerated stocks, which are about to be winners as pressures from inflation, the dollar and supply chain ease and those headwinds turn into tailwinds. You can't have too little of the mega-caps until the process of figuring out a real multiple begins. It will happen. It's happening now for some companies. These are the ones I am most worried about. The good news? They represent a fraction of the companies out there. The bad news? They represent a gigantic amount of market cap that must be lost. I'd say we're only halfway there.

{"text": "The year 2021 was a year of huge economic turbulence caused by the global pandemic and its resulting ripple effects. From the outset, 2020 set the tone for an uneasy stock market outlook. The pandemic caused deep and far-reaching impacts on global supply chains, corporate earnings and investment sentiment. \n\nThe stock markets were highly volatile with huge sell offs and unprecedented gains that left investors\u2019 portfolios in disarray. Those who adopted a passive investment strategy and held tight lost a considerable amount of money in their portfolios. Those who took risks and bought the dip did well initially, but were eventually burned when the market suddenly dropped precipitously towards the end of the year.\n\nSo, what does history tell us about the prospects for stocks in 2023?\n\nThe past might not repeat itself but it can certainly rhyme. Analysts have been closely studying historical returns in order to provide investors with guidance for 2023. Over the past 30 years, stock markets have performed better than expected in the year following a major market downturn. According to some historical data, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 13.7% in the first year following a severe market correction.\n\nHowever, this is not a surefire guarantee of success. Historically, stock markets have been relatively resilient in the aftermath of a major crisis, with the S&P 500 rising an average of 5.5% a year after the 1987 stock market crash. But even with such resilient performance, the S&P 500 did not break into positive territory until the third year following the crash.\n\nIn addition to past performance, analysts have also taken into consideration the likely macroeconomic conditions in 2023. Interest rates are expected to remain low, as the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will not be increasing rates until at least 2024. This is likely to create an environment of low borrowing costs and could prove to be a positive influence on stock markets.\n\nIn addition, corporate earnings are expected to improve in 2023 as the global economy begins to recover. Analysts predict that US corporate earnings will increase by 8.9% in 2023, which could provide a tailwind for stocks.\n\nFinally, geopolitical risks will remain a factor in the stock markets in 2023. With the US-China trade tensions still unresolved, there is a risk of further volatility in the markets if tensions escalate. In addition, there is the potential for further volatility from Brexit negotiations and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the European Union.\n\nOverall, the stock market outlook for 2023 is uncertain but with historically strong returns in the aftermath of a market downturn, there is potential for robust performance. Investors should remain vigilant and diversify their portfolios in order to mitigate the risks posed by a volatile market. Having a well-thought-out investment strategy and sticking to it could help investors capitalize on any potential stock market gains in 2023.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On Tuesday, the South Korean military fired warning shots at multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from North Korea that had crossed into South Korean airspace for the first time in five years. \n\nThe warning shots came after the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) announced that \u201cmultiple objects presumed to be North Korean drones\u201d had been detected entering South Korean airspace near the inter-Korean border at about 8:45 a.m. local time (6:45 p.m. ET). \n\nThe South Korean military said that it had responded by firing 20 machine gun rounds into the air as a warning to the North Korean drones. According to reports, the South Korean military fired two warning shots in total, with the first shot being fired at 8:46 a.m. and the second shot at 8:49 a.m. \n\nThe South Korean military said that the North Korean UAVs had retreated to North Korean airspace at 8:50 a.m., and that no further action had been taken as of 9:20 a.m. \n\nAccording to reports, the North Korean UAVs were seen flying close to the \u201ccivilian control line\u201d\u2014a demilitarized zone that separates the two countries\u2014in the region of the East Coast. \n\nThe South Korean military said that it was able to identify the drones as being from North Korea based on the shape and design of the UAVs, as well as the performance characteristics. \n\nThe incident marks the first time in five years that North Korean drones have violated South Korean airspace. The last time was in May 2017, when two North Korean drones were shot down by South Korean fighter jets after entering South Korean airspace.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when tensions between the two Koreas are running high. The two countries have been engaged in an ongoing diplomatic dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile program, as well as the presence of US troops in South Korea.\n\nIn response to the incident, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it would take \u201cnecessary action\u201d if the North Korean drones violated South Korean airspace again. \n\nIt also said that it had put its military on alert and would take measures to ensure the safety of its citizens.\n\nThe South Korean military said that it was monitoring the situation closely and had requested a meeting with North Korea to discuss the incident.\n\nNorth Korea, however, has yet to respond to the incident.\n\nThe incident is likely to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, and could potentially lead to further provocations from both sides.\n\nIt is unclear what the North Korean drones were doing in South Korean airspace, or why the North Korean military decided to launch the UAVs.\n\nThe incident also raises questions about North Korea's capability to launch UAVs into South Korean airspace, as well as the South Korean military's ability to detect and respond to such incursions in a timely fashion. \n\nThe incident is a stark reminder of the dangers of the ongoing tensions between the two Koreas, and the need for both sides to continue to work towards peace and dialogue.", "label": "machine"}

However, if you fall behind on your payments, your loan may go into default, which can come with some serious consequences.\n\nNo one wants to default on a loan. But, in case you do, it's helpful to understand the implications.\n\nWhat does it mean to default on a loan?\n\nDefaulting on a loan happens when you miss payments for a certain amount of time. In other words, failing to keep up your end of a loan agreement can eventually push your loan into default.\n\nBefore you officially default on the loan, there is often a grace period, called delinquency, between missing a payment and defaulting on the loan. The length of the delinquency period varies based on your loan, but it kicks off as soon as you miss a payment. Depending on your loan type, this grace period is often in the range of 30 to 90 days.\n\nDefaulting on a loan can damage your credit score significantly, cost you thousands in accumulated interest, and prevent you from getting another loan in the future.\n\nIf you default on a secured loan, the lender may have the right to repossess your collateral. For example, if you default on your mortgage payments, the lender can foreclose on your home. If you default on unsecured debt, the lender cannot immediately claim your assets. However, the lender can pursue legal action to obtain payment.\n\nHow long do I have until I default on my loan?\n\nWhile the exact number of days varies from lender to lender, you can expect your loan to fall into default after you've missed payments for a set period.\n\nIf you are falling behind on your payments or fear you might, reach out to your lender immediately. Ask about deferment options, which involve a temporary pause to your payment obligations for a set period. Even a short reprieve might give you enough time to get back on track with your loan payments.\n\nIf your lender will not grant a deferment, here's how much time you may have before you are in default. Of course, the numbers in the chart below are only estimates. If you need specifics, reach out to your lender to better understand their rules.\n\nLoan type Standard amount of time until loan considered default Standard amount of time until nonpayment reported to credit bureaus Student loan 270 days 90 days Auto loan 30 days 30 days Personal loan 30 days 30 days Mortgage 30 days 30 days\n\nQuick tip: The specific timeline of defaulting on a loan can vary based on the lender. If you have questions about your loan, seek clarification from the lender.\n\nWhat are the consequences of defaulting on a loan?\n\nThe type of loan you default on comes with different consequences. Depending on the type of loan, you may have your wages garnished, collateral seized, or home foreclosed upon. As your default period stretches out, you may also rack up thousands of dollars in unpaid interest.\n\n\"Most loan agreements for homes and vehicles also allow for the physical repossession of the property if the debt is in default,\" says Todd Christensen, an AFCPE-Accredited Financial Counselor. \"While the lenders don't typically want to repossess your vehicle or foreclose on your home, they will begin these proceedings if they feel it is their least worst option.\"\n\nAdditionally, defaulting on a loan can significantly damage your credit score. Payment history accounts for 35% of your FICO score. If you miss multiple payments, this can drag your credit score down.\n\nImportantly, it is not a crime to default on a loan. No lender can have you arrested for failing to pay a loan. Defaulting on a loan may be a civil offense, and you might have to appear in court. But you won't serve jail time for defaulting on a loan.\n\nHow to get out of loan default\n\n\"Communication is the key component,\" says Ryan Cicchelli, founder of Generations Insurance & Financial Services. \"As long as you stay in consistent contact with them and take advantage of any hardship assistance they may offer, the chances of defaulting on a loan diminish substantially.\"\n\nIf you are facing default on your loans, consider loan consolidation. When you consolidate your loans,you get a loan from one lender for the total amount of debt you'd like to combine. Then, you use those funds to pay off the individual, smaller debts. At the end, you have all of your debt rolled into one monthly payment, one deadline for debt repayment, and a smaller interest rate.\n\nFor federal student loan borrowers, loan rehabilitation is a possibility. When signing up for loan rehabilitation, you'll need to agree to make nine voluntary and affordable monthly payments within 20 days of the due date over a consecutive period of 10 months.\n\nOther options include working with a credit counselor. Depending on the size of your defaulted loan, you may also consider bankruptcy as an option of last resort.\n\nQuick tip: If you aren't sure where to start getting out of default, consider working with a credit counselor. They can help you choose an appropriate course of action.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Uno scontro epico, che ha scosso le mura reali britanniche. William e Harry, due fratelli legatissimi da sempre che sembravano essere una forza inarrestabile, si sono finalmente separati. Ma cosa \u00e8 successo tra i due in quella tragica giornata dell'agosto 2019? Qual \u00e8 stata la causa della loro rottura?\n\nTutto \u00e8 iniziato l\u2019anno scorso, quando Harry e Meghan Markle hanno annunciato di voler lasciare la famiglia reale per creare una vita indipendente. La reazione di William alla notizia non \u00e8 stata positiva. Aveva cercato di consigliare il fratello di rinunciare alla sua idea, ma Harry aveva risposto risolutamente di no.\n\nQuesto atteggiamento aveva messo in imbarazzo William, e soprattutto la regina Elisabetta. Infatti, William \u00e8 diventato il protettore della corona, e suo compito era quello di assicurarsi che nessuno dei membri della famiglia reale facesse qualcosa che potesse mettere a rischio la reputazione della dinastia.\n\nInoltre, William nutriva delle preoccupazioni riguardo all'impatto di Meghan sulla vita di Harry. Lui temeva che la moglie del fratello lo avrebbe portato a cambiare idea su come gestire la sua vita e, cosa pi\u00f9 grave, avrebbe potuto causare problemi alla monarchia. Non era certo pronto ad accettare che questo accadesse, e aveva cercato di far capire il suo punto di vista al fratello durante un incontro informale avvenuto alla fine dello scorso agosto.\n\nQuesto incontro, tenutosi alla residenza reale di Sandringham, \u00e8 stato visto da molti come la scintilla che ha provocato la tragica rottura tra i due fratelli. In quella giornata, Harry ha finalmente rivelato a William i suoi sentimenti riguardo Meghan. Le lacrime dei due non sono state sufficienti a far ritornare le cose come prima. La convivenza con la moglie del fratello \u00e8 stata vista da William come un possibile problema per l'intera dinastia reale, e questo non era un punto di vista condiviso dal fratello.\n\nDa allora, i rapporti tra William e Harry sono stati estremamente tesi. I due hanno provato a ricucire lo strappo, ma i loro sforzi si sono dimostrati vani.

{"text": ".\n\nAs Zoom calls and online hangouts become a staple of our lives, our smiles have taken center stage\u2014unfortunately, sometimes as a reminder that we haven\u2019t had time to book a professional teeth whitening appointment. But while a visit to the dentist\u2019s office might be the best way to brighten your smile, there are plenty of at-home kits that will also get the job done, no trip to the dentist required. \n\nTo find the best at-home teeth whitening products on the market, we consulted four dentists, who shared their advice on products that will actually deliver results. Read on for the 14 best at-home teeth whitening kits that experts love, plus tips on how to use them for best results.\n\nFirst up is the Go Smile Super White Professional Whitening System, which features two different products. The first is a five-day pre-filled whitening tray, which comes with 20 treatments, while the second is a whitening serum and whitening accelerator, which you'll use on a weekly basis. Dentist Rachel Pearce says that this system is one of the best teeth whitening kits available, as it quickly lifts discoloration and restores your teeth to a whiter shade. \"The product contains carbamide and hydrogen peroxide, both of which are proven to be effective in whitening teeth,\" she explains. \"The tray sits comfortably on the teeth, and you can even wear it overnight for maximum results.\u201d\n\nNext, there's the Crest 3D Whitening Kit, which dentist Mark Lo is a fan of. \"This kit contains a two-step process: first, a whitening strip with a built-in accelerator to speed up the results, and second, a whitening gel that helps to break down surface stains,\" Lo explains. He adds that the system has \"a greater amount of active ingredients than other at-home kits,\" so you can expect noticeably whiter teeth in just three days.\n\nAnother popular at-home teeth whitening kit is the HiSmile Teeth Whitening Kit. \u201cI absolutely love this product,\" says dentist Karen Sando. \"It's easy to use, and it contains natural ingredients like coconut oil and aloe vera, which help to soothe and protect the gums while you whiten.\" According to Sando, this kit will help to remove surface stains while also nourishing and protecting your teeth.\n\nIf you prefer something a bit more natural, dentist Robert Davids recommends the AuraGlow Teeth Whitening Pen. This pen features a mouthpiece with an LED light, which helps to activate the gel and maximize its effectiveness. \"This product is great for busy people who don't have much time to spare,\" Davids explains. \"It delivers fast results, and the pen is small enough to fit into your pocket, so you can take it with you wherever you go.\"\n\nIf you're looking for an intensive whitening treatment, Dr. Pearce recommends the Beyond My White Smile 30 Day Teeth Whitening System. This kit comes with 30 pre-filled trays and is designed to provide deep whitening in just one month. \"It's one of the most effective kits I've used,\" Pearce says. \"The trays are super comfortable, and after just a few weeks you'll begin to notice a dramatic difference in your smile.\" \n\nFinally, there's the White Glo Professional Choice Whitening System, a whitening toothpaste that includes a whitening pen and whitening strips. Dentist Laura Smith says this kit is great for maintaining your bright smile between whitening treatments. \"The toothpaste is formulated with baking soda and peroxide, which helps to reduce stains and discoloration,\" Smith explains. \"Plus, the strips and the pen help to target deep-set stains. It's one of the best ways to keep your teeth looking their brightest.\"\n\nAt-home teeth whitening kits can be a great way to get your smile looking its best without spending hours in the dentist's chair. With these 14 products, you can easily and safely get the pearly whites you've been dreaming of. As always, though, make sure you talk to your dentist before using any of these products to make sure they're a good fit for your teeth.", "label": "machine"}

Jim Jordan of Ohio on Tuesday to be speaker of the House during the chamber\u2019s second and third votes amid the floor fight for House leadership.\n\nJordan, in an effort to show party unity, nominated GOP leader Kevin McCarthy in the second round of voting. Speaking on the House floor Tuesday, Jordan said the differences among Republican lawmakers \u201cpale in comparison\u201d to the differences between Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe need to rally around him,\u201d Jordan said of McCarthy.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida nominated Jordan in the second round where he earned 19 votes. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who already voted twice against McCarthy, nominated Jordan for speaker in the third round.\n\nIn that round, Jordan earned 20 votes when Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who had initially voted for McCarthy in the first two rounds, shifted his support to Jordan.\n\nJordan\u2019s nomination by other members marks a new layer of leadership drama as Republicans take control of the House. The first order of House business as the 118th Congress convenes is the selection of a new speaker, but McCarthy is being stonewalled by a group of conservative hardliners. Because the GOP holds only a narrow majority, those hardliners hold more influence in the conference and have already denied McCarthy the votes necessary to secure the gavel in initial rounds of balloting.\n\nA majority of at least 218 votes is needed to be elected speaker. The tally for the first ballot in the speaker vote was 203 for McCarthy, 10 for Rep. Andy Biggs and six for Jordan \u2013 with three Republicans voting for other candidates.\n\nFor McCarthy to reach 218, he can only afford to lose four GOP votes \u2013 and his initial failure to do so marks the first time in a century that a party will have to take multiple ballots to elect the chamber leader.\n\nThe House voted to adjourn Tuesday evening after McCarthy suffered his third rebuke for speaker and the number of defections against him grew. He earned 202 votes on the third ballot.\n\nLeaving the floor, Jordan told CNN there is \u201cno\u201d chance he will become speaker, adding he wants to be House Judiciary chairman. He said he would lobby his colleagues to back McCarthy once the chamber resumes Wednesday.\n\nJordan is a high-ranking conservative and a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, serving as its first chair from 2015 to 2017, and as its vice chair since 2017. He was the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee from 2019 to 2020. He vacated that position to become the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, where he is expected to become chairman in the newly GOP-held House.\n\nJordan is a close ally of former President Donald Trump. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump refused to concede while making claims of election fraud, Jordan supported lawsuits to invalidate the election results and voted not to certify the Electoral College results.", "label": "human"}

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nAt its core, purchasing life insurance is an investment in an uncertain future. The diverse range of life insurance policies helps buyers prepare for an unexpected death, accident, illness, and sometimes retirement. The Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance boasts award-winning insurance coupled with best-in-class customer service. It's a powerful punch designed to help individuals across the country protect what might be their most valuable asset: future dreams for those they love.\n\nWhile many people think of life insurance as a death benefit, life insurance loans, accelerated death benefits, and other options are available. For example, American Family offers life insurance primarily to care for beneficiaries after the policyholder's death, but some plans also include accelerated death benefits. Finding the right policy can help you achieve your goals.\n\nThe company, founded in 1927, has proudly served 12 million customers (and counting!) in the ensuing nine decades. It's currently listed among Forbes' best insurance firms.\n\nLife insurance plans from American Family Insurance\n\nLife insurance is a savvy way to financially (and proactively) protect the people you love in the event of your death. Consider these DreamSecure options when shopping for a policy with American Family:\n\nTerm Life Insurance: A term life policy delivers coverage for a specific time. Coverage remains in effect for the contracted term (10, 15, 20, or 30 years). If the policy is active at the time of the insured's death, a benefit will be paid. While qualified applicants may renew the policy at the end of the term, renewal premiums will be higher than the term policy's scheduled payments. Any conversion to a whole life insurance product goes through the same application as a new life insurance policy. Qualified applicants can apply for a no medical exam life insurance policy. But the death benefit could change, and acceptance is not guaranteed. A term life policy carries no cash value.\n\nSimplified Term Life Insurance: Enjoy quick and easy application (no medical exam life insurance) and approval (subject to health history) with this no-nonsense option. Applicants can protect the financial future of loved ones with minimal hassle. Since life insurance policies are based on age and health, the earlier you act, the better. This option comes with customizable coverage ranging from $50,000 to $150,000, available over standard terms of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. In addition, each premium is guaranteed to remain unchanged for the whole period, after which the policy expires if it is not converted to a whole life insurance policy (commonly referred to as permanent life insurance).\n\nWhole Life Insurance: A whole life policy delivers life insurance coverage for an individual's entire life. This means a death benefit is promised to the beneficiary. Additionally, this policy accumulates cash value, meaning policyholders can use it for current financial needs. For example, money can be borrowed as a loan when purchasing a home or facing college tuition. Whole life policy premiums with American Family remain constant over the policy's life, regardless of age or health changes.\n\nChild Whole Life Insurance: Parents can purchase additional coverage at specific milestones without a medical exam or further health questions. A trio of coverage options ($25,000, $50,000, and $75,000) coupled with two payment options (10- and 20-year plans) means coverage continues through significant life events, including marriage and homeownership long after the final monthly premium is paid.\n\nSenior Whole Life Insurance: This simple, affordable policy is designed for adults between 50 and 80. While no medical exam is required, policy issuance is based on answers to health-related questions. Plus, coverage comes in small amounts. Policies are available with only $10,000 or $50,000 in death benefits. The limited payout makes it a good fit for final medical and funeral expenses after your death. Keep in mind American Family can also reference medical records.\n\nFlexible Life Insurance: This long-term, flexible coverage is designed to evolve on par with your life. Both premiums and coverage are adjustable to meet changing needs, across various life stages, with a single life insurance policy. Living benefits are another attractive feature only available with American Family's flexible life insurance plans. Unlike traditional death benefits, living benefits allow the buyer to pull money out to pay medical bills and living expenses in the event of a severe illness or accident. Of course, this reduces your death benefit later on.\n\nAdditional coverage options from American Family Insurance\n\nSome American Family life insurance plans offer additional insurance riders to meet your unique needs:\n\nPremium waiver for disability benefit rider: This add-on eliminates premiums if the insured experiences an accident or life event rendering them disabled. In other words, you keep your benefit without future payments.\n\nThis add-on eliminates premiums if the insured experiences an accident or life event rendering them disabled. In other words, you keep your benefit without future payments. Accelerated death benefit/living benefits: This add-on allows a policy owner to receive partial death benefits if the policyholder is diagnosed with a terminal illness. This rider was referenced above as \"living benefits\" available with the flexible life insurance plan.\n\nThis add-on allows a policy owner to receive partial death benefits if the policyholder is diagnosed with a terminal illness. This rider was referenced above as \"living benefits\" available with the flexible life insurance plan. Guaranteed purchase: This option allows customers to purchase additional whole life coverage without answering further medical questions or scheduling a physical exam. Increased benefits are only available at certain preset milestones.\n\nThis option allows customers to purchase additional whole life coverage without answering further medical questions or scheduling a physical exam. Increased benefits are only available at certain preset milestones. Children's insurance rider: This option offers coverage of $15,000 for biological, adopted, and step-children.\n\nThe type and amount of coverage you need are unique to your family's circumstances. A licensed life insurance agent is always the best resource for purchasing an appropriate life insurance plan. But the following equation can give you a basic idea of the minimum death benefit you might want to buy:\n\nExpenses (inclusive of current/future debts, childcare expenses, education, and income replacement)-assets (spouse's income, investments, and any existing life insurance policy) = estimated life insurance needs\n\nHow much does life insurance from American Family Insurance cost?\n\nGenerally, term coverage is less expensive than permanent (whole life policy) coverage. The main caveat is the latter comes with a guaranteed benefit/payout while the former does not. In addition, a term policy expires at a specific time, meaning you're betting you'll die before that point or be healthy and financially stable enough to convert your policy to a whole life insurance policy. But, of course, your insurer is betting neither of those situations will apply. Remember, because you'd be applying at a later age with more health conditions, premiums will likely rise if you convert your term policy to a whole life policy.\n\nThat said, the cost of whole life insurance may be less expensive than you think if you buy early. Age, gender, health, and coverage amount are the main factors determining premium costs. So the younger and healthier you are, the lower your policy premium will be. In addition, when accounting for fixed premiums when you buy early instead of converting your term life insurance later, you could save money in the long run.\n\nAmerican Family Insurance offers a life insurance calculator to determine coverage needs and estimate costs.\n\nHow do I file claims with American Family Insurance?\n\nThe easiest way to file a claim with American Family Insurance is to contact your agent or call 1-800-MYAMFAM (1-800-692-6326), ext. 78080.\n\nBecause the process of starting a death benefits claim begins with the insured person (and not the beneficiary), have the following information available:\n\nTheir first and last name\n\nTheir date of birth\n\nTheir state of residence\n\nTheir state of death\n\nThe following list of additional information may expedite the processing of your death benefit claim:\n\nPolicy number\n\nDate and cause of death\n\nContact details for each beneficiary\n\nDate of birth for each beneficiary\n\nRelationship of each beneficiary to the policyholder\n\nUltimately, you will be required to provide a copy of the death certificate and contact information for the funeral home handling arrangements. American Family Insurance agents can advise on the information required if you need to file a claim for accelerated death benefits.\n\nWho are the ideal customers for American Family Insurance?\n\nThe broad range of policy options at American Family Insurance runs the gamut from term to whole and simplified to flexible. These options make the company accessible to a diverse range of people as long as you're in relatively good health and a US citizen. Unfortunately, American Family does not offer life insurance for foreign nationals.\n\nLike other major life insurance companies, American Family Insurance has an age cutoff that varies between policy types. At a certain point, term policies cannot be renewed or converted to whole life policies. So while it offers small senior plans, options become limited and disappear when you wait too long to apply. In addition, riders like American Family's accelerated death benefits are unavailable on some plans.\n\nWhat does \"no medical exam\" mean with American Family Insurance?\n\nSome life insurance policies require a physical exam. American Family Insurance determines eligibility for DreamSecure Simplified Term Life Insurance via a short health survey. According to company underwriting guidelines, children ages 0-17 do not require a medical exam for term life, whole life, or DreamSecure Flexible Life insurance policies. However, applicants will need to answer health-related questions to determine eligibility. As such, being transparent about preexisting conditions is essential. Given the company's access to basic health records, dishonesty of any kind can lead to a policy being canceled or death benefits being withheld. These two rules apply to life insurance policies in general.\n\nCompare American Family Insurance vs. Mutual of Omaha\n\nMutual of Omaha offers guaranteed coverage without medical exams or health-related questions. This risk is offset by lower maximum coverage amounts across the board. In addition, the Nebraska-based Fortune 500 Company offers universal life and indexed universal life policies. These permanent insurance options may include accelerated death benefits to pay out after an illness or severe accident. Its universal life policies also build cash value via non-equity earned rates in the case of the former allowing for cash value growth through an equity index account.\n\nAs an industry giant, Mutual of Omaha offers more diverse life insurance plans than American Family Insurance, especially if your goal is your financial planning. Some of its underwriting guidelines may also be stricter. So while payouts would be smaller, more applicants may be eligible for American Family life insurance than with Mutual of Omaha. Buyers looking for life insurance plans to accomplish their retirement and investment goals will find better options with Mutual of Omaha.\n\nCompare American Family Insurance vs. State Farm\n\nAccording to J.D Power's yearly life insurance survey, State Farm consistently ranks first in customer satisfaction. In addition, State Farm's term life insurance offers high payouts with low premiums for qualifying applicants. Applicants with existing State Farm home, auto, or other insurance policies may also enjoy multi-policy discounts.\n\nIts whole life policies come with living benefits for accidents or serious illnesses. A key thing to remember with State Farm is living benefits payments are restricted to four withdrawals ($500 minimum each) per year. American Family's guidelines for policies with living benefits can be more flexible. Both companies sell their policies through captive insurance agents who can advise on the benefits of individual life insurance policies. In other words, State Farm agents only sell State Farm insurance products. As such, if you want to compare life insurance policies from other companies, agents would have to contact a different insurance agent. Both companies offer good death benefits, but neither company provides competitive life insurance plans for financial planning.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe compare life insurance companies based on product quality, insurance riders available, net performance scores, pricing, and customer service. In addition, we look at the diverse range of life insurance products to compare death benefit plans with life insurance designed for long-term financial planning. Our opinions are wholly based on facts gathered.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided here is intended for review purposes only. Utilizing a licensed insurance agent to shop for life insurance is the best way to ensure you'll get the right policy, one inclusive of appropriate coverage (at a competitive price) that best meets the needs of you and your loved ones. Once an individual is denied a life insurance policy with any company, this information is reported within a more extensive network. Any denial exponentially increases the likelihood that future applications will be denied. A licensed insurance agent can help you prepare your application and review your options to apply for plans that make sense for you and the insurance company.\n\nFAQs\n\nWho needs life insurance? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. People responsible for their loved ones' financial well-being will benefit from life insurance. This includes primary wage earners, homeowners with mortgages, and parents with children. It also includes non-wage earners who reduce household costs. For example, a stay-at-home parent may clean, provide child care, and other services that would otherwise raise the family's monthly expenses.\n\nWhat is a beneficiary? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. A beneficiary is an individual or organization receiving the proceeds of a life insurance policy when the insured person dies. Some companies allow a buyer to elect multiple beneficiaries.\n\nWhat are living benefits? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Also known as accelerated death benefits, living benefits allow buyers to pull money out early. Early withdrawals depend on the life insurance holder suffering a severe illness or injury that prevents them from working. Policyholders can use it to pay medical bills or living expenses during that time.\n\nShould I buy a policy for my child? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Since the cost of life insurance largely depends on one's age and health, purchasing a life insurance policy for a child comes with benefits, the biggest of which is locking in at a low rate for the policy's life. Some policies for children are term policies that cannot be renewed as adults. So keep this in mind when setting your premium.\n\nHow much life insurance can I buy? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Seeing the limits on American Family life insurance policies, you might buy multiple life policies. Insider recommends getting quotes from at least three companies if you are not satisfied with the benefits any life insurance company provides. Whether you buy one or multiple life insurance policies, combined coverage is limited based on the age at which you purchase the policies. Adults 40 and younger can qualify for as much as 25-35 times their annual income. Adults between 60 and 70 could only purchase policies covering five times their yearly income.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Dan Forbes\n\nIt\u2019s pouring rain in San Juan, Puerto Rico, but the fire dancers swinging flaming poi outside the warehouse party don\u2019t seem to mind. They\u2019re entertaining cryptocurrency industry executives, blockchain developers, and Burning Man types who\u2019ve flocked to the island in December 2021 for Blockchain Week, in which the island\u2019s crypto bigwigs rent out basement club venues, party-hop in gated communities with top-shelf liquor, mingle with some Miss World contestants (there for the pageant the following week, funded in part by local crypto billionaires), and catch COVID together.\n\nI\u2019d come from a dinner earlier that night where a different set of fire dancers twirled in the background while a founder of a \u201csocial impact\u201d blockchain company explained how his team, despite tireless efforts, couldn\u2019t find a qualified woman to fill their chief financial officer role. (They\u2019d hired a white man instead.) Next, it was off to a house party with a driveway full of Tesla charging stations and bros leaning on the balcony. On the journey over, the thirtysomething woman riding with me, a director at an NFT (non-fungible token) music company, mulled over a question she\u2019d been asking herself since joining the male-dominated cryptocurrency industry: \u201cIs this a high point or a low point?\u201d she said, recalling a moment during Art Basel Miami Beach when she\u2019d found herself networking at E11EVEN, a 24-hour \u201cultraclub,\u201d in the wee hours of the morning with industry colleagues. \u201cI really don\u2019t know....\u201d\n\nFor women in the crypto space, this waffling between the good and bad, this constant weighing of the pros and cons of working in this exciting, emerging, and sometimes creepy industry is a recurring theme. While the opportunities for women can be both thrilling and boundless, in part because they stand out in a sea of crypto men (a bonus when networking), their minority status often goes hand in hand with misogyny. After all, it was mostly men who bought into cryptocurrency at its start, allowing them to amass big early money in the space and influence the newborn industry, where they continue to hold the reins.\n\nNo industry is safe from sexism, but the Wild West nature of the barely regulated cryptocurrency market tends to exaggerate both problems and successes. The high highs of the money and lavish parties (Chris Rock introducing the Strokes; twentysomething coders bum-rushing a yacht) are punctuated by the low lows (scams, mishaps, and market fluctuations that have cost investors millions and sent early operators to prison), facilitating an atmosphere in which it feels like almost anything can happen. And almost anything does, particularly as crypto- currency becomes increasingly mainstream. Matt Damon pressures people to invest, saying \u201cFortune favors the brave\u201d in a Super Bowl ad; Gwyneth Paltrow and Jimmy Fallon buy NFT ape cartoons for a reported six figures.\n\n\u201cThe higher in the ranks you go, the more there\u2019s a target on your back.\u201d\n\nBut because cryptocurrencies allegedly democratize financial systems by removing traditional gatekeepers like banks and politicians, anyone\u2014not just wealthy celebrities\u2014can get in on the action, ideally. In reality, though, women have largely been left out of the cryptosphere. About 19 percent of 18- to 29-year-old women reported buying, using, or trading cryptocurrency versus 43 percent of men in that age group, per 2021 Pew Research Center numbers. And a November 2021 report by research firm Art Tactic showed female artists made up just 5 percent of all NFT sales over the preceding 21 months. Per a February 2022 Bakkt study, \u201cnearly all\u201d participants\u2014men and women\u2014felt crypto was \u201cstrongly associated with men.\u201d Ninety-five percent of non-crypto-owning women, however, said that association wasn\u2019t what kept them from buying\u2014it was more about not understanding crypto. But as women account for more than half of the \u201ccrypto-curious\u201d in the Bakkt study, the number of female investors could soon increase, representing a \u201cmajor potential shift.\u201d Another recent survey by BlockFi, a crypto financial services company, found nearly one in three American women say they are planning to buy crypto this year.\n\nOf the 35 women working in crypto and NFTs interviewed for this story, most estimate that women make up around 10 to 20 percent of the industry, with some describing the culture that\u2019s sprung up around cryptocurrencies as \u201calienating\u201d and \u201cintimidating.\u201d One woman says she\u2019s seen r\u00e9sum\u00e9s get passed over at her company solely because of the applicant\u2019s gender; others mention microaggressions, sexual harassment, and jealous male colleagues, who raise a stink or spread rumors when female peers earn promotions over them. \u201cThe moment I became a VP was when a lot of the wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing came out,\u201d says Chjango Unchained (the name she goes by in crypto), a podcaster who\u2019s been in the space since 2014. \u201cI think it\u2019s just the nature of women rising in the hierarchy. The higher in the ranks you go, the more there\u2019s a target on your back.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not as simple as writing off crypto as purely a playground for misogynists. It\u2019s a growing, global industry full of opportunity for anyone who takes the time to learn about it and dive in\u2014and suggesting that women stay away to avoid bad actors would be a disservice. Besides, many of the women interviewed for this piece couldn\u2019t wait to extol its virtues. Joyce Yang, 32, founder and CEO at Global Coin Research, calls it \u201cone of the best places for women\u201d because of the \u201cvery open-minded ethos\u2026[and] welcoming atmosphere.\u201d She and others I spoke with acknowledge the space\u2019s gender imbalance, but see the proportion of women growing \u201cnotably faster than\u2026in traditional tech.\u201d Almost all of them say that while there are not a lot of women in crypto, the ones who are rank among the sharpest, most badass people they\u2019ve ever met.\n\nStill, my night at the warehouse in San Juan ends on a damp couch covered in fluffy blankets where two women show me the NFT art of Olive Allen, an artist in her twenties who\u2019s been making NFTs since well before the mainstream hopped on board. It\u2019s an image of a skeletal girl surrounded by Twitter icons with devil horns and text that sums up her experience as a woman working in NFTs: \u201cWhen they say they are here for female artists but go & buy a pic of a woman from DegenBoy69.\u201d Because of the minuscule market share women creators account for in the NFT space, \u201cthere have been funds organized to buy female artists\u2019 NFT work,\u201d Allen tells me later in her Brooklyn apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly an undervalued asset in the space\u201d\u2014just as women generally are.\n\n\n\nThose who\u2019ve felt the sting of crypto misogyny often chalk it up to the space\u2019s newness. \u201cThe leaders in this industry in general are young and inexperienced,\u201d one woman who works at a crypto trading firm tells me\u2014meaning they\u2019re not exactly versed in the importance of diversity and inclusion. The more experienced leaders can also lack, well, leadership qualities. This is on display in Puerto Rico, where hordes of the crypto rich have controversially moved to avoid paying taxes.\n\n\n\nThe most high-profile leader there is Brock Pierce, a crypto billionaire and former child actor infamous for his involvement in a Hollywood child sexual abuse scandal stemming from his cofounding, in 1998, of a video production start-up called Digital Entertainment Network with Marc Collins-Rector, who was later accused of sexually assaulting three underage males. (Pierce was named in a 2000 civil lawsuit related to the allegations, but two of the plaintiffs dropped their claims against him. Pierce settled with the third plaintiff for $21,600, according to court documents, a fee Pierce has claimed was levied to cover the plaintiff\u2019s legal fees.)\n\nThe crypto world is crawling with men who\u2019ve maintained power by virtue of their appreciating digital assets, eclipsing sometimes sketchy pasts and business dealings.\n\nPierce\u2019s rise in crypto has also been marked by controversy. He has been involved with two big-name crypto entities that have each faced allegations of financial misconduct. The first, Block.one, which sold EOS tokens (one of the more popular cryptocurrencies at the time) in a yearlong $4.1 billion initial coin offering in 2018, settled a class action lawsuit for $27.5 million filed by EOS investors who said the company sold unregistered securities and pumped up the price of EOS. (Pierce left the company in 2018.) Second was Tether (which Pierce says he hasn\u2019t been involved with since 2015), a crypto company that has come under scrutiny for being unable to prove it is holding the billions of U.S. dollars that supposedly back its currency.\n\nThe crypto world is crawling with men like these\u2014early bitcoin investors who\u2019ve maintained power by virtue of their appreciating digital assets, eclipsing sometimes sketchy pasts and business dealings. And their power is only growing. Pierce ran for the U.S. presidency as an Independent in 2020, and has filed candidacy papers with the Federal Elections Commission to seek a Vermont Senate seat. In November 2021, New York City\u2019s mayor-elect, Eric Adams, who had said he\u2019d get his first three paychecks in bitcoin, flew to Puerto Rico in Pierce\u2019s private jet.\n\nAnother early adopter turned mega-influencer in the industry is blockchain public relations veteran Michael Terpin. The mission behind Terpin\u2019s CoinAgenda, a conference that\u2019s part of Blockchain Week in December, seems to lie in luring more big-time crypto investors to the island. Known for losing $23.4 million in a SIM-swap hack in 2018, Terpin has his hands in numerous crypto projects and is the founder of both blockchain PR and consulting company Transform Group and crypto angel investor group BitAngels.\n\nRelated Story NFTs Are the New Sneaker Drops\n\nTerpin has been extolling the virtues of relocating to Puerto Rico to crypto industry workers and holders since he moved there himself from Las Vegas in 2016. He proudly claims to have been the first person from the crypto world to relocate to the island to take advantage of its tax benefits, which allow wealthy newcomers who live there for at least half the year to enjoy tax-free profits on their investments. That\u2019s a very appealing prospect to crypto investors who benefited big-time from the market\u2019s 2017 bull run and followed Terpin to the island, much to many locals\u2019 chagrin. Puerto Ricans have staged protests against the tax breaks, including demonstrating outside a Pierce-organized conference, according to theWashington Post\n\n. And Puerto Rican Senate member Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Santiago Negr\u00f3n has put forward legislation to repeal the tax break.\n\nNevertheless, Terpin is undeterred in his aim to attract more crypto industry players to the island. He does this in a small San Juan convention center for an audience of mostly middle-aged white men. Holding up his hand to mimic dangling a $1 million check, he demonstrates how he\u2019s gotten other crypto founders to relocate. He insists the narrative that crypto bros are \u201ccolonizing\u201d Puerto Rico is \u201cfalse,\u201d but proceeds to use wartime analogies to describe how he and his cohort descended on the island. \u201cI guess I would have been the paratrooper\u2014go out and see whether it\u2019s safe, and come back and say, Hey, it\u2019s a beautiful island, and, you know, easy to do business down here,\u201d he says of arriving in Puerto Rico in 2016. \u201cAnd then Brock was coming [in the] next wave, he came down\u2026with about 50 of his friends. I guess that\u2019s sort of like the Air Force.\u201d For many\u2014in Puerto Rico and beyond\u2014Terpin and Pierce have been their entry points into the industry, serving as gatekeepers with their outsize influence.\n\nA still image of Goddess of Pearls, an NFT based on an original oil painting by of the same name, made by artist Christina Lewis Vizcarrondo (aka Bonesy). Christina Lewis Vizcarrondo\n\nThe maleness of this conquer-culture is not lost on the women who\u2019ve made Puerto Rico their home. During Blockchain Week, I meet Christina Lewis Vizcarrondo (aka Bonesy), 35, an artist who moved from New York to her mom\u2019s native Puerto Rico in 2019. She estimates that if she could sell one NFT a month, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her bills. \u201cA lot of people come here and expect [locals] to bow down to them,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the most part\u2026that\u2019s been male. I\u2019ve never seen a woman in the space do that.\u201d Before I arrived in San Juan, a 29-year-old who works in crypto told me about her \u201cvery lonely\u201d experience in Puerto Rico \u201csurrounded by 99 percent men.\u201d She detailed \u201cbro parties at penthouses\u201d with drugs, sex workers, and \u201ce-girls,\u201d attractive women who get paid to promote digital coins. \u201cI got tired of it\u2014like okay, this is fun, but it\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhile I don\u2019t see this exact scenario play out on the island, every crypto party I attend in Puerto Rico is a \u201cbro party.\u201d The party coordinator, however, is a woman: Molly Pops, a self- described \u201ccommunity builder\u201d who got into crypto less than a year ago and gushes about the industry\u2019s \u201cabundance.\u201d She runs a group called the Ministry of Social and works with both Pierce and Terpin. Looking ready for Burning Man in a cowboy hat and red pants when we meet outside the CoinAgenda conference (which she does sales for), she acts surprised when I ask about crypto\u2019s gender imbalance. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even cross my mind,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not a thing here.\u201d Peering up at a palm tree shielding us from the daily downpour, she thinks for a second. \u201cThere are a lot of men in crypto in Puerto Rico\u2014young, single men\u2014but I\u2019ve never felt any gender profiling.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for slightly more women in blockchain, head to Miami, where crypto advertisements float by on boats passing South Beach and the mayor has turned his paycheck into bitcoin. The city hosts a younger crypto crowd, representing a newer wave marked by the 2021 NFT boom and growing use of the term \u201cWeb3\u201d to describe the decentralized internet that runs on blockchain. \u201cI fit into the Web3 ideology, which is quirky, transparent, authentic, and [about] empathy,\u201d says Imgesu Cetin, 26, cofounder of Defy Trends. Pronounced alternatively as \u201cDeFi,\u201d for \u201cdecentralized finance,\u201d and \u201cdefy\u201d as in \u201copenly resist,\u201d the company aims to lower the barrier to entry into crypto with an easy-to-use investing tool. Its branding stands out from the predominant dark-toned, complex-looking software that caters to \u201cmale pro traders who\u2019ve been in the game for six years,\u201d Cetin explains.\n\nRelated Story Corporate Transition\n\nA party the company hosts in January in Miami\u2019s artsy Wynwood neighborhood boasts a theme of women\u2019s empowerment. Local mural artist Diana Contreras, 40, has been invited to create a live painting (to be encoded into an NFT) while attendees mingle under purple lighting among Defy Trends\u2013branded unicorn statues, the bar littered with koozies that read \u201cTalk Crypto to Me.\u201d Born in Peru but raised in Miami, Contreras started learning about NFTs last year at Art Basel. She sees selling her art that way as an opportunity to build \u201cgenerational wealth\u201d for her family. Though Miami\u2019s crypto space is \u201cmostly all men,\u201d she says Defy Trends\u2019s three female cofounders have made her feel like she could \u201cfit in.\u201d\n\nHaving met first as friends living in Tulum, Mexico, the Defy Trends cofounders\u2014CEO Cetin, COO Daniela Henao, and CFO Elena Garidis\u2014now live together in what Cetin calls a \u201cstart-up\u201d house in North Miami. \u201cCrypto is a really hard niche to dive into, especially if you\u2019re not a finance bro, which we\u2019re not,\u201d Henao tells me shortly after I arrive at their party. \u201cI often have to prove myself, and that\u2019s really draining.\u201d At a blockchain conference in Dubai last year, Henao describes how men at the event wouldn\u2019t talk to her, one of the only women in the room. She\u2019s witnessed male investors promise funding on the spot for male founders, only to turn to her and say they couldn\u2019t commit.\n\nInevitably, a man crashes our conversation. When I say I\u2019m doing an interview about women in crypto, he says, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want more ladies?\u201d\n\nOlder women see promise in this new crypto generation because of such female- led teams. Sylvana Levy, 50, tells me the gender balance in Miami\u2019s crypto/NFT scene \u201cfeels completely different\u201d from the male-dominated art world\u2014but she\u2019s having trouble convincing her interior designer friend, Gabriela Sanchez-Vegas. \u201cHow many women do you see there?\u201d Sanchez-Vegas, 48, asks Levy as we stand outside the venue, pointing through the glass walls at a crowd that\u2019s more than 50 percent male. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s still male-dominated; it\u2019s the same.\u201d\n\nLevy cites the number of women she\u2019s met \u201cin high positions\u201d in the industry, but Sanchez-Vegas stands her ground. \u201cI\u2019ll put money on it,\u201d she interrupts, that men will continue to dominate this industry. \u201c[I\u2019ll bet] crypto, NFT if you want\u2026it\u2019s very hard for women to get into things like this.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d says Levy, \u201cbut you\u2019re not very much in the NFT world, so you haven\u2019t seen\u2014\u201d Sanchez-Vegas turns to me. \u201cI always bet money. She hates it. She knows I win.\u201d\n\nBack inside the party, a trio of women in their twenties congregate on a couch, discussing blockchain with such familiarity that I think Sanchez-Vegas may lose her bet. Wearing a bubblegum-pink sweatsuit and magnetic eyelashes sold by her company, Glamnetic, Ann McFerran, 28, complains that it\u2019s hard to get her customers to pay for her beauty products in crypto because \u201cnot that many women hold\u201d\u2014but that doesn\u2019t stop her from planning her company\u2019s upcoming NFT play. The women chat about why fewer women have crypto and attribute it to risk aversion. An e-commerce consultant wearing vegan leather, Alexandra Checa, 26, has a message for fellow females: \u201cJust take more risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupport each other, too,\u201d adds a third in our circle, Keke, 27. Born and raised in South Florida, she\u2019s enthusiastic about her city\u2019s growth as a crypto hub and says she\u2019s spent the past two years planning a blockchain conference that aims to have \u201c90 percent women speakers.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Ann Lai Filed a Lawsuit to Tell This Story\n\nInevitably, a man crashes our conversation.

Meanwhile, Cetin, her face covered in subtle glitter, gets on the mic to tell the party that Contreras\u2019s painting, now finished, and the associated NFT are up for auction. The price is currently at $1,200, and the proceeds will all go to Lotus House, a local women\u2019s shelter. \u201cA lot of thought leaders in the space are male\u2026and it\u2019s really hard to get into their space,\u201d Cetin had told me over Zoom a month prior. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve infiltrated. I\u2019m one of the boys now, but it shouldn\u2019t be like that.\u201d It seems that while women are steadily working their way into this industry, they still have to go through men to do it.\n\nCetin\u2019s \u201cinfiltration\u201d is evident when I run into her at a club two nights later, sharing bottle service with a group of crypto men, fitting in seamlessly as the only woman at the table. I think back on all the women who\u2019ve told me they\u2019re used to being the only female in the room, coming up in online coding forums and traditional tech or finance jobs, and how crypto has been kinder to them than those established male-dominant industries because there\u2019s not as much historical precedent for misogyny. At least here, the newness and lack of rules that many blame for the grossest displays of male chauvinism also spell out an opportunity for change, to shape a culture that will better welcome anyone who wants to join.\n\nFor a much simpler take on women in crypto, however, ask the bald guy I meet at a mansion party in Miami, who tells me by the pool that the industry women here and in Puerto Rico have the \u201csame brains,\u201d a presumable compliment connoting their understanding of blockchain.

During her career, Ms. Wolf has investigated cybercrime, organized crime, terrorism, public corruption and violent crime.\n\n\u201cJaimie brings tremendous skill and expertise to her new role as Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Field Office,\u201d Director Wray said in a statement. \u201cHer commitment to public service and proven track record of success make her the ideal choice to lead the hardworking men and women of the Chicago office.\u201d\n\nMs. Wolf\u2019s appointment follows the recent retirement of Special Agent in Charge Michael Anderson, who had led the office since January 2018.\n\nThe Chicago Field Office is responsible for the investigation of federal crimes committed in parts of Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana, with a primary focus on public corruption, organized crime and terrorism. As SAC, Ms. Wolf will lead a team of nearly 400 special agents, intelligence analysts and support personnel responsible for carrying out the FBI\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cI am humbled by the opportunity to serve as the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Field Office and eager to join the outstanding professionals at the FBI,\u201d Ms. Wolf said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to leading the talented men and women of the office in our mission to protect the citizens of Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.\u201d\n\nMs. Wolf will assume her new role in mid-February and will join an already impressive team of FBI personnel in Chicago. In addition to Director Wray\u2019s selection of Ms. Wolf, the office is currently led by Assistant Special Agent in Charge Curt Creager, who has served as the Acting Special Agent in Charge since Mr. Anderson\u2019s retirement in December.\n\nSince taking over the leadership of the Chicago Field Office in 2018, Mr. Anderson played a key role in enhancing the effectiveness of the FBI\u2019s efforts to combat violent crime in Chicago, particularly in addressing the devastating gun violence that has plagued the city in recent years.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Chicago office opened the first joint FBI and Chicago Police Department office to proactively identify individuals driving violent crime in the city. He also oversaw the expansion of the Public Corruption Initiative, which takes a strategic, intelligence-based approach to identifying and disrupting public corruption in the area.\n\nIn addition to appointing Ms. Wolf to lead the Chicago Field Office, Director Wray also announced several other changes to the FBI leadership structure in Chicago. The Deputy Special Agent in Charge of the Counterintelligence Division, Jason Lake, will replace Mr. Creager as the Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Criminal Division. The current Deputy Special Agent in Charge of the Criminal Division, David Siebert, will assume Mr. Lake\u2019s former role. \n\nIn addition, FBI Chicago will welcome three new supervisory special agents to the Criminal, Cyber and Counterintelligence divisions. \n\nThe new FBI leaders are all highly qualified and bring extensive investigative experience to their respective roles. With these changes, Director Wray has put in place a leadership team that is well-equipped to handle the challenges of the 21st century, while continuing the Chicago Field Office\u2019s mission to protect the citizens of Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "cancel culture.\n\nRepublican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was sworn in for his second term on Wednesday, casting himself as a national leader in a speech that included a sweeping message about the future of the Sunshine State and his ambition for the coming years.\n\nIn his inaugural address, DeSantis vowed to combat cancel culture and resist what he described as \"authoritarian woke bullies\" that threaten Florida's culture. He also addressed infrastructure, the environment and the state's economic growth.\n\n\"We reject the idea that 'free' means having to bow to cancel culture or the authoritarianism of woke bullies,\" DeSantis said during the speech at the state Capitol in Tallahassee.\n\nThe governor, who was first elected in 2018, made a name for himself as one of the country's most outspoken critics of the Biden administration. He has said he plans to pursue a number of policies that would block any attempts by the federal government to increase regulation or taxes in the state.\n\n\"We will continue to stand up for our values and liberties, and that includes standing up for our law enforcement,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis' inaugural address had a distinctively nationalistic tone, and was met with applause from the crowd. He touted his accomplishments as governor and warned against the \"terrible consequences\" of increased government regulation and higher taxes.\n\n\"We must remember, above all else, that no one will protect our liberty like we will,\" he said.\n\nThe governor also touched on infrastructure, touting his administration's efforts to build roads, bridges and airports. He described the state as a \"magnet\" for businesses and people, and promised to do more to help the environment by increasing efforts to protect Florida's coastline and Everglades.\n\n\"Florida will serve as a model of stewardship as we carry the torch of freedom and of prosperity,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis also used the address to make an explicit pitch for a potential 2024 presidential run. The governor said he had no plans to run, but was coyly flattering when talking about his accomplishments and goals in the state.\n\n\"We must never forget what it's taken to get here,\" he said. \"So, the question for all of us is, can we preserve it for future generations? Because if we are blessed enough to do so, and I think we will be, if that's the case, then future generations will look back and say 'this is where it all started.'\"\n\nDeSantis' name has been floated as a potential Republican candidate for president in 2024, but he has yet to formally announce his plans.\n\nThe governor has been an outspoken critic of President Biden and other Democrats, leading to speculation that he could be looking to run for a higher office in the coming years.\n\nDeSantis is popular among Republicans, but has come under scrutiny for his handling of the pandemic in Florida. His staunch opposition to lockdowns and economic restrictions has been criticized by some health experts.\n\nThe governor also has been called out for his ties to conservative media outlets and for retweeting QAnon-linked accounts.\n\nStill, DeSantis' popularity remains high, and he has been able to gain national attention by taking on the Biden administration and its policies. \n\nOnly time will tell if DeSantis plans to run for president in 2024, but his inauguration address made it clear that he has no intentions of backing down when it comes to defending Florida's values and freedoms.", "label": "machine"}

The firm's rapid expansion was funded by the investment arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, leading to expectations of continued success. \n\nHowever, it seems that the FTX's success was to be short-lived, with the exchange now unable to meet its obligations to creditors, forcing them to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. \n\nThe news of the filing is sure to come as a shock to the crypto community, as FTX had become one of the most trusted platforms for trading digital assets. The exchange had been well-received by traders, gaining traction due to its ease of use and range of services. \n\nHowever, FTX's bankruptcy filing indicates that the company has been unable to manage its finances effectively. According to court documents, the company has been unable to repay its creditors and is unable to pay its staff salaries, leading to its eventual downfall. \n\nThe filing also contains details of FTX's alleged misuse of its funds. In particular, the documents allege that the company has been operating its exchanges in an illegal manner.

{"text": "The recent stockings of Chinook salmon in Indiana waterways have brought a surge of excitement to the local fishing community. Now, the state of Indiana is taking the unprecedented step of holding a series of public meetings to discuss the best way to manage the current Chinook salmon stocking effort.\n\nThe meetings, hosted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, will begin at the end of January and will focus on determining the optimal number of salmon to stock and the best locations for the stocking sites. The meetings are open to all members of the public and will involve various government agencies, local stakeholders, and fishing enthusiasts.\n\nThe current Chinook salmon stocking program was initiated in 2019. In the following years, the DNR has slowly increased the number of stocked Chinook in Indiana rivers. In 2020, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources stocked 19,000 Chinook into the Ohio and Wabash rivers. While this number is significantly lower than the annual stocking levels of other states such as Michigan, it has nonetheless become a popular destination for sports anglers in the region.\n\nThe presence of salmon has also attracted bald eagles to the region. In the spring of 2020, the Indiana DNR began a program to monitor the number of bald eagle nests in the state. By the end of the year, they had counted over a thousand pairs of eagles, the largest population of bald eagles in the state since the 1990s.\n\nIn addition to the chinook salmon, the state has also begun stocking a variety of other species, such as bass, trout, and catfish. These new stocks have been met with enthusiasm by the angling community, who have welcomed the opportunity to target a diverse range of species.\n\nThe upcoming meetings will provide an important forum for anglers to voice their opinions and concerns regarding the current Chinook salmon stocking program. It is the first time in years that the state has taken an active role in the management of its fisheries, and the meetings are expected to draw a large crowd of interested stakeholders.\n\nThe DNR is also hosting the first ever Indiana Fishing Show this April. The show will feature speakers from the DNR, local anglers, and a variety of vendors selling fishing gear and tackle. There will also be a series of seminars and educational sessions to help inform anglers on the latest trends in fishing and conservation.\n\nThe Chinook salmon stocking program has brought new life to Indiana waterways and a renewed sense of optimism to the fishing community. As the state moves forward with the public meetings and the inaugural Indiana Fishing Show, anglers and nature enthusiasts alike can look forward to a bright future for Indiana\u2019s fisheries.", "label": "machine"}

Until we can provide people with these basic needs, we cannot expect violent crime to truly go down.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the community is rallying behind the victim of the shooting and his family, who are asking for privacy as they cope with this traumatic event. Local organizations are offering to cover the victim\u2019s medical expenses, and there is a growing movement to raise funds for his recovery.\n\n\u201cWe must all stand united against violence and help each other in times of need,\u201d said one community member. \u201cThis is a tragedy, but it can also be a moment to come together and make our neighborhoods safe and secure.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Millennial Money series, which details how people around the world earn, spend and save their money. Hector Carvajal lives to hustle. He doesn't know any other way. He saw it from his neighbors growing up in the Dominican Republic, and then stateside when he was 8 and his family moved to the Bronx borough of New York City. His mom's first job in the U.S. was cleaning tables at McDonald's and his dad drove a cab. As a teen, Carvajal saw people selling candy on the subways and at school, so he decided to try it, too. As an immigrant family, \"we go for it,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"It's a sense of hunger, a sense of drive. We don't come here with anything, so we're trying to build something.\"\n\nHector Carvajal, 26, is the founder of Don Carvajal Cafe, a Dominican-sourced coffee roaster, and lives on $25,000 a year just outside New York City. Mickey Todiwala\n\nThat drive steered him toward studying business marketing at the University of Rochester and, in 2019, he brought a class project to life as a real business. He took a leave of absence from college, with one year left to graduate, to focus on it full-time. Today, the 26-year-old runs Don Carvajal Cafe, a coffee roasting company out of the South Bronx that sources its beans from the Dominican Republic. From January to early December 2022, his business brought in roughly $190,000 in sales. From that, Carvajal lives off a $25,000 salary. \"'I just make it work, the same way my mom made it work,\" he says. Here's how he manages his money while growing his business.\n\nFrom classrooms to cafes\n\nWhen Carvajal was tasked with mocking up a business plan in college, his mind immediately went to coffee. \"In the countryside of the Dominican Republic, we farm, we harvest, we roast coffee,\" he says. Carvajal has vivid memories of his mom brewing a fresh batch for the house every morning. He wanted to bring attention to Dominican-sourced products, which he feels are underrepresented despite Dominicans being one of the biggest immigrant groups in New York City. He named the business and designed the logo after his grandfather, who provided for his family as a farmer in the Dominican Republic. \"I've always been interested in finding a way to loop it back to where my family started,\" Carvajal says. \"Being a New York City kid and coming from a farmer family in the Dominican Republic, I felt that Don Carvajal was the bridge between these two experiences growing up.\"\n\nDon Carvajal Cafe's name and logo is a tribute to Hector's grandfather, who was a farmer in the Dominican Republic. Mickey Todiwala\n\nCarvajal's school project was a success. After he wrapped the class, he still had some extra coffee left and posted it for sale on social media. It got a lot of attention from his friends, and Carvajal realized he had a real opportunity on his hands. Carvajal went back to his dorm room and immediately registered the name Don Carvajal Cafe as a business with the state of New York. He used some seed money \u2014 a $500 credit card and a $300 grant from school \u2014 to buy more coffee and sell it on Instagram. He would reinvest any earnings to grow the business, including by finding a roasting facility to work out of, getting a delivery truck and hiring employees. He gained more traction throughout 2021 with a $60,000 Kickstarter campaign. As a roaster, Carvajal sources coffee beans, gets the raw product to his roasting facility in Long Island City, creates different roasting profiles, and packages them up and sells them to customers nationwide. He makes most of his sales from e-commerce, farmers markets and selling to restaurants.\n\n'I learned you don't need much to survive'\n\nGrowing up with little money is what led Carvajal to the frugal mentality he has today. He pays himself $25,000 a year and lives as minimally as possible. \"I learned that you don't need much to survive,\" he says.\n\nHector Carvajal says he grew up surrounded by ambitious and driven people in the Dominican Republic and the Bronx, New York. Mickey Todiwala\n\nCarvajal's mom taught him about credit at a young age \u2014 he learned it was important to build and protect his credit score if he ever wanted to rent an apartment, finance a car or open a business. He got his first credit card at 18 and, at the advice of his brother, never maxes it out. Also a must: Paying it off in full every month. For the first three years of running his business, Carvajal lived rent-free with his mom in the Bronx in her rent-stabilized apartment. Thanks to her, Carvajal was able to reinvest every bit of money made from the business back into it.\n\nHector Carvajal credits his mother for his drive, financial savvy and support in starting Don Carvajal Cafe. Mickey Todiwala\n\nCarvajal credits his parents for his financial discipline today: \"Thanks to their resilience and their hard work and their honesty, I am that type of person now that carries those values. And I'm able to carry out my craft, I'm able to chase my dreams.\"\n\nHow he spends his money\n\nHere's how Carvajal spent his money in November 2022.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Elham Ataeiazar | CNBC Make It\n\nDiscretionary: $636 on shopping, home goods and entertainment\n\n$636 on shopping, home goods and entertainment Savings and investments: $588\n\n$588 Food: $569 on dining out and groceries\n\n$569 on dining out and groceries Transportation: $264 on tolls and license renewal fees\n\n$264 on tolls and license renewal fees Pet insurance: $40 per month for his French bulldog, Toasty Carvajal recently signed a new apartment lease that came with a rent discount, so he didn't have to make a payment in the month of November. After the discount period, he and his girlfriend will split their rent and utilities down the middle and pay $1,500 each. Carvajal qualifies for free health insurance through Medicaid and writes off his phone bill and car payments as business expenses under an LLC. He did pay out of pocket for other transportation costs in November, including toll fees and to renew his driver's license. Otherwise, Carvajal spent a little over $600 on home goods for his new place and winter clothes for the month. With some extra cash freed up, he's trying to get back into the habit of investing through Acorns, a micro-investing platform. In November, he made three deposits of $196 and plans to auto-invest that amount on a weekly basis.\n\nHector Carvajal makes a decent amount of his sales at farmers markets and even supplements his grocery bill by bartering with other vendors for food, trading his coffee for their produce. Mickey Todiwala\n\nEventually, he wants to earn money through passive income, like starting an ATM or vending machine business. Carvajal supplements his grocery bill by bartering with other farmers market vendors for food. He'll trade them some of his coffee in exchange for what they have in season. Another major expense for Carvajal: caring for his French bulldog, Toasty. In a given month, his share after splitting expenses with his girlfriend comes out to about $40 on his pet insurance and $60 for grooming.\n\nCoffee with a mission\n\nWhen asked about his goals for the future, Carvajal first thinks of paying it forward in the coffee world. His focus: Getting more Dominican-grown coffee on the map. Back in the 1900s, he says, the Dominican Republic used to export a lot more coffee, but in recent decades, the climate crisis and invasive coffee leaf rust has destroyed a lot of farmland.\n\nHector Carvajal is eager to put Dominican-sourced coffee on the map. He recently landed a deal to sell his coffee beans at Whole Foods stores across the northeastern U.S. next spring. Mickey Todiwala\n\n\"A lot of the farmers did not have the capital to reinvest back into their fields,\" Carvajal explains. \"We're making our way back little by little.\" It's also why it's so important to him to source his coffee from farmers in the Dominican Republic. In the early days of Don Carvajal Cafe, he connected with a Eddy Ramirez, a farmer in Jarabacoa, and spent a week there to get to know his family and their estate. \"I believe it's important to have a relationship with the coffee farmer, because at the end of the day, it creates more transparency between you, the producers and the end consumer,\" Carvajal says.\n\nHector Carvajal says it's important to him to source coffee beans from the Dominican Republic and spent a week in Jarabacoa getting to know the farmers who harvest his product.

{"text": "Stocks with high exposure to China could stand to gain if the country moves away from its Covid protocols next year, according to Jefferies. A continuation of China's \"zero-Covid\" policy has worried business leaders around the world who view the country as a key part of the global supply chain. But Desh Peramunetilleke, Jefferies' global head of microstrategy, said he expects China's reopening plan to become more formalized in the first half of the year before the country reopens in the second half. The Wall Street Journal reported progress on that front Thursday , saying China's leaders were targeting GDP growth of more than 5% next year as they ease Covid restrictions. \"Of the many issues facing China, end of zero COVID is the most definitive factor that will continue to support the market,\" Peramunetilleke said in a note to clients Wednesday. \"While there will be a few direct long-term beneficiaries such as airlines and casino operators, more broadly US companies with China exposure are likely to benefit as China's economy rebounds from both the re-opening and recent property market stabilization measures.\" With this in mind, Jefferies screened for stocks with sales exposure above 15% to China and Hong Kong. The chart below shows 10 of the names the firm found. Hotel stocks are among the most exposed. Las Vegas Sands has the most exposure at nearly 70%, while Wynn Resorts also made the list with just over 40% exposure. Both stocks have gained share value since the start of the year. And both have moved in line with news out of China over the course of the year. For instance, both got boosts in late November after the Chinese government granted resort operators provisional licenses to continue operating in Macau, which signaled progress away from Covid restrictions. Farther down on the list, electric vehicle maker Tesla has just over 25% exposure to the country. The company cut December output of one model at its Shanghai plant by more than 20%, Bloomberg first reported, due to cooling demand. Production in Shanghai lagged earlier in the year due to a combination of supply chain challenges and Covid restrictions. Apple is also considered one of the most-exposed stocks. A plant in China that is the largest producer of iPhones in the world was ordered to lock down for seven days in November under the country's Covid restrictions. Later in the month, plant workers protested amid broader demonstrations against the country's Covid restrictions . Tesla has dropped 55.5% this year, while Apple has shed 19.4%.", "label": "human"}

That's because space-time isn't flat \u2014 it's curved, and it can be warped by matter and energy.\n\nSo depending on our position and speed, time can appear to move faster or slower to us relative to others in a different part of space-time. And for astronauts on the International Space Station, that means they get to age just a tiny bit slower than people on Earth.\n\nThat's because of time-dilation effects. First, time appears to move slower near massive objects because the object's gravitational force bends space-time.\n\nPublic Domain\n\nThe phenomenon is called \"gravitational time dilation.\" In a nutshell it just means time moves slower as gravity increases.\n\nThat's why time passes slower for objects closer to the center of the Earth where the gravity is stronger.\n\nThat doesn't mean you could spend your life in a basement, just to outlive the rest of us here on the surface. The effect isn't noticeable on such a small scale. If you became a basement hermit, then across your entire lifetime you'd only age a fraction of a second slower than everyone else above ground.\n\nBut this concept gets pretty crazy when you start thinking about it:\n\nA watch strapped to your ankle will eventually fall behind one strapped to your wrist.\n\nYour head technically ages more quickly than your feet.\n\nTime passes faster for people living on a mountain than those living at sea level.\n\nTime gets even weirder though.\n\nThe second factor is something called \"relative velocity time dilation\" where time moves slower as you move faster.\n\nThe classic example of this is the twin scenario. One twin blasts off in a spaceship traveling close to the speed of light, and one twin stays behind on Earth. When the space-traveling twin returns to Earth, she's only aged a couple years, but she's shocked to find that her Earth-bound sister has aged over a decade.\n\nOf course no one has performed that experiment in real life, but there's evidence that it's real. When scientists launched an atomic clock into orbit and back \u2014 while keeping an identical clock here on Earth \u2014 it returned running ever so slightly behind the Earth-bound clock.\n\nThen time gets even more complicated because gravitational time dilation and relative velocity time dilation can happen at the same time. A good way to think about it is to consider the astronauts living on the International Space Station.\n\nCurrently, an international crew of seven live and work aboard the ISS, orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes, according to NASA.\n\nThey're floating about 260 miles above, where Earth's gravitational pull is weaker than it is at the surface. That means time should speed up for them relative to people on the ground. But the space station is also whizzing around Earth at about nearly five miles per second.\n\nThat means time should also slow down for the astronauts relative to people on the surface.\n\nYou'd think that might even out, but actually their velocity time dilation has a bigger effect than their gravitational time dilation, so astronauts end up aging slower than people on Earth.\n\nThe difference isn't noticeable though \u2014 after spending six months on the ISS, astronauts have aged about 0.005 seconds less than the rest of us.\n\nThat means that when former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly returned home in 2016 from his history-making, year-long stay on the ISS, he technically was 0.01 second younger than his twin astronaut brother \u2014 and now US senator \u2014 Mark Kelly who stayed on Earth.\n\nSo the next time you find yourself wishing the weekend would last longer, stay low to the ground and move really fast. It won't feel like your weekend got any longer, but technically you may gain a teeny, tiny fraction of a fraction of a second.\n\nRemember, time is relative.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As the new year began, the US job market showed signs of softening, with job openings falling to a five-month low in November.\n\nAccording to the Labor Department\u2019s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), job openings fell by 157,000 in November to 6.6 million. This was the lowest level since June, when there were 6.3 million job openings. \n\nThe decline comes despite a 2.6% rise in the US labor force participation rate, which rose to 63.9% in November. But the latest data shows the labor market may be slowing down, with the number of job openings down 11.9% over the year.\n\nThe decline in openings was seen across most sectors. Job openings in the leisure and hospitality sector fell by 80,000 to 1.2 million, while openings in the information industry fell by 57,000 to 614,000. The education and health services sector saw the greatest declines, with job openings falling by 79,000 to 1.4 million. \n\nThe data also shows that the pace of hiring is slowing. Total hires in November were 6 million, down from 6.3 million the previous month and 6.4 million in October. \n\nThe decline in job openings is seen as a sign that employers are feeling less confident in the economic outlook and are reducing their hiring in anticipation of economic weakness. It\u2019s also a sign that employers may be getting more selective in their hiring, as they look to find the best talent and wait for the right economic conditions to make offers.\n\nThe data also shows that workers are feeling less secure in their current jobs. The rate of job separations fell to 3.7 million in November, down from 3.9 million the previous month. The number of layoffs and discharges also decreased to 1.6 million in November, down from 1.7 million in October. \n\nWhile the data suggests that the labor market may be loosening up, economists caution against reading too much into the numbers. The data is just one month old and can be volatile, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a lot of people being unemployed, many employers have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels of hiring and there is still a lot of uncertainty in the job market,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for things to get back to normal.\u201d\n\nBut Zandi said that he does see some hope in the numbers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see job openings falling, as it suggests that employers are getting more cautious and are less willing to commit to new hires in a period of uncertainty,\u201d he said. \n\nThe decline in job openings could have a positive effect on wages in the long run, as it means employers may have to compete more for the best workers. But that remains to be seen.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that the labor market may be loosening up. While the decline in job openings could be seen as a sign of economic weakness, it could also be a sign of employers taking a more cautious approach to hiring and looking to find the right workers in a tight labor market.", "label": "machine"}

Asia's fourth-biggest listed company by market value will release detailed earnings on Jan. 31.\n\nRising global interest rates and cost of living have dampened demand for smartphones and other devices that Samsung makes and also for the semiconductors it supplies to rivals such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).\n\n\"For the memory business, the decline in fourth-quarter demand was greater than expected as customers adjusted inventories in their effort to further tighten finances...,\" Samsung said in the statement.\n\nIts mobile business' profit declined in the fourth quarter as smartphone sales and revenue decreased due to weak demand resulting from prolonged macroeconomic issues, Samsung added.\n\n\"Memory chip prices fell in the mid-20% during the quarter, and high-end phones such as foldable didn't sell as well,\" said BNK Investment's Lee, adding its display business was hurt due to client Apple's production delays at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China during the quarter.\n\nThree analysts said they expected Samsung's profits to dive again in the current quarter, with a likely operating loss for the chips business as a glut drives a further drop in memory chip prices.\n\nSamsung shares rose 1% in Friday morning trade, versus a 0.9% rise of the wider market (.KS11).

{"text": "The price of gasoline took a wild ride in 2020, and with 2021 almost upon us, it\u2019s difficult to predict what next year\u2019s prices may be.\n\nIn the first five months of the year, prices fell by an average of 3 percent, according to the US Energy Information Administration, while in the last five months they climbed back up by over 6 percent, including a 6.2 percent increase in December.\n\nThe price of gasoline has been driven largely by international and domestic events, including the ongoing pandemic, production cuts in the US, the OPEC+ agreement to reduce crude oil production, and fluctuations in the US dollar.\n\nThe pandemic has had an outsized impact on the price of gasoline. As people stayed home, drove less, and rode public transportation more, demand for gasoline fell drastically, leading to a steep drop in prices.\n\nAt the same time, the OPEC+ agreement led to production cuts in crude oil, which also drove up gasoline prices. As production in the US fell due to the pandemic, prices rose even higher.\n\nThe volatility of the past year makes it tough to predict what will happen in the coming year. The pandemic is still ongoing, and it\u2019s difficult to predict how much longer it will last. The US Energy Information Administration predicts that US production will remain relatively steady in 2021, although there are still uncertainties.\n\nOPEC+ also agreed to increase crude oil production beginning in January, and that could also lead to lower gasoline prices.\n\nThe US dollar has also been a factor in the price of gasoline. When the dollar is weak, gasoline prices tend to be higher, as the US imports more crude oil from abroad. The dollar has been largely unchanged since mid-2020, but economists expect it to strengthen next year.\n\nThe biggest wild card for 2021 is the vaccine. If it is successful in reducing the spread of the virus, it could lead to a recovery in demand for gasoline, and higher prices.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s difficult to predict what will happen with gasoline prices in 2021. The uncertainty could lead to prices that remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Consumers should keep an eye on global developments and be prepared for whatever 2021 may bring.", "label": "machine"}

And on Tuesday it revealed its latest electric car at CES 2023: the ID.7 sedan.\n\nThe ID.7 will compete with Tesla's uber-popular Model 3 when it goes on sale in the US, China, and Europe.\n\nIt follows up an onslaught of Volkswagen EVs launched over the last few years, including the ID.3 hatchback, the ID.4 SUV, and the ID.Buzz minivan.\n\n\n\nVW pegs range at up to 700 kilometres, or 435 miles. But that's according to the European testing standard, which is typically more generous than the US EPA.\n\nVW says the ID.7 will offer some fancier features, like a standard heads-up display and a massive 15-inch touchscreen.That's three inches bigger across than the display in VW's ID.4 SUV.\n\nPlus, the ID.7 features a new, advanced climate system that can start heating or cooling the cabin when the car senses its owner approaching with the key fob.\n\nThe direction of the air vents in the ID.7 is digitally controlled through the touchscreen.\n\nVW says this will improve user experience, but in my experience, regular vents with manual tabs work just fine.\n\nThere is one neat benefit to having the vents be electronically directed: They can move automatically to distribute cool or warm air better \u2014 like an oscillating fan.VW also says that the \"intelligent\" system will react when it detects the sun's glare inside the cabin \u2014 and adjust the air direction and temperature accordingly.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "What does Blackhawks defenseman Seth Jones think about the NHL rule that requires one player from every team to participate in the All-Star Game?\n\n\u2018\u2018That\u2019s probably why I got nominated this year,\u2019\u2019 he responded.\n\nIndeed, Jones has no illusions about why he\u2019s headed to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Feb. 3-4 for his fifth career All-Star appearance. It\u2019s simply because someone from the last-place Hawks had to go.\n\nFor the record, however, he understands the logic behind the rule, even if it leads to many deserving players not receiving invites.\n\n\u2018\u2018Before this rule happened, the whole starting lineup was Hawks, including [Corey] Crawford in net, for the West [in 2015],\u2019\u2019 Jones said. \u2018\u2018So you could still have situations like that. Say, Colorado. You could easily have [Mikko] Rantanen, [Nathan] MacKinnon and [Cale] Makar. It depends. Some guys are going to get the short end of the stick every year.\u2019\u2019\n\nJones will join Makar, Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey, Stars forward Jason Robertson, Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov, Coyotes forward Clayton Keller, Blues forward Vladimir Tarasenko and Predators goalie Juuse Saros on the Central Division All-Star team, which was announced Thursday.\n\nThree more players in each division will be determined by fan vote in the coming weeks, but there inevitably will be some snubs.\n\nPredators defenseman Roman Josi is objectively more deserving than Jones, for example, but Saros\u2019 selection excluded him. Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl has almost twice as many points as Ducks forward Troy Terry (60-32), but Connor McDavid obviously was chosen over him.\n\nOn the other hand, the NHL\u2019s diverse selection process ensures all fans headed to All-Star weekend festivities \u2014 hosted by the Panthers this winter \u2014 have someone to root for. There are pros and cons.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s always a fun time,\u2019\u2019 Jones said. \u2018\u2018You play three-on-three hockey in front of a good crowd and showcase your skill.\u2019\u2019\n\nJones hinted he would have had more fun if his vacation during the preceding week \u2014 the Hawks\u2019 bye week \u2014 hadn\u2019t been \u2018\u2018cut short\u2019\u2019 by his sudden commitments in Florida, but he will be a good sport about it.\n\nHe won\u2019t use this hollow selection to hype himself up, however. He remained as self-critical as usual Friday when evaluating his season so far.\n\n\u2018\u2018It has been up-and-down,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Offensively, I don\u2019t like the numbers I have. And then it has been a struggle defensively, as a team in general, keeping the puck out of our net. . . . We haven\u2019t gotten a lot of \u2018O\u2019-zone time this year as a team, so [I\u2019m focusing on] just taking advantage of when I do have that time.\u2019\u2019\n\nHawks coach Luke Richardson has taken note of Jones\u2019 attitude.\n\n\u2018\u2018He\u2019s probably disappointed more than anybody,\u2019\u2019 Richardson said. \u2018\u2018I talked to him [Thursday] and just said, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s looking up; you scored last game.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n\nJones entered play Friday ranked 13th among NHL defensemen in ice time, averaging 24 minutes, 41 seconds, but his results have been poor. Not only does he rank 85th in points per minute, but his 41.1% scoring-chance ratio at five-on-five ranks 172nd of 185 defensemen.\n\nThat\u2019s much more of a Hawks problem than a Jones problem \u2014 just like his All-Star selection was much more because of his teammates\u2019 mediocrity than his excellence. But both are realities nonetheless.\n\n\u2018\u2018He\u2019s such a good skater that he can join a rush later on [rather] than early on,\u2019\u2019 Richardson said. \u2018\u2018[But] then we turn the puck over and he\u2019s scrambling back, and now he\u2019s tired. If he does that for 27 minutes . . . that\u2019s a lot. That affects his game.\n\n\u2018\u2018He can\u2019t be the savior for everybody on this team. He\u2019s just got to play his position, play it well, and we\u2019ve got to do our job around him.\u2019\u2019", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The FTC wants to ban noncompete agreements, which stop workers from moving to competitors or starting their own similar businesses.\n\nUnder the FTC's proposed rule, employers wouldn't be able to impose a noncompete, and past ones would be rescinded.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan said that noncompetes undermine competition and competitive conditions.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

The Commission argues that noncompetes are an unfair method of competition, violating the Federal Trade Commission Act \u2014 and their ban would broaden opportunities for American workers, putting almost $300 billion more in their pockets annually.\n\n\"Why are we doing this? Basically, in short, there's a whole raft of economic evidence that now documents the ways in which these noncompete clauses undermine competition and competitive conditions,\" FTC chair Lina Khan said.\n\nTheoretically, noncompetes are meant to stop primarily high-level employees from jumping ship to other companies, bringing proprietary information and other knowledge with them.\n\nBut, in practice, noncompetes are more sweeping. Over 30 million workers are made to sign noncompetes, according to the National Employment Law Project, and over a third of those workers are asked to sign the agreements after they've already accepted a job. In some cases, workers can't start their own businesses similar to the ones they're working in.\n\n\"If you're a phlebotomist or a journalist and you think that you can't practice your trade in the area in which you work for a long period of time, that's still significantly chilling. It could still mean that you don't match with the optimal job that you want,\" Elizabeth Wilkins, director of the office of policy planning at the FTC, said. \"You can't get a raise, and you can't ask for the kinds of things that you might be able to ask for if you could get a better job.\"\n\nAgreements are sometimes foisted upon low-wage workers, preventing them from jumping ship to a different restaurant or retail store offering higher pay. Among workplaces paying an average of less than $13 an hour, 29% have noncompetes for all workers, according to a report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nOne famous example of noncompetes: Stopping sandwich sales. In Illinois, sandwich chain Jimmy John's settled a lawsuit from the state's attorney general in 2016, and said it would not enforce noncompetes on its workers. Workers had been banned from working at any business within two or three miles of a Jimmy John's that made over 10% of its revenue from selling \"submarine, hero-type, deli-style, pita, and/or wrapped or rolled sandwiches\" for two years.\n\nThe White House has already taken aim at noncompetes as a barrier to competition. President Joe Biden signed an executive order last summer encouraging the FTC to ban or limit the agreements. Now, the FTC is doing just that, with its proposed rule outlawing employers from entering into, maintaining, or making it seem as though a worker is subject to a noncompete. Independent contractors and unpaid workers would be subject to the rule. Under it, employers would have to rescind current noncompetes and let workers know they're doing so.\n\nThe public will have 60 days to submit comments on the proposed rule, which the FTC will then review and potentially incorporate into a final rule.\n\nAnecdotally, some businesses have recently been more dogged in enforcing noncompetes amidst labor shortages in attempt to keep workers. The rule is likely to attract ire from businesses which deploy noncompetes.\n\nCrucially, noncompetes are one mechanism for maintaining what's called monopsony power \u2014 which means that, due to a lack of competition, employers have more power over the labor market, and the ability to do things like set wages at lower levels than a more competitive market would create.\n\nThe Treasury Department previously found that wages are 15% to 20% lower currently than they would be in a perfectly competitive labor market, showcasing the monopsony power employers still hold. One reason for those suppressed wages, according to Treasury: Noncompetes.\n\n\"If this rule were to be finalized and go into effect, workers that are currently stuck in place, effectively, would now be able to freely move to another job,\" Khan said, adding: \"I would think that would basically force employers to compete more vigorously over workers in ways that should lead to higher wages. That should lead to improved working conditions.\"", "label": "human"}

I was mesmerized by the depth and detail of what I witnessed.\n\nI was deeply moved as I slowly walked through the exhibits, stopping frequently to read and hear personal accounts of the atrocities Black people faced \u2014 and the triumphs they achieved \u2014 during their first 250 years on American soil.\n\nColumnists bug Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\n\n\nIt was a history with which I am very familiar, but there was something about taking it all in at once.

The S & P 500 is on pace to end the quarter up 6.2%, through Thursday's market open. That's sandwiched between the other two major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track to gain 15% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite set to lose 2.5%. As a result, the benchmark S & P 500 index will see its first quarterly advance this year, limiting the full-year loss to a little less than 20%. The quarter has proven a welcome respite from what will still end up as the largest annual decline for stocks since the global financial crisis of 2008. More than a fifth of all S & P 500 stocks climbed 20% or more in the last three months of the year as inflation cooled, the Federal Reserve slowed its campaign of higher interest rates and the job market stayed strong. CNBC Pro looked at the 10 best-performing stocks in the index this quarter, using data from FactSet through Wednesday's close. Universal Health Services led the way, adding 58.1% in the fourth quarter. While the wider market has had a dismal December, the health-care stock has seen a 6.5% rally this month that lifted it to a year-to-date advance of 7.5% in 2022. Hedgeye analyst Tom Tobin recently named UHS a long idea with a potential upside of as much as 40%, according to StreetAccount. Other analysts are less optimistic after the big run, with just 28% rating it buy or overweight, 50% a hold and 22% underweight or sell, FactSet data shows. The average analyst expects its price to drop almost 8% in the next 12 months. Boeing is close behind, soaring 55.6% this quarter. The jet maker and defense contractor had awaited a congressional extension requiring a new safety standard in 737 Max cockpits , which it received in December. The company's shares have slipped 6.4% this year. Boeing is favored on Wall Street. Nearly four out of every five analysts rate the company overweight or buy. The average analyst has a price target that implies an upside of 5.5%. \"Global air travel has largely recovered, airlines are placing orders for new planes at a near-record pace, the MAX and 787 are delivering and production rates are ramping, and China is de-risked from the MAX skyline,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak in a Dec. 14 note to clients. He called Boeing a top aerospace pick for 2023. Caterpillar is higher by about 46% in the fourth quarter, turning what had been a year-to-date decline into a 15.8% gain. The construction equipment maker popped in late October after third-quarter sales and earnings topped analyst estimates. About two out of every five analysts covering Caterpillar rate the stock overweight or buy. But the average analyst expects the price to be little changed over the coming year. \u2014 CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe interception of a United States Air Force reconnaissance jet by a Chinese fighter over the South China Sea last month should be seen as a potential warning of how easily, and quickly things can go terribly wrong \u2013 raising the risk of a deadly military confrontation between the two powers, analysts say.\n\nThe incident in question occurred on December 21 over the northern part of the South China Sea in what the US says was international airspace.\n\nPerforming what the US military deemed an \u201cunsafe maneuver,\u201d a Chinese navy J-11 fighter jet flew within 20 feet of the nose of a US RC-135 Rivet Joint, an unarmed reconnaissance plane with about 30 people on board, forcing the US plane to take \u201cevasive maneuvers to avoid a collision,\u201d according to a statement from the US Indo-Pacific Command issued on December 28.\n\nIt released a video of the incident showing the Chinese fighter flying to the left of and slightly above the four-engine US jet, similar to the Boeing 707 airliners of the 1960s and \u201970s, and then gradually closing in on its nose before moving away.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s Southern Theater Command, in a report on China Military Online, had a different interpretation of the encounter, saying it was the US jet that \u201cabruptly changed its flight attitude and forced the Chinese aircraft to the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a dangerous approaching maneuver seriously affected the flight safety of the Chinese military aircraft,\u201d it said.\n\nIt released its own video of the incident, shot from the fighter jet, that appeared to show the RC-135 moving closer to and behind the fighter.\n\nAviation and military experts contacted by CNN who watched the two videos said it appeared the Chinese jet was firmly in the wrong and had no reason to get as close as it did to the American plane.\n\n\u201cThe 135 was in international airspace and is a large, slow, non-maneuverable aircraft. It is the responsibility of the approaching smaller, fast, maneuverable aircraft to stay clear, not to cause a problem for both aircraft,\u201d said Peter Layton, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer, now with the Griffith Asia Institute.\n\n\u201cThe intent of the interception was presumably to visually identify the aircraft and the fighter could have stayed several miles away and competed that task. Getting closer brings no gains,\u201d he said.\n\nRobert Hopkins, a retired US Air Force officer who flew similar reconnaissance jets, also pushed back at the Chinese interpretation of events.\n\n\u201cThe (Chinese) response is so far divorced from reality that it is fictional. An unarmed, airliner-sized aircraft does not aggressively turn into a nimble armed fighter,\u201d said Hopkins.\n\nBut Hopkins also said the US military risked blowing the incident out of proportion in saying the US jet had to take \u201cevasive maneuvers,\u201d a term he described as \u201coverly dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are no different than a driver adjusting her position to avoid a temporary lane incursion by an adjacent driver,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cThe US response is pure theater and needlessly creates an exaggerated sense of danger.\u201d\n\nBut while the incident itself was safely managed by the US pilots, experts agreed the small distance between the US and Chinese planes evident in the videos leaves little room for error.\n\n\u201cFlying aircraft close to each other at 500 miles per hour with unfriendly intentions is generally unsafe,\u201d said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cAt that range, an unexpected maneuver or an equipment issue can cause a terrible accident in under a second,\u201d Herzinger said.\n\nAnd Herzinger said the current state of US-China military relations means accidents could quickly turn into armed confrontation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that the PLA has effectively wrecked any kind of hotlines or discussion forums for addressing potential incidents with the United States. If an intercept does go wrong, there are fewer options than ever for senior officers to limit potential escalation,\u201d he said.\n\nLayton pointed out another potential danger that could lead to escalation. As seen in the US video, the Chinese aircraft is armed with air-to-air missiles.\n\n\u201cThe 135 is an unarmed aircraft. Why does the PLAN consider it necessary to intercept carrying missiles when the intent was to visually identify the aircraft? Doing this is potentially dangerous and could lead to a major and tragic incident,\u201d Layton said.\n\nBut in a regular press briefing on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the incident was just the latest in a string of US provocations that threaten stability in the region.\n\n\u201cLet me point out that for a long time, the US has frequently deployed aircraft and vessels for close-in reconnaissance on China, which poses a serious danger to China\u2019s national security,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.\n\nThe Chinese Southern Theater Command said the US reconnaissance jet was flying \u201cin the vicinity of China\u2019s southern coastline and the Xisha Islands\u201d \u2013 known in the West as the Paracels \u2013 where Beijing has built up military installations.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacfic Command said the RC-135 was in international airspace and was \u201clawfully conducting routine operations.\u201d\n\nChina claims almost all of the vast South China Sea as part of its territorial waters, including many distant islands and inlets in the disputed body of water, many of which Beijing has militarized.\n\nThe US does not recognize these territorial claims and routinely conducts operations there, including freedom of navigation operations through the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThe US\u2019s provocative and dangerous moves are the root cause of maritime security issues. China urges the US to stop such dangerous provocations, and stop deflecting blame on China,\u201d the Foreign Ministry\u2019s Wang said.\n\nBut Washington has consistently pointed the finger back at China in these intercepts, which date back decades.\n\nIn the most infamous incident in 2001, a Chinese fighter jet collided with a US reconnaissance plane near Hainan Island in the northern South China Sea, leading to a major crisis as the Chinese pilot was killed and the damaged US plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The US crew was released after 11 days of intense negotiations.\n\nAfter a string of incidents last year involving intercepts of US and allied aircraft by Chinese warplanes, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the PLA\u2019s actions were escalating and \u201cshould worry us all.\u201d\n\nLayton said he thinks Beijing may have been trying to provoke the US military last month, and get it on video.\n\n\u201cThere was no possible gain by the fighter flying so close except to create an incident \u2013 that was handily recorded on a high quality video camera the fighter\u2019s crew just happened to have and be using. The incident seems very well planned by the PLAN, if rather risky,\u201d he said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".\n\nWhat a year it was in the world of sports in 2022! From record-breaking performances to major changes in the landscape, it\u2019s been a year of historical moments.\n\nAs we look back at the year that was, here are some of CNN Sports\u2019 biggest stories of 2022:\n\n1. Victory in Tokyo: After years of preparation, the U.S. Olympic team was finally able to take to the field in Tokyo, as the Olympics were postponed in 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. After months of anticipation, the United States came out on top in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s categories, taking home a combined 25 medals, the most for any country.\n\n2. Serena Williams\u2019 Grand Slam: In the same year that she became the oldest-ever Grand Slam champion, Serena Williams added another landmark to her illustrious career: a Grand Slam victory at the French Open. Williams, who turned 40 in 2021, is the first 40-plus player ever to win a major and the oldest women\u2019s singles champion in history.\n\n3. Liverpool\u2019s Football Dynasty: Liverpool\u2019s dominant year in football culminated in a remarkable sixth Champions League trophy, the most of any English club. Liverpool\u2019s feats in 2022 included clinching the Premier League title, reaching the FA Cup Final and winning the Club World Cup.\n\n4. Messi\u2019s Goodbye: After more than two decades of providing magical moments for Barcelona, Lionel Messi left the club in the summer of 2022. Despite the departure of their beloved forward, Barcelona was able to retain the La Liga title, beating arch-rival Real Madrid to it by two points.\n\n5. The Impact of COVID-19: While the global pandemic forced the world of sports to adapt, the biggest impact was felt in the Paralympic movement. The International Paralympic Committee was forced to postpone the Summer Games in 2021, but in 2022 the event made a triumphant return. The Games also featured a new disability sport, e-sports, which saw Britain\u2019s Tom Sykes crowned as the first champion.\n\n6. Formula One\u2019s Big Year: Formula One had a breakout year in 2022, as the sport saw record-breaking performances and the emergence of a new star. Max Verstappen won the world title for the first time, and new recruit Mick Schumacher made an instant impression, becoming the youngest ever driver to win a race at the age of 21.\n\n7. Rise of Esports: Esports continued to grow in popularity throughout the year, with major tournaments like the Overwatch League, League of Legends World Championships, and Fortnite World Cup being held. As well as established tournaments, new leagues and competitions, such as the Valorant Champions Tour and Apex Legends Global Series, were added.\n\n8. Tennis Reborn: The beginning of 2022 saw a resurgent tennis scene, with Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka, and Rafael Nadal all reclaiming Grand Slam titles. Meanwhile, rising star Daniil Medvedev captured his first major title at the U.S. Open and the world\u2019s top female players united to form the WTA Players\u2019 Council.\n\n9. Baseball Strike: Baseball was thrown into disarray in 2022, as the players\u2019 union went on strike in late June in protest of the league\u2019s failure to address issues around pay and player safety. After an extended break, the league managed to restart in August, with the World Series being played in October.\n\n10. The Year of the Humanitarian: The year 2022 saw some incredible achievements off the field, with numerous sports stars demonstrating their commitment to making the world a better place. Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling was named Person of the Year by Time Magazine for his tireless activism and fundraising, while LeBron James set up a foundation to support the fight against racial injustice in the US.\n\nIt was certainly an eventful year in the world of sports, one which we won\u2019t forget any time soon. As we look forward to the new year, we\u2019ll have plenty to look forward to as we continue to enjoy some of the greatest sporting moments in history.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Lawyers in the US are looking to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic with a more client-focused service environment. The emphasis will be on better alignment with clients, greater efficiency, and a reimagining of lawyer compensation models, according to a recent Thomson Reuters Institute report.\n\nThe pandemic has presented law firms with a unique opportunity to adjust their practices and become more efficient, according to the report. As businesses of all sizes face financial hardships, many law firms are reevaluating traditional service and fee models in order to better align their services with clients\u2019 needs.\n\nThe report examined various ways in which law firms are changing their service models to adjust to the post-pandemic economic environment.\n\nOne of the more significant changes has been a move away from the traditional hourly billing model. Many firms are instead offering value-based billing options and fixed fee arrangements, which can help to reduce client costs and uncertainty.\n\nThe report also highlighted the rise of alternative legal service providers, such as attorneys-for-hire, contract lawyers, and virtual legal service providers. These options provide greater flexibility for clients and can help to reduce costs by allowing them to access specific legal services without committing to a long-term relationship.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also sparked a surge in demand for ESG (environmental, social, and governance) compliance services. In particular, the report noted an increased focus on creating socially responsible law firms, which can help to attract and retain talent and establish credibility with clients.\n\nIn addition, the report found that law firms are placing a greater emphasis on digital technologies. This includes investments in legal technology to help automate processes, create efficiencies, and create a more modern client service experience.\n\nFinally, the report discussed the potential for law firms to alter lawyer compensation models in the post-pandemic era. This includes incentives for lawyers to stay with a firm long-term, as well as shared profits and other incentives for firms to invest in the development of their lawyers.\n\nOverall, the report concluded that the coronavirus pandemic has pushed many law firms to make difficult changes to their service models, fee structures, and compensation models in order to be more competitive and remain viable in a post-pandemic economy. As a result, many firms are better positioned to meet the needs of their clients and remain financially secure in the years ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, it has been reported that some customers of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX have asked a bankruptcy court to keep their names confidential. The customers said they were worried that their identities could be revealed if the court moved to liquidate some of the company\u2019s assets.\n\nThe issue is of particular concern to FTX customers because the exchange was recently hit with a class-action lawsuit, which alleges that its business practices were deceptive. If the court were to move to liquidate some of FTX\u2019s assets, customers said they were concerned that their identities could be exposed.\n\nThe FTX customers have asked the bankruptcy court to keep their names confidential in order to protect their privacy and ensure that the court\u2019s process runs smoothly. It is unclear at this time if the court will grant their request.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Tua Tagovailoa threw five touchdown passes and set a Sugar Bowl record, and No. 4 Alabama rolled to a 45-21 victory over No. 15 Kansas State in the Capital One Sugar Bowl on Wednesday night.\n\nTagovailoa, a Heisman Trophy finalist, passed for 318 yards and led the Crimson Tide to 28 second-half points. He became the first Alabama quarterback to throw five touchdown passes in a bowl game since Jeff Rutledge in 1979 and set the Sugar Bowl record for touchdown passes in a single game.\n\nAlabama (14-1) ended the season with 12 straight wins and claimed the school's 17th SEC championship with a dominant performance over Kansas State. The Crimson Tide had 467 total yards, including 149 rushing, and scored touchdowns on five of their first six possessions of the second half.\n\n\"They're an incredibly talented team and that's why they won the SEC championship,\" said Kansas State coach Bill Snyder. \"They made some exceptional plays and we just couldn't get it to where it needed to be.\"\n\nWide receiver Henry Ruggs III had four touchdown catches, the most ever in a Sugar Bowl, and a team-high 136 yards on seven receptions. Running back Josh Jacobs added a 2-yard touchdown run and 115 yards on just 12 carries.\n\nKansas State (9-4) took an early 14-7 lead on touchdown runs by quarterback Alex Delton, but was hampered by turnovers and sacks. The Wildcats were unable to consistently move the ball in the second half and were outscored 28-7 over the final two quarters.\n\nDelton completed 11 of 27 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown, but was also intercepted twice and sacked four times. Running back Alex Barnes rushed for 94 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries, but had a costly fumble in the second half that led to one of Ruggs' touchdown catches.\n\n\"We made some mistakes early on in the second half that proved to be costly,\" said Snyder. \"We have to learn from these mistakes and move forward.\"\n\nAlabama made quick work of Kansas State's lead and regained the advantage with two quick touchdowns in the second quarter. Tagovailoa threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Ruggs, then connected with Jerry Jeudy for a 24-yard score to give the Crimson Tide a 21-14 halftime lead.\n\nAlabama then took over in the second half, with Tagovailoa throwing three touchdown passes to Ruggs in the third quarter. Tagovailoa added another touchdown pass to Irv Smith Jr. in the fourth quarter, before Jacobs capped the scoring with a 2-yard touchdown run.\n\nIt was a fitting way for Tagovailoa to end his sophomore season, as he finished with 43 touchdown passes, 841 rushing yards, and 3,966 passing yards. Alabama's defense was also impressive, holding Kansas State to just 313 total yards and keeping the Wildcats off the scoreboard in the second half.\n\nThe Crimson Tide won their fourth straight Sugar Bowl and sixth of the Nick Saban era. The victory also extended Saban's record to a remarkable 12-0 against former assistants.\n\n\"We are just really proud of our team,\" said Saban. \"They played well tonight and did a good job of executing our game plan. I'm really proud of the way they competed and I'm really proud of our seniors for the way they've led this team throughout the season.\"\n\nWith the win, Alabama now awaits its College Football Playoff matchup, which will be announced on Sunday. The Crimson Tide is expected to be in contention for one of the four spots and is looking to win its sixth national championship in the Saban era.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Le scorgevi dalle pagine dei magazine e ne rimanevi inspiegabilmente attratta. Le It Girls non vestivano propriamente alla moda, avevano uno stile preciso che spesso rifuggiva da quello dei grandi brand, o meglio, amalgamavano alto e basso con disinvoltura, illudendoti che la replica fosse possibile. Protagoniste del loro tempo, personalit\u00e0 tanto affascinanti quanto inafferrabili, di loro sapevi giusto quel tanto che bastava al copycat modaiolo (che di rado riusciva) e nulla pi\u00f9. Naturalmente dotate di una bellezza fuori dal comune- nonch\u00e9 di una certa noncuranza che inspiegabilmente dava risultati sorprendenti- queste ragazze inconsapevoli dettavano tendenza, orientando sogni e aspirazioni di generazioni a colpi di carisma e personalit\u00e0. Ma oggi, in un mondo che trabocca di influencers omologate, ragazze perfette con una routine divulgata al secondo, ha ancora senso parlare di It Girls?\n\nAlexa Chung, It Girl assoluta degli anni 2000, durante la London Fashion Week del 2017 Melodie Jeng Getty Images\n\nDa Clara Bow a Chlo\u00eb Sevigny passando per Edie Sedgwick: l\u2019evoluzione della It Girl\n\nIn realt\u00e0, la prima volta che si registra l\u2019uso del termine \u201cIt\u201d \u00e8 nel 1904 quando lo scrittore Rudyard Kipling scrive il racconto Mrs. Bathurst. Per caratterizzare la protagonista, per l\u2019appunto la Signora Bathurst di cui il marinaio Vickery della storia \u00e8 innamorato, Kipling usa queste parole: \u201cNon \u00e8 una questione di bellezza, per cos\u00ec dire, n\u00e9 necessariamente un bel discorso. \u00c8 semplicemente questo. Alcune donne rimangono nella memoria di un uomo una volta che le si \u00e8 viste camminare per strada\". Ecco abbozzato in poche parole il fattore \u201cIt\u201d: una seduzione non ostentata che attrae chiunque, un\u2019innata coolness, come diremo noi oggi, che affascina senza apparente spiegazione.\n\nClara Bow, prima It-Girl della storia, in un ritratto del 1927 John Kobal Foundation Getty Images\n\nUn\u2019espressione che diventa ancor pi\u00f9 ricorrente ed efficace negli anni Venti quando la scrittrice e sceneggiatrice britannica Elinor Glyn pubblica It and Other Stories e tratteggia in modo chiaro i contorni di un concetto fino ad allora troppo fumoso, spiegando che \u201cit\u201d altro non \u00e8 che \u201cla qualit\u00e0 posseduta da alcune persone, che attira tutti con la sua forza magnetica\u201d. La narrazione- che segue le vicende di Betty Lou, ragazza di umili origini che s\u2019innamora del proprietario del grande magazzino per cui lavora- viene ben presto trasposta al cinema (a noi arriva con il titolo di Cosetta) interpretata da quella che ormai viene riconosciuta come l\u2019antesignana di tutte le It Girls: Clara Bow. Madre schizofrenica, padre violento e un\u2019infanzia trascorsa nei bassifondi di Brooklyn, la sua bellezza diventa viatico per il successo, con Hollywood che la riscatta ad attrice simbolo dell\u2019et\u00e0 del jazz, perfetta incarnazione di una flapper dall\u2019attitudine mannish che si veste a piacimento e se ne frega delle regole.\n\nEdie Sedgwick e Andy Warhol nel 1965 Walter Daran Getty Images\n\nUn vissuto tormentato e una vocazione ribelle che hanno caratterizzato anche Edie Sedgwick, factory girl indissolubilmente legata a Warhol, ricoverata per disturbi alimentari in anni in cui il termine era ancora lontano dall\u2019essere tristemente popolare, icona degli anni Sessanta e della loro moda. Dosi massicce di eye-liner a sottolineare lo sguardo, capelli corti a mostrare orecchini chandelier, e micro gonne votate alla causa di quel certo non so che insito in ogni It Girl che si rispetti. \u00c8 proprio con Edie Sedgwick che prende forma il fenomeno cos\u00ec come lo conosciamo noi oggi; quello di ragazze anticonformiste dalla vita avvolta in un alone di semi-mistero, dotate di un gusto ricercato che pare al contempo, replicabilissimo. Un\u2019attitudine ben descritta in un articolo del 1994 di Jey McInerney che, per il New Yorker, segue per qualche giorno la It Girl dei tempi moderni: un\u2019allora diciannovenne Chlo\u00eb Sevigny cui le ragazze affibbiano il titolo di nuova sacerdotessa della moda nonostante le mise improbabili. Dirette discendenti del paradigma incarnato dell\u2019attrice americana, le It Girls degli anni 2000 (da Alexa Chung a Lindsay Lohan) sono forse le ultime che possono dirsi degne di tale appellativo. Vuoi l\u2019abuso del termine che ne ha fatto la stampa di settore, vuoi l\u2019attitudine festaiola che da trasgressione si \u00e8 trasformata in regola per cui al party vali solo se ti fotografano, il carattere (cos\u00ec come lo stile) unico e irripetibile che aveva caratterizzato le It Girls, oggi pare non esserci pi\u00f9.\n\nChlo\u00eb Sevigny al Met Gala Cocktail Party del 2016 Taylor Hill Getty Images\n\n\u201cThat Girl\u201d: la nuova icona femminile nell\u2019epoca dell\u2019iper condivisione\n\nSveglia presto e necessaria beauty routine. Acqua con limone e via alla scrittura del diario, di fatto una to do list di doveri e piaceri della giornata. Sessione di fitness, colazione con caff\u00e8 e fiocchi d\u2019avena, lavoro, spesa, pranzo (insalata + frullati vitaminici) e tempo da dedicare alla lettura. Non \u00e8 fantascienza, bens\u00ec la giornata tipo di una \u201cThat Girl\u201d che, come intuibile, di fatto con la moda ha poco a che fare. Nemmeno con l\u2019iper produttivit\u00e0 e la perfezione a tutti i costi, chiosano da YouTube e TikTok le paladine del nuovo trend che, giurano, \u00e8 invito a diventare la versione migliore di s\u00e9 stesse. Poco importa che tra i commenti ai suddetti video ne compaiano, ogni tanto, di allarmanti, con ragazze che nel tentativo di replicare il modello, finiscano poi con il cadere in depressione. Va in effetti notato come per molte altre, invece, la nuova estetica che scandisce la quotidianit\u00e0 di momenti sani e positivi, abbia rappresentato una svolta al vivere sereno e al prendersi cura della propria persona nonostante i ritmi serrati di studio e lavoro che il contemporaneo necessariamente richiede. Piaccia o no, quello della \u201cThat Girl\u201d \u00e8 un nuovo ideale che ispira, anche se lontanissimo da quello dell\u2019originale It Girl che ammaliava il suo pubblico con lifestyle sfuggenti e indecifrabili e proprio per questo magnetici. La rivoluzione digitale ha rotto la coltre di mistero e l\u2019attrattiva dell\u2019imperfezione: il nuovo mantra \u00e8 postare ogni minuto e il pi\u00f9 impeccabili possibili, secondo un programma social che, pi\u00f9 che ispirare, sembra costringere senza scampo. Non solo; se le Chlo\u00eb e le Alexa erano esseri unici e irripetibili e per questo rari, i social media oggi forniscono l\u2019illusione a tutte di poter diventare una It Girl. In fondo basta prendere un trend tra i mille che a cadenza regolare proliferano su Tik Tok e Instagram e volgere su di s\u00e9 la telecamera. E il gioco, narcisistico e un po' banale, \u00e8 fatto.", "label": "human"}

As Insider's Kali Hays reported on Thursday, Musk has most recently cut a major fertility benefit for Twitter employees.\n\nThe food options available for Twitter staff are one of the employees' perks which has taken a hit. Two freebies that are expected to stay are snacks and coffee, per Schiffer, who cited the internal email.\n\nTwitter was planning to charge workers for office lunches that were previously free of charge in the company canteen, The New York Times reported on November 11, citing sources. Shortly after the report, Musk tweeted that free lunches were costing Twitter more than $400 per meal because \"almost no one came to the office.\"\n\nTracy Hawkins, a former Twitter employee, quote-tweeted Musk, saying his claim was a \"lie\" and the meals cost between $20 and $25 a day per person.\n\nTwitter's cafeteria menu then changed, according to a report by The Times. One Twitter worker told the publication that the menu at the company's New York office no longer listed grilled shrimp as an option. The cafeteria had a salad bar, as well as two types of macaroni and cheese, the employee told The Times.\n\nIn an email to employees in late November, Twitter said it was making changes to its food and beverage program to \"better control costs\" and would \"partially\" pay for some options, Insider reported. The company added that it would still provide coffee and snacks for all employees.\n\nTwitter informed staff in the same email that several benefits were being \"discontinued,\" including home internet costs, wellness and productivity allowances, and training expenses.\n\nTwitter didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "outbreak.\n\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed at least nine people in China and infected hundreds more has dominated headlines in recent weeks, leaving many people on edge. Chinese state media outlets have sought to reassure the public, touting the country's response and experience in handling past public health crises.\n\nChina's official news agency Xinhua reported on Friday that the country's top medical experts had declared the virus \"preventable and controllable\" and urged people to remain calm.\n\nThe government is taking a comprehensive approach to contain and prevent the disease, said Huang Yan, director of the Guangdong Provincial Health Committee, as quoted by Xinhua. She also announced a plan to \"support and effectively use the advanced technology to control the situation\" and called on citizens to pay close attention to health and take the necessary protective measures.\n\nThe Chinese government has also ordered hospitals to double-check the diagnosis of patients with fever to rule out the possibility of an infection, according to Xinhua. It has also implemented measures to stop the spread of the virus, such as closing off public areas and suspending public transportation.\n\nOther state media outlets have joined in to provide guidance to the public on health and safety. The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, released an article about the importance of proper hygiene and the steps people can take to avoid infection. China Central Television (CCTV), the state-run broadcaster, has aired interviews with medical experts explaining how the virus is spread and how to protect oneself.\n\nThese media reports seek to provide reassurance amid a climate of fear and confusion. The public health emergency also underscores the need for governments to respond quickly to potentially dangerous health threats, says Professor Zha Weida of Beijing University's School of Public Health.\n\n\"Faced with the epidemic of this novel virus, China should be commended for responding promptly and transparently. This demonstrates to the international community that the Chinese government is serious about public health,\" she said.\n\nState media is also emphasizing the success China has had in containing past epidemics. The SARS outbreak in 2003 was a wake-up call to the country, and it has since taken a more proactive approach to preventing and controlling contagious diseases.\n\n\"In the last 10 years, China has formulated and improved multiple regulations and laws in order to ensure the country's public health and safety,\" said Professor Zha.\n\n\"The Chinese government has set up an infectious disease monitoring system, which is able to track and monitor diseases from the moment they emerge until the moment they are contained. It has also increased investment into health services and research.\"\n\nThe Chinese public should rest assured that the government is doing everything possible to contain the virus and protect citizens from further harm, Professor Zha added.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "With the pandemic still raging on and the job market being highly volatile, many people are eagerly wondering when the economy will finally begin to rebound. Even more concerning is the changing landscape of the job market\u2014some fields are booming, while others are on the brink of extinction. However, a trend that is becoming increasingly evident among employers is the rise of \u201cquiet hiring.\u201d\n\nThis hiring method, though relatively new, could become the go-to style of recruitment in the U.S. in 2023, according to HR expert Rebecca Garvey. Speaking to CNBC_papers, Garvey explained that she expects the trend to continue due to its cost-effective, efficient and successful nature. \n\n\u201cQuiet hiring is an approach to talent recruitment that is increasing in popularity among employers due to its cost savings,\u201d Garvey said. \n\nThe concept is simple\u2014instead of advertising open positions, businesses rely on their networks of former employees and referrals from current workers for help. It\u2019s believed that if a former employee has had a successful experience working for a particular organization, they\u2019ll be more likely to refer their friends or colleagues.\n\nThe result is that employers can avoid costly job boards and advertising campaigns. This, in turn, helps them to keep their hiring costs to a minimum while still being able to access a pool of talented applicants.\n\nGarvey explains that businesses can benefit from quiet hiring in other ways too. She states that relying on referrals and previous employees can help employers save time on the recruiting process as they don\u2019t have to wade through as many resumes and applications. \n\nQuiet hiring also ensures that businesses are able to access a pool of talented workers who are a great fit for their organization. By relying on referrals from their networks, employers can be sure that any applicant they take on has already been vetted to some extent. \n\nAccording to Garvey, businesses should begin preparing for the growing trend of quiet hiring. \n\n\u201cI think employers need to start getting familiar with quiet hiring and using it more,\u201d she said. \u201cIf employers don\u2019t start using it, they may be at a disadvantage in 2023 because other businesses are likely to be relying more and more on this approach.\u201d\n\nGarvey recommends that businesses develop a robust referral program and ensure that they have good relationships with their current and former employees. She also stresses that businesses should make sure they\u2019re utilizing social media outlets such as LinkedIn to access even more talent.\n\nOverall, Garvey expects that quiet hiring is going to become an increasingly popular option for businesses in 2023 due to its cost savings, efficiency and success rate. Businesses should start preparing for this trend now in order to be successful in the future job market.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "When it comes to making the most of your money, few financial moves are as impactful as saving regularly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a plan in place for the next time you get a raise.\n\nAs a financial planner and founder of MYRA Wealth, a financial planning firm, I\u2019ve seen clients who can successfully grow their savings and investments when they receive a raise. Here are my top three tips for maximizing your money whenever you get a pay raise.\n\n1. Automate your savings and investments.\n\nIf you want to make sure your raise goes to your financial goals, the best thing you can do is to set up automatic payments from your paycheck to the accounts you have set up to save and invest. You can automate your deposits to retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as to other long-term investment accounts, like a taxable brokerage account.\n\nBy setting up automatic deposits, you can ensure that your raise is set aside for its intended purpose, and you won\u2019t have to think about it or transfer the money manually. This can also make it easier to develop a habit of consistently adding to your savings and investments.\n\n2. Make room in your budget for fun.\n\nIt\u2019s important to save and invest a portion of your raise, but it\u2019s equally important to give yourself room in the budget to enjoy it, too. A lot of people want to put the entire raise towards their financial goals but that\u2019s not always realistic or necessary.\n\nThink about using a portion of your raise to do something fun \u2014 whether that\u2019s a weekend getaway, a class or hobby, or a new wardrobe, you can use your raise as a way to reward yourself and make your financial goals more achievable. Even small splurges here and there can give you something to look forward to, which can make saving and investing easier.\n\n3. Use your raise to pay down debt.\n\nAnother way to make the most of your raise is to use it to pay down your debt. Having too much debt can prevent you from achieving your financial goals, so the sooner you can pay it off, the better.\n\nIf you have high-interest debt, such as credit cards or student loans, consider using a portion of your raise to make extra payments. This can help you pay down your debt faster and save money on interest over time.\n\nSaving and investing for the future is important, but it\u2019s also important to recognize that getting a raise is an opportunity to enjoy the present \u2014 and make progress towards your long-term goals. By using your raise strategically, you can make the most of the money you receive and enjoy the rewards now and in the future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Bankman-Fried, the embattled Los Angeles-based cryptocurrency derivatives exchange operator and former Fort Worth, Texas hedge fund, is set to enter a not guilty plea in an ongoing federal criminal fraud case.\n\nThis announcement comes after Bankman-Fried, headed by former XRP executive Luke Price, was charged in June 2020 with fraud and related activities in connection with a purported scheme to steal millions of dollars from customers.\n\nThe firm is alleged to have unlawfully converted investor funds to purchase expensive vehicles and real estate properties and then disguised those activities as profit-generating investments. Price and his associates also allegedly used customer accounts to falsely inflate asset values, thereby masking the losses and concealing the real financial condition of the firm.\n\nThe US government has accused Bankman-Fried of securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and other alleged violations. In its complaint, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that Price and his associates \u201ctook customer funds to finance a lavish lifestyle, acquire vehicles, real estate, and other personal items.\u201d\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on January 11th in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Price and his co-defendants are set to enter their not guilty pleas at a hearing on December 31st.\n\nIn a statement released by Bankman-Fried, the firm expressed its commitment to cooperate with the criminal investigation and that they intend to \u201cvigorously defend against all charges.\u201d\n\nThe news of Bankman-Fried\u2019s not guilty plea follows a challenging year for the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange and its shareholders. The company has faced widespread criticism due to its lack of regulatory oversight, lack of consumer protections, and the significant financial losses sustained by its customers.\n\nFurthermore, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has initiated disciplinary proceedings against the firm for allegedly failing to register with the regulatory body before conducting securities business in the United States.\n\nHowever, the Bankman-Fried case has set a new precedent in how regulators may prosecute cryptocurrency fraud and underscores the need for greater oversight of the industry as a whole.\n\nThe implications of the case will undoubtedly be felt across the legal and finance sectors. Financial services firms have already begun to adopt more stringent client onboarding procedures, money laundering policies, and asset management structures in response to the news of the Bankman-Fried case.\n\nThe outcomes of the case will likely spark a more stringent regulatory landscape, with greater focus on customer protections and accountability.\n\nFurthermore, this case is likely to have profound implications on the roles of lawyers and lawyers\u2019 ethical duties. In recent years, the surge in legal technology and the complexity of cases involving cryptocurrency and other financial instruments has drastically changed the legal landscape.\n\nThe Bankman-Fried case will undoubtedly serve as a reminder for law firms to better equip their lawyers with the necessary tools, knowledge, and understanding of the latest legal regulations and enforcement trends, in order to protect their clients from the legal pitfalls that can come with operating in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAs well, the case has highlighted the importance of updating lawyer compensation models to better align with the rising costs associated with the increased complexity of cases, as well as to incentivize lawyers to stay on top of the latest industry developments.\n\nIn this ever-evolving landscape, the Bankman-Fried case will no doubt serve as a wake-up call for many companies in the legal, financial, and cryptocurrency spaces alike to reassess their processes and ensure the protection of clients and their assets.", "label": "machine"}

Al cabo del tiempo, vendes una de tus criptomonedas por 25 euros. El valor de compra, \u00bfser\u00edan los 10 euros por los que compraste la primera o los 20 de la segunda?\n\nAqu\u00ed es donde entra en juego el m\u00e9todo FIFO (First In First Out), que es el orden que tiene en cuenta Hacienda para calcular lo que has ganado por la venta. Este m\u00e9todo considera que se est\u00e1n vendiendo las criptomonedas que se compraron primero, no las m\u00e1s nuevas.\n\nPor lo tanto, la respuesta a la pregunta de cu\u00e1l ser\u00eda el valor de compra (10 o 20 euros) son 10 euros, que se corresponde con el valor al que compraste la primera acci\u00f3n\n\nImpuesto de Patrimonio y miner\u00eda de criptomonedas\n\nComo ya se ha comentado antes, si solo decidiste comprar criptomonedas y no hiciste ninguna operaci\u00f3n (que te supusiera ganancias o p\u00e9rdidas) con ellas, no es necesario que las criptomonedas aparezcan en tu declaraci\u00f3n de la renta, pero hay una excepci\u00f3n, y es cuando, por el valor total de tus activos, tengas obligaci\u00f3n de presentar el Impuesto de Patrimonio.\n\nEste var\u00eda de unas comunidades aut\u00f3nomas a otras, pero, con car\u00e1cter general, tienen la exigencia de hacerlo todas aquellas personas f\u00edsicas con bienes o derechos con un valor superior a 2 millones de euros.\n\nHay un detalle m\u00e1s a tener en cuenta respecto a las criptomonedas y la declaraci\u00f3n de la renta: es el caso de que act\u00faes en la blockchain y ejerzas la miner\u00eda.

{"text": "2022 was not a kind year for the broader emerging market complex. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) has dropped 22% year to date. That puts the fund on pace for its biggest one-year loss since 2008, when it tumbled 50%. Three key drivers of this underperformance were steep declines in economic activity in China due to the country's zero-Covid policy, a strong dollar and higher interest rates around the world. Looking ahead, strategists and some widely followed investors on Wall Street see a better year ahead for emerging markets, especially as China starts to unwind its strict Covid protocols and the dollar eases off its highs. \"We're going to have a spending boom in China, at least in the first half of the year,\" said Mehran Nakhjavani, emerging market strategist at MRB Partners. \"This means that, with a market already exposed heavily to consumer earnings \u2026 there's going to be really good support for Chinese stocks,\" which will boost emerging market equities more broadly. China reopening Earlier this month, the Chinese government implemented sharp changes to its Covid policies, allowing domestic travel and quarantines at home in a move to keep businesses running. Among the changes, people will no longer need a negative Covid test to travel to a different part of the country. Local authorities have also removed many testing requirements. The changes from Beijing came just a few weeks after protests erupted across China over the country's strict Covid controls . Demonstrators clashed with authorities in several major cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, after 10 deaths in a building fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang in late November was blamed on the old quarantine policy. \"When you look at the recent events of the past few weeks, it's pretty clear that zero-Covid is out the window. It's over,\" Nakhjavani said. Now, China will \"tolerate very high levels of infection.\" CNBC Pro's guide to investing in 2023 The Nasdaq had its worst year since 2008. These are the best and worst performers and what to expect in 2023 Oil expected to stay volatile in 2023, but the price could depend on China reopening The crypto investing outlook for 2023 after a 60% decline in bitcoin this year These ETF strategies can help investors navigate a murky 2023 for markets Nakhjavani isn't the only one who sees China reopening as a positive catalyst for emerging markets. JPMorgan chief global markets strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a Dec. 8 note that he sees emerging market stocks returning 14% to investors in 2023 , citing the potential for strong economic growth in China as the country reopens for part of the bounce. The iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) has dropped 26% in 2022, on pace for its worst year on record. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite is down 15%, headed for its biggest one-year loss since 2018 \u2014 when it shed 24.6%. The dollar Another catalyst that could drive gains in emerging markets is a potential decline in the dollar. A weaker dollar tends to boost emerging markets as debt in U.S. dollars becomes easier to service. The U.S. dollar has been on fire in 2022, rising more than 8% against a basket of major currencies. That would be the currency's biggest annual gain since 2015, when it jumped 9.5%. At one point this year, the greenback traded at levels not seen since May 2002. This year's gains came as the Fed lifted interest rates to fight a 40-year high in inflation. However, the dollar has cooled off dramatically since reaching those 20-year highs in September. Since then, the greenback has fallen more than 9%. Billionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach said he thinks the dollar has already reached a top and that it should continue to weaken. \"I do think the dollar has peaked out ... which does suggest that investments in emerging markets like emerging market equities are probably going to be a good winner in 2023,\" Gundlach, the CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said Dec. 6. \"It's time to buy emerging market equities if you have an annual allocation switch. ... I really do think the time is right.\" Another potential catalyst for emerging markets could come in the form of a recovery in the semiconductor industry, which would in turn boost stocks in Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 two major industry hubs. Semiconductor companies have been hurt by continued supply chain disruptions as well as supply/demand imbalances. On Wednesday, Micron Technology reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results, with management noting : \"The industry is experiencing the most severe imbalance between supply and demand in both DRAM and NAND in the last 13 years.\" In the past year, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has dropped more than 34%.However, MRB Partners' Nakhjavani thinks that the industry downturn could reach a bottom over the next two quarter, priming it for a strong second half of 2023. \"That would help South Korea and Taiwan,\" he said. The iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (EWT) has fallen nearly 40% in 2022, while the EWY \u2014 which tracks the South Korean stock market \u2014 has shed 27%. 'A game of two halves' To be sure, not everyone is as sanguine on emerging markets. David Lubin, head of emerging markets economics at Citi, thinks emerging markets can have a good year in 2023, but only after a rocky start due to continued hawkishness in U.S. monetary policy. \"Emerging markets in 2023 looks to us like a 'game of two halves', with the latter part of the year arguably much more benign for investors than the start,\" he said in a note earlier this month. \"The most obvious near-term question for EM is whether inflation remains a big enough threat to need more monetary tightening. We think not, due to an overall weak growth outlook, though central banks will remain wary of anything that could spark an acceleration.\" \"What EM wants, ideally, is to get to a place characterized by both loosening U.S. monetary conditions and a strong recovery in China. Since we think that these two conditions won't properly materialize until the second half of the year, the nearer term will remain characterized by a strong dollar, tightening U.S. monetary policy and Chinese uncertainties related to both Covid and real-estate investment,\" Lubin added. The Fed hiked rates through 2022, with other central banks following suit in their respective regions. Most recently, the Bank of Japan changed its yield curve control policy to allow the 10-year Japanese government bond rate to move 50 basis points above or below its 0% target. The news sent ripples through global financial markets , pressuring risk assets. \"The move was taken as an indication that no central bank could be relied on to remain dovish,\" said Mark Haefele, global wealth management chief investment officer at UBS. Meanwhile, the Fed indicated at its December meeting that it sees the \" terminal rate \" \u2014 the level at which it would feel comfortable stopping its rate hikes \u2014 at 5.1%. That's a half point higher than a September forecast for a terminal rate of 4.6%. How to play emerging markets in 2023 Regardless, there are several ways for investors to get exposure to emerging markets. Perhaps the easiest way is by investing in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). The fund is invested in more than 1,200 companies across a host of developing markets. Alibaba, Vale, Tencent and Taiwan Semiconductor are among EEM's biggest holdings . The fund \u2014 which has an expense ratio of 0.68% \u2014 is heavily exposed to China, with the country accounting for 31.55% of its total market value. Another vehicle through which to play emerging markets is the First Trust Emerging Markets Small Cap AlphaDex ETF (FEMS) . The fund is the best-performing emerging markets ETF this year, according to Morningstar, with a year-to-date return of just over 1%. It also has a strong track record, outperforming 98% of funds in its category over the past 10 years. Its expense ratio comes in at 0.8%. The ETF's managers assign different weightings to its holdings based on \"what we view as favorable growth and value characteristics,\" said Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president at First Trust Portfolios. Other variables such as price to book and return on assets are also taken into account when assigning weights. For investors looking to invest in individual emerging markets, they can turn to the iShares MSCI ETFs tracking markets such as Turkey, Mexico, and South Korea, for example. And, while buying shares of individual companies can be difficult, some of the biggest EM companies are also listed on U.S. exchanges, among them JD.com , HDFC Bank , Petrobras and SK Telecom . Shares of Chinese e-commerce company JD.com have dropped about 18% year to date, but are up more than 14% in the fourth quarter. India's HDFC Bank, meanwhile, has had a stellar 2022, gaining just over 3%. Petrobras is only down 5% year to date, while South Korea's SK Telecom has dropped 22%. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

Down here, oxygen levels are adequate for our brains and lungs. At much higher altitudes, our bodies cannot function properly.\n\nBut if climbers want to summit Mount Everest, the tallest peak in the world at 29,029 feet (8,848 meters or 5.5 miles) above sea level, they have to brave what's known as the \"death zone.\" This is the area with an altitude above 8,000 meters, where there is so little oxygen that the body starts to die, minute by minute and cell by cell.\n\nIn the death zone, climbers' brains and lungs are starved for oxygen, their risk of heart attack and stroke is increased, and their judgment quickly becomes impaired.\n\n\"Your body is breaking down and essentially dying,\" Shaunna Burke, a climber who summited Everest in 2005, told Business Insider. \"It becomes a race against the clock.\"\n\nIn 2019, at least 11 people died on Everest, almost all of whom spent time in the death zone. It became one of the deadliest seasons on Everest in recent memory.\n\nSome expedition companies blamed these deaths on crowding, noting that the peak became so choked with climbers during a rare period of good weather that people were stuck in the death zone for too long. On May 22, 2019, 250 climbers attempted to reach the summit, The Kathmandu Post reported, and many climbers had to wait in line to go up and down.\n\nThese extra, unplanned hours in the death zone might have put the 11 people who perished at higher risk, though it's hard to determine the specific causes of each death.\n\nOne mountaineer said climbing Everest feels like 'running on a treadmill and breathing through a straw'\n\nThere is a deadly traffic jam on Mount Everest as climbers are forced to wait in the \"death zone.\" Twitter/@nimsdai\n\nAt sea level, the air contains about 21% oxygen. But at altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen levels are 40% lower.\n\nJeremy Windsor, a doctor who climbed Everest in 2007 as part of the Caudwell Xtreme Everest Expedition, told Everest blogger Mark Horrell that blood samples taken from four mountaineers in the death zone revealed that the climbers were surviving on just one-quarter of the oxygen they needed at sea level.\n\n\"These were comparable to figures found in patients on the verge of death,\" Windsor said.\n\nFive miles above sea level, the air has so little oxygen that even with supplementary air tanks, it can feel like \"running on a treadmill and breathing through a straw,\" according to mountaineer and filmmaker David Breashears.\n\nClimbers need to acclimate to the lack of oxygen\n\nA lack of oxygen results in myriad health risks. When the amount of oxygen in your blood falls below a certain level, your heart rate soars to up to 140 beats per minute, increasing your risk of a heart attack.\n\nClimbers have to give their bodies time to acclimate to the lung-crushing conditions in the Himalayas before attempting to summit Everest. Expeditions generally make at least three trips up the mountain from Everest Base Camp (which is higher than nearly every mountain in Europe at 17,600 feet), going a few thousand feet higher with each successive trip before making a push for the top.\n\nOver the course of those weeks at high altitudes, the body starts to make more hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body) in order to compensate. But too much hemoglobin can thicken your blood, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. That can lead to a stroke or the accumulation of fluid in your lungs.\n\nOn Everest, a condition called high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is common \u2014 a quick stethoscope check can reveal a clicking sound as fluid that's leaked into the lungs rattles around. Other symptoms include fatigue, a feeling of impending suffocation at night, weakness, and a persistent cough that brings up white, watery, or frothy fluid. Sometimes the coughing is so severe it can crack or separate ribs.\n\nClimbers with HAPE are always short of breath, even when resting.\n\nIn the death zone, your brain can start to swell, which can lead to nausea and a form of psychosis\n\nAcclimatization to death-zone altitudes simply isn't possible, high-altitude expert and doctor Peter Hackett told PBS.\n\nOne of the biggest risk factors at 26,000 feet is hypoxia, a lack of adequate oxygen circulation to organs like your brain. If the brain doesn't get enough oxygen, it can start to swell, causing a condition called high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). Essentially, it's HAPE for the brain.\n\nThis swelling can trigger nausea, vomiting, and difficulty thinking and reasoning.\n\nAn oxygen-starved brain can cause climbers to forget where they are and enter a delirium that some experts consider a form of high-altitude psychosis. Hypoxic climbers' judgment becomes impaired, and they've been known to do strange things like start shedding their clothes or talking to imaginary friends.\n\nOther possible dangers include insomnia, snow blindness, and vomiting\n\nWhen climbing in the \"Death Zone,\" your brain receives one-quarter of the oxygen it needs. Lhakpa Sherpa\n\nBurke said that while climbing, she suffered from a constant, relentless cough.\n\n\"Every second or third breath your body gasps for air, and you wake yourself up,\" she said.\n\nThe air was so thin that she was unable to sleep properly.\n\n\"Humans will start to deteriorate,\" Hackett added. \"Sleeping becomes a problem. Muscle wasting takes place. Weight loss takes place.\"\n\nNausea and vomiting from altitude-related illnesses, including HAPE and HACE, also cause a decrease in appetite. The glare from the endless snow and ice can cause snow blindness \u2014 temporary vision loss, or burst blood vessels in your eyes.\n\nTemperatures in the death zone never rise above zero degrees Fahrenheit. \"Any exposed skin freezes instantly,\" Burke said.\n\nA loss of blood circulation to climbers' fingers and toes can cause frostbite, and in severe cases \u2014 if the skin and underlying tissues die \u2014 gangrene. Gangrenous tissue often needs to be amputated.\n\nAll this physical weakening and impaired vision can lead to accidental falls. Fatigue is ever-present, according to Burke.\n\n\"It takes everything to put one foot in front of the other,\" she said.\n\nPoor decision-making can also lead climbers to forget to clip back into a safety rope, to stray from the route, or fail to properly prepare life-saving equipment like oxygen tanks.\n\nMountaineers climb through the death zone in a day, but they can wind up waiting in line for hours\n\nClimbers can only spend 20 minutes on Everest's summit before having to descend. Lhakpa Sherpa\n\nClimbing in the death zone is \"a living hell,\" as Everest climber and 1998 NOVA expedition member David Carter told PBS.\n\nTypically, climbers attempting to bag the summit try and make it up and down in a single day, spending as little time as possible in the death zone before returning to safer altitudes. But this frenzied push to the finish line comes at the end of weeks of climbing.\n\nLhakpa Sherpa, who's reached Everest's summit nine times (more than any other woman on Earth) previously told Business Insider that the day a group attempts to summit Everest is by far the most difficult period of the trek.\n\nIn order to summit successfully, everything must go right. Around 10 p.m., climbers leave Camp Four at 26,000 feet. The first chunk of their climb is done in the dark, lit by starlight and headlamps.\n\nAbout seven hours later climbers typically reach the summit. After a brief rest filled with celebrations and photographs, the expeditions turn around, making the 12-hour trek back to safety and arriving (ideally) before nightfall.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Based on the initial market action of 2023, it appears investors' New year's resolutions were something like this: Keep Big Tech in the penalty box, place some bets on foreign-stock outperformance, while feasting on bonds of all kinds to capture healthy yields and maintaining some hope that the elusive soft economic landing remains possible. No one needs the reminder that turn-of-the-year resolve often dissolves in the face of changing circumstances. Recall that at the start of last year, the popular bet was for a smooth and painless rotation from expensive growth stocks to financials and cyclicals. It didn't last: The S & P financial sector trounced utilities by seven percentage points in just the first week of 2022. From that point through the rest of the year, utilities outperformed financials by a yawning 17 percentage points. Still, the markets have revealed some clear preferences in the early going, some of which have simply carried over from 2022. These include the continued unwinding of the massive valuation premium and over-optimistic investor sentiment in the Nasdaq giants. Tech unwind continues Underway since November 2021, this deflation of the tech favorites entered a new phase recently with the topping pattern in Apple shares and urgent liquidation in Tesla , which has cost it some three-quarters of the 1,800% surge the stock enjoyed in the two years leading up to its late-2021 peak. It's been common to cast this action as largely a response to higher interest rates, which reduce the present value of distant cash flows. But rates were always just part of the story both on the way up and down. In fact, since the 10-year Treasury yield peaked on Oct. 24, the Nasdaq 100 is down nearly 4% while the equal-weighted S & P 500 has gained 8%. Sinking profit forecasts colliding with still-rich valuations tell the more relevant story. Since mid-2022, consensus forecast 2023 earnings for Amazon have declined by 30%. For Alphabet , it's close to a 20% drop. These companies once had reliable-seeming growth when growth was scarce, they over-hired believing the good times would last and analysts over-extrapolated the pandemic-era growth surge. One could argue that the greater part of the tech reckoning has by now occurred. The forward price/earnings ratio on the Nasdaq 100 has indeed tumbled from 31 a year ago to under 21 today. Some stocks that led the way lower arguably became thoroughly washed out and inexpensive. Some investors clearly came into the year feeling that, for instance, Meta Platforms and PayPal fell into this category of busted \"de-risked\" growth stocks, each of them up 8% last week. Yet the Nasdaq 100 's premium to the overall S & P 500 remains at 25% \u2014 higher than at any point in the decade before the Covid pandemic hit. And the history of prior tech busts, such as after the 2000 market peak, suggest this group can have a long period in the wilderness even after they stop going down, lagging the broader tape for years. Foreign stocks over U.S.? And the broader tape, as measured by the equal-weighted S & P 500, continues to act better than the top-heavy headline index. This egalitarian basket, buyable via the Invesco S & P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) , is up 16% from the autumn low, is down less than 12% from its record high and has broken to a new cycle high against the traditional S & P 500. The big growth stocks' poor positioning and performance is also a factor in an emerging preference for overseas markets. American tech-stock dominance was a big part of US indexes' vast outperformance over the rest of the world for the past 15 or so years. There are now hints of a potential reversal. Non-U.S. markets as a group \u2014 see the iShares ACWI ex-US ETF (ACWX) \u2014 was up more than 4% last week against 1.5% for the S & P 500. The dollar is near a seven-month low. China is reopening and Europe's markets are skewed toward value sectors and exporters. Bank of America global strategist Michael Hartnett issued a call to \"Buy the world\" versus the U.S. for those and other reasons. Citi's global strategists Friday downgraded US equities to underweight, saying European stocks, in particular, are priced more for a potential profit slide than are American shares. Such calls for an international comeback have been made many times in the past decade to little avail, though it could well be that the moment now is more ripe. That U.S. profit forecasts are too high is a widely shared view, and a reasonable one, though it's hardly a sure thing that the market is oblivious to this. Low expectations Morgan Stanley shows this chart plotting the forward consensus S & P 500 earnings tally against the index's forward P/E as proof that profits will fall a good deal. Perhaps so, though one can also read this as the market generally anticipating turns in the earnings trend, and likely a good part of the past year's compression in valuation reflects a risk that profits have more room to fall. It's also worth noting that the current Wall Street projection of 4% S & P 500 earnings growth is, somewhat surprisingly, the lowest year-ahead forecast in at least 35 years, according to Deutsche Bank. And this includes a number of years when earnings ended up negative \u2013 and in some of those years, stocks did not decline (1998, 2012, 2015, 2020). Put this into the file of evidence that, whatever this market's problems, upbeat expectations are not among them. Bears have exceeded bulls for 40 straight weeks in the AAII retail-investor poll for the first time ever, active managers in the NAAIM positioning survey showed an historically low 39% equity exposure last week and the final weeks of 2022 saw heavy flows out of equity funds. None of which means the market has absorbed all that a tricky macro environment has to throw at it. Stocks celebrated evidence of declining wage growth and services-sector prices on Friday , after three weeks of tightly coiled sideways trading right at the down-20% level of 3800 for the S & P 500. It remains a downtrend, until proven otherwise and the Federal Reserve could certainly once again push investors back on their heels for prematurely celebrating a potential end to tightening moves. Yet strong consumer incomes and low debt-service obligations among households and companies are buffers, keeping the soft-ish landing scenario alive for now. Can housing and manufacturing retrench for a bit to decompress the economy, while overall activity muddles through? No one knows, but neither can anyone foreclose on the chance. Henry McVey, head of global macro at KKR & Co., wrote on Friday, \"We are in a bottoming process where supply, sentiment and valuation (especially on the credit side) appear somewhat attractive, but unrealistic margin assumptions and a strong U.S. dollar mean that this process will take a lot longer than normal to play out.\" The attractiveness of credit is being heeded, with heavy flows into bond funds absorbing a massive rush of new corporate issuance last week, a healthy sign that the capital-markets' circulatory system is functioning well. Higher yields, with investment-grade indexes offering 5%, are popularly said to present tough competition for stocks. Superficially, yes. But the presence of safe yield \u2013 or, in fixed-income parlance, \"carry\" \u2013 in a portfolio can also serve to cushion against equity volatility and in fact allow investors to better shoulder the risk that stocks bring with them. The recession predictions, based on a long history of data relationships involving the yield curve and Leading Economic Indicators, can't be disproved either, leaving the tape caught between a tough-talking Fed and a vigil for the economy to give way. If nothing else, though, the starting point for 2023 is better for an investor than it was a year ago. Back then, one was buying the S & P 500 at 21-times expected earnings, could grab no more than 1.8% in yield from 10-year Treasuries and the Fed had all of its tightening ahead of it. Now, the S & P is under 17 and at the 20-year average, with the 10-year delivering double the yield and the Fed just about done lifting rates. It doesn't mean things are cheap and forward-returns compelling, but it pays to recall that when asset prices and valuations fall, risk is coming out of the markets and potential future returns are being restored.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".\n\n\n\nIn ancient Egypt, the mummy-making process of a deceased person was highly symbolic and included the removal of the brain \u2014 but it was likely done a little differently than you might expect.\n\nRather than pulling the brain out of a dead person's nose, as many believe, the organs were likely broken up and scrambled, a paleo-pathologist from the University of Arizona tells Business Insider.\n\nThe mummification process was essential to ancient Egyptians' understanding of what happened to a person after death and was used to preserve bodies and protect them from decomposition. It was a lengthy, complex process that took place over 70 days and required knowledge of anatomy and embalming techniques.\n\nCleansing the body of its organs, including the brain, was an essential part of the process and is believed to be the first step in ensuring the afterlife for the dead. Ancient Egyptians viewed the brain as a useless organ and therefore, an unimportant organ to preserve, says Eftychia (Effie) Stathopoulou, an anatomy professor in the department of Pathology at the University of Arizona and an expert in ancient Egyptian mummification and paleo-pathology.\n\nSo while they didn't pull the brain out through the nose, that doesn't mean they didn't take it out at all.\n\n\u201cThe techniques of brain removal in ancient Egypt were not as carefully documented as in later periods of history,\u201d Stathopoulou said. \u201cBut it is clear that the brain was removed prior to mummification and this was probably done in a number of ways.\u201d\n\nStathopoulou speculates that they most likely used a hook to puncture the cranial cavity, and then proceeded to \u201cscramble\u201d the contents of the skull to remove the brain material.\n\nIn 2015, Stathopoulou and her team of researchers at the University of Arizona conducted a study to test out their hypotheses. For the experiment, the researchers used a CT scanner to observe a human skull from the 19th century and created a 3D model of the brain\u2019s sinuses. Then, they used a crochet hook, a tool similar to those used by ancient Egyptians for medical practice, to see how effective it could be in removing brain material from the skull.\n\nTheir results, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, showed that the crochet hook was effective in scraping brain material off the sinus walls of the skull, proving that the ancient Egyptians could have easily used the same technique to remove brain matter.\n\n\u201cWe felt the experiment was a great success,\u201d Stathopoulou said. \u201cIt provided direct evidence to how brain removal may have been carried out, confirming our hypothesis and giving us more insight into this process.\u201d\n\nThe crochet hook experiment wasn\u2019t the first of its kind, however. In 1993, a team of researchers conducted a similar experiment and found similar results.\n\nBy conducting these experiments, Stathopoulou and her team of researchers not only provide insight into the mummification process, but also dispel the longstanding myth of ancient Egyptians pulling brains out of dead bodies through the nose.\n\nThe mummification process was essential to the ancient Egyptians' understanding of life after death and continues to fascinate researchers today. By providing evidence that the brain removal process was likely quite different than what was previously thought, Stathopoulou and her team of researchers have made a significant contribution to the understanding of this ancient ritual.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "(Photo: Ra2 Studio/Shutterstock)\n\nDigital photography has democratized the medium. More people are taking more photos than ever before, and they're sharing them online with friends and family in record numbers. It's easy to place the blame on the camera (or your smartphone) if your images aren't as nice as some others you see online, but by following a few guidelines you can improve the quality of your snapshots\u2014without having to shell out big bucks for a new camera. Keep these 10 easy tips in mind next time you head out to capture the world around you. And if you have any tips that have helped you take better pictures, please share them in the comments section.\n\n1. Get Basic Composition Down\n\nUse the rule of thirds when learning to compose images (Photo: Jim Fisher) (Jim Fisher)\n\nThe heart of a photograph is its composition\u2014the position of different elements in a frame. The easiest rule of thumb to learn and remember is the Rule of Thirds(Opens in a new window). Basically, you'll want to break your frame into nine squares of roughly equal size. Try and align the subject of your photo along these lines and intersections and imagine the main image divided over these nine boxes. This gives you a more dramatic, visually interesting shot than one where you subject is located dead center. Many cameras and smartphones have a rule of thirds grid overlay that you can activate when shooting.\n\n2. Adjust Exposure Compensation\n\nAs long as you aren't shooting in full manual mode, your digital camera is making decisions that determine the exposure of a photo\u2014in English, how light or dark the shot appears. Generally speaking, a camera looks at a scene and tries to determine the appropriate exposure based on the correct lighting of a gray card, which is why there are special scene modes for snow\u2014without them, the camera would try to make the white snow gray.\n\nIf a photo is too light or dark you can either delve through the dozens of scene modes that are available in modern point-and-shoot cameras, or simply dial in a bit of exposure compensation. Many cameras have a physical button or dial for this, identified by a +/- symbol. If your photo is too dark, move the scale up above zero; if it's too light, move it down a bit.\n\n3. Choose the Right Shooting Mode\n\nYour camera is likely to have scores of shooting modes, ranging from fully automatic operation to very specific scene modes. If you're shooting fast action you can put the camera into Shutter Priority (\"S\" or \"Tv\") mode and increase the speed at which a photo is taken\u2014setting it to 1/125 second or faster will help to freeze action, and for really quick subjects (like the hummingbird below), use as short a speed as possible to freeze motion, or a longer one to add motion blur to the flapping wings.\n\nUse shutter priority to freeze moving subjects (Photo: Jim Fisher) (Jim Fisher)\n\nIn lower light you can use Aperture Priority (\"A\" or \"Av\") mode to make sure as much light is entering the lens as possible, or if you're shooting landscapes on a tripod you can close the lens's iris to increase depth of field, keeping everything in sharp focus from the foreground to the horizon. If you're a DSLR shooter, you're more likely to use the A or S modes, while point-and-shoot cameras will often feature more specific modes that cater to activities like sports, low-light use, or landscape shooting.\n\n4. Think About Lighting\n\nPay attention to how much light you have and where it's coming from when taking your photos. If you're shooting outdoors, be careful not to take photos of a person when the sun is at their back, unless you want to make a portrait with some dramatic flare (make sure to dial in positive EV adjustment if you do). If you're grabbing a photo in front of a monument or landmark and you want to make sure it's not overexposed, use some fill flash instead to make your backlit subject as bright as the background. You may have to manually activate the flash, as there's a good chance that the camera will think that it's unnecessary on a bright day.\n\n5. Use Your Flash Wisely\n\nUse fill flash for backlit subjects (Photo: Jim Fisher) (Jim Fisher)\n\nMany a photo has been foiled by a flash firing too close to a subject. If your friends and family look like Casper the Friendly Ghost when you photograph them, chances are that you're too close when snapping your photos. If you need to activate the flash, back up a bit and zoom in to get the proper framing. If things are still too bright\u2014or too dark\u2014check and see if flash compensation is an option. Many cameras allow you to adjust the power of the flash, which can help to add better balance to your flash-assisted photos. Adding just a little bit of light makes it possible to fill in shadows, resulting in a more natural-looking photo.\n\n6. Change Your Perspective\n\nMost snapshooters and beginners will stand on two legs and snap shots from eye level. While this is fine for many images, it's not always ideal. If you've got a camera with a tilting screen you can more easily shoot from a low or high angle to get a different perspective on your subject.\n\nGet low to the ground when photographing pets (Photo: Jim Fisher) (Jim Fisher)\n\nIf you don't have a tilting LCD, think about getting down low to the ground to get the best shots of pets and toddlers\u2014you'll want the camera at their eye level to get an image that stands out. You don't have to pay for every shot with a digital camera, so play around with different angles and camera positions until you've found one that captures a moment and stands out from the crowd.\n\n7. Watch Your White Balance\n\nYour camera will try and set white balance automatically based on the type of light in which you're shooting. Different light casts different types of color\u2014sunlight is very blue, tungsten lighting is yellow, and fluorescent is a bit green. In many cases, the camera will automatically detect what type of lighting you're under and adjust the color in photos so that they look natural.\n\nSet your white balance properly (Photo: Jim Fisher) (Jim Fisher)\n\nBut when White Balance isn't right, you can get results like you see above\u2014the image on the left is correctly balanced, and the one on the right is way off. If you're shooting under mixed lighting, or if the camera is just having a hard time figuring things out, you can set the white balance manually. On most point and shoots you'll have to dive into the shooting menu to adjust this, but many SLRs have a dedicated White Balance button, often labeled \"WB.\" You can correct color in the included Mac or Windows photo editing apps later on, but you'll get better-looking photos if you get the white balance right in the first place.\n\n8. Use a Tripod or Monopod\n\nSometimes, the best way to get your shot perfect is to take some extra time. Using a tripod will allow you to set up framing, and can come in handy\u2014along with your camera's self-timer\u2014for getting that shot of you and the kids in front of Mount Rushmore. You can get away with an inexpensive tripod if you're a point-and-shoot user, although spending a bit more on a brand like Manfrotto(Opens in a new window) or MeFoto(Opens in a new window) will result in much less frustration than with the bargain brands that you'll find at the local five and dime. Mirrorless system and SLR owners should definitely put care into selecting a tripod, as a set of legs and a head that are sturdy enough to hold the camera are paramount.\n\nPeak Design Travel Tripod (Photo: Jim Fisher) (Jim Fisher)\n\nIf you're more of a run-and-gun shooter, a monopod\u2014which is just like it sounds, a tripod with two of its legs missing\u2014will help you stabilize your shots. Great for use at zoos and sporting events, a monopod is supplemented by your two legs in order to add stability to your camera\u2014without the sometimes-cumbersome setup and breakdown required with a good tripod.\n\n9. Be Selective\n\nIt's easy to take hundreds of photos in a few hours when shooting digitally. But don't just dump your memory card and upload all of the images to Facebook. You should spend some time going through your photos so you can eliminate redundant shots and discard photos that may be out of focus or poorly composed. It's better to post a few dozen great photos by themselves rather than the same good photos hiding among hundreds of not-so-good ones.\n\n10. Don't Forget to Post-Process\n\nConsider using software to organize and edit your photos. Apple Photos and Microsoft Photos support basic organization, as well as a number of editing tools. If you're more of a phone editor, check out VSCO or Snapseed. Performing some very basic editing on a photo can help improve its quality drastically. Cropping a bit can help with composition, nd you can also rotate a photo so that horizon lines are straight. Getting perfect photos in-camera is a lofty goal; there's no harm in a bit of retouching.\n\nWhen you're ready to do even more with your photos, read our 10 beyond-basic photography tips.

{"text": "California snowpack off to one of its best starts in decades\n\nAs winter takes hold in California, a heartening report released today reveals that the state\u2019s snowpack is off to one of its best starts in decades.\n\nThe statewide average of the Sierra snowpack, which supplies much of the state\u2019s water supply, was nearly 180% of the season\u2019s average as of Dec. 11, according to the California Department of Water Resources. That\u2019s the second highest level since 2000, when water officials began tracking the data.\n\n\u201cThis strong start to the snowpack season is good news,\u201d said Mark Cowin, director of the Department of Water Resources. \u201cThe late arrival of a wet November helped us jumpstart the season and put us in a much better position heading into the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe snowpack\u2014the amount of water content found in the snow\u2014acts as a natural reservoir for the state, with some areas getting more than 80% of their water supply from melted snow.\n\nThe early snowfall brought some of the most welcome news for the state in an otherwise difficult year. Californians have spent most of 2020 battling some of the most destructive wildfires in state history, which together burned nearly 8 million acres. Now, a good snowpack could go a long way toward helping alleviate some of the associated strain on water supplies.\n\n\u201cThe snowpack is a critical source of fresh water for the California economy,\u201d said Cowin. \u201cWe need more precipitation to sustain our snowpack and build on this strong start.\u201d\n\nThe unusually wet November in California resulted in the snowpack's overall performance. A recent storm even brought significant snowfall to Southern California, prompting some to pull out their snow boots and sleds.\n\nThe state\u2019s mountain ranges have experienced similarly increased snow levels, with many showing unusually high levels for this time of year. For example, the Mount Shasta area was at about twice its normal snowpack level as of Dec. 11.\n\nBut the data show that weather patterns in California can be unpredictable. While wetter-than-normal weather is in the forecast for January, the season could still turn to the dry side.\n\nSo the early snowpack performance is no guarantee that water supplies will remain high throughout the coming year. \u201cWe should not be lulled into a false sense of security,\u201d said Cowin.\n\nUltimately, California\u2019s water supplies depend on an array of factors, including snowpack, reservoir levels and water conservation measures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to ensure that communities throughout the state can access the water they need to remain healthy and prosperous,\u201d said Cowin. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for the snowfall and encourage everyone to continue to do their part in conserving water.\u201d", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping vowed Friday to deepen their bilateral cooperation against the backdrop of Moscow\u2019s 10-month war in Ukraine, which weathered another night of drone and rocket attacks following a large-scale missile bombardment.\n\nPutin and Xi made no direct mention of Ukraine in their opening remarks by videoconference, which were broadcast publicly, before going into private talks.

Just last week, Moscow and Beijing held joint naval drills in the East China Sea. Putin and Xi also spoke by video link last December.\n\nChina, which has promised a \u201cno limits\u201d friendship with Russia, has pointedly refused to criticize Moscow\u2019s actions in Ukraine, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin, and has blasted the punishing sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\nRussia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid the tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan.\n\nRussia and China are both facing domestic difficulties. Putin is trying to maintain domestic support for a war that has lasted longer than anticipated, while a surge in COVID-19 cases has overwhelmed hospitals in China.\n\nIn Ukraine, authorities reviewed the toll from a widespread Russian missile attack on power stations and other vital infrastructure Thursday that was the biggest such bombardment in weeks. Four civilians were killed during the barrage, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in its Friday morning update that Russian forces had unleashed a total of 85 missiles and 35 airstrikes on targets across Ukraine in the previous 24 hours. Russia also launched 63 attacks from multiple launch rocket systems, the military report said.\n\nFollowing the first waves of missiles on Thursday morning, Russian forces attacked Ukraine with Iranian-made Shahed-131/136 drones on Thursday night and early Friday, all of which were shot down, the Ukrainian air force said.\n\nSome were aimed at Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday. Of seven exploding drones launched against the Ukrainian capital, two were shot down on the approach to the city and five over Kyiv itself, according to Klitschko.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address that Russia hasn\u2019t abandoned plans to capture all of Donetsk, aiming to accomplish the goal by New Year\u2019s Day. Zelenskyy also warned Ukrainians there could be another widespread air assault.\n\n\u201cThere are two days left in this year. Perhaps the enemy will try once again to make us celebrate the New Year in the dark. Perhaps, the occupants are planning to make us suffer with the next strikes on our cities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no matter what they plan, we know one thing about ourselves: we will survive. We will. We will drive them out. No doubt about it. And they will be punished for this terrible war.\u201d\n\nAlena Verbitskaya, presidential commissioner for the protection of the rights of defenders of Ukraine, said Friday that 3,392 Ukrainian servicemen are now in Russian captivity.

Rowe Price, a major shareholder in News Corp, have expressed concerns about the merger.\n\nAustralian journalist Paddy Manning, author of the upcoming unauthorized biography, \"The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch\" (out November 15 from Sutherland House Books), spoke to Insider about what might be driving the Murdochs to explore alternatives: economic pressures or Lachlan Murdoch's desire to keep control.\n\nPaddy Manning. Subject\n\nManning, who is researching a doctorate on the history of News Corp, noted the speculation that Rupert Murdoch may have one more big hand to play. The author also speculated that the two Murdoch-controlled companies \u2014 which were split in 2013, with publishing assets falling under News Corp and film and entertainment properties under 21st Century Fox \u2014 could be taken off the public markets.\n\nRupert Murdoch built one of the biggest media conglomerates of the 21st Century and for decades, media obsessives pondered which of his children \u2014 Lachlan, James, or Liz \u2014 would inherit his mantle.\n\nThey found out when Murdoch dismantled 21st Century Fox and sold the bulk of its film and TV assets to Disney in 2019, setting up the Murdoch family trust that controls about 40 percent of the voting stakes in both News Corp and Fox \u2014 which holds the Fox broadcast network and stations and Tubi, as well as Fox News and Fox Sports. Rupert Murdoch remains executive chairman of News Corp and chairman of Fox.\n\nLachlan Murdoch was named Fox's CEO, and James Murdoch, after four years as CEO of 21st Century Fox, was left to carve his own path.\n\nManning speculated that if the proposed merger of Fox and News Corp were to happen, it could result in the departure of some longtime executives \u2014 as well as some turmoil among the Murdoch siblings regarding the assets' future.\n\nManning's conversation with Insider has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhy did you want to write a book about Lachlan Murdoch?\n\nSomeone told me there's been a hundred books about Rupert. So all of this focus is on Rupert, but no focus yet on the next generation \u2014 and in Lachlan's case, on the guy who was clearly running Fox and poised to take control of the entire empire.\n\nThere was a piece in the Australian Financial Review in Sydney by Neil Chenoweth who reported that Rupert now has a telecommuting agreement with News Corporation. He doesn't have to turn up at the office anymore, so he's going to be happy on his ranch in Montana and newly single.\n\nThere's a quote that one financial analyst gave me \u2014 Lachlan gets fired the day Rupert dies.\n\nFired by his siblings who run the trust?\n\nCorrect.\n\nDid you talk to Lachlan Murdoch?\n\nI had no response from him at all. But I was given access to the people that work most closely with Lachlan.\n\nHe's been subjected to media coverage and speculation since he was in his early twenties at least, so thirty years in the spotlight. But he is a remarkably private person for the high-profile position that he occupies. He is incredibly guarded, I suppose, as you would expect. He's very selective about who he talks to.\n\nCould we see Lachlan's siblings \u2014 Liz, James, and Prudence \u2014 taking over Fox News and becoming a force in American media again?\n\nYeah, I think you could see a contest. Forty percent is generally enough but it's not an outright majority. They don't have outright control. It's possible to imagine a revolt by the other investors in the combined companies, if they were to propose some kind of radical transformation of Fox News that would see [the network] lose its base and therefore be bad for profitability.\n\nMaybe there could be a huge institutional backlash, but the business is sub-scale. It kind of flies under the radar. And the reaction to the merger from the investor community and analysts has not been positive. It's been head-scratching. And why would you want to include a bunch of UK and Australian newspapers into it and dilute the earnings of this incredible machine that is Fox?\n\nI think that Lachlan's preference would be to de-list the thing altogether, to take it private. If he could find a partner that would help him privatize the whole thing, I think he would.\n\nFox News is so controversial, it's not clear who would be a natural kind of partner or buyer for that. But The Wall Street Journal would be a saleable asset any day of the week.\n\nDuring his career in Australia, Lachlan had two big investments that he made privately. One was the commercial radio station Nova, which has remained private and is an absolute cash cow for him.\n\nThe other was Channel 10, which went bankrupt and was ultimately sold to CBS, and that was publicly listed. Lachlan and his advisors, like Siobhan McKenna who was his right-hand person \u2014 they got buckets of negative coverage over Channel 10 and almost no coverage over Nova. And they look at that and say that's a function of the fact that one is publicly listed and subject to scrutiny from analysts, the investor community, and the media \u2014 and the other is private. And no one cares about it.\n\nI think that they would like to find a structure, a solution that took Fox News and took News Corporation off the market all together and de-listed it.\n\nWhat do you make of Lachlan's personal politics and how it influences Fox News?\n\nI think he can't afford, or he feels, can't afford to put his stamp on the business because it's making too much money. He doesn't want to interfere with a formula that is making so much money for him and his family.\n\n[However,] the siblings are quite determined to bring that business back \u2014 to focus on, for example, enhancing democracy. And this was put to me in the context of the January 6th Committee hearings. I think that the siblings believe that Fox News has played a destructive role and has to be brought back to the middle.\n\nCan they do that, do you think?\n\nNot while Rupert's alive.\n\nTell me how Lachlan is like, or not like, his dad?\n\nOne of the things I picked up \u2014 you constantly hear people make comments that James is the brilliant one or Liz is the brilliant one \u2014 I think in some ways Lachlan's been underestimated. And funnily enough he's quite like Rupert in the sense that he was a pretty average student.\n\n\"The Successor\" is an unauthorized biography of Lachlan Murdoch. Sutherland House Books\n\nHe is more risk-averse, he sees himself more as an investor and less as an operator. And he refuses to overpay \u2014 I got that message loud and clear. So I suspect he wouldn't have done the Dow Jones acquisition. Rupert was criticized for overpaying [$5 billion] at the time.\n\nThe deals Lachlan is most proud of are deals where, for example, in real estate [with REA, and Australian digital real estate company] \u2014 they've probably invested the better part of a hundred million in that business now, but it's worth billions. And I think that's a deal that Lachlan is very proud of.\n\nFox has made modest acquisitions with a small outlay and then grown them organically \u2014 like Tubi or Credible Labs. He hasn't gone for the big bang corporate activity up until now when this merger's being floated.\n\nWhat do you make of the possible merger?\n\nOnce you start pulling apart News Corporation, it sort of makes sense to recombine all the media assets at the moment. It's a strange kind of beast with REA Group, which owns [real estate site] Move.com, and which accounts for a huge chunk of the value in the listed entity. And then Dow Jones, which is a profit engine, and then this grab bag of assets from the New York Post to the Times of London to the Australian newspapers and pay-TV operator Foxtel.\n\nBut I think it's more about entrenching Lachlan's control most likely. I think it's another chapter in the succession story where Lachlan will emerge as the executive chairman of the combined entity \u2014 I'm speculating \u2014 and that there will be a hired CEO from outside the family.\n\nIf you're looking longer-term about who's going to run the company beyond the merger, if it happens, [News Corp CEO] Robert Thomson is probably retiring. And Suzanne Scott. Fox News is still the beating profit, heart of Fox cooperation, you know, you couldn't criticize her from a financial perspective. But I do wonder whether she will remain as the CEO of Fox News beyond her present contract.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It has been a year to forget for growth stocks. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) has plunged 30% in 2022, on track for its biggest one-year loss since 2008, when it fell 39%. This also marks the first time since 2016 that growth has lagged value, comparing the growth ETF to the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) . Growth stocks are characterized by those that tend to trade on the expectation of strong earnings expansion over several years in the future, rather than here and now. Investors have shunned the group this year, as the Federal Reserve and central banks around the globe tighten monetary policy to fight inflation. This makes today's earnings more valuable and the promise of future profits less so. Despite this tough year, analysts expect big gains from some growth companies in 2023. To find them, CNBC Pro screened the IWF for stocks that met the following criteria: Market cap of at least $2 billion Buy ratings from 60% or more of analysts covering the stock Upside of at least 60% based on average price target A minimum of 15 analysts covering the stock Here are the names that made the cut. ChargePoint and Plug Power made the list, with analysts expecting both to more than double over the next 12 months. More than three-quarters of analysts covering ChargePoint rate it a buy, while Plug Power has buy ratings from nearly two-thirds of analysts covering it. Both stocks have suffered in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market value. However, JPMorgan named them top picks for the new year, noting : \"While a weakening macro could present new challenges, as demand could be dampened, potentially delaying energy transition efforts, we still anticipate significant growth and inflection points and/or initial adoption across clean transport sub-sectors.\" Uber Technologies also made the cut, with 80% of analysts rating it a buy. The average price target on the stock implies upside of more than 90%. Shares of the ride-sharing giant have dropped more than 40% in 2022, but Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown said last month he has high hopes for Uber. \"It's becoming apparent Uber is becoming the one company that's going to dominate this space, similar to what Google eventually was able to do in search,\" Brown said . E-commerce and web services behemoth Amazon also made the list. Analysts on average see the stock going up more than 60% in the next year. Amazon is also rated a buy by 75% of analysts. Amazon shares are down more than 49% in 2022, on pace for their second-worst year on record. However, Truist analyst Youssef Squali named it a top pick for 2023. \"While the company is facing macro headwinds and working to regain productivity losses from Covid \u2026 we view these challenges as temporary and see AMZN with the power of Prime, AWS leadership and [a] rapidly growing ad business as best positioned to ride these multiple secular growth trends in FY23/beyond,\" Squali said.

{"text": "US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron are set to reap a combined estimated $100 billion windfall from Russia's war on Ukraine. The money is expected to come from the sale of oil and gas fields in the disputed region, as well as profits from the completion of a long-planned pipeline connecting eastern Europe and Central Asia.\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron have had long-standing relationships with Russian energy companies, and both companies have made large investments in the country's energy sector. Recently, both ExxonMobil and Chevron have become increasingly involved in the Ukrainian conflict, taking major stakes in the country's energy sector.\n\nIn recent years, Russia has used military force to seize energy assets in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, in what is considered a violation of international law. Despite United Nations sanctions, Russia has been successful in taking control of these energy assets, and the profits to ExxonMobil and Chevron have been tremendous.\n\nExxonMobil has already secured a 20 percent stake in the Russian oil giant Rosneft, and is expected to reap billions of dollars in profits as a result. Chevron, meanwhile, has been in talks with Russian energy firm Gazprom over the sale of a stake in a major natural gas field in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the direct profits from their investments in Russia, ExxonMobil and Chevron are also in line to benefit from the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will connect eastern Europe and Central Asia with gas from Russia's Yamal Peninsula. This massive $20 billion project is already more than 80 percent complete and is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been a source of significant controversy, as the US and many European nations view it as a way for Russia to bypass Ukraine and exert greater control over its energy exports to Europe. However, for ExxonMobil and Chevron, the completion of the pipeline is expected to bring in even more profits, as both companies have invested heavily in the project.\n\nIt is unclear how much of the profits ExxonMobil and Chevron will share with the Ukrainian government, or if the profits from the sales of assets will be used to help rebuild the country. Nevertheless, the ongoing war in Ukraine is sure to have a major impact on the US oil giants and their bottom lines.\n\nAs Russia and Ukraine continue to battle for control over energy assets, ExxonMobil and Chevron are in the prime position to reap massive profits. The two companies are set to benefit greatly from the Russian invasion, and with the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, their profits are only expected to increase in the coming years. With these new developments, ExxonMobil and Chevron are poised to reap a combined estimated $100 billion windfall from Russia's war on Ukraine.", "label": "machine"}

However, the government had the right to review the project and any changes made to the project to ensure that it would benefit the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since FQM tried to introduce new changes to the original agreement that the government did not agree with.\n\nIn response, the government of Panama has launched an official investigation into the matter and is looking into the legality of the changes. This has led to both sides becoming increasingly hostile and the government going so far as to threaten to strip FQM of its rights over the project.\n\nThe government has also accused FQM of not properly consulting with the local community or properly monitoring environmental impacts.\n\nThe dispute has been escalating in recent weeks and has been a major source of tension for Panama.\n\nAs the dispute deepens, both sides have taken steps to demonstrate their commitment to their positions.\n\nFQM has filed a lawsuit against the government of Panama, claiming that it is overstepping its authority and not properly consulting with the local community.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has increased its presence at the mine, bringing in police and other security forces to ensure that the mine is being properly managed and that no changes are made without its approval.\n\nThis further escalates the situation and suggests that neither side is willing to back down.\n\nPanama\u2019s government has stated that it is open to talks with FQM and is willing to negotiate a fair resolution, but it is clear that the government is taking a hard stance.\n\nFor now, it seems that the dispute is unlikely to be resolved in the near future and is set to be a major source of contention between Panama and FQM.\n\nThe stand-off highlights the difficulty of balancing economic growth with environmental protection and community consent when dealing with large scale projects.\n\nIt also serves as a stark reminder of the difficulty of doing business in a nation with a legal system that often clashes with foreign corporate interests.\n\nAt stake is more than just a copper mine. It is the future of an entire nation and the security of its citizens.\n\nFor Panama, it is a crucial test for its economic development plan and one that it must get right. As for FQM, the stakes are equally high and could decide the company\u2019s future in the region.\n\nOnly time will tell how this dispute plays out and who will ultimately come out on top.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Beyond Meat \"Beyond Burger\" patties made from plant-based substitutes for meat products sit on a shelf for sale in New York City.\n\nBeyond Meat on Wednesday reported a wider-than-expected loss for its third quarter as demand for its meat substitutes tumbled.\n\nCEO Ethan Brown called the results \"disappointing\" in the press release. Cash-strapped shoppers are skipping Beyond's burger, sausage and chicken substitutes and instead buying cheaper proteins, according to Brown.\n\nShares of the company were effectively flat in after-hours trading. The stock closed down 9% on Wednesday.\n\nHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\nLoss per share: $1.60 vs. $1.14 expected\n\nRevenue: $82.5 million vs. $98.1 million expected\n\nNet sales dropped 22.5% to $82.5 million in the third quarter.\n\nBeyond has tried to revive demand for its meatless burgers and sausages by offering restaurants and grocery customers discounts. However, lower sticker prices weren't enough. The company said total pounds sold fell 12.8%, and net revenue per pound shrank 11.2%.\n\nThe company's U.S. food service business was the only division to report sales growth, rather than declines, for the quarter. Beyond sold 5.6% more of its meat alternatives to restaurants, corporate cafeterias and stadiums. The company said pounds sold climbed 32.2%, meaning the growth likely came from offering attractive discounts.\n\nU.S. grocery sales fell 11.8% in the quarter, driven entirely by shrinking demand.\n\nOutside the U.S., its sales declines were even more stark, in part due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. International grocery sales cratered 53%, while food service revenue dropped 42%. International markets accounted for roughly 35% of sales a year ago. In the third quarter, they only made up a quarter of Beyond's total revenue.\n\nThe company reported a third-quarter net loss of $101.7 million, or $1.60 per share, wider than its net loss of $54.8 million, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nAs Wall Street grows pessimistic about the company's growth prospects, Beyond has been trying to become cash-flow positive by the second half of 2023. In October, Beyond announced it would cut 19% of its workforce, or roughly 200 employees. Just two months earlier, the company said it would lay off 4% of its workers.\n\n\"This is a difficult period economically across the country and across the world, so we are going to rightsize our organization to get through it,\" Brown said.\n\nHe told analysts on the conference call that the company won't launch another product like Beyond Jerky, which was part of a joint venture with PepsiCo . The meatless jerky was expensive and inefficient to produce and launch. It took two quarters to break even. Going forward, Beyond will only launch cash-flow positive products.\n\nBrown said the company is also focusing on a more narrow set of food service and grocery opportunities to reduce operating expenses.\n\n\"We have a number of [fast-food] partners. We've narrowed our focus somewhat to a handful,\" Brown said.\n\nBeyond also faced turmoil inside its C-suite. Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey left the company after being arrested for allegedly biting another man's nose in a parking garage. The company also eliminated the role of chief growth officer and saw its chief financial officer, Phil Hardin, depart for another job elsewhere.\n\nFor 2022, Beyond expects full-year sales between $400 million to $425 million, reiterating the lower forecast it released in October.\n\nCorrection: This story was updated to reflect that Beyond Meat lowered its sales forecast in October.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "For the first time, Cox Communications is joining the ranks of its cable TV competitors, launching a mobile business and joining the ranks of Comcast, Charter, and Altice.\n\nThe launch of the mobile business comes as cable TV providers increasingly compete with wireless providers in the battle to offer consumers the best in mobile services. While these providers have long been able to offer landline phone services, Cox is the first major cable provider to launch an all-in-one mobile solution, providing voice, text, and data services, as well as access to 5G networks.\n\nThe new mobile business is expected to be available to current Cox customers starting in late 2023, with a broader nationwide rollout expected to follow.\n\n\"Cox is focused on providing our customers with the best wireless experience possible, and this new mobile business will be a key part of that,\" said Cox President Pat Esser. \"We are excited to be able to offer a comprehensive solution that provides our customers with all of their wireless needs.\"\n\nThe company has yet to announce pricing for its new mobile services, but Cox has said it will offer competitively priced plans with no hidden fees. The new business will use a combination of Cox's own wireless network, as well as access to other wireless providers' networks.\n\nCox is expected to announce more details about its mobile plans later this year, as well as details about its 5G networks. The company is also expected to launch a mobile app to enable customers to track their usage and manage their accounts.\n\nCox's new mobile business marks a significant shift in the cable industry, as providers move to offer comprehensive solutions to meet the growing demand for wireless services. As cable companies continue to focus on providing comprehensive offerings, the move to the mobile arena is likely to provide further opportunities for consolidation.\n\nThe launch of the new mobile business also comes amid a growing push by cable companies to develop new technologies and services in an effort to stay ahead of their competitors. Recently, Comcast, Charter, and Altice have all announced initiatives related to mobile, such as 5G networks and streaming services.\n\nWhile the new mobile business is likely to face stiff competition from the other major cable providers, Cox has a history of staying ahead of its rivals in terms of technology and service. As the company continues to make strategic investments in its mobile business, it's likely that it will be able to stay competitive in the future.\n\nCox's new mobile business is just the latest example of how cable companies are looking to diversify their businesses and remain competitive in the mobile space. As consumers continue to demand better services, more comprehensive packages, and greater convenience, it's likely that more cable companies will follow Cox's lead and launch their own mobile offerings.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As of January 1st, 2023, employers in certain states, cities, and counties must now provide their employees with information about the range of salaries within the company. This new requirement is part of a larger trend in the United States to promote pay transparency, and ensure workers are paid fairly and equitably.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and other government agencies have implemented this new rule in order to protect employees from unfair salary discrimination. Although the details vary depending on the jurisdiction, in general, employers must provide a list of job titles and salary ranges to employees upon request. The list must be updated at least once a year and must include job titles, base salary, overtime rate, and potential bonuses or commissions, if applicable. \n\nThe new rule applies to employers in 21 states, including California, New York, and Illinois, plus certain cities and counties throughout the United States. It is important to note that some areas, such as the District of Columbia, have their own pay transparency requirements. \n\nThe new law is a crucial step forward for creating more equitable pay practices in the workplace. Previously, employees were unable to compare their salaries to colleagues in similar positions and were more vulnerable to salary discrimination, especially when employers refused to provide salary information. This new law is an important step in increasing fairness and transparency in the workplace. \n\nEmployers in the affected states, cities and counties should be aware of the new requirements and familiarize themselves with the specific rules that apply in their jurisdiction. The Department of Labor has released a handy guide to pay transparency requirements, which outlines the specifics in each area. \n\nIn addition, employers should consider how they will communicate this information to employees and ensure that their policies are compliant with the new law. Employers should also review their pay structures and ensure that salaries are in line with the market rate for each job. This could be a great opportunity for employers to review their salary and compensation structures and ensure that their pay practices are equitable and fair. \n\nPay transparency has been an important issue for decades, but the current economic climate has put a spotlight on the issue and highlighted the need for greater equity in the workplace. This new law is a crucial step forward in achieving pay equity and ensuring that workers are compensated fairly for their work. \n\nIt is also an important reminder of the importance of pay transparency and salary equity in the workplace. Employers in the affected states, cities, and counties must be sure to comply with the new law and be aware of the implications for their business. By understanding the importance of pay transparency and taking the necessary steps to ensure fair and equitable pay, employers can create a better working environment for all.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday finalized a rule allowing mifepristone, one of two drugs used in medication abortions, to be dispensed by retail pharmacies. The rule will make medication abortion, which accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions, more accessible in states where abortion remains legal, but its impact in states that have banned abortion will be limited.\n\nWHAT CHANGES FOR PATIENTS UNDER THE NEW RULE?\n\nPatients will be able to get the drug more quickly.\n\nPreviously, mifepristone had to be dispensed by an authorized clinic or through certain specialty mail-order pharmacies \u2014 a process that could take days or even weeks if a clinic is busy.\n\nOnce pharmacies begin dispensing the drug in states that allow abortion, it \"will make it much easier to access the pill,\" according to Naomi Cahn, a professor at University of Virginia School of Law.\n\nWHAT DOES NOT CHANGE?\n\nAll patients still need a prescription to get mifepristone. It will not be available over the counter.\n\nMost significantly, the FDA's new regulation will not help patients get abortion pills in states that have banned abortion, said Amanda Allen of the Lawyering Project, a legal group that defends abortion rights.\n\nNonetheless, Allen said, the rule could make it easier to travel out of state for a medication abortion. Currently, a patient seeking a medication abortion in another state must both obtain the prescription and the pill in that state. That will become much easier if the pill can be picked up at a retail pharmacy, she said.\n\nAs of November, 16 states that permit some abortions had laws restricting mifepristone, including requirements that it be provided by a physician, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. It is not clear whether pharmacies must comply with these laws; some legal scholars have argued that federal rules should override them, but the issue has not been tested in court.\n\nHOW LONG BEFORE MIFEPRISTONE IS AVAILABLE IN PHARMACIES?\n\nIt is not yet clear, because pharmacies must first be certified by one of the drug's manufacturers to dispense it in accordance with federal safety rules.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O), the largest U.S. retail pharmacy chain, said Wednesday that it intended to get certified. CVS Health (CVS.N) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) have said they are reviewing the new rule and intended to comply with federal and state law but have not yet confirmed that they plan to dispense the drug.\n\nCOULD THE NEW REGULATION FACE LEGAL CHALLENGES?\n\nYes. Anti-abortion groups represented by the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom already filed a lawsuit in November seeking to undo the FDA's approval of mifepristone for abortion entirely on alleged safety grounds.\n\nIf the Trump-appointed judge rules in favor of suspending the FDA's 20-year-old approval of the drug, it would effectively pull the drug from the market nationwide and render the latest FDA rule moot.\n\nThe judge, Reed O'Connor, has been friendly to conservative causes before, previously ruling the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional and ruling against the Biden administration in a case over healthcare coverage for transgender people\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Julie Blake said in a statement that the new rule \"just bolsters the strength and importance of our case.\"\n\nCOULD ANTI-ABORTION STATES TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO RESTRICT MEDICATION ABORTION?\n\nSome conservative policy groups and lawmakers have proposed laws that would make it a crime to help someone travel to another state for abortion or mail them abortion pills.\n\nExperts have said there would be little if any direct precedent for whether such laws would be enforceable, potentially triggering a new round of legal battles.\n\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Lisa Shumaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

The company has long been a leader in the oil and gas industry, and it is well positioned to weather the current headwinds. Its cash flow and balance sheet remain strong, and it recently announced a $20 billion share repurchase program, signaling management's confidence in the stock. Chevron is also investing heavily in renewable energy and other clean energy sources, which should provide a solid foundation for long-term growth.\n\nAnother stock that we like is Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE: CNQ). This Canadian energy producer has been hit hard by the pandemic, but its operations remain profitable and its balance sheet is strong. Despite its weak stock price, the company has continued to pay a generous dividend, signaling management's confidence in the company's future. Canadian Natural Resources is also well-positioned to benefit from rising oil prices in the near future.\n\nWe also believe that Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) is worth a look. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the tailwinds of higher oil and gas prices, and its balance sheet remains solid despite the recent downturn. In addition, Devon is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of renewable energy sources, as it has invested heavily in solar and wind power over the past few years.\n\nFinally, we like Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA). The company has long been a leader in the oil and gas industry, and its portfolio is well diversified across the globe. Apache is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of clean energy sources, and its balance sheet remains strong. In addition, Apache recently announced a $1 billion share repurchase program, signaling management's confidence in the stock.\n\nWe believe that these four oil stocks are good buys in the current market conditions. All four of them have strong balance sheets, a diversified portfolio, and are well-positioned to benefit from the rise of renewable energy sources in the future.

{"text": "One of the big takeaways from the market's decline in 2022 is that investors should build their portfolios in a different way, said Joe Terranova, chief market strategist at Virtus Investment Partners. \"I think there has been a paradigm shift in 2022 ... and that's moving toward equal-weighted strategies,\" Terranova said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Halftime Report .\" In such a strategy, an equal amount of money is allocated to each stock in a portfolio. This is notably different from the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite , which are weighted based on market cap. Because of this structure, equal-weighted funds end up with relatively less exposure to the market's largest stocks, and higher exposure to value stocks with lower price-to-earnings multiples. Equal-weighted funds generally outperformed last year. The strategy can also keep portfolios from getting too exposed to hot sectors. Several tech stocks ballooned to massive size over the last decade, which made the equal-weighted funds a relatively safer move when that trend reversed in 2022. Terranova made his comments during a discussion about Tesla , which has declined from a market cap of more than $1 trillion to about $300 million after Tuesday's share price declines . For investors holding broad index funds weighted based on market cap, Tesla has been a big drag on performance. \"I think we are in a moment where you have to go back to looking at equal-weighted strategies and elevating them to the top of your list for investment,\" he said. Terranova is not alone in believing in equal-weighted trades right now. Bank of America ETF strategist Jared Woodard listed the Invesco S & P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) as a top trade for 2023. The fund had a total return of -11.6% in 2022, meaning its decline was significantly less than the S & P 500. The lower exposure to tech and growth stocks was a key contributor to that outperformance. Woodard said in a note to clients in November that an equal weight S & P 500 index was underweight tech and communications services by about 15 percentage points. After tech stocks underperformed again in December, value stocks have now made up a lot of ground in the major indexes. However, equal-weighted funds still give investors more exposure to value stocks and areas like energy and materials than broad index funds. Some other equal-weighted ETFs on the market include the Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF (EQAL) and the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (EUSA) .", "label": "human"}

The euro was up 0.1% against the dollar, while the British pound, the Australian dollar and the yen all pared early losses.\n\nIn the U.S., the House of Representatives approved a nearly $2.3 trillion spending package on Tuesday and sent it to President Donald Trump to sign, a move that will provide direct payments to Americans of up to $600 and extend additional unemployment benefits.\n\nThe package is expected to fuel a further rise in yields on U.S. Treasuries and bolster the U.S. economic recovery. This in turn could see investors turning to the dollar for investments and pushing the currency higher.\n\nBut that scenario is unlikely to happen this week, given that trading was muted ahead of the long New Year holiday and market players have already priced in the passage of the stimulus package.\n\n\u201cThe market impact of this news (stimulus) will fade away as time passes,\u201d said Junichi Ishikawa, senior currency analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n\nIn other currency markets, the euro was up 0.2% against the yen to 125.29, while the Australian dollar hit a nine-year high of 0.7630 after Australia\u2019s central bank said it expects the economy to recover more quickly than previously anticipated.\n\nThe Bank of Canada also maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.25% and said it sees a gradual recovery in the economy in 2021. The Canadian dollar pared losses after the decision, climbing 0.2% against the greenback.\n\nIn commodities markets, spot gold dropped 0.3% to $1,899.92 an ounce after gaining nearly 3% in 2020. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was up 0.7% at $54.05 a barrel, its highest level since February.\n\nThe gains came despite a gloomy economic outlook from the International Monetary Fund, which said in a report on Wednesday that it now expects the global economy to shrink 4.4% in 2020 due to the pandemic, deeper than the 3% contraction forecast in October.\n\nInvestors\u2019 focus is expected to shift to U.S. non-farm payrolls for December due Friday for clues on the health of the economy, as well as a meeting between the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve later this week.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields were little changed, with the benchmark 10-year yield at 0.93%.\n\n\u201cWe expect U.S. yields to remain low in 2021 as the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains its highly accommodative policy stance,\u201d said Keita Kawakami, chief Japan currency analyst at Mizuho Bank.\n\nElsewhere, South Korea\u2019s won was little changed at 1,096.32 per dollar, while the Indian rupee was little changed at 73.55.\n\n\u201cIn Asia, currencies are likely to be affected by global risk appetite,\u201d Kawakami said. \u201cIn the near term, investors are likely to focus on developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, including the vaccine.\u201d", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Immigration has been one of the most divisive issues in the United States for the past few decades. The past year has seen an increasing number of reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detaining immigrants and separating families, while the debate over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has only become more heated as it has been caught up in a legal battle between the Trump Administration and Congress. It's a complex issue, with both sides of the aisle having strong opinions on what the best solution should be.\n\nRecently, President Donald Trump has increased the use of Title 42 to deport immigrants. This action was seen as a drastic move by many and has raised a lot of questions. In this article, we'll take a look at what Title 42 is, why it's being used, and what both sides of the aisle are saying about it.\n\nTitle 42 is a federal statute that was originally put in place in 2002 to deal with the nation\u2019s growing opioid crisis. The statute gave the government the power to quickly deport anyone who was \u201csuspected\u201d of having drugs or associated with drug activities. It was mainly used in the 2000s to deport people from countries such as Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, but in recent years, the statute has been used for immigration purposes as well.\n\nIt essentially gives ICE officers the power to deport immigrants without due process. This means that immigrants cannot fight their cases in court and cannot be granted a hearing by an immigration judge. This has been widely criticized as a violation of immigrants\u2019 rights and a departure from the usual due process that\u2019s afforded to people facing deportation.\n\nThe Trump Administration and some Republican lawmakers have defended their use of Title 42, arguing that it\u2019s necessary in order to secure the border and keep immigrants out of the country. They point to what they say is the necessity of controlling immigration to the United States.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats and some Republican lawmakers have argued that Title 42 goes too far and is an excessive use of power by the government. They point to the lack of due process afforded to immigrants, arguing that it goes against fundamental American values. They also point to the fact that Title 42 isn\u2019t necessary to secure the border, as other measures such as increased border security can be used to achieve that goal.\n\nThe issue of immigration is one that\u2019s sure to remain contentious for the foreseeable future. Both sides have valid points and concerns, but ultimately, the decision to use Title 42 has proven to be a controversial one. It\u2019s clear that both sides need to take a step back and try to come to a more meaningful and fair solution that takes into consideration the safety and security of the United States while also giving immigrants a chance to defend themselves and their rights. Otherwise, the immigration debate is sure to continue to be a source of contention in the years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Associated Press\n\nThe snowpack covering California's mountains is off to one of its best starts in 40 years, officials announced Tuesday, raising hopes that the drought-stricken state could soon see relief in the spring when the snow melts and begins to refill parched reservoirs. Roughly a third of California's water each year comes from melted snow in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state. The state has built a complex system of canals and dams to capture that water and store it in huge reservoirs so it can be used the rest of the year when it doesn't rain or snow.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally ran November 23, 2022. It has been updated to reflect new data in two charts: Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s party affiliation switch from Democrat to independent and updated race/ethnicity data for the 118th Congress from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA record number of women won election to the 118th Congress \u2013 but barely.\n\nThe 149 women who will serve in the US House and Senate will expand the ranks of female representation by just two members above the record set by the 117th Congress.\n\nAlaska carried women across that threshold in November when the state determined through its ranked-choice voting system that Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, will represent the state\u2019s at-large House seat for a full term after winning the special election earlier in the year, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski won reelection.\n\nWomen will break an overall record in the House, with 124 taking office in January.\n\nAnd not only will women of color break records in the 118th Congress, but within the House alone, there will also be a record number of both Latinas and Black women. Four more Latinas will serve in the House for a total of 18 \u2013 the most ever \u2013 and one more Black woman, bringing their total from 26 to 27.\n\nMore than half of the incoming class of 22 freshman women in the House are women of color, showing the increasing diversity of that chamber.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase in the racial and ethnic diversity of women as candidates, nominees, and then officeholders at the congressional level, but more specifically, in the US House,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers.\n\n\u201cThat diversity is still hugely lacking in the US Senate. \u2026 We\u2019re seeing stasis there in terms of the number of women of color overall. The number of Asian and Latino women specifically will stay the same, and the number of Black women will stay the same at zero.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Sydney Kamlager of California is one of those new voices coming to the House. A state senator, she was elected to replace retiring Rep. Karen Bass, who will become the first female mayor of Los Angeles. Kamlager said while she is excited about the diversity of the freshman class, there is still a long way to go.\n\n\u201cI think folks have to stop giving lip service to Black women and brown women and put the money where the mouth is. The fact remains that Black and brown women face higher barriers of entry into this work than other women and men,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cWhen we run, our contributions are less oftentimes than men. We are held to higher and double standards,\u201d she added, noting that female candidates are still often asked why they are not \u201chome taking care of your husband or your children.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks are OK with a mediocre male candidate but expect the female candidate to be off the charts,\u201d she said.\n\nRep.-elect Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat, is the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado. A state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, she\u2019ll also be just the second female doctor who\u2019s a voting member of Congress. (The first, Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier, won reelection in Washington state.)\n\n\u201cKind of sad that it took until 2022,\u201d Caraveo said, reflecting on both milestones.\n\nHer experience in medicine and state politics, she said, prepared her for having to work harder to get \u201cless credit\u201d than her male counterparts.\n\n\u201cIt is, unfortunately, something that I\u2019ve seen throughout my time, both in medicine and in politics, and, sadly, a challenge that one gets used to, in some ways, but also, in other ways, continues to be painful,\u201d said Caraveo, a pediatrician.\n\n\u201cEven members of my staff, you know, as they came on board, really noted the different way in which I was treated or perceived as a woman of color compared to some of the other candidates that were able to more easily get meetings or support from different groups,\u201d she added.\n\nMarking the milestone\n\nStill, the moment isn\u2019t lost on these women.\n\n\u201cIn Colorado, I didn\u2019t grow up seeing what I am now,\u201d said Caraveo. \u201cThe idea of being the first Latina \u2013 so not just that it\u2019s a woman but it\u2019s a woman of color \u2013 serving in Congress, I hope is going to be make things a little bit easier for the little girls that I\u2019ve taken care of in clinic. So that one day they don\u2019t have to talk about being first of something, their candidacy and their ability to be in office is just a given.\u201d\n\nAnd Caraveo, who will be representing a new district that Colorado gained in the reapportionment process, also stressed the significance of what more female representation could mean for legislating.\n\n\u201cThat sense of collaboration that we approach things with is very different than, I think, what my male counterparts often do,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Republicans will break a record with 42 women serving in Congress. Murkowski and Republican Sen.-elect Katie Britt of Alabama help bring the number of Republican women in the Senate to nine. And 33 Republican women will serve in the House next year, up from 32 this year.\n\nThe incoming class of seven House Republican freshmen includes three Latinas, bringing the total number of Republican Latinas in the House to five.\n\n\u201cHaving the diversity of thought and experience is, you know, it\u2019s critical to our representative democracy,\u201d said Rep.-elect Erin Houchin, who noted that she\u2019s the first woman to represent her Indiana district.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re accomplishing something for the next generation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is meaningful for me in particular to set that example for my own daughters, for young women.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio has seen and beat plenty of records before as the longest-serving woman in the House. When she\u2019s sworn in for another term in January, on the heels of her first competitive reelection in years, she\u2019ll become the longest-serving woman in all of Congress, beating the record set by former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski.\n\nFirst elected in 1982, Kaptur has been sounding the alarm about her party being dominated by leadership from the coasts, while the heartland and industrial America \u2013 and its struggling middle class \u2013 is often forgotten in Washington.\n\n\u201cMy most heart-warming achievement is that the tenure represents a voice from the working class of people \u2013 who happens to be a woman,\u201d she said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It's been nearly a decade since James Cameron's 3-D juggernaut \"Avatar\" opened, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.8 billion in global ticket sales. But did that seismic event really change the way we watch movies?\n\nThe box-office performance of Cameron's follow-up, the four-part sequel \"Avatar 2,\" which is set to hit theaters this December, will be closely watched by industry insiders to find out the answer.\n\nIn some respects, \"Avatar\" set the template for how big-budget films are marketed, emphasizing tentpole special effects and design elements, or concept-driven franchises -- such as Marvel's \"Avengers\" films and Warner Bros.' \"Harry Potter\" series -- that provide an additional incentive for viewers to see them in theaters.\n\nThe question is whether \"Avatar\" shifted the calculus for going to the movies in a substantial and lasting way, or whether that effect has since faded.\n\nThe rise of streaming platforms has certainly raised the pressure on theater owners to create a more alluring entertainment experience, as they attempt to compete with the convenience of home viewing -- as well as the availability of often-deep discounts when purchasing tickets online.\n\nAt the same time, the emergence of virtual reality has led to speculation about its potential to revolutionize moviegoing, whether it be by providing additional, interactive elements that enhance the theatrical experience -- such as those deployed to great success for \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and the recently released \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" -- or by fundamentally changing the way movies are presented and consumed.\n\nBut these are still early days for VR, and the available technology has yet to significantly reshape the way most people experience films.\n\nNevertheless, \"Avatar\" remains an invaluable bellwether, especially given its reliance on groundbreaking 3-D visuals. Viewers could watch other movies at home, but with \"Avatar,\" there was a virtual promise of something more tangible and real, a significant factor that elevated the movie's audience experience.\n\nThe film represented the potential of 3-D technology to become more than a silly gimmick, delivering enhanced depth and texture to the film while providing a heightened physical and emotional connection to the characters.\n\nIt's also possible that what made \"Avatar\" so distinctive at the time is starting to become more commonplace. 3-D projection has been around for several decades, but technology has made it far more immersive in recent years.\n\nFor example, a variation of the \"Avatar\" viewing experience has become available on home theater systems, called \"active 3-D.\" The system includes polarized glasses and a special display that alternately flashes the movie's images from left to right, creating a full-on 3-D experience similar to what people experienced in theaters when the film debuted.\n\nTheater owners have also increasingly been investing in upgraded sound systems, as well as deeper, more comfortable seats and other amenities meant to lure people away from their living rooms and back into the darkened auditoriums.\n\nThat strategy appears to have paid off to some degree, but it's uncertain how much of an impact \"Avatar\" had in the first place. The spectacular box-office numbers don't tell us whether people returned to the theater to see other movies, or merely to take another round trip to Cameron's universe.\n\nThere's also no denying that ticket prices have steadily increased, now averaging around $8.79 a pop, according to research firm BoxOfficeMojo. It's possible that, even as amenities improve, expensive tickets may become a deterrent, driving people back to their televisions and computer screens.\n\nUltimately, there's no substitute for the experience of seeing a movie on the big screen. But with \"Avatar 2\" about to hit theaters, \"Avatar's\" legacy will continue to be scrutinized, and moviegoers will soon decide for themselves whether the 3-D sequel can deliver the same degree of cinematic magic as the original.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "US Soccer announced today that it is launching a full investigation into the conduct of men's head coach Gregg Berhalter following revelations that he was involved in a domestic violence incident in 1991.\n\nThe investigation was prompted by a report that was first published by The Washington Post this week which detailed an incident involving Berhalter from over 30 years ago. The incident, which occurred in 1991 when Berhalter was a college student, involves a woman who claims that Berhalter assaulted her after an argument about a party. The woman has said that she was bruised and shaken after the incident.\n\nThe organization said in a statement that \"while US Soccer was not aware of this incident prior to the recent media reports, we are taking this allegation seriously.\" US Soccer also said that \"we have met with Coach Berhalter to hear his side of the story, and we are in the process of launching a full investigation.\"\n\nThe organization also stated that Berhalter has denied any wrongdoing and that he has been cooperative throughout the process. Berhalter also released his own statement in response to the report, saying that he is \"troubled and saddened\" by the incident.\n\nBerhalter's statement goes on to say that \"while this incident happened three decades ago, I want to be unequivocal: Domestic violence is wrong, and I believe the only way forward is to make sure that the proper education and resources are in place to ensure that it does not happen again.\"\n\nBerhalter also said that he has taken part in domestic violence prevention programs in the past and that he is committed to being a positive role model for young soccer players and coaches alike.\n\nThe investigation into Berhalter comes at a time when US Soccer is already under fire for its handling of a recent gender discrimination lawsuit. The organization has been accused of paying its female players significantly less than its male counterparts, and it has also been accused of providing fewer resources to its female teams.\n\nUS Soccer has said that it takes the allegations of domestic violence \"very seriously\" and that it is committed to creating a safe and respectful environment for all its players, coaches, and staff. The organization also said that the investigation is ongoing and that it will provide updates as they become available.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the outcome of this investigation will be, but it is clear that US Soccer is taking the matter seriously. In the meantime, the organization is likely to face further scrutiny over its handling of the gender discrimination lawsuit, as well as any further revelations that may come out as a result of the investigation into Berhalter.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "At the start of 2022, space exploration was at a pivot point. After decades of launching spacecraft, sending astronauts to the moon, and establishing permanent human presence in low-Earth orbit, space agencies from around the world were looking to take the next step. The year brought both incremental progress and major milestones for the industry as researchers sought to expand humanity's reach further into our solar system. \n\nOne of the biggest moments in space exploration during 2022 was the successful landing of NASA's Perseverance rover on Mars. The six-wheeled robot touched down on the Red Planet in February, marking the fourth successful landing of a robotic mission and the third successful mission to a planet other than Earth. The Mars mission was notable not only because of the science that Perseverance sought to achieve, but also because of its cultural significance, inspiring millions of people around the world and giving NASA the opportunity to explore and gather new information about an alien world.\n\nIn the same month, the European Space Agency launched its ExoMars mission, a joint venture with the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The mission sent an ambitious robotic craft to the Red Planet with the goal of determining whether or not there is life on the planet, by drilling down and collecting samples of the Martian surface.\n\nAnother major event during the year was China's Chang'e 5 mission to the moon, which achieved the first-ever soft landing on the lunar surface since 1976. The Chang'e 5 mission was highly ambitious and involved multiple spacecraft, including an orbiter, a robotic lander, and an ascent vehicle. The mission's success was a major victory for China's space program and marked the first time that a space agency had managed to land, collect samples, and return them to Earth in a single mission.\n\nAt the same time, there were some significant advances in space technology. For instance, SpaceX successfully launched the world's first private, autonomous, reusable spacecraft into orbit. Dubbed \"Starship,\" the craft is designed to take humans and cargo to and from destinations in low-Earth orbit, potentially revolutionizing space transportation and enabling space tourism.\n\nIn April, the International Space Station celebrated its 20th anniversary. The station has become a symbol of international cooperation and, over the past two decades, has been a major research outpost in low-Earth orbit. The station has hosted a variety of experiments, from biology to physics, and has enabled a new understanding of how life and research is conducted in space.\n\nEven as the space industry made great strides during the year, there were some setbacks, too. In November, a joint NASA-Roscosmos mission to test an innovative rocket propulsion system failed shortly after launch, and the loss was particularly hard felt. The mission had been highly anticipated, as the new propulsion system was intended to revolutionize space travel and pave the way for future missions to the outer planets and beyond.\n\nDespite these issues, the year 2022 was a major milestone for space exploration, with new advances in technology, the first landing on the moon in decades, and a number of successful robotic missions. There is still much to learn and explore in the universe, but with every mission that is successfully launched, we come one step closer to answering the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe?", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's time to move to the sidelines on Home Depot , according to Credit Suisse. Analyst Karen Short assumed coverage of Home Depot with a neutral rating, with a previous rating of outperform, saying the slowing housing market spells trouble for the home improvement retailer. \"Our general view is that HD story offers a healthy balance of reasons to be positive longer term but cautious in the near term,\" Short wrote in a Monday note. The analyst cited several reasons for her cautious outlook, including declines in both the stock market and home prices that could create a \"negative wealth effect\" that delays or cancels home improvement projects for consumers. The S & P 500 is down about 19% this year. Meanwhile, home prices remain elevated, but are down 8% from their June 2022 peak, according to the note. \"A forecast from the Dallas Fed suggests that the price correction could reach as much as 15-20% in a pessimistic scenario. Therefore, further declines in the stock market and home prices could weigh on demand for home improvement projects,\" Short wrote. However, the story for Home Depot remains constructive over the long term, according to the note. The analyst said Home Depot and Lowe's together share 25% of the home improvement retail industry, meaning the two retailers are a little more insulated from pricing pressures in an inflationary environment. \"As a result, even if the backdrop becomes a little more challenging, we would expect pricing and promotions to remain largely rational given that: a. The largest operators are EDLP retailers; b. The industry has some oligopolistic features within retail; c. Demand for non-discretionary home improvement projects has been relatively inelastic,\" read the note. Shares of Home Depot are off more than 23% this year. The analyst's $335 price target, cut from $390, is about 5% above where shares closed Monday. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

Taco.\n\n\u201cI don't think anyone imagined that it would be as big as it has been,\u201d Galindo said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \u201cIt ended up being the No. 1 podcast in Mexico. ... I remember seeing the charts and it was in the top 100 in all countries. It\u2019s still in the top 100 podcasts today, a year later, and people recognize me from the podcast. ... They\u2019re like, \u2018OMG, you\u2019re Erick Galindo!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe podcast, with a version in English and one in Spanish has made it possible to connect with very different audiences, not only by nationality, but also by age. \u201cIt\u2019s the first podcast my parents listened to,\u201d Galindo pointed out.\n\nEven S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, Marisela Vallejos F\u00e9lix, told Galindo that she didn't expect the podcast would be so popular.\n\nWritten by Galindo and Mendoza as if it were a thriller, the chapters investigate the possible theories surrounding the life and death of the singer. S\u00e1nchez was born and died in the north of Mexico \u2014 in Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa \u2014 but he was well known and continues to be very popular on the other side of the border, especially in Los Angeles, where he lived for several years and achieved his dream of becoming a popular singer.\n\nThe result is an emotional story, set to music by an original \"corrido\" created especially for the podcast.\n\nA podcast narrated by a pocho and a chilango\n\nGalindo, whose family is from Culiac\u00e1n, was born in the U.S. and remembers how shocking S\u00e1nchez's death was for him and his relatives.\n\nIn the case of his older brother, it was literal shock: He had come home visibly affected after learning that his favorite corrido singer had been shot to death, according to the writer in the first episode of the podcast. He wanted to put a cassette with the artist\u2019s hits in the family\u2019s rickety tape recorder, but in trying to remove another stuck cassette with a screwdriver, he was shocked and passed out. When he was barely conscious again, he said between sobs, \"They killed Chalino.\"\n\nErick Galindo, a co-creator of the \"\u00cddolo\" podcast, says people recognize him on the street because of the podcast's popularity. Eulimar N\u00fa\u00f1ez / Noticias Telemundo\n\nThe anecdote shows the deeply personal touch that he and Mendoza give to the narrative, drawing on their own experiences, which ended up producing unique versions of the same story \u2014 each with a completely original language and approach.\n\n\"We started thinking that it would be an exact translation from English to Spanish and vice versa. ... But when we started writing, we realized it wasn\u2019t the same story,\" Galindo said.\n\n\"If you listen to the two episodes, in English and in Spanish ... you will see that the perspective is different,\" Galindo said, \"one is the perspective of a 'pocho' (slang for Mexican American) living in the United States and the other is that of a 'chilango,'\" (referring to someone from Mexico). The Spanish one represents a look from the Mexican states of Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n and Sinaloa, which are epicenters of the war against the drug cartels and much of the violence that shakes the country.\n\n\"\u00cddolo\" co-creator Alejandro Mendoza narrates the Spanish version of the podcast. Gabriela Mart\u00ednez / Noticias Telemundo\n\nThe figure of S\u00e1nchez is an archetype for many Mexicans because of what he represents, Mendoza said, \"a bit like the stereotype of the brave, brave man forging ahead, who has a clear objective and is going to achieve it, who does not leave anyone behind and who had a dream and fulfilled it.\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez represents the experiences of migrant men and women in the United States.

His father died when he was only 6 years old, and he had to learn to make a living with his seven brothers.\n\nAn outlaw-turned-singer\n\nThe podcast takes the listener into the controversy around the late singer, including accounts of S\u00e1nchez's participation in more than one shooting, including an account of a shooting at a party in Culiac\u00e1n when he was \"barely a short teenager,\" as Mendoza narrates in Spanish, an event that forces S\u00e1nchez to immigrate to California.\n\nHe also shot into the audience in the middle of a concert at the Plaza Los Arcos bar in Coachella, California, returning fire after he was shot. He wasn't charged.\n\nThe podcast narrators skillfully weave together the most relevant events in S\u00e1nchez\u2019s life with theories about his death: whether he was killed in revenge for the shooting at the party in Culiac\u00e1n when he was a teen, whether the cartels wanted him dead because of the lyrics to his songs, was it because of a possible love triangle with a furious drug lord, or was it because of possible links to a drug trafficker, among other hypotheses.

Juan Carlos Cruz / EFE\n\n\u201cThe regional Mexican genre is historically associated with drug trafficking and crime,\u201d Mendoza pointed out. It's a complex relationship that stems from a relatively simple principle: Artists talk about what they know, so in a country overwhelmed by crime, it's not surprising that songs about bosses, kilos and machine guns abound.\n\n\u201cThe regional Mexican genre tells stories that happen in the country, and if the country is submerged in violence, there will be a chronicler who talks about it,\u201d Mendoza said.\n\nThere's also humor, reflected in a scene from the second episode on how S\u00e1nchez and his future wife and mother of his two children, Marisela Vallejos F\u00e9lix, met. It was Mendoza's favorite anecdote.\n\nS\u00e1nchez is driving through the streets of East Los Angeles and sees a woman he likes standing on the sidewalk getting wet in the rain. Then, he offers her a rid in his car, a gesture both gallant and arrogant.\n\nFor Mendoza, the scene says a lot about the two characters.\n\n\u201cHe was exercising this image of power, like, \u2018Hey, I have a car, I\u2019m handsome, get in,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I love it because her response speaks of the character of the Mexican woman. ... She said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll get on, but you let me drive,\u2019 and she drove, but she did it so fast that Chalino himself was scared. And well, he liked that.\u201d\n\nBetween shootings, love anecdotes and theories about an unsolved crime, the narrators take the listener by the hand through S\u00e1nchez\u2019s story, until his last days.\n\nA newspaper clipping announcing the concert by Chalino S\u00e1nchez in Coachella on Jan. 26, 1992. newspapers.com\n\nAfter the artist's involvement in the Coachella shooting while he was on stage, he catapulted to fame.\n\nAfter the shooting, he was hospitalized in serious condition after being hit by two bullets. But a few months later, when he was barely recovering, he made a risky decision that put him on a deadly path: He returned to Culiac\u00e1n to sing to his people the corridos that made him famous.\n\nHe arrived in Sinaloa to present what would be his last concert on May 16, 1992. The concert was sold out, the audience sang along to all the songs and S\u00e1nchez was probably giving the performance of his life, the podcasters explain. In the middle of the merriment, he was approached by a man who handed him a note with a handwritten message, known in the singer\u2019s fan circles as the \"death note.\"\n\nWhat was written on that paper has never been revealed, but his composure changed when he read it. He threw it to the ground and continued playing, as if nothing had happened.\n\nHours later, still at dawn, he was found dead in a canal.

Rumors about why he was killed started immediately: that he had faked his death to escape a possible attack, that the Mexican or U.S. government killed him, that he was a secret hit man for the cartels and got what he deserved.\n\nSince S\u00e1nchez's death, ranchera songs sung with a shrill and out-of-tune voice but with deep passion have gone from being something liked by a select few to becoming the most important musical genre in Mexico.

However, some investors remain bullish on chip stocks and are betting on their strong long-term potential.\n\nOne such investor is Nick Garbrandt, portfolio manager of the Baillie Gifford Emerging EMEA Equity Fund. Speaking to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Alley\u201d on Wednesday, Garbrandt said he remains bullish on the sector, despite its recent performance.\n\n\u201cI am still very much an optimist on the semiconductor space,\u201d Garbrandt said. \u201cI think the sector as a whole has been under-owned for some time.\u201d\n\nGarbrandt cited several reasons for his bullishness, including the strong demand for chips in the coming years. He argued that the demand for chips will likely remain strong as the world becomes increasingly reliant on them for everything from mobile devices to internet-connected devices.\n\n\u201cI think there is huge potential over the next five to ten years in this space,\u201d Garbrandt said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a massive increase in demand as people upgrade their phones and computers, and as more devices are connected to the internet.\u201d\n\nGarbrandt named two chip stocks he is particularly bullish on: Intel Corporation (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM).\n\nHe cited Intel as a \u201clonger-term play,\u201d noting that the company is \u201creally shifting its focus\u201d towards data-centric products like artificial intelligence, 5G networks and cloud computing.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re successful in transitioning into those spaces, then I think the stock will perform well,\u201d Garbrandt said.\n\nGarbrandt also highlighted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a \u201cshort-term play\u201d given its dominant position in the global chip manufacturing space. The company is set to benefit from a surge in demand for chips due to the increasing popularity of 5G and internet-connected devices.\n\n\u201cThe company has a commanding lead in the semiconductor manufacturing space, and I think that\u2019s going to be an important part of the recovery story over the next few years,\u201d Garbrandt said.\n\nThe chip sector has had a difficult year, with many stocks underperforming the wider market. However, Garbrandt\u2019s long-term bullishness on the sector is a sign that there is still potential for chip stocks to perform well in the coming years.

{"text": "A Witcher\u2019s most common tools of the trade are their steel and silver swords. But as students of the magical world they live in, they can also cast simple spells, or Signs. The Witcher 3 gives you five signs to cast in battle, each with varying magical attacks and defenses. The latest update to the game also gives you a brand new way to cast Signs, resulting in a much faster, real-time combat feel.\n\nSince The Witcher 3 is an RPG without a choice of classes, Signs, how you cast them and how you level them up, is one of the ways you can spec out a \u201cGeralt build.\u201d This guide will go over the basics of what Signs to use, when, and why you might want to invest points in different ones.\n\nRead More: Witcher 3 Next-Gen Update Has A Mysterious Cyberpunk 2077 Connection\n\nIf you\u2019re returning to the now-seven year old game after playing it before, you\u2019ll find that the new \u201cQuick Casting\u201d system changes up the pace of battle a bit, and might lead you to consider new ways of using signs in conjunction with other combat moves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Witcher 3 Sign Casting 101\n\nGeralt\u2019s overall effectiveness at casting Signs relies on Stamina and Sign Intensity. These two stats are viewable in the Player Stats menu found by navigating to Inventory in the menu and pressing the Right Trigger (or C on a keyboard).\n\n\n\nYou can boost your base effectiveness at Signs by investing ability points (earned when you level up) in the Griffin School Techniques, Focus, Adrenaline Burst, and Rage Management in the \u201cGeneral\u201d tab of the Character menu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPurchasing these abilities alone won\u2019t give you their benefits, however. You\u2019ll need to activate these abilities after purchasing them by slotting them into any of the nine Ability slots viewable on the right side of the Character menu. You can then boost Sign effectiveness by slotting in a blue mutagen into the diamond shaped slots to the right and left of the slots. These should match in color for the greatest effect.\n\nVarious equipment might also boost Sign Intensity or specific Signs. Viewing an item\u2019s stats in the Inventory menu will tell you what buffs, if any, to Signs you\u2019ll get. You can also further boost Sign buffs by slotting glyphs into open mod slots on gear (the presence of which is indicated by one or more circles on the item\u2019s image in the menu).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy default, Geralt will use up his Stamina meter as he casts a sign. At lower levels, casting a sign will typically deplete the whole bar and you\u2019ll need to wait until it refills before casting again. You also won\u2019t be able to sprint while your Stamina is depleted. If you took Rage Management and have it assigned, you can cast a Sign using an Adrenaline Point (earned after landing an attack on an enemy) when you\u2019ve run out of Stamina.\n\nThe big new update The Witcher 3 recently received didn\u2019t just deliver gorgeous new graphical options and a cool new quest (with new armor and weapons!), however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead More: Let\u2019s Get Geralt The Netflix Series Armor In The New Witcher 3 Quest\n\nHow Next-Gen Witcher Changes Signs (And How To Enable The New Settings)\n\nYou now have a choice of between being able to quickly cast any sign at will with a two button combo, what the new update calls \u201cQuick Casting,\u201d or you can choose to select a sign from a menu that slows down time and bind that to a dedicated sign button, what the game now calls \u201cStandard Casting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStandard Casting was how the game has worked up until the new update. Here you\u2019ll hold down LB/L1 on a controller (Tab on keyboard) to bring up the Quick Access Menu and choose which sign to bind to RT/R2 (Q on keyboard). When rebinding a sign, the action will slow down to a crawl, allowing you some breathing room to figure out which sign makes the most sense. On a keyboard you could also use keys 3 through 7 to select which Sign you wanted to activate with Q.\n\nThe new, \u201cQuick Casting,\u201d option lets you cast whatever Sign you want in combat, almost entirely on the fly. You\u2019ll need to enable this in the pause menu. Navigate to \u201cGameplay,\u201d and you\u2019ll find it as the sixth option down. And it functions slightly differently depending on whether you\u2019re on a gamepad or keyboard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Quick Casting on controller, you\u2019ll hold down RT/R2 and will notice the list of Signs on the bottom right of the HUD. Hit the button that corresponds with the Sign you wish to cast and you\u2019ll cast it, no need to go into the slow-down menu to select it. Note: If you\u2019re maintaining a defensive stance by holding down LT/L2, you will always cast Igni if you press RT/R2. You must let go of your left trigger in order to use Quick Casting, otherwise you\u2019ll always cast Igni.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn keyboard keys 3 through 7 will instantly cast their respective Signs, they no longer select which one will be cast based on a press of the Q key. The Q key, however, will still cast whatever Sign you\u2019ve selected in the Quick Access Menu as indicated as active in the upper right hand corner of the HUD.\n\nAard, Yrden, Igni, Quen, Axii: the five Signs and their uses\n\nGeralt will have access to five unique signs. These are core abilities he will always have access to and their uses vary on the playstyle you\u2019re after, as well as what enemy you\u2019re fighting against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAard: A telekinetic blast that knocks enemies down (and destroys weak objects)\n\nIgni: A blast of fire that damages enemies\n\nYrden: A magical trap that slows enemies down\n\nQuen: A shield that protects Geralt from damage\n\nAxii: Dazes enemies (also used in dialogue scenes as a mind trick)\n\nEach of these Signs has an alternate casting ability you can invest ability points in to unlock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAard alternate: Area of effect attack that knocks all enemies surrounding Geralt down\n\nIgni alternate: A continuous stream of flame instead of one blast\n\nYrden Alternate: The trap now causes damage\n\nQuen alternate: A larger bubble shield surrounds Geralt and lasts longer than the standard shield\n\nAxii alternate: Enemies are tricked into temporarily fighting as your allies\n\nWhile you\u2019ll earn enough ability points to customize and boost a few different Signs, you\u2019ll have to make some decisions as to which will fit your playstyle. While Signs can become very powerful, Geralt is not a spellcaster. In some ways Signs are always augmentations to fighting with swords. Let\u2019s go over a few use cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcelling at combat (especially at higher difficulties) relies on using some of everything here, but if you want to directly boost your magic abilities for attacking, crowd control, or defense, this is where to invest your points.\n\nIf you want your Signs to deal damage, focus on Igni first, Yrden second. Igni is a direct fire attack. And you\u2019ll find that many monsters, such as Griffins and Drowners, are weak against this. (Always consult your bestiary before fighting a monster. The listing will indicate their various weaknesses, which may include specific Signs). Depending on whether you prefer a blast or stream of continuous damage, you might want to stick to the base Igni attack, or unlock and go with the alternate one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYrden on its own doesn\u2019t deal damage, but it will slow enemies in its radius down, making it easier for you to attack them. However, the alternate version of this Sign will deal damage in addition to slowing down a target.\n\nNote that Aard and Quen can be leveled up to deal damage, but that will take some investment and isn\u2019t as direct as casting a fire spell or a trap that zaps enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want your Signs to help with crowd control, focus on Aard, Axii, and Yrden. Some fights can see Geralt get surrounded pretty quickly. There are a number of attack and defensive moves that can help you get out of a tight spot, but Signs will make that even easier.\n\nTo start, the telekinetic blast of Aard will quickly knock enemies directly in front of you down, and if you unlock and equip the alternate form of Aard, you can knock enemies surrounding you down. This Sign is great for large amounts of enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAxii will help you thin advancing enemies by either stunning one of them into a daze or by tricking them into fighting on your behalf.\n\nCasting Yrden is also a good way to control a group that has you surrounded. Cast it and roll out of the trap\u2019s area. The enemies will give chase, but their movement speed will be reduced, giving you a chance to catch your breath, cast Igni at them, or prepare for an alternate strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlways be casting Quen. While some might find Quen\u2019s stamina drain to be a little taxing, you should consider casting it often. Quen is a shield that\u2019ll protect Geralt from attacks. Boosted abilities will allow the shield to even return some damage if Geralt is struck. You should cast Quen at the start of every fight\u2014especially if you\u2019re playing at higher difficulties. Quen can be cast rather quickly. So unless you are saving your Stamina to use with a specific Sign, you should take every possible moment to make sure you have an active Quen shield. Quen is useful whether you max it out or never spend a single ability point on it.\n\nShould You Use Quick or Standard Casting In The Witcher 3?\n\nAs someone who\u2019s invested many hundreds of hours into The Witcher 3, I came to appreciate the brief pauses in action while selecting a new Sign under the Standard Casting method. It reminds me of the way that the action would pause in Knights of the Old Republic whenever you\u2019d spot an enemy. Since RPG combat so often relies on rock-paper-scissors outcomes of stat math, having those moments to think \u201cmy health is low, time to fall back on Quen, then I\u2019ll get my enemy into a Yrden trap\u201d can make combat a bit more digestible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile in the Quick Access Menu, you can also consume potions or food. So switching up a Sign is also a good time to hit a health or stat boost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, on PC, it\u2019s rather quick to simply hit a number key. In some ways, using a keyboard with Standard Casting is sort of an \u201cin between\u201d casting mode.\n\nThe newer casting method lets you switch up Signs way faster. Some might find this to dramatically increase the pace of combat (the action will still slow down if you\u2019re changing up bombs). In that way it can lead to a harder game, but perhaps one that feels more seamless and action-oriented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Quick Casting you\u2019ll be able to change up tactics a little more easily since you can swiftly lay down a Yrden Sign, roll back and immediately cast Igni if your Stamina is back to full, for example. In my experience with Quick Casting, it kept the combat moving along; but I did miss those brief moments to weigh different tactics while in the Quick Access Menu.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019ll be up to your playstyle. If you like slower RPGs, or even turn-based games, the Standard Casting method might not bother you. If you like more immediate action RPGs, though, Quick Casting might help make the game feel more responsive.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The United States is facing a labor shortage, particularly in industries like construction, manufacturing, and warehousing. Employers in many states are offering higher wages and more attractive benefits, but they still can't find enough workers. At the same time, millions of workers are stuck in jobs that don't pay a living wage and offer little in terms of job security. \n\nSo what's the solution? It starts with raising wages. \n\nFor the last decade, the federal minimum wage has remained stuck at $7.25 an hour, the same rate it has been since 2009. In today's economy, this isn't nearly enough to make ends meet. According to the Economic Policy Institute, a family of four needs an annual income of at least $48,500 just to pay for basic necessities. To reach that level, an employee would need to make $23.40 an hour.\n\nStates have begun to take matters into their own hands, and some have gone far beyond the federal minimum wage. For example, California, Massachusetts, and Washington all have minimum wages of $12 or more, and in New York the minimum is $15. \n\nBut in many states, the minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 an hour. This is particularly true in states with lower overall wages, like Mississippi, Arkansas, and South Carolina. The same is true for some of the rural and small-town areas in more populous states like Missouri and Indiana.\n\nAnd in even more states, the minimum wage isn't $7.25 an hour \u2014 it's lower. In Louisiana and Alabama, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour only for those who are covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. In those states, the minimum wage for some workers is actually $2.13 an hour.\n\nAnd the thing is, raising wages won't just be good for workers \u2014 it will also be good for employers, who will be able to attract more workers with higher wages and better benefits. This is especially true in industries with chronic labor shortages, like hospitality, construction, and manufacturing.\n\nThe good news is that some states are taking matters into their own hands. In California, for instance, lawmakers recently passed a bill that would raise the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. Other states are moving in the same direction, with Oregon and Illinois both introducing legislation to raise their minimum wages to $15 an hour by 2022.\n\nBut as long as the federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 an hour, millions of workers in states across the country will continue to be stuck in jobs that don't pay a living wage and offer little in terms of job security. And until that happens, the labor shortage will likely continue. \n\nIf we want to solve the labor shortage, we should start by raising wages. It's time for Congress to do the right thing and give American workers the pay they deserve.", "label": "machine"}

The two companies rose 9% and 16%, respectively, this week as investors sought out stocks with momentum and resilience.\n\nNike has been a stock market leader for some time, and this week the company once again outperformed expectations. After the company reported earnings that beat estimates, the stock rose 9%. The quarterly results showed strong demand for Nike's products and digital efforts and the company is continuing to expand its e-commerce operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, a drugmaker focused on cancer treatments and autoimmune diseases, also had a strong week.

The results showed the company continuing to make progress in its efforts to move away from traditional fitness trackers and into more fashion-focused wearables.\n\nTesla also saw a surge this week, rising 8% after the company's Gigafactory in Nevada began production. Tesla has long been one of the most closely watched stocks on the market, and its continued progress in electric vehicle production has been bullish for the company's share price.\n\nFinally, emerging markets were a major source of strength this week. Chinese stocks surged after the country announced plans to reduce its corporate tax rate, while Indian equities soared as the government unveiled new budget reforms.\n\nOverall, it has been a strong week for stocks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all closing at records. Despite continued concerns about the economic outlook, investors appear to be finding refuge in certain stocks that offer attractive opportunities in this difficult market environment. As the holidays approach and the vaccine rollout begins, investors may continue to gravitate toward the stocks that have shown strength and resilience in this turbulent year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Since the start of 2021, Wall Street has been incredibly volatile. A contentious US election combined with fears over the coronavirus pandemic, the rollout of vaccines and the coming of a new year have all added to the market's frothiness. The heightened volatility has led to some stocks being oversold, giving investors an opportunity to scoop up mega-cap stocks at deep discounts.\n\nMorningstar, the investment research firm, has identified nine mega-cap stocks that are trading at deep discounts and have the potential to jump by up to 129% in the first quarter of 2021. The stocks are Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Johnson & Johnson, Visa, Mastercard and Qualcomm.\n\nThe stocks were identified by Morningstar\u2019s equity strategist, R.J. Hottovy, who said the stocks \u201crepresent a great opportunity for investors looking to gain exposure to a select number of high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations.\u201d\n\nHottovy pointed out that the current market sentiment is \u201cat odds with the long-term prospects for these companies.\u201d He noted that in the current environment, investors should focus on quality stocks with strong fundamentals, such as the nine stocks identified by Morningstar.\n\nHe went on to say that the stocks are trading at discounts to their estimated intrinsic value, ranging from 6%-44%. Hottovy believes these companies will have solid financial performances in 2021, which would lead to the stock prices moving closer to their intrinsic values.\n\nWhen asked about the potential upside for the stocks, Hottovy said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some of these names jump by as much as 50%-129% in the next quarter.\u201d He went on to say that he believes the stocks could be worth significantly more by the end of 2021.\n\nHottovy also added that he believes investors should focus on the companies\u2019 fundamentals, rather than the short-term market volatility. He said that while short-term volatility is normal, the long-term fundamentals of these companies remain strong and should be the focus of investors.\n\nFor those looking to add these nine mega-cap stocks to their portfolio, now could be an opportune time. Morningstar\u2019s estimates indicate that these stocks could jump by up to 129% in the first quarter of 2021 and be worth significantly more by the end of the year.

Last year, Microsoft said it would support approaches that would make it simpler for its employees to join unions.\n\nIn recent months three groups of employees at video game publisher Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is working to acquire, have unionized, but Microsoft has yet to complete the nearly $69 billion deal that competition regulators have pushed back on. Last week, the Communications Workers of America said a supermajority of employees at Proletariat, a Boston-based game studio Activision Blizzard acquired in mid-2022, had voted to unionize.\n\nNow U.S. quality-assurance employees across multiple studios at ZeniMax, a video game publisher Microsoft bought in 2021 for $8.1 billion, are organizing with the CWA, which has also worked with the Activision Blizzard workers.

{"text": "Since the Bears lost Sunday, I find myself stuck on the direction the team should take for the finale. It wasn\u2019t that the Bears lost \u2014they\u2019re in the middle of a nine-game losing streak \u2014 it\u2019s how they lost. In a season where wins have been hard to come by it was disappointing to see what can only be described as quitting.\n\nThe q-word is a terrible label. I\u2019m sure that there are plenty of Bears players who are physically and mentally exhausted. The end of this season must feel like reaching Valhalla, but on Sunday the Bears didn\u2019t exhibit Matt Eberflus\u2019 H.I.T.S principle one bit and it was distressing.\n\nThis team has one more game to play and their approach to it is interesting to me. Eberflus said Sunday that if Justin Fields is healthy, he will play. But should he?\n\nHere are some arguments for and against. You decide.\n\nQB rushing record\n\nJustin Fields is very close to breaking Lamar Jackson\u2019s rushing record. With one game to play, Fields only needs 64 rushing yards to set a new mark for quarterbacks. Fields has walked with the immortals, knocking down record after record. I\u2019m not sure if this record means anything to him. He may have given us a glimpse of how he feels about his run-usage a couple weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan on rushing for a 1,000 yards every year,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cLike I said before, it\u2019s an honor and a blessing from God and I couldn\u2019t do it without my coaches and teammates.\u201d\n\nGoing forward this is not what he thinks is the most effective way to use him, but since he\u2019s inside of an unprecedented season why not cap it off with something historic?\n\nGame reps\n\nCoaches believe there\u2019s nothing more valuable than live reps. This whole season has pretty much been Fields and offensive coordinator, Luke Getsy, getting on the same page and finding out how far he can be pushed.\n\nThe problem with this as it pertains to the Vikings game is what happened against Detroit. If Bears players have already checked out and the Vikings are still fighting for seeding, it could be embarrassing. They could be physically dominated. Fields was sacked seven times by a Lions defense that struggles defensively. Fields has taken a bunch of hits this year. He had a reputation for being tough walking into the NFL and this season hasn\u2019t done anything to change that perception.\n\nIt becomes a risk-reward situation for the Bears. Everyone wants to ensure that Fields makes it out of the season with just bumps and bruises. You don\u2019t want him dealing with an injury while trying to get ready for next season.\n\nRhythm with Claypool\n\nSince the Bears traded a high second-round pick to the Steelers for Claypool, everyone has been trying to figure out how to unlock his potential and get on the same page with Fields. Claypool had a display of frustration after the loss to the Lions. It\u2019s understandable. I\u2019m sure he saw this whole thing going differently in his mind.\n\nTheoretically, the Bears could treat this like a preseason game. They could use the reps to get Claypool more targets than the anemic one target he had in Detroit.\n\nThe counter to this is that Claypool needs entire offseason to digest the playbook. He may be better served working through it with Fields after they each take a break to let their bodies heal.\n\nThe draft\n\nIf the NFL Draft was held today, the Bears would pick second. If they lose Sunday, there\u2019s a chance they can snatch the top pick. Anywhere in the top three gives the Bears sufficient leverage to make trades with other teams that are desperate for one of the top quarterbacks.\n\nThe Bears need more good players. Making some savvy moves as the draft nears would allow them to rebuild faster. The nightmare scenario is that Fields has one of those game where he offers a virtuoso performance and wins the game. Then the Bears could be drafting fourth.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to consider. What do you hope the Bears do with Fields? Should he play or should he sit?\n\nYou can hear Laurence Holmes talk Chicago sports Monday to Friday from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. on 670 The Score with Dan Bernstein.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "If you had more shoes on your wishlist than goals for 2023, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Shoes will make or break your outfit, your night, and your whole life if you let them. The runways\u2014and the streets\u2014of spring 2023 fashion month were stomped on by all kinds of footwear. And according to two buyers in the fashion industry, that\u2019ll be the case throughout the year. From mega-high platforms to tiny kitten heels, clunky boots to sculptural shoes, and heavy embellishments to minimalist thongs, the new year will be all about variety. Pick your favorites to try out (with your best spring 2023 fashion trends and 2023 bag trends, of course) from the styles below.\n\nPlatforms\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nWhether you\u2019re 5\u20192\u201d like our mother monster Lady Gaga or 5\u201910\u201d, making you taller than most men if you wear even short heels, platforms will make anyone feel on top of the world. Look down on your enemies in these wicked shoes (and take them for a practice run before you go out and twist your ankle). Thank Gucci, Schiaparelli, and Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood for taking this trend to new heights. \u201cLoud platform heels paired with a sexy bodycon dress are definitely a clear trend for spring 2023,\u201d said Tiffany Hsu, \u2019s Fashion Buying Director. \u201cStatement shoes from Amina Muaddi and Mach & Mach are the perfect staple to pair with any mini-skirt.\u201d\n\nKnee High Boots\n\nDaniel Zuchnik\n\nAre you wearing the...trending knee-high boots of the upcoming season? Yeah, I am. Heel or no heel, knee-high boots are the ideal height for styling with mini skirts, slit-leg midi dresses, or, dare I say, skinny jeans. As long as the pants are leather, we\u2019ll allow it.\n\nTiny Kitten Heels\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nFor just a little bump-up but not too much, try the kitten heel. \u201cThe biggest trend in shoes is something we are dubbing the \u2018fashion footwear comedown,\u2019\u201d said Ryan Kleman, the Director of Buying, Non-Apparel at . \u201cFor so long, the best shoes in the market were north of 100mm. Now, we are seeing a fashionable return to heel heights somewhere in the middle. The key to mastering this trend is not sacrificing the fashion or the sexy.\u201d\n\nHeavy Boots\n\nMelodie Jeng\n\nIf you need a shoe that will keep you grounded, these are for you. Your feet might feel literally anchored to the floor, but at least you\u2019ll look really cool in the heavy shoe trend for 2023. And your feet will get used to the extra weight...think of it like a workout with ankle bands. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\nToe Ring Sandals\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nPerhaps as a nod to the nineties and noughties, toe rings are back for spring 2023. Only this time, they\u2019re on your shoes. Tory Burch, Lanvin, and Stella McCartney are all in on the trend.\n\nEmbellishments\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nChains, studs, rhinestones, pearls, and more adorned the shoes on the spring runways, from Junya Watanabe and Alaia to Ottolinger and Paco Rabanne. As for what you\u2019ll see on Moda? \u201cBoots that are anything but boring,\u201d Kleman says. \u201cEveryone seems to have their everyday boots and are opting to refresh their shoe closet with thigh-highs, heavy embellishments, or denim variations.\u201d\n\n\n\nSuper Strappy\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nStrappy sandal heels will always be a spring and summer classic, so get your pedicures scheduled in advance. Missoni, Ulla Johnson, and A.W.A.K.E. Mode had the standouts this season, but until they reach the stores, check out these styles.\n\nClear Heels\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nTake clues from Bottega Veneta, Valentino, and Dries van Noten\u2019s runway shows: clear is the new black. The references for this trend aren\u2019t totally clear (pun intended), but whether inspired by glassware, \u201990s jelly accessories, or club dancer culture, its popularity on the runways is nothing but transparent.\n\nSculptural Heels\n\nChristian Vierig\n\nArtistic and edgy, these shoes are sure to start a conversation, so make sure you\u2019re elegantly crossing your legs when you can so they\u2019re on display to the world. They might not have been sculpted by Michelangelo himself, but we can settle for Rick Owens.\n\nThong Sandals\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nIf you love flip flops but don\u2019t want to look like a total surfer bro, try them with a heel, as seen in Coperni and Burberry\u2019s spring collections. Perfectly minimal and sexy, the style gives your foot an elongated, slender shape without the hassle of straps or buckles.\n\nUpdated Loafers\n\nEdward Berthelot\n\nPragmatists can get behind this trend. From the office to brunch to shopping around town, these definitely aren\u2019t your father\u2019s loafers, nor are they ugly commuter shoes. These loafers are made to be seen.", "label": "human"}

Byron Donalds of Florida \u2014 a Black Republican who was first elected to a southwest Florida district in 2020 \u2014 as their candidate.\n\nHe was nominated alongside Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who had already made history as the first Black person chosen to lead a party in Congress. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped down from leadership at the end of the last Congress, though she will remain in the House as a rank-and-file lawmaker.\n\nThe Florida Republican ultimately garnered 20 votes on three different ballots on Wednesday. Combined with the 212 Democratic votes for Jeffries, a majority of the chamber voted for a Black candidate. McCarthy once again failed to garner the necessary votes to become speaker.\n\n\"Byron is a dear friend, a solid conservative, but mostly importantly, a family man,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas as he nominated Donalds on the fourth ballot. \"Now, here we are, and for the first time in history, there have been two Black Americans placed into the nomination for speaker of the House.\"\n\nThe chamber then erupted into applause.\n\n\"However, we do not seek to judge people by the color of their skin, but rather the content of their character,\" Roy continued.\n\n\u2014ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 4, 2023\n\nIn a later speech, Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania noted that the first Black members elected to Congress in the 1800s following the Civil War had been Republicans, though that took place before party re-alignment driven by the GOP's so-called \"Southern Strategy.\"\n\nDonalds previously served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2016 to 2020. A member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, he is one of five Black Republicans who have been elected to serve in the 118th Congress.\n\nDonalds' nomination came on the fourth ballot for House speaker. The House held three votes in a row for the position on Tuesday, but adjourned without choosing a candidate or swearing in any of its members.\n\nRepublican leader Kevin McCarthy has continually failed the majority of votes necessary to become speaker, earning fewer votes than Jeffries on every ballot so far, despite Republicans holding a narrow majority in the lower chamber.\n\nBut not everyone was enthused by the historic nature of Donalds' candidacy. Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, a progressive \"Squad\" member and former Black Lives Matter organizer, referred to Donalds as a \"prop\" who supports an agenda \"upholding and perpetuating white supremacy.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Soccer is the most popular sport in Argentina. Actually, it might be more than that.\n\nBorn in Frontera, Argentina, Fire midfielder Federico Navarro was back in his home country when Lionel Messi and the national team beat France in a thrilling final to win the World Cup. Navarro recalled the Argentina\u2019s reaction to the victory, one that gave the South American nation its third world championship.\n\n\u201cHere, it\u2019s the maximum that can happen to all of us,\u201d Navarro said through a translator. \u201cHere, especially, [soccer] is before anything in Argentina, before anything else. I feel like people here breathe in [soccer]. The world stops when the team is playing.\u201d\n\nNavarro, 22, made his professional debut for Argentine club Talleres in 2019. Though he gets paid to play the sport, it\u2019s clear his fandom and love of the sport hasn\u2019t waned.\n\nWhen he spoke about being in Argentina during its triumph in Qatar, Navarro didn\u2019t sound like a stilted pro who only views the game as a way to pad his bank account. He spoke like somebody proud of his nation, and truly grateful to share the moment with his family and fellow Argentines.\n\n\u201cIt means the world to an Argentine,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cI was able to be in the country and watch it with my wife, but also with my grandmother, and I was able to live it as a fan and [to] watch the team win it was incredible. I really can\u2019t explain it to you. It was just so incredible.\n\n\u201cEverywhere, the people were stopped. Everyone was watching. In this country, it\u2019s the absolute maximum thing that could ever happen. Everyone wants for the team to win the World Cup.\u201d\n\nNavarro isn\u2019t the only Fire player with ties to Argentina.\n\nMidfielder Gaston Gimenez was born in Formosa, Argentina, and appeared in one match for the national team before switching to Paraguay. Navarro said he and Gimenez had been talking about the World Cup all last year, eager to see how Argentina would fare.\n\nNow that Argentina has won, Navarro and Gimenez are planning to celebrate when they see each other by drinking mate, a traditional tea-like caffeine-infused beverage.\n\n\u201c[Gimenez] is Argentine 100%,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cI know that he switched over to play with another team because of [soccer], because sometimes [soccer] is that way and things like that happen.\u201d\n\nA defensive midfielder who\u2019s built a reputation for strong challenges and endless energy, Navarro has established himself as a key part of the Fire midfield. Taking the next step and getting into contention for the 2026 World Cup roster won\u2019t be easy because of the strength of Argentina\u2019s player pool, but Navarro hopes to make that happen after improving his game and gaining more experience.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest dream, the dream that every Argentine player has, to wear the shirt of the national team,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cMaybe more for us, we feel it a little bit differently, as Argentines are very passionate, and especially when it comes to representing our country and playing for our flag.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It was a busy year for Congress, which passed a slew of consequential bills, most of which enjoyed support from both parties. And it may be the high-water mark of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency from a legislative standpoint, with Republicans poised to take over the House of Representatives early in 2023.\n\nAs two years of full Democratic control come to an end, here are five of the most significant bills passed in 2022.\n\nA sweeping climate, health and tax bill\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act represents the largest attempt in U.S. history to combat climate change with a $369 billion package of clean-energy funding covering cars and homes and businesses. It also aims to curb methane emissions and sets aside money for communities heavily affected by air pollution and other climate-related issues.\n\nThe legislation contains new measures to lower prescription drug costs, including a provision that empowers Medicare to negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry, a new $2,000 yearly cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions through Medicare, and a $35 monthly insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries. It\u2019s funded by a potpourri of new taxes, including a 15% corporate minimum tax.\n\nThere\u2019s more funding for IRS tax collection included in the bill, too.\n\nIt passed with the slimmest of margins \u2014 a vote of 51-50 in the Senate, winning over every Democratic senator and requiring Vice President Kamala Harris to break the tie, and 220-207 in the House. Not a single Republican voted for it.\n\nA new election law aimed at preventing another Jan. 6\n\nThe massive government funding bill that passed Friday included a major election reform package designed to prevent future presidential candidates from stealing elections.\n\nThe Electoral Count Reform Act will revise the 1887 Electoral Count Act to make clear the vice president cannot discount electoral votes. It\u2019ll raise the threshold for objections from one member of each the House and Senate to one-fifth of both chambers. It\u2019ll also prevent competing slates of electors and simplify state certification with mechanisms to assure the rightful winner is certified.\n\nThe bipartisan package, led by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is aimed at closing gaps in federal law that former President Donald Trump and his allies sought to exploit to stay in power after losing the 2020 election. It\u2019s designed to protect U.S. elections going forward and prevent another Jan. 6.\n\nThe toughest new gun law in nearly 30 years\n\nFor the first time in nearly three decades, Congress tightened gun laws, in response to growing public support for action to address mass shootings that have become common in the U.S.\n\nThe Safer Communities Act \u2014 a bipartisan bill led by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and John Cornyn, R-Texas \u2014 include grants for states to pass \u201cred flag\u201d laws designed to block people who could pose a threat to themselves or others from purchasing or owning a firearm.\n\nIt beefs up background checks of 18- to 21-year-olds, opening the door to examining juvenile records. It attempts to close the \u201cboyfriend loophole\u201d by keeping firearms away from dating partners who are convicted of abuse. The law also clarifies which gun sellers are required to register as licensees and thus forced to conduct background checks on potential buyers.\n\nThe action in Washington came in response to mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, that occurred 10 days apart and killed a combined 31 people, including 19 schoolchildren.\n\nA law to improve U.S. competition with China\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act is both a major piece of legislation and a message that the U.S. doesn\u2019t intend to fall behind China when it comes to global competitiveness.\n\nThe law \u2014 which grew out of a bill first negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind. \u2014 makes a whopping $280 billion investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and tax breaks for the production of chips.\n\nThe White House and congressional defenders have described it as an essential step to revitalizing the struggling U.S. manufacturing industry and making a downpayment in the American workforce. It\u2019s another bipartisan success story for this Congress, representing a rare point of strong consensus between the two parties: that the U.S. must combat China\u2019s rising influence on the world stage.\n\nEnshrining same-sex marriage\n\nOne of the final acts of the Democratic-controlled Congress was to pass a law that codifies federal protections for marriages between same-sex and interracial couples.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act \u2014 led by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the first openly gay American elected to the Senate \u2014 forces the federal government to recognize legally performed same-sex marriages and to ensure couples full benefits \u201cregardless of the couple\u2019s sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.\u201d It will not require states to grant marriage licenses against state law, but same-sex couples will enjoy the benefits if they get married in a different state.\n\nThe legislation came about after the new 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court voted last summer to overturn Roe v. Wade, prompting critics to fear that it could do the same to same-sex marriage rights. The new law provides a backstop against that possibility.\n\nIt reflects growing U.S. support for legal same-sex marriage and was a celebratory moment for Biden a decade after he upstaged his then-boss, President Barack Obama, by jumping out ahead of him to declare his support for same sex marriage as vice president.", "label": "human"}

So I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that, Heidi, what do you wish candidates were able to say about the economy, and maybe you can hypothesize about why you think they\u2019re not saying it, but what do you wish they were able to say about the economy to the American people?\n\nHeidi: This question really cuts at the heart of a lot of problems that we\u2019re seeing right now.

Yes, inflation is very, very high right now, that is 100 percent true, but there\u2019s just not all that much that policymakers can do about that inflation because it is a global phenomenon caused by pandemic.\n\nFelicia: You don\u2019t think that would be satisfying as a stump speech?\n\nHeidi: Yes. It\u2019s so very, very hard to say, and it\u2019s such a big thing. It looms so large in people\u2019s minds.\n\nFelicia: But what do you wish people were saying?\n\nHeidi: It is that the pace of this recovery has just been unbelievable. It\u2019s like nothing I have ever seen before and the fact that some people think right now, according to polls, that we\u2019re actually in a recession is mind-boggling because we are in the fastest recovery in my lifetime, at least.\n\nFelicia: They\u2019re still feeling a whole lot of uncertainty, anxiety, fear, maybe that\u2019s some of what that polling is picking up.\n\nHeidi: Yeah and high inflation, stuff costs a lot of money. If we could just hold on until inflation comes naturally down because the things that are spiking inflation are abating.\n\nFelicia: You mean supply chain problems.\n\nHeidi: Price of oil coming down; supply chain problems are clearly easing; the spending patterns that shift from services to goods that caused a lot of inflation problems that\u2019s normalizing. Other costs are slowing. We know housing costs spiked in the pandemic, but lately the cost faced by people\u2019s buying homes or renters renting new places are clearly coming down. That\u2019s not showing up in the overall numbers yet because the overall housing indexes, they take into account the average of everyone. When price of new homes is coming down, it takes a little while for that to have this broader effect, but it is calming. So those slowdowns are happening. If we can just hold tight, while we are still very much suffering through this spike in inflation, and really take stock of all that we have done, like the weirdly named Inflation Reduction Act, which is really a climate bill that has a potential to have just put us on a path toward not burning the planet down. It\u2019s just these absolutely remarkable things that have been done, have not spiked our inflation rate as we know, as we already discussed, but are just incredibly important steps in the future of this country and this world frankly.\n\nMichael: You\u2019ve opened the door, Heidi, with a few of the things you\u2019ve mentioned to a bigger picture discussion and Joelle we\u2019d love to hear from you first on this. All four of us in our different ways are involved in this ongoing battle to change the economic paradigm of the country and to get away from the neoliberal free market presumptions that have governed so much of economic policymaking in the last 40 years and to move toward something different, something that is more rooted in thinking about workers, thinking about the middle class, emphasizing public investment, emphasizing that the public sector can create growth as well as the private sector. All the kinds of questions that you\u2019re all familiar with. How far down that road, Joelle, are we?\n\nJoelle: Well that is the million-dollar question, even adjusting for inflation.\n\nHeidi: Several-trillion-dollar question\n\nFelicia: $4 trillion question\n\nMichael: $4.38 trillion question\n\nFelicia: Oh boy, economist jokes, very bad. Sorry, Joelle, you should go.\n\nJoelle: To be honest, it\u2019s hard to say because where we are right now is what feels like another very reactionary moment, one where every time we release a number, prognosticators come up with their new predictions that they aren\u2019t completely sure of until the next number comes out. That\u2019s at least how it feels from where I sit, as someone who needs to keep track of ongoing trends and use data to inform policy decisions. So I am really interested in, I would say, two things: doing things that help people and doing them well, because that feels like the right long-term strategy for shifting how people view the role of government and how people view the role of government is critical to shifting the economic paradigm.\n\nSo that is how I view it, because it can feel very easy to get into the \u201cwho\u2019s side is winning, who\u2019s side is losing\u201d and then of course, people move from one side to the other. People think something was a good idea yesterday. Today, they hate it and that\u2019s just the nature of the beast. From where I sit, working in the Department of Labor, it\u2019s hard to get into those kinds of debates when we have potential regulations that can help workers get classified properly, which we just proposed a rule around, the independent contractor rule.\n\nFelicia: What does it mean to classify a worker?\n\nJoelle: Some workers are classified as independent contractors, so not employees, so they don\u2019t actually get all of the benefits that are accrued to them under the law. Those are the kinds of things that we have to focus on because if we can do that right, do it well, and people start to think differently about their relationship to government, to their workplace, to start to feel power, to start to feel like they are a part of a democracy, I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to win this overall war over the paradigm, whereas right now the individual battles feel very reactionary, just to be honest.\n\nMichael: This fight to change the way we make economic policy and the way we get Americans to think about economic policy, how many years is this fight going to take, do you think?\n\nHeidi: It has been going on for decades. It used to be that people really, really thought that a perfectly competitive labor market was a reasonable approximation for what\u2019s really going on in the world, not that it\u2019s exactly true, but it\u2019s a reasonable approximation. What that means is that economists believed that workers and employers essentially have equal power. They have equal footing. An employer loses their worker, that\u2019s hard for them. A worker loses their job, that\u2019s hard for them, and it\u2019s kind of equal. The idea isn\u2019t any inherent power balance that would require things like minimum wages or unions to actually create more balance in the labor market, that idea is really, really breaking down and economists now really recognize that that model of perfect competition actually isn\u2019t a good approximation for essentially any labor market.\n\nFelicia: Because some people have more power in labor markets than others.\n\nHeidi: Yes, employers in particular have a lot more power inherently than workers. Losing one worker is not as big of a problem for them as a worker losing their job. It just is not. The idea that that is equivalent, people are waking up to that being a little bit just bonkers. And so once that idea is understood to be really problematic, then this whole structure crumbles.\n\nFelicia: This whole structure of perfect competition in labor markets as part of economic dogma or economic common sense.\n\nHeidi: Yeah and then all of the policy prescriptions that follow from that like, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a strong safety net.\u201d \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have strong labor standards.\u201d \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a strong union movement.\u201d All of those things that I just said, shouldn\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t. The \u201cshouldn\u2019ts\u201d were supported by the perfect competition, neoliberal, and that foundation is really crumbling. So there\u2019s been a big shift, and I think it will\u2014\n\nMichael: And the shouldn\u2019ts become shoulds.\n\nHeidi: The shouldn\u2019ts become \u201cabsolutely we should do this.\u201d They can actually push our economy towards being running better, being more efficient. I think these are\u2014I totally get Joelle\u2019s point that there\u2019s lots of reactionary stuff going on but just more broadly in the public discourse\u2014but I think this shift amongst economists, that\u2019s not going to go away so quickly. That is a real, you can actually just see the new academics coming up that understand the economy in a new way, and they\u2019re not going to just go back on that broad, broad understanding of their field. I do think that there has been this really important shift that we\u2019re still seeing it unfold and there\u2019s certainly people within the and without the economics field that are fiercely resisting this change, but we\u2019re seeing the effects now and we\u2019ll be seeing them for a long time to come. You can see the effects already in the differences in priorities between the Obama administration and the Biden administration.\n\nFelicia: Do you mean the priorities in terms of how important it is to promote unionization and the right to organize?\n\nHeidi: Unionization, the right to organize, and also, the push for much larger stimulus packages. The Obama administration really was pushing for it and were just stymied. There\u2019s just been obviously a big shift in the way people think about this to have allowed the response that we did in response to the Covid recession.\n\nFelicia: So Joelle, what Heidi just said was that unions are important and that academic economists are newly understanding of union\u2019s importance in strengthening labor markets. From where you sit in this administration, is that something that you are arguing for? Is that something that you can bring to life? And what is the economic rationale for that?\n\nJoelle: I completely agree that the recognition that labor markets are not perfect is really important to a bunch of conclusions that argue for increasing workers\u2019 power in the worker versus employer dynamic and that lands you on things like unions being a good countervailing power to employer power when it comes to someone trying to get a job or negotiate for higher wages, et cetera, to make sure that people get wages that are actually representative of how much value they bring to the firm, which is a lot.\n\nI think that that\u2019s a really important shift in the economic consensus that leads you to seeing unions as getting to better outcomes in the labor market economically. I think from where we sit at the Department of Labor, we very much support workers\u2019 rights to unionize and there\u2019s a lot of economic evidence that that can lead to a lot of outcomes that are really good for workers too. It\u2019s not just about making the labor market about efficiency. Here you see things that are good for workers, like higher wages. You see things like better benefits, better job quality, fewer labor law violations from unionized workplaces.\n\nFelicia: Yeah, we\u2019ve talked to people about the importance of, we\u2019ve talked to other guests, Dorian Warren in particular, about the importance of unions to ensuring workers\u2019 basic health and safety.\n\nJoelle: Yes, exactly, because it is about power. There are lots of ways in which employer power manifests in the workplace. It\u2019s not just lower wages in what workers should be paid, it\u2019s also the quality of the jobs. There are other ways to take a little bit more of workers\u2019 share of what\u2019s produced. That I all think is important, but there\u2019s also broader effects. There\u2019s some emerging research on the relationship between overall union density in the United States and economic inequality. So unions play an important role, it looks like, in actually reducing inequality overall in the U.S. economy as measured by income share. The top 10 percent\u2019s income share was lower when unionization was higher in the United States and that trend in unionization has reversed. Union density is lower and inequality is also higher. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s inherently causal, one thing doesn\u2019t inherently cause the other, but there\u2019s clearly some relationship there and I\u2019m glad to see that there\u2019s a lot more research on that.\n\nMichael: This has been really fascinating and we\u2019re going to wrap it up now with the final question that we ask all of our guests, Joelle first and then Heidi. As you know, this show is called How to Save a Country, and that\u2019s basically the question. What one big thing in your mind will save this country of ours?\n\nJoelle: I might cheat and do two things, but I think they\u2019re related.\n\nMichael: Oh, all right.\n\nFelicia: You get two.\n\nMichael: Felicia, is that allowed?\n\nFelicia: Yes, you get two wishes for how to save the country.\n\nJoelle: Thank you. I\u2019d say two things. So earlier I mentioned that I\u2019m really just focused on trying to do things that help people and do them well, in part because that\u2019s what we should be doing in government, but also because I think too often policymaking gets so convoluted. It becomes a pulley system of incentives that are designed to produce outcomes, but they\u2019re done so in a way that people cannot access them. They do not understand it. They do not feel help and often they don\u2019t actually get the help they need. And so bold policies that get people help, they know they got the help, and they know where it came from, which is, the democratic institutions that they elect, the leaders do what something that will actually help them and they feel it, I think that that is absolutely important that we focus on policies that are easy to understand and people can feel their effects. That\u2019s the first thing. And I often use student debt cancellation as an important aspect of that, an important example. The other thing is, of course, democracy and folks having power in our democracy, which I\u2019m sure many of your guests have brought up, but it\u2019s so important, and we\u2019ve been talking about unions, but unions are also critical to democracy as well. Democracy is not just a ballot box issue, though it really is an important one. It\u2019s also about having power in your life, including in your workplace.\n\nMichael: Well said. Heidi?\n\nHeidi: I am going to stick on the union theme. I think there is no such thing as a fair economy without a strong labor movement, without workers being able to join together with their co-workers to make collective demands. The laws that ensure people have the right to unionize have just been totally shot through with loopholes so there\u2019s this enormous gap between the share of people who want to be in a union and the share of people who actually are in a union. In order to truly have support for the right for workers to be able to join a union, we need fundamental labor law reform and there are some really great pieces of legislation that would take us in that direction: the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. Those are the kinds of things that we need to pass.\n\nFelicia: Heidi Shierholz, Joelle Gamble, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you so much for your service to our country, literally your service to our country. We so love talking to you here on How to Save a Country, so thank you.\n\nMichael: Really grateful.\n\nJoelle: Thank you so much. It\u2019s been wonderful.\n\nHeidi: Thank you for having us.\n\nFelicia: So Michael, I want to pick up on that last thing we talked about with Heidi and Joelle: unions. We are seeing such a renewed interest in unions from so many different sectors, so many different people. We\u2019ve talked about unions, as it turns out, a lot on this show. There was even an article in Forbes, pretty mainstream, published recently by Rick McGahey and it was called \u201cAmerica\u2019s New Industrial Policy Needs Unions.\u201d And Rick basically argues that the kind of industrial policy that the Biden administration is pushing, the kind that we talked to Brian Deese about earlier on in this show, that idea that affirmative government investment in certain sectors is the way forward, all of that strategy works best when those sectors are strongly unionized.\n\nMichael: Yeah not only that, I\u2019m still old fashioned enough to believe that unions help build a stronger and more stable and more secure middle class. That\u2019s what happened after World War II.\n\nFelicia: Stronger democracy\n\nMichael: Stronger democracy and more freedom and it can happen again, not on the same scale. We\u2019re never going to get to the point where 34 percent of the private sector workforce is unionized\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to happen again\u2014but right now it\u2019s about 6.5 percent. If that could even be doubled, that would be an amazing development and would have all kinds of positive effects on the workforce and I believe the economy.\n\nNow, Felicia, what\u2019s going on next week? What do you want to tell our listeners about next week\u2019s guest?\n\nFelicia: Next week, drum roll, we have Senator Elizabeth Warren on the podcast.\n\nMichael: That\u2019s pretty cool.\n\nFelicia: Yeah, it\u2019s great. She wants to save a country apparently.\n\nMichael: So you don\u2019t want to miss that folks.\n\nFelicia: Nope, looking forward to it.

In the snap, Khai looked adorable in a long-sleeve dress and pink headband as she smiled up at her brother, who was wearing a white onesie.\n\n\"Cheers to new beginnings .. wishing everyone a blessed 2021,\" Gigi captioned the photo, adding an \"\ud83e\udd0d\" at the end.\n\nThe post quickly garnered thousands of likes and comments from Hadid's fans, many of whom praised her for sharing the photo of her daughter. \"Your daughter is so gorgeous, thank you for sharing her with us,\" one fan wrote. \"What a beautiful way to start 2021,\" added another.\n\nIt's no surprise that the proud parents kept their daughter away from the spotlight for so long, as they only announced her name shortly after she was born. But the couple has opened up a bit more recently, sharing photos of Khai in July when she turned one.\n\nThe two were also spotted taking Khai out for a family stroll in New York City in November. And while they still prefer to keep her face out of the public eye, they have given us glimpses of her sweet personality in their social media posts.\n\nGigi has been candid about the struggles of being a parent in the past, particularly during the pandemic. In August, she revealed that she had felt \u201cmentally and physically exhausted\u201d during the first weeks of motherhood.\n\n\"This post is for the moms struggling today, and the mamas who have made it through the hardest months with babies, toddlers, and newborns that we never expected to have to raise during a pandemic,\" she wrote at the time.\n\nHowever, judging from her recent posts, it looks like Gigi and Zayn have adjusted to the new normal quite nicely. The family, along with Hadid's mother and brother, were seen spending the holiday season in The Hamptons, where they were seen enjoying the beautiful scenery, playing with their kids and taking strolls along the beach.\n\nClearly, things are going well for the new family of four, and here's hoping for a wonderful 2021 for them!", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Mark Cuban, who built his fortune starting and selling tech companies, only offered two $1 million investments on ABC's \"Shark Tank\" in 2022.\n\nBut they weren't in software, crypto or sports businesses. Instead, the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks gave his biggest investments of the year to two food companies. He offered $1 million to Umaro, a seaweed protein company, for 7% of the company \u2014 and $1 million in CupBop, a Korean Barbeque chain, for 5% equity.\n\nCuban also split another $1 million investment offer with guest Shark Peter Jones: $300,000 with a $700,000 line of credit for 10% of dress shirt company Collars & Co.\n\nSince their appearances, business seems to be going well for both companies. A couple of months after landing the \"Shark Tank\" deal, Umaro CEO Beth Zotter tells CNBC Make It she and her co-founder \"parted ways amicably\" from Cuban, due to a different closed funding round. While they didn't get the $1 million from Cuban, their product, which was only a prototype when the episode was filmed and aired, will be in 60 different restaurants by the end of January.\n\nIt's not unusual for a \"Shark Tank\" investor and company to abandon or revise their partnership. In 2016, Forbes interviewed 237 companies that appeared on the show between seasons one and seven, and found 43% of deals made on the show fall apart and another 30% are changed after taping.\n\nIn May, CupBop told CNBC Make It it was operating 36 locations across six U.S. states and more than 100 locations in Indonesia. The company did not immediately reply to CNBC Make It's recent request for comment.\n\nCuban, who went vegetarian in 2019, has invested millions of dollars over the past few years in other food companies on \"Shark Tank.\" He's been particularly drawn to startups specializing in plant-based food, like Pan's Mushroom Jerky, vegan cold-cuts company Unreal Deli and vegan pork rind company Snacklins, to name a few.\n\nThe lifestyle, and investment strategy, appear to be beneficial to Cuban, too: He told Habits & Hustle podcast host Jennifer Cohen in August that he stopped eating meat to help reduce inflammation after he had both hips replaced. \"It's like night and day,\" he said on the episode.\n\nHis investments have also translated into a gift-giving strategy off the air. In 2019 and 2021, the billionaire told CNBC Make It he planned to give loved ones healthy snacks, like Alyssa's Cookies which he invested in 2012, after its co-founder Doug Saraci sent him a box of cookies with a note asking for $50,000 for 25% of the business, Saraci told CNBC Make It in 2019.\n\n\"People get so much junk food [at the holidays], they need something tasty, low-cal and healthy,\" he told CNBC Make It in 2019.\n\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter\n\nDon't miss:\n\nNetflix lists \u2018Glass Onion\u2019 island compound for $450 million on Zillow\n\nMark Cuban has 4 rules for making money\u2014No. 4 is: \u2018Know your s--t better than anyone else in the room\u2019", "label": "human"}

Tesla stock dropped 3 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement.\n\nTesla\u2019s delivery performance was driven by its new China factory, which delivered 160,000 Model 3s during the quarter. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attributed the success to China\u2019s \u201cworld-leading\u201d EV infrastructure, saying that the company is \u201csetting up for a strong year in 2021.\u201d\n\nModel Y deliveries also saw a substantial jump in the fourth quarter, rising to nearly 73,000 vehicles. This was the first full quarter of Model Y deliveries, with the first units delivered in mid-October.\n\nTesla\u2019s Model S and X deliveries also improved, rising to 27,210 and 4,170 vehicles respectively, after a dismal third quarter that saw deliveries of only 16,992 and 3,219 vehicles.\n\nTesla said that it achieved its delivery target despite \u201csignificant production challenges,\u201d including parts shortages due to the global chip shortage, and \u201crelentless\u201d shipping logistics to deliver vehicles to customers around the world.\n\nTesla has now been profitable for five consecutive quarters. The company reported a fourth quarter 2020 net income of $270 million, and a full-year 2020 net income of $721 million.\n\nDespite missing expectations, Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter performance was the best of any automotive company during the period. All other major automakers reported quarter-over-quarter declines in vehicle sales, and many have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels of production.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock had been on a tear in recent weeks as investors anticipated strong fourth-quarter results. Shares closed at a record high of $883.09 ahead of the news, but fell to $853.53 in after-hours trading.\n\nThe EV maker is now turning its attention to 2021, with a focus on delivering 1 million vehicles globally, as well as continuing to drive profitability. Tesla is also hoping to launch its highly-anticipated Cybertruck in late 2021.\n\nWith the growth of its Model 3 and Model Y sales, and more products in the pipeline, Tesla is positioned for a strong 2021.

{"text": ".\n\nJanuary 3, 2023 will go down as an historic day in United States political history. On this date, the Republican Party of the United States voted to nominate Jim Jordan of Ohio as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe election marked the culmination of months of infighting and turmoil within the Republican Party over who would succeed current Speaker Paul Ryan, who is scheduled to retire at the end of the 113th Congress. While several candidates initially vied for the position, the race eventually became a two-horse race between establishment figure Kevin McCarthy of California and conservative firebrand Jordan.\n\nMcCarthy had the support of the party establishment and the endorsement of President Donald Trump, while Jordan was backed by the conservative wing of the party and had been gaining ground in recent weeks. However, the deciding factor in the race came down to the support of the hardliners in the Republican Party, who felt that McCarthy had become too moderate in his views.\n\nIn the end, Jordan\u2019s overwhelming popularity with the hardliners won out and he was able to secure the nomination in a landslide vote. He is set to become the first Speaker of the House from the conservative wing of the Republican Party since Newt Gingrich\u2019s tenure in the 1990s.\n\nDespite the internal divisions that have emerged in the GOP in recent years, Jordan\u2019s ascension was seen as a sign of unity within the party.\n\nIn his victory speech, Jordan declared, \u201cI want to thank my colleagues for placing their faith in me and supporting me in this nomination. We may not always agree on everything, but we can agree on this: We are all Republicans and we are all united in our desire to ensure that our party is able to advance its conservative agenda in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s election is a sign of the shifting power within the Republican Party, which is increasingly dominated by the hardliners who are determined to move the party further to the right and promote conservative policies.\n\nIn the weeks and months ahead, Jordan will have to prove that he is capable of steering the House towards the conservative agenda without alienating moderates. This will be no easy task, but if successful, it could prove to be a major victory for the Republican Party in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. \n\nThe GOP will now be watching closely to see whether Jordan can bridge the gap between the hardliners and moderates and unify the party ahead of the 2024 election. Only time will tell, but for now, Jim Jordan has been given the chance to make history as the first conservative Speaker of the House in decades.", "label": "machine"}

However, I have a young family now and other commitments that are important to me, such as charity work and other engagements.\"\n\nThe prince's decision is likely to disappoint royalists and constitutional monarchists in England, who have been looking forward to the coronation as an event of national unity and celebration.\n\nMeanwhile, the prince said he will be spending much of his time in the coming months working on his charitable causes, as well as visiting other countries to support charitable initiatives.\n\n\"I am really excited about working with a number of organizations and charities on a number of causes around the world,\" he said. \"I hope to be able to make a real difference to the people I meet and the projects I am involved in.\"\n\nWhen pressed on the issue of the coronation, the prince said he was still thinking about it, but could not yet make a commitment.\n\n\"I am considering my options at the moment,\" he said. \"I know my father would be delighted to have me there, but I cannot make any promises.\"\n\nThe prince's comments come just days before the announcement of the coronation date and the start of the official countdown.

{"text": "that have potential in the long run\n\nCitigroup is bearish on the short-term prospects for lithium in its Global Metals, Mining and Steel research report released this week, with analyst Andrew Schoepp commenting that \u201cwe believe the short-term outlook for lithium is weak\u201d.\n\nLithium, a rare and vital resource for the production of batteries for energy storage, has seen its prices plunge since the second half of 2019, with the recent coronavirus pandemic exacerbating the already sluggish demand for electric cars due to travel restrictions and fewer commuters on the roads.\n\nThe report from Citi said the global demand for electric cars is expected to reduce significantly in 2020 and 2021 due to the current global lockdown and the negative sentiment caused by the current crisis. This is expected to lead to a 10-15% reduction in demand for lithium over the next two years.\n\nHowever, Citi also said that although lithium prices are expected to remain weak in the short term, they are expected to rebound over the longer term, as demand recovers. The report also said that the long-term outlook for lithium is positive, with the focus shifting towards cleaner, sustainable energy sources and the electrification of the global vehicle fleet.\n\nThe report identified three stocks that Citi believes have the potential to benefit from the long-term growth in lithium demand: Albemarle Corporation (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Neometals (NOM). Albemarle Corporation is one of the largest producers of lithium in the world, with operations in Chile, China, Europe and the US. SQM is one of the largest producers of lithium in Chile, and Neometals is a junior producer and developer based in Australia.\n\nCiti said Albemarle is its top pick among the lithium producers, as it has established itself as one of the leading producers in the industry, with a diversified and low-cost production base. It also has a wide-ranging lithium product portfolio and is well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth in demand.\n\nCiti said SQM is also well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth in demand, but noted that the company has been facing some legal and political headwinds in its home market of Chile. The report also said that Neometals is one of the most promising junior producers, with the potential to become a major player in the lithium space.\n\nOverall, Citi is bearish on the short-term prospects for lithium, but believes there are stocks that can benefit from the long-term growth in demand. It recommended Albemarle, SQM and Neometals as stocks with the potential to benefit from the long-term growth in lithium demand.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "prices\n\nIndia\u2019s finance ministry raised a windfall tax on crude, diesel, and aviation fuel prices on Thursday, introducing a special levy aimed at increasing government revenue while curbing the rise of fuel prices.\n\nThe windfall tax, which will be effective from 1 January 2024, comes as a response to the recent hikes in petrol, diesel, and aviation fuel prices in India. This levy is likely to raise additional resources for the government and provide some relief to consumers.\n\nThe Finance Ministry has said that the Windfall Tax will be calculated on the difference between the prevailing price and the base price. The base price is the price at which crude oil, diesel and aviation fuel was sold during a certain time period determined by the government. The difference between the base price and the prevailing price will be taken as the price of the windfall tax.\n\nThe tax will be applicable to sales of all fuel products, including crude oil, diesel, and aviation fuel. It is expected to raise additional resources of around Rs 1,000 crore per annum for the government.\n\nThe windfall tax comes in response to the recent rise in fuel prices in India. Petrol prices have been rising for the last two years, and diesel prices have risen sharply in the last few weeks. The rise has been attributed to rising international crude oil prices.\n\nThe windfall tax is expected to provide some relief to consumers as it will act as a dampener on the rising prices of fuel products. It is also expected to increase government revenues and help reduce the fiscal deficit.\n\nThe Windfall Tax will be applicable to all Indian companies importing crude, diesel, and aviation fuel. The tax rate has been kept high, at up to 30 percent, to ensure that any windfall gains are captured by the government.\n\nThe tax is also likely to encourage Indian companies to invest in renewable energy resources. This is in line with the government\u2019s goal to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and increase its use of renewable energy sources.\n\nThe windfall tax is expected to be reviewed and amended in the upcoming budget to address any issues or changes in the fuel prices. It is expected to provide some relief to the consumers and additional revenue to the government.\n\nOverall, the imposition of the windfall tax will have a positive effect on the Indian economy as it will reduce fuel prices and increase government revenue. It is also expected to encourage Indian companies to invest in renewable energy sources.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Train passengers have been hit with a double blow of disruption as rail workers have held their first 48-hour strike of the year. The strike, by members of the RMT union, has left tens of thousands of travellers stranded, with many services halted and long delays on other routes.\n\nThe strike began at 4am on Tuesday morning and will last until 4am on Thursday morning. It is the first of up to 20 two-day strikes planned by the RMT, who are in dispute with train operators over the introduction of driver-only trains.\n\nThe RMT accused rail operators of attempting to reduce staff on trains and jeopardise passenger safety by axing the role of the guard. A statement from the union said that rail companies were \"hell bent\" on creating a \"polarised workforce\" where staff are treated differently.\n\nThe disruption has been felt across the UK, with commuters experiencing lengthy delays and cancellations on Northern, South Western Railway and Merseyrail services. Northern said that some services have been suspended completely and warned passengers to travel only if necessary.\n\nFor those who have been unable to avoid travelling during the strike period, replacement bus services have been arranged. These services will run during the times of strike action. Passengers travelling with Northern, South Western Railway and Merseyrail should check the operators' websites and social media pages for updates on services.\n\nFor rail users unable to use the replacement bus services, some train companies have offered tickets for travel on the days the strike is taking place. For example, passengers with Northern can buy tickets for travel on the affected days up to 24 hours before the strike begins.\n\nCommuters have expressed their frustration at the disruption caused by the strike. Many travellers vented their anger at the RMT union, accusing them of \"holding the public to ransom\" and causing unnecessary disruption. Others criticised the government for failing to intervene and settle the dispute, with one passenger branding the situation \"shameful\".\n\nThe strike is having a detrimental effect on businesses, with some firms forced to lose revenue or having to pay extra for staff to work from home. It is also causing major disruption to students who rely on the rail network to get to college and university.\n\nTheresa May has called for both sides to \"get round the table\" and resolve the dispute. A statement from the government said: \"We urge the RMT and train operators to put the interests of their customers first, return to talks and resolve the situation\".\n\nIn response, the RMT has said that the government should \"take responsibility for the crisis\". General secretary Mick Cash said that the dispute is \"about putting public safety before private profit\". He also accused the government of \"refusing to step in and sort out this mess\".\n\nIt is clear that the dispute shows no sign of ending soon, with further strikes expected to be announced. Thousands of passengers have been forced to endure long delays and cancellations, with the strike likely to have a lasting impact on the economy and businesses. It is crucial that both the RMT and train companies return to the negotiating table to resolve the dispute and minimise disruption to passengers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's not been a great end to the week for the soft-landing crowd. The S & P 500 lifted off its low for the year in October on a simple premise: The Federal Reserve would finish raising rates early in 2023, there is a reasonable chance of cutting rates late in 2023, the economy would slow down but not too much, and earnings would be roughly flat next year. That is the soft landing. The soft-landing crowd is very much on the defensive because: 1) Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pounded away on the \"higher for longer\" outlook , and 2) the economic data Thursday ( retail sales , industrial production, the European Central Bank raised its inflation outlook) did not support a soft landing. A harder landing in the economy means that stocks are very expensive. Most Wall Street strategists (those who make predictions about the markets based on macroeconomics, not individual company projections) now anticipate that earnings will decline next year (the average of 17 strategists is a decline of 6%). Analysts (who cover individual stocks and sectors) are more optimistic, expecting earnings to rise roughly 4%. But analysts are traditionally more optimistic than strategists, and the Street is beginning to side with the strategists. If earnings decline 6%, the multiple for next year is very high, roughly 19 times forward earnings. The multiple is almost never above 18. \"To argue for a multiple above 18 times goes against the historic data,\" Eric Johnston at Cantor Fitzgerald told me. \"The only time the multiple was above 18 was post-Covid, and in 2000 during the internet bubble,\" he said. \"With a 5% interest rate and the economy getting worse, how do you argue that a multiple should be above 18?\" he said. It's not helping that there is an enormous options and futures expiration Friday. Friday is quadruple witching, the quarterly expiration of stock index futures & options, and single stock futures & options. There's also a rebalancing of the S & P 500 at the close. This doesn't usually cause a lot of mayhem, but there have been an unusually large number of options contracts that were still open Thursday. S & P 500 option open interest (puts+calls) (contracts, target price, followed by contracts) 4,000: 300,000 3,950: 150,000 3,900: 125,000 3,850: 80,000 Source: Interactive Brokers This is a lot of open interest. Steve Sosnick, a veteran options watcher at Interactive Brokers, told me he normally starts paying attention when open interest is above 100,000 contracts on a single strike. The big expiring contracts tend to cluster around round or significant numbers, and Sosnick felt it did add to the volatility Thursday. \"Once it was clear 4,000 [on the S & P 500] was not holding, we sold off quickly and abruptly,\" he said. \"That is why we went right through 4,000, then dropped again at 3,950, and then again at 3,900.\" The index options prices are set by the opening prices on the S & P 500 on Friday, so expect a huge rush of volume at 9:30 a.m. ET when the market opens.", "label": "human"}

The 20-year-old safety for the University of Pittsburgh was playing against Duke when, on the fourth play of the game, Duke\u2019s tight end caught a pass and began to run. As he charged toward the end zone, Hamlin dived and tried to make a tackle. But instead of crashing into the tight end, he felt a sudden and intense pain shoot through his body.\n\n\u201cIt felt like my entire body shut off,\u201d Hamlin later told reporters. \u201cI was kind of confused for a second, and I heard my coach saying, \u2018Get up, get up!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the help of trainers, Hamlin managed to get to the sideline, but soon collapsed into the arms of his coaches. After the game, an MRI revealed the cause of his collapse: a potentially career-ending spinal injury.\n\nHamlin\u2019s injury is a grim reminder of the harsh reality that is football: while the game offers young men a platform to showcase their talents and win college scholarships, it also poses one of the most serious dangers in all of sports. For every Aaron Rodgers, who enjoyed a long and successful career, there are countless young athletes like Hamlin whose dreams of glory were cut short by a single devastating play.\n\nThese types of injuries are far from rare. According to a recent report from the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research (NCCSIR), over the last decade, there have been 860 reported catastrophic football injuries in the United States and Canada, resulting in 138 deaths and 722 permanent disabilities.\n\nThe most common type of injury is a traumatic brain injury, also known as a concussion. Concussions occur when an individual receives a direct or indirect blow to the head that causes the brain to rapidly accelerate and then suddenly stop, resulting in a complex injury that can range from mild to severe.\n\nOther common types of football injuries include spinal cord injuries, herniated disks, broken bones, torn ligaments, and contusions. In some cases, these injuries can cause permanent damage, robbing individuals of the chance to lead a full and active life.\n\nThe causes of these injuries are numerous and varied, ranging from improper technique to inadequate training. Poorly maintained fields and equipment can also be a factor, as can fatigue and dehydration. According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, players who are dehydrated by even two percent can be at an increased risk of suffering a concussion or other injury.\n\nThe dangers posed by football can be minimized, however, by taking certain steps. These include proper training and instruction, using the proper protective gear, and avoiding dangerous contact drills and tackling drills.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for young athletes to understand the seriousness of football injuries and the fact that, once an injury occurs, the repercussions can be life-altering. Players should be educated on the symptoms of concussions and other types of injuries, and encouraged to speak up if they feel that something is wrong.\n\nHamlin, who is currently undergoing rehabilitation, is facing an uncertain future. But regardless of his own outcome, he serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in football, and the urgent need to protect the safety of all who play the game.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Metaverse, the much-hyped virtual reality (VR) headset technology, has gotten off to a troubled start after sales of the device declined significantly in 2022.\n\nAs the latest numbers from tech industry analysts IDC show, the Metaverse headset was just the fourth-most popular VR headset in the market this year, capturing only 9.6% of market share in Q3 2022. This is down from the peak of 13.2% the headset had reached in Q1 2020.\n\nExperts say the decline is due to several factors. One of the main issues is that Metaverse doesn't offer the same level of functionality as its competitors, such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The Metaverse headset is less advanced, and its controllers lack the precision and smoothness that other VR systems offer.\n\nThe lower-than-expected sales of the Metaverse headset come as a disappointment to many investors, who had bet on the technology's success. Since its launch in 2017, the Metaverse headset had consistently maintained its market share, leading some to expect strong sales in the coming years.\n\nOther analysts are pointing to the competition as a major factor in the device's decline. As the VR headset market has become more crowded, with new players like the Microsoft HoloLens and Sony PlayStation VR, the Metaverse headset has struggled to keep up.\n\nIn addition, some experts are suggesting that the Metaverse technology has become dated, unable to compete with more modern systems such as the Oculus Rift S and Samsung Gear VR. Many of the newer headsets offer more advanced features such as increased resolution, higher refresh rates, and improved tracking.\n\nFinally, some experts are saying that the cost of the Metaverse headset is too high. At $499, the device is much more expensive than the competition, and many consumers may be unwilling to make the investment.\n\nWith its sales declining, the future of the Metaverse is uncertain. Some investors are holding out hope that the technology could still find a foothold in the market, while others are starting to become pessimistic.\n\nOnly time will tell if the Metaverse technology can recover from its current slump. In the meantime, the company will need to focus on improving its device and adapting to the ever-changing VR headset market.\n\nGiven the high cost of the device and competition in the market, it may be a long road ahead for Metaverse. However, if the company can make the right moves, it could still be one of the biggest players in the virtual reality market in the years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".\n\nIndianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay is facing a dilemma. He has been widely criticized for his decision to bring back former offensive line coach Jeff Saturday as the head coach of his beloved Colts.\n\nThe move has not been met with universal approval and many of the Colts faithful have taken to social media to voice their displeasure with the decision. Saturday was on the team's coaching staff from 1998 to 2005 and had a successful run as the Colts' offensive line coach.\n\nThe move has been met with mixed reactions, but one thing is certain: there's no way Jim Irsay can justify bringing back Jeff Saturday as Colts head coach.\n\nThe criticism is rooted in Saturday's lack of experience as a head coach and his lack of overall NFL coaching experience. Saturday has been away from the game since 2005 and has not been actively involved in the NFL in any capacity.\n\nIn addition, his career as an offensive line coach was largely unspectacular. The Colts' offensive line was never among the league's best and he was never considered a top-tier coach.\n\nThe criticism is further heightened by the fact that the Colts are a team in transition and this hire does not seem to be the best choice for a team that is looking to get back to the playoffs.\n\nThe Colts are in the midst of an overhaul and are looking to rebuild their roster and move forward under a new regime. Saturday's lack of NFL experience and lack of any recent involvement in the game do not fit with this new direction the Colts are taking.\n\nIn addition, there are a number of high profile coaching candidates that have been linked to the Colts vacancy that have far more experience and credentials than Jeff Saturday.\n\nThe most notable is Jim Harbaugh, who recently left the San Francisco 49ers after seven successful seasons. Harbaugh is considered by many to be one of the best coaches in the game and would have been a much more attractive option for Irsay and the Colts.\n\nThe bottom line is that there's no way Jim Irsay can justify bringing back Jeff Saturday as Colts head coach. He has not been actively involved in the game for nearly a decade and does not possess the credentials or experience to lead a team in transition. The Colts are in a crucial stage of rebuilding and it would be unwise to entrust their future to a coach that has been out of the game for so long.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It\u2019s finally November and the time for Resort 2023 collections to hit the runway is upon us. This year, the world of fashion has embraced a bold new trend\u2014Food-Inspired Fashion\u2014and it\u2019s taking the industry by storm.\n\nRather than the same old cookie-cutter looks we\u2019ve come to expect from the industry, fashion insiders have decided to incorporate bold and flavorful foods into their designs. From extravagant ice cream scoops to detailed pastries, it appears that this trend is here to stay.\n\nDesigners such as Giorgio Armani and Dolce & Gabbana have embraced the trend, creating outfits that look like they came straight out of a bakery. In particular, Armani has presented looks that were inspired by his favorite Italian pastry, the Sfogliatella.\n\nHis collection includes a beige blazer with intricate, cream-filled piping, as well as a vibrant, fuchsia skirt inspired by the flavor of his favorite summer dessert\u2014Passion Fruit. Meanwhile, Dolce & Gabbana created a stunning dress that is modeled after a Neapolitan pizza, with red, yellow, and white materials arranged in a classic checkerboard pattern.\n\nIn addition to these celebrated designers, there have been some smaller, yet influential, fashion houses that have taken part in the trend as well. For example, Chiaki Morita, a Tokyo-based designer, has presented a collection made entirely out of food-inspired fabrics. Her designs have been inspired by her favorite Japanese dishes, such as sushi and tempura.\n\nThe garments she\u2019s created include a pair of light wash jeans with embroidered soy sauce motifs, and a hoodie with vibrant red and yellow ginkgo leaves and peppers printed on the front. She\u2019s also created a unique dress that features seaweed in the shape of a flower blooming down the center of the bodice.\n\nThis trend has also been embraced by some of the world\u2019s most iconic brands. Gucci, for instance, has taken the \u201cFood-Inspired\u201d trend and gone above and beyond in its presentation. The fashion house has presented a line of ensembles that represent various international dishes.\n\nFor instance, there is a vibrant red hoodie adorned with a detailed sushi roll, as well as a trench coat that pays homage to a classic French onion soup. Other creations have included a boldly printed statement blouse inspired by Mexican tacos, as well as a pastel skirt modeled after a light and airy tiramisu.\n\nThese food-inspired looks are a refreshing take on what we\u2019ve come to expect from the fashion world. Not only are these designs appealing to the eye, but they also represent a celebration of the global cuisines that have been embraced all over the world. With so many inspiring fashion trends emerging for the upcoming Resort 2023 collections, it\u2019s safe to say that the future of fashion looks more delicious than ever.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When it comes to finances, you\u2019d think that the number one goal of most people would be to reach a level of wealth that allows them to retire comfortably. But when it comes down to it, many of us don\u2019t have a specific goal in mind. We just want enough money to feel \u201cwealthy.\u201d\n\nSo what does it take to make you feel \u201cwealthy\u201d? According to a new survey from Charles Schwab, the magic number is a net worth of $2.4 million.\n\nThe survey, which polled 1,000 Americans aged 21 and over in August, found that this $2.4 million mark is what makes people feel \u201cfinancially secure.\u201d It also found that 45% of respondents believed they had achieved this level of wealth, while another 26% felt they were \u201cclose\u201d to achieving it.\n\nSo, how did the survey participants arrive at this number? The most common approach was to base their estimates on the assets they currently owned, such as a house, car, investments, or other assets. Those who felt they were close to achieving a $2.4 million net worth often indicated that they felt they were on the right track but still had a ways to go.\n\nIt's important to note that the responses were somewhat different when participants were asked to imagine what their lives would be like if they had a net worth of $2.4 million. In that case, 39% said they would still feel \u201cfinancially secure\u201d while 27% said they would feel \u201cultra-secure.\u201d An additional 15% said they would feel \u201cset for life\u201d and 17% said they would feel \u201cextremely wealthy.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to actually reaching that $2.4 million net worth, it\u2019s not always so simple. Schwab\u2019s survey revealed that only 10% of participants have a long-term plan that was specifically designed to help them reach their financial goals. A mere 20% have even set any kind of long-term financial plan in place.\n\nIt's not surprising that a lot of people don\u2019t have a plan for reaching their financial goals. After all, building wealth can be an intimidating process and many people simply don\u2019t have the resources or knowledge to put together an effective plan.\n\nStill, achieving a $2.4 million net worth shouldn\u2019t be your only financial goal. Investing in yourself is just as important, if not more so, than aiming to accumulate a certain amount of money. That\u2019s because money can quickly come and go, but knowledge and skills, such as those gained through advanced education or specialized training, last a lifetime.\n\nMoreover, there are plenty of other things you should consider in order to build a secure financial future. That includes putting some money away in an emergency fund, paying off credit card debt, and building some kind of retirement nest egg.\n\nThe bottom line is that it\u2019s important to have a financial goal and to make an effort to reach it. But it\u2019s also important to remember that there are other aspects of financial security that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. You don\u2019t have to have a net worth of $2.4 million to feel wealthy. All it takes is a solid financial foundation and a long-term plan that puts you in a better place financially tomorrow than you are today.", "label": "machine"}

Workers were protesting unfair labor practices and a lack of representation. The union, which represents 160 employees, accused the organization of retaliating against workers who spoke out against it and failing to offer fair wages and benefits. They also said Howard Brown had ignored grievances and had blocked their ability to form a union. The strikers were joined by supporters, including members of the city council and the president of the Chicago Teachers Union. After five days of negotiations, an agreement was reached, and the workers returned to their jobs.\n\nCook County Holds First Same-Sex Wedding of 2023\n\nOn January 2, Cook County held its first same-sex wedding of the new year. The couple, Dwayne Johnstone and Julianna Moiz, were married in the Cook County building in front of friends and family. Judge Michael Kiser officiated the ceremony and their dog, Jax, was the ring bearer. In Illinois, it is illegal to discriminate against same-sex couples. The wedding was the first step in creating equality for all couples in the state. \n\nKobe Bryant Memorial Service Held at United Center\n\nOn January 3, a memorial service was held at the United Center in Chicago in honor of basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna. The service featured speeches from family, friends and past teammates, including Shaquille O\u2019Neal. The event, which was attended by thousands of people, was broadcast around the world. Fans were able to pay tribute to Kobe and his daughter by watching the service or participating in a virtual memorial.\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Presents Midwinter Ball\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago held its annual Midwinter Ball on January 4. The event was a benefit for the museum and featured performances from big names like Chance the Rapper, Lizzo and Smino. Guests were able to mix and mingle while enjoying food, cocktails, live music and art. Attendees also got to explore the museum\u2019s current exhibits, including the recent exhibition of renowned artist Kara Walker. \n\nChicago Program Introduces Students to Coding\n\nOn January 5, Chicago Public Schools introduced a new program called \u201cCoding for Kids.\u201d The program, which will be offered at a handful of elementary schools, will teach students the basics of coding. The program\u2019s goal is to get more children interested in technology and prepare them for future careers. The initiative will also provide the students with a laptop and free access to coding lessons and resources. \n\nThese were some of the headlines that made news in Chicago in January 2021.

Pyongyang regularly revamps its leadership and the year-end party gathering has often been used to announce personnel reshuffles and major policy decisions.\n\nState television showed Pak sitting in the front row of the podium with his head down during the meeting while other members raised their hands to vote on personnel issues. His seat was later shown unoccupied.\n\nHe was also absent in photos released on Monday by the official KCNA news agency of Kim's New Year's Day visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun which houses the bodies of his grandfather and father, unlike in October when Pak accompanied Kim on a trip to the palace to mark a party anniversary.\n\nThe party's Central Military Commission, which is headed by Kim, is considered the country' most powerful military decision-making body, above the defence ministry.\n\nPak's replacement came as Kim called for developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles and a larger nuclear arsenal to counter the United States and South Korea as key to the isolated country's 2023 defence strategy.\n\nPak had rapidly moved up the military ladder from a one-star artillery commander in 2015 to a four-star general in 2020, taking credit for contributing to progress in the country's short-range missile technology.\n\nIn late 2020, Pak was promoted to the politburo and earned the title of marshal, the highest military rank under Kim, and became a leading voice last November against joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises.\n\nLike most other top military aides who went through ups and downs repeatedly under Kim, Pak was briefly demoted in mid-2021 after Kim chided some officials for their handling of North Korea's anti-coronavirus policy, before being promoted again months later.\n\nPak's dismissal comes despite Kim mostly lauding the military's advances in weapons development during the meeting, unlike other areas where he pointed out some faults and called for improvement.\n\nOh Gyeong-sup, a fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said a recent flare-up in inter-Korea tension over North Korean drones' intrusion into the South could have played a role.\n\nOfficials in Seoul said South Korea sent three drones across the border in response to the intrusion, but there was no response from the North, which Oh said could mean that it failed to detect the aircraft.\n\n\"Pak might have taken responsibility for the failure of security operations,\" Oh said.\n\nRi, Pak's successor, is also a senior military commander who held key positions including chief of the army's general staff and defence minister.\n\nReporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

The convictions had been upheld by a lower court in January.\n\nOliver had appealed to the US Supreme Court in late March, claiming his trial was unfair and the evidence had not been presented correctly. His attorneys argued that he had been denied due process.\n\nJustice Sotomayor, who reviewed the case and had agreed to hear arguments in the Supreme Court on Thursday, ultimately denied his request for bail and wrote in her ruling, \"The nature of the allegations and the evidence presented at trial, including multiple eyewitness accounts, present a compelling case that the defendant is a danger to the public and the court declines to grant bail.\u201d\n\nOliver, 65, was a well-known philanthropist and had been a respected figure in the pharmaceutical industry for many years.

{"text": "Daniel Erichsen, founder of the Sleep Coach School Daniel Erichsen\n\nDaniel Erichsen spent about a decade as a sleep doctor, primarily seeing patients who were struggling with sleep apnea and insomnia. His career took a dramatic turn early last year, when he was fired from his hospital job in Oregon. Erichsen, 42, had stopped prescribing sleeping pills to patients and for the most part refused to refer them for expensive and time-consuming tests that he deemed pointless. Erichsen didn't suddenly turn anti-medicine. Growing up in Sweden, the son of a doctor and a nurse, he knew what he wanted to do from a very early age. He studied at the Karolinska Institute, a medical school in Stockholm, moved to New York for his residency in 2007 and then did a fellowship in sleep medicine at the University of Chicago. But after years spent listening to patients describe their struggles with sleeplessness and their desperate efforts to find the supplement, essential oil, herbal tea, yoga practice or prescription pill that would fix their issue, Erichsen concluded that the patients weren't the problem. Rather, the problem was the ways they were being treated. \"This wasn't working for people,\" Erichsen said in an interview from his home in Eugene, Oregon. \"I was not a fit anymore. The system was not a fit for me.\" Insomnia is a big business. According to market research firm Imarc, the global insomnia market will hit $5.1 billion this year and climb to $6.1 billion by 2028. That includes spending on prescription drugs, over-the-counter sleep aids, medical devices and various types of therapy. Imarc said in its report that the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit the U.S. in early 2020, \"generated unprecedented changes in lives, including social isolation and innumerable work challenges and family obligations\" and acted \"as a major stressful event that impacted the sleep patterns of millions and strengthened the market growth.\" Even before the pandemic, the tech industry had found plenty of ways to capitalize on sleep and humans' desire to optimize it. Sleep trackers are everywhere, embedded in the Apple Watch and Fitbit devices. There's the smart ring from Oura, which said in April that it raised a funding round at a $2.55 billion valuation, less than a month after selling its 1 millionth ring.\n\nwatch now\n\nNumerous meditation apps like Calm, Headspace and Breethe contain content designed to help people sleep. Other apps, including some backed by venture capital firms, promote cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I. That therapy is meant to change the way people think about sleep and incorporates behavior changes like sleep restriction and stimulus control. Participants are urged to get out of bed after being awake for a certain amount of time. CBT-I apps include Sleep Reset, developed by Simple Habit, and Dawn Health, which announced this month that it raised \"strategic funding\" from early stage firm Kindred Ventures. Dawn said in its press release that insomnia affects 49 million Americans and results in $84 billion in health-care costs and $100 billion in \"safety incidents and lost productivity.\" CBT-I programs usually last two to three months. Dawn charges $249 for the first three months, while Sleep Reset currently costs $225 for the same amount of time.\n\nWhat if insomnia is a phobia?\n\nErichsen said he had tried CBT-I with patients during his years as a physician, and it would sometimes work. Other times a patient would start the program and he'd never hear from the person again. For some people, strict sleep restriction imposed an important element of structure in their lives. For others, it created added anxiety and worry \u2014 another failed effort to find a cure. After listening to hundreds of stories from people with sleep struggles, Erichsen came to believe that the medical industry was misclassifying insomnia as a sleep disorder, grouping it with depression, anxiety and psychotic disorders. Erichsen had come to see it differently. People who showed up in his clinic were scared. They'd experienced a few bad nights of sleep from a sickness or stressful event. When normal sleep didn't return, they fell into full-blown panic mode. They thought something was deeply wrong and that they'd forgotten how to sleep. The dark abyss of the internet contained limitless stories about the long-term health problems awaiting them if normal sleep didn't return. Fear was the common denominator. So instead of calling insomnia a disorder, Erichsen prefers to describe it as a phobia, thus reframing how it should be addressed. \"Think of the implications,\" Erichsen said. \"When we say, 'Oh you have to take medications to sleep or exercise or do all these things,' you're actually worsening the phobia.\" After being removed from his medical practice, last year Erichsen became a full-time sleep coach and evangelist for changing the way people think about sleep. He loads up his YouTube channel, The Sleep Coach School, with educational content several days a week and releases the same discussions in podcast form. He also has an app called BedTyme, which combines educational lessons with personalized coaching. Apart from the free content he puts out to the public, none of this comes cheap. A group-oriented program called \"Insomnia Immunity\" costs $259 a month. A 45-minute call with Erichsen runs for $289 (or $169 for a call with another coach) and BedTyme costs $330 a month.\n\nwatch now\n\nErichsen hasn't raised any outside funding, and said the business is hard to run profitably because it doesn't scale like a tech company. There's a lot of one-on-one coaching for each client. \"It's very involved work,\" Erichsen said. The objective, Erichsen said, is to help people find their way without needing month after month of costly assistance. Within two to four months, most clients are ready to go it alone, he said. \"We celebrate when somebody graduates, and says 'I don't need you anymore, I can be my own coach,'\" Erichsen said. \"From a business perspective, that's not a problem. They become an ambassador and we find somebody else to work with.\" Erichsen acknowledges that his approach is quite nascent. His YouTube channel has a modest following of 7,000, up from 4,000 at the start of the year, and his coaching practice is small enough that he doesn't think the sleep medicine world is aware he exists. \"My friends who are doctors think it's nice, but they don't fully understand it,\" Erichsen said. \"We're so far off the radar, that nobody in the medical establishment knows what we're doing.\" CNBC reached out to another sleep expert to get an industry perspective on Erichsen's approach. Michael Breus is a clinical psychologist and fellow of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. He runs The Sleep Doctor website, which was launched in 2008 and describes itself as \"a leading authority in the field of sleep health.\" Breus took a look at Erichsen's website and offered his thoughts via email. \"This sounds like a disaster,\" he wrote, adding that Erichsen's methods \"will give many people false hope.\" Breus said he gives \"little to no merit\" to the idea that insomnia can be best understood as a phobia. After reviewing the site, Breus said Erichsen offers no data on the effectiveness of his approach, yet he \"seems to feel just fine about now marketing himself with a new method, and new theory.\" Erichsen responded by saying that while he doesn't provide data, his YouTube channel has an \"abundance of interviews with people who have found benefits with the way we approach insomnia.\" He said he avoids most of the industry metrics, because they \"lead to the idea that sleep can be controlled and that we should achieve a certain sleep score or number after putting in a certain amount of work.\"\n\n'The more I chased sleep, the less I slept'\n\nSome controversy has emerged in public. In May, Saniya Warwaruk, who's studying to be a dietician at the University of Alberta in Canada, gave a TEDx talk at her college. The topic of the event was \"Finding light in the darkness.\"\n\nSaniya Warwaruk and her husband, Edward Warwaruk Saniya Warwaruk\n\nWarwaruk, 33, was coming off a year of debilitating insomnia, which she chronicled recently in a first-person story for the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.) website. In May 2021, Warwaruk had a few bad nights, waking up at 3 a.m., and was unable to get back to sleep. As the struggle persisted, she started using supplements. \"Then came the appointments \u2014 the blood work checking for tumours and hormones, the electrocardiogram, the sleep study,\" she wrote. \"Aggravatingly, the results showed I was perfectly healthy. Yet the more I chased after sleep, the less I slept.\" As she described it in her TEDx talk, when she would try a new thing and it would fail, \"you crank up the anxiety and the fear, which leads to more insomnia and so on and so on and so on.\" She also tried CBT-I, which resulted in \"the darkest days of my life,\" she told CNBC in an interview. After several months of near sleeplessness, constant anxiety and brain fog, Warwaruk, who's married, briefly went to live with her parents in Calgary because she needed extra care. Soon after her return home, her husband stumbled upon Erichsen's ideas online. Watching Erichsen's videos, Warwaruk said she quickly understood this was different. Whereas CBT-I forced her to practice sleep restriction, get out of bed if she was awake for 15 minutes in the middle of the night and avoid daytime naps, Erichsen was advocating gentler methods, designed to reduce the intensity level along the path to recovery. She established a sleep window for herself, providing a finite period for sleep each night but without having to limit it to six or fewer hours at the start. Warwaruk quickly started to learn that if she could train her brain that there was nothing to fear, the cycle could reverse. Instead of constantly seeking solutions, she woke up every day and lived as if she didn't have insomnia. She exercised, hung out with friends and concentrated on her studies even if her sleep wasn't great. She stopped trying to make sleep happen. \"No pills, no treatments, no therapies, no teas, no sleep hygiene, nothing,\" she said at the TEDx event. \"I was no longer to chase after sleep.\" She would even watch TV shows during her middle-of-the-night wakefulness, \"breaking the cardinal rule of no blue screens.\" Her preference was \"Seinfeld.\" That's when she started to sleep. It wasn't all at once, and there were speed bumps throughout her progress, but her sleep challenges were no longer paired with obsessive anxiety about not sleeping. She told her story over the course of 15 minutes to the small crowd in Alberta. But unless you have the YouTube link for Warwaruk's talk, you can't find it. TED marked it as \"unlisted,\" so it doesn't show up in search results. Here's TED's explanation, which shows up below the video: NOTE FROM TED: Please consult a health professional and do not look to this talk for mental health advice. This talk reflects the speaker's personal experiences and understanding of anxiety and insomnia. Therapies discussed in this talk require further scientific investigation. We've flagged this talk because it falls outside the content guidelines TED gives TEDx organizers. TED didn't respond to a request for comment. Erichsen said TED's action is \"the first sign of friction\" he's seen in public involving his approach. While he'd prefer to have the material readily available for anyone to see, Erichsen said he understands why there would be resistance. The medical establishment has defined insomnia in particular ways, he said, and organizations like TED don't want to risk promoting viewpoints that could be seen as anti-science. One of his regular podcast segments is called \"Talking Insomnia,\" featuring people who made it through the struggle, whether using his program or another one. Earlier this year, he published a book titled, \"Tales of Courage: Twenty-six first hand accounts of how insomnia ends.\"\n\nBeth Kendall teaching her online course Beth Kendall\n\nWarwaruk is one of the case studies in the book. Another is Beth Kendall, a 54-year-old Minneapolis native, who says she struggled with insomnia for 42 years, starting when she was 8 and her parents moved her bedroom upstairs to the attic. Kendall's insomnia was sporadic for decades. Through college and then her working life as a ballet dancer and flight attendant, sleep would come and go for extended spells, leaving Kendall exhausted, confused and desperate for answers. She describes the \"medication merry-go-round\" and how she ended up with a drawer full of every sleeping pill imaginable. Before that, there were all the teas, so many that \"I could smell them right now,\" she told Erichsen. Kendall also tried CBT-I. In a blog post about why sleep restriction doesn't work for everybody, she said the feelings of guilt and failure that followed her initial efforts made sleep even more elusive and turned her into a \"walking zombie.\" \"It was a bit of torture,\" she said in an interview. Before stumbling upon Erichsen a few years ago on social media, Kendall's condition had started to improve. She was working in the mind and body space and was certified in tapping, a practice that draws on acupuncture. She started to see insomnia as a mental program, and that the coding just had to be changed. Kendall began blogging about sleep. People would contact her because her ideas were resonating. That turned into casual coaching, and then real coaching, including work for some of the newer apps. (Kendall was my coach on an app earlier this year.) In October, Kendall launched her own eight-week program \u2014 Mind. Body. Sleep. Every week, clients receive several short videos with lessons demystifying why insomnia happens, how our responses can perpetuate it or minimize it, and how people can learn to be OK with wakefulness, even in the middle of the night. She also includes individual coaching sessions and sends out regular emails, reminding clients that feelings of anxiousness are normal, progress is not linear and that thing that suddenly makes you jumpy at bedtime is called hyperarousal. \"The beginning of the journey is very educational, laying down the accurate knowledge,\" Kendall said. \"At the end of the program, I also talk about what leaving insomnia looks like and some of the patterns.\" Kendall's message, which mirrors much of Erichsen's teachings, is that sleep is simple, but insomnia makes it seem complex. We try to fix it by doing more and then follow failure by doing even more. But what we should do is less. Attention is the oxygen that insomnia needs to survive. Starve it, she says, and see what begins to change. \"Sleep is a passive process that happens in the absence of effort,\" she writes in one of her emails to clients. \"There is nothing you need to do for it to happen.\" WATCH: Does melatonin really help you sleep?", "label": "human"}
