{"text": "We don't seem to have (m)any expats or Australians on the site yet, but I'll share what I have learned.  I'm taking advantage of your profile information listing you as a software developer.   A friend of mine is currently doing a study of national IT professional societies for his MBA project. One of his goals is to understand which funding models are effective in the absence of mandatory licensing.  (Consider: Most developers don't need to be a member of an organization in order to practice.) Such organizations you or others may be familiar with are the British Computer Society (BCS), the Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS), or in the U.S. the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS). To the point: My friend told me recently that the Australian Computer Society (ACS) makes money by assisting the Australian government in determining immigration eligibility.  So I went to the ACS site and started digging:  \"The Australian Computer Society (ACS)   is the designated professional   assessing authority for persons   seeking to apply for Skilled Migration   as IT (Computing) Professionals [...]\" See ACS's Pre-application Skills Assessment (PASA) page.  That page also links out to the Australian Government's Department of Immigration and Citizenship, in particular to a document titled General Skilled Migration (PDF).  Here are some interesting points I discovered, relating just to fees: The government recommends if you do want professional help to use a registered migration agent.  There will be fees for such an agent.  See MARA - What does it cost to use an Agent?  Currently: AUD1500 - AUD4000, or ~ \u00a3850 - ~ \u00a32270. There will be a fee for the immigration application process itself. See Professionals and other Skilled Migrants visa charges - outside Australia.  Currently: total of AUD 6035, or ~ \u00a33420. Also: \"You also need to have your skills   assessed by the relevant assessing   authority as suitable for working in   your nominated occupation.\"  (page 7) ... and you need to do that before you even apply.  The ACS Costs and Charges page shows a cost of AUD 400, or ~ \u00a3225, for the PASA (General) application. So, I think the answer is yes, you'd certainly want to have ample savings to cover the red tape stuff; perhaps ~ \u00a36000 judging from the above alone.  Add your travel, moving, and living expenses, etc. Best of luck!  Australia sounds exciting.  (Have you considered Canada? ;-)", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Guns , Germs and Steel , by Jared Diamond , gives a pretty solid account . There are a lot of reasons , and a lot of bad assumptions made in the question . First , lets discuss the state of technology globally in the era of Columbus- I think that meeting time is the most relevant to the question . The central american tribes had huge urban cities with a complicated social structure and specialized trades , along with aquaculture and waterworks . Some North American tribes had complex democratic empires- which I would argue is a technological advancement over lineage - based monarchies in Europe of the time . They had an incredible knowledge of astronomy and goldsmithing . In china , there was artillery and gunpowder , but it was still feudal . In europe , there was a very complex system of government and international trade , but people were still putting their sewage in the street . The main technological differences between old and world and new are sea - going vessels , gunpowder , steel / iron / advanced metallurgy , and horses , which is n't really that much . I think the worlds were more similar than OP might suspect . Ocean - going vessels are necessary for Europeans , but not for Native americans , because trade was much more prevalent in Europe , as it had developed specialized farming , and then more general specialization- meaning that surplus food and good had to be shipped . Of course , it helps that there is a more diverse and larger landmass connected to europe ( this will be a recurring theme- the ships of egypt in 2500 BC became the ships of Greece , then Rome , then Spain . Europe got gunpowder from China ) . Horses are important . There were no animals of the genus equus on the american supercontinent from between the last ice age and the landing of Columbus in 1493- several escaped and went wild , and those are the ancestors of the wild and domesticated horses we have today . The horse- and all the other large , domesticatable mammals on the afro - eurasian supercontinent- allowed a wider range of trade , and greater international collarboration . Native Americans had to travel by foot , which limited their range . I do n't know anything about advanced metal - working , but I 'm going to assume the same points as gunpowder and ships applies . Tl;dr : A larger and more varied landmass , more easily traveled by horse than by foot , allowed for faster communication and trade , which means that more technology was assimilated by more cultures in the time frame .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?  All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.\nLogical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.\nLogicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n, either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n or by formal intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n.  The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "To answer your question briefly: net income is affected by many things inside and outside of management control, and must be supplemented by other elements to gain a clear picture of a company's health. To answer your question in-depth, we must look at the history of financial reporting: Initially, accounting was primarily cash-based. That is, a business records a sale when a customer pays them cash, and records expenses when cash goes out the door. This was not a perfectly accurate system, as cashflow might be quite erratic even if sales are stable (collection times may differ, etc.). To combat problems with cash-based accounting, financial reporting moved to an accrual-based system. An accrual is the recording of an item before it has fully completed in a cash transaction. For example, when you ship goods to a customer and they owe you money, you record the revenue - then you record the future collection of cash as a balance sheet item, rather than an income statement item. Another example: if your landlord charges you rent on December 31st for the past year, then in each month leading up to December, you accrue the expense on the income statement, even though you haven't paid the landlord yet. Accrual-based accounting leaves room for accounting manipulation. Enron is a prime example; among other things, they were accruing revenue for sales that had not occurred. This 'accelerated' their income, by having it recorded years before cash was ever collectible. There are specific guidelines that restrict doing things like this, but management will still attempt to accelerate net income as much as possible under accounting guidelines. Public companies have their financial statements audited by unrelated accounting firms - theoretically, they exist to catch material misstatements in the financial statements. Finally, some items impacting profit do not show up in net income - they show up in \"Other Comprehensive Income\" (OCI). OCI is meant to show items that occurred in the year, but were outside of management control. For example, changes in the value of foreign subsidiaries, due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Or changes in the value of company pension plan, which are impacted by the stock market. However, while OCI is meant to pick up all non-management-caused items, it is a grey area and may not be 100% representative of this idea. So in theory, net income is meant to represent items within management control. However, given the grey area in accounting interpretation, net income may be 'accelerated', and it also may include some items that occurred by some 'random business fluke' outside of company control. Finally, consider that financial statements are prepared months after the last year-end. So a company may show great profit for 2015 when statements come out in March, but perhaps Jan-March results are terrible. In conclusion, net income is an attempt at giving what you want: an accurate representation of the health of a company in terms of what is under management control. However it may be inaccurate due to various factors, from malfeasance to incompetence.  That's why other financial measures exist - as another way to answer the same question about a company's health, to see if those answers agree. ex: Say net income is $10M this year, but was only $6M last year - great, it went up by $4M! But now assume that Accounts Receivable shows $7M owed to the company at Dec 31, when last year there was only $1M owed to the company. That might imply that there are problems collecting on that additional revenue (perhaps revenue was recorded prematurely, or perhaps they sold to customers who went bankrupt).  Unfortunately there is no single number that you can use to see the whole company - different metrics must be used in conjunction to get a clear picture.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.\nSome speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \"speaker-independent\" systems. Systems that use training are called \"speaker dependent\".\nSpeech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. \"call home\"), call routing (e.g. \"I would like to make a collect call\"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).\nThe term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.\nFrom the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.", "label": "hc3human"}

At first I thought it was Wal - mart , but having later made friends with much better paid retail employees they did the same thing on breaks . No one ever asked us to work off the clock ( when I 'd first started my only experience was farm work which does n't take breaks , ever ) and I got in trouble for not taking my 15 minute breaks as scheduled , it would have been a firing offense in our store for a manager to ask you to work off the clock . Even then we were n't ever scheduled to work close to 40 hours , most weeks I was scheduled for 35 - 38 hours , not getting done within 39 hours would have been an issue . This was fine with me ( I was a student at the time ) , but may not have been ideal for non - student employees . Costco pays far more , but they can afford to be picky ( hiring only the best employees after training by other retailers ) and do n't have turnover . There would n't be room for everyone to follow Costco 's strategy . TL ; DR : Wal - mart is like most entry level jobs , but as America 's largest retailer they have more stores and more chance for a shitty manager to become a headline , they 're excellent at distribution but tend to be relatively bad at high touch service ( partly because they 've found that their customers wo n't pay for it -- which becomes a self fulfilling prophecy ) . Edit : Clarified employee turnover and fixed a capitalization . Also , I 'm happy to answer questions and rarely shop in the local Wal - marts near me because they 're pretty terrible ( I told someone about a spill knowing it was f'ing drop everything to fix this only to have the employee either not understand me or totally ignore me ) , stores were filthy and checkers are very slow . Outside of this area , I 'm pretty agnostic about where I shop . Big shops , local stores each have advantages and I aim for places that offer a good value ( which does n't mean lowest prices ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I asked how often grocery purchases are made in a comment, but I'm going to assume weekly for simplicity. If a roommate is present during the week following a grocery purchase, then they owe a share according to their preferences as you outlined them above. You will have to track the grocery cost by category for that week and calculate the balance owed by the person for that week. If there is a partial week where most expect to leave for a holiday or otherwise, then fewer groceries should be purchased for that week, and the cost of shares will decrease accordingly. One need only indicate preferences once, and weekly attendance thereafter. The only issue remaining is to determine how to record shares. If a normal person consumes 3 shares of milk, and .5 shares of butter, and so on, you simply add up all of the milk shares for the week and divide the milk bill by those shares. Same with the butter. The downside of this method is that you have to predict consumption in advance, so you may instead calculate by consumption after the fact with a deposit paid by all to create the initial grocery supply which will be refunded when that person leaves the grocery purchase co-op, and shares are calculated by who participated in the week prior to the grocery purchase. This also allows for a mid-week refresh if any commodity incurs higher than expected consumption, with the mid-week bill being added to the end of week refresh trip.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.\nSome speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \"speaker-independent\" systems. Systems that use training are called \"speaker dependent\".\nSpeech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. \"call home\"), call routing (e.g. \"I would like to make a collect call\"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).\nThe term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.\nFrom the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Wire transfers normally run through either the Fedwire system or the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). The process generally works like this: You approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money. You give the bank a certain code, either an international bank account number or one of several other standards, which informs the bank where to send the money.  The bank sends a message through a system like Fedwire to the receiving bank, along with settlement instructions.  This is where the process can get a bit tricky. For the wire transfer to work, the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other, or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver. If the sending bank sends the money to a third-party bank, the transaction is settled between them, and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third-party bank. This last transaction may be a wire transfer, ACH transfer, etc.  The Federal Reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the Federal Reserve. This allows them to use the Fed as the third-party bank referred to above. Interestingly enough, this is one of the significant ways in which the Fed makes a profit, because it, along with every other bank and routing agent in the process, collects a miniscule fee on this process.  You'll often find sources that state that Fedwire is only for transferring large transactions; while this is technically correct, it's important to understand that financial institutions don't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately. Although the orders are put in immediately, the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day, and even then they normally only settle the difference. So, if Chase owes Bank of America $1M, and Bank of America owes Chase $750K, they don't send these as two transactions; Chase simply credits BAC $250K.  You didn't specifically ask about ACH transfers, which as littleadv pointed out, are different from wire transfers, but since ACH transfers can often form a part of the whole process, I'll explain that process too. ACH is a payment processing system that works through the Federal Reserve system, among others. The Federal Reserve (through the Fedline and FedACH systems) is by far the largest payment processor.  The physical cash itself isn't transferred; in simple terms, the money is transferred through the ACH system between the accounts each bank maintains at the Federal Reserve.  Here is a simple example of how the process works (I'm summarizing the example from Wikipedia). Let's say that Bob has an account with Chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer, Stack Exchange, directly deposited into this account. Assume that Stack Exchange uses Bank of America as their bank.  Bob, the receiver, fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer, called the originator. Once the originator has the authorization, they create an entry with an Originating Depository Financial Institution, which acts as a middleman between a payment processor (like the Federal Reserve) and the originator. The ODFI ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations. In this example, Bank of America is the ODFI.  Bank of America (the ODFI) converts the transaction request into an ACH entry and submits it, through an ACH operator, to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI), which in this case is Chase bank. Chase credits (deposits) the paycheck in Bob's account.  The Federal Reserve fits into all of this in several ways. Through systems like Fedline and FedACH, the Fed acts as an ACH operator, and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the Federal Reserve, so it's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The balance sheet for a bank is the list of assets and liabilities that the bank directly is responsible for.  This would be things like loans the bank issues and accounts with the bank. Banks can make both \"balance sheet\" loans, meaning a loan that says on the balance sheet - one the bank gains the profits from but holds the risks for also.  They can also make \"off balance sheet\" loans, meaning they securitize the loan (sell it off, such as the mortgage backed securities). Most major banks, i.e. Chase, Citibank, etc., could be called \"balance sheet\" banks because at least some portion of their lending comes from their balance sheet.  Not 100% by any means, they participate in the security swaps extensively just like everyone does, but they do at least some normal, boring lending just as you would explain a bank to a five year old.  Bank takes in deposits from account holders, loans that money out to people who want to buy homes or start businesses. However, some (particularly smaller) firms don't work this way - they don't take responsibility for the money or the loans.  They instead \"manage assets\" or some similar term. I think of it like the difference between Wal-Mart and a consignment store.  Wal-Mart buys things from its distributors, and sells them, taking the risk (of the item not selling) and the reward (of the profit from selling) to itself.  On the other hand, a consignment store takes on neither: it takes a flat fee to host your items in its store, but takes no risk (you own the items) nor the majority of the profit. In this case, Mischler Financial Group is not a bank per se - they don't have accounts; they manage funds, instead.  Note the following statement on their Services page for example: Mischler Financial Group holds no risk positions and no unwanted inventory of securities, which preserves the integrity of our capital and assures our clients that we will be able to obtain bids and offers for them regardless of adverse market conditions.

{"text": "In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or \"loops\" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes in a single straight line.\nBinary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of children for each parent to exactly two. When the order of the children is specified, this data structure corresponds to an  ordered tree in graph theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children.\nThe abstract data type can be represented in a number of ways, including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list). Representations might also be more complicated, for example using indexes or ancestor lists for performance.\nTrees as used in computing are similar to but can be different from mathematical constructs of trees in graph theory, trees in set theory, and trees in descriptive set theory.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan. It may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money.  I know of one, called Lending Club (Disclaimer - I'm an investor on this platform. Not trying to advertise, it's just the only place I know of off the top of my head) that facilitates loans like this, but instead of a bank financing the loan, the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount (such as $25). They have rates anywhere between 5-30%, based on your credit profile(s), and I believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that you're discussing.  Regarding buying the house - The best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20% downpayment, if at all possible. Below this amount, you may be asked to pay for 'PMI' - Private Mortgage Insurance. This is a charge that doesn't go away for quite a while (until you've paid them 20% of the appraised value of the home), where you pay a premium because you didn't have the 20% downpayment for the house.  I would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible, and would recommend the same for your father. Getting your utilization down and reconsolidating the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable, fixed payment.  Whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you; if it were me, personally, I'd do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time. But if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your 'tax free savings account', it may not be a beneficial situation.  Treat debt, especially credit card debt, like an emergency at all times, and you'll find yourself in a better place as a result.  Credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary, and their rates and fees are structured that way. If, for any reason, you expect that a credit card's balance will remain for an extended period of time, you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan, instead.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A protein is a very complex molecule . It 's structure can be broken down into several levels : - Primary structure At their base level , a protein is a series of amino acids ( themselves smaller molecules ) , which are chained together in a long string . There are many different amino acids , of which about 20 are found in human proteins . The primary structure is the specific sequence of amino acids that go into the protein . - Secondary Structure As you can imagine , a long chain of molecules is n't likely to stay in a long straight line for very long . If you take a long piece of string and dangle it high off the ground , it 's more or less straight . As soon as you let it relax and let go of the string , it puddles on the floor into a complex shape . Proteins behave similarly . Secondary structure is the way that segments of the protein which are immediately adjacent to each other fold themselves . It can be either alpha - helices ( twists ) , or beta - pleated sheets ( zig - zag folds ) . A single protein will transition from alpha to beta and back again many times over its entire length . We can generally recognize from the amino acid sequence which parts are beta sheets and which are alpha helices . - Tertiary structure Once you 've got lengths of helices and pleated sheets , the protein is still mostly a straight line , just with a few folds or twists here and there . It 's still not stable as a whole . Tertiary structure is how disparate lengths of the protein , which may be many hundreds of amino acids apart , come together because of attractions between their component amino acids . This results in the whole superstructure of the protein folding and twisting back on itself so that alpha - helix A lies close to alpha - helix F , and beta - sheet C is adjacent to beta - sheet X , etc . This tertiary folding is the part that Folding@Home is working on . There are myriad ways in which you could fold a protein so that things which go together * are * together , but we have no easy way to work out which is correct . Only one configuration will result in the protein working properly . We generally assume that whichever configuration has the lowest binding energy is most likely to be the correct one . Folding@Home is trying to figure out which configurations need the least energy . - Quarternary Structure This can refer to two things : 1 . Sometimes , after the protein folding is finished , another enzyme comes along and chops bits off , so that the final shape and function is correct . Insulin works like this - it 's tertiary structure looks a bit like a paperclip . The quarternary modification cuts off the rounded ends of the paper clip so that you 're left with some parallel bits . 2 . Some proteins need to be attached to other proteins ( or to copies of the first protein ) in order to function . The resulting superstructure is quarternary structure . Haemoglobin ( that carries oxygen in your blood ) is like this , and is composed of four identical but kind - of separate proteins ( the globin ) , wrapped around another protein that incorporates iron ( the haem ) . Interestingly , a single protein chain might be folded in two different ways to have very different functions . This can either be on purpose , increasing efficiency of genetic coding , or as part of a disease process - amyloidosis and prion diseases are a result of incorrect protein folding .", "label": "hc3human"}

Note that compensation (which generally means earnings form working) is not just what appears on a W-2 form as salary or wages; it can be  earnings from self-employment too, as well as commissions, alimony etc (but not earnings from property, pensions and annuities, certain types of partnership income) You must also not have attained age 70.5 in the year for which the contribution is made.  Even if you don't have any compensation of your own, you can nonetheless make a Traditional IRA contribution if your spouse has compensation as long as you are filing a joint tax return with your spouse. For spouses filing a joint return, the  limits are still the same $5500/$6000 for each spouse, and the sum total of Traditional IRA contributions for both spouses also must not exceed the sum total of earned income of both spouses. The age limits etc are all still applicable. Note that none of this says anything about whether the contributions are deductible.  Everyone meeting the above requirements is eligible to make contributions to a Traditional IRA; whether the contributions can be deducted from current income depends on the income:  those with high enough incomes cannot deduct the contribution. This is different from Roth IRAs to which people with high incomes are not permitted to make a contribution at all. Finally, the source of the cash you contribute to the IRA can be the proceeds of the stock sale if you like; you are not required to prove that the cash received from compensation is what you sent to the IRA custodian.

{"text": "Excellent question . First , it 's not necessarily true that movies stick to one director . In many movies , there are several directors , including 2nd unit directors if they want to shoot different things at the same time . If you had a chance to see * Skyfall * recently , a lot of it was directed by a guy named Sam Mendes , but it was also directed by Chris Corbould , Gary Powell , and Alexander Witt , who all directed different parts of the movie . Usually it 's only smaller movies that get only one director , but on big movies that need to get out faster , it 's more efficient to shoot different parts of the movie , especially those that have to be shot at different places , at the same time . That 's how they can make a whole James Bond movie in less than a year . Additionally , film series are also often directed by different directors . Sam Mendes directed * Skyfall * , the most recent James Bond movie , but * Quantum of Solace * and * Casino Royale * , the previous James Bond movies , were directed by Marc Foster and Martin Campbell , respectively . The same is true of the Harry Potter movies , the Mission Impossible movies , and many other film series . As for why to change directors , it has a lot to do with wanting a fresh take on the material . Different directors have different ideas and strengths . Some directors are really good at lighthearted comedy , some directors are really good at epic action , and some directors are really good at stark human drama . Because most TV series have different stories , sometimes they need a director who 's good at one thing and other times they need a director that 's good at something else . Take * Battlestar Galactica * as an example . Some episodes of * Battlestar Galactica * are almost entirely serious , dramatic scenes of dialog between characters . There 's no humor , there are no action scenes , there 's just serious talking . That would take a director who 's especially good at shooting that kind of episode . Some episodes are about big space battles , though , which means they 'd need a different director , someone really good at action and directing computer generated video . When the show runner has a finished script for an episode , he or she has to choose a director he or she thinks will best be able to make that episode the way the show runner wants .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'm answering from what I can remember of high school biology , so please keep in mind that there will likely be inaccuracies in my response . TL;DR Versions : DNA is the set of instructions that tells your cells what to do . A gene is a specific instruction encoded in your DNA . Cells are the smallest thing that can be considered living . Every living creature is made of them , and every cell must have a copy of the DNA of the creature it is a part of . A chromosome is compacted DNA , a way to save space and organize DNA so it can be stored inside of a cell without taking up all of the available space and getting tangled up . Long versions : DNA is an extremely large molecule that serves as instructions for the various activities carried out inside a cell . It 's shaped like a very long and twisted ladder ( this shape is called a double helix ) . Each rung on the latter is made from two of four chemical bases ( also called nucleotides ): adenine ( A ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , and thymine ( T ) . A pairs with T and G pairs with C ; in other words , a rung can be made of A and T or G and C , but not with A and G or C and T. Also , each chemical makes up one half of the rung ; you can have A on the left and T on the right , for example . This makes it so the DNA can be ' unzipped ' and split into two halves . The ability to be unzipped and the specific pairs the nucleotides have are what make it possible for your cells to decode the DNA . The instructions in DNA are stored in the pattern these bases follow . For example , if a series of five rungs is composed of the pairs A - T , G - C , C - G , T - A , T - A , their sequence can be described by AGCTT ( the pattern followed by one half of the strand ) . If this sequence caused some trait to show itself in an organism , such as by causing a person 's eyes to be green , it is called a gene . Genes have variable lengths . Some are a few thousand bases , but others can be millions long . A cell is the smallest building block of life . You are made of trillions of them . Each cell performs a certain function , which is dictated by the part of your DNA that particular cell decodes . For instance , red blood cells carry oxygen around your body . Groups of cells that perform a similar function form tissues . Muscle cells make muscle tissue . Again , DNA tells your cells how to work together so they can accomplish the collective task the tissue must fulfill . Tissues grouped together to perform a certain function make organs . Your heart is made of muscle tissue and connective tissue . Organisms are made from a collection of organs . Now , think about how much space your body takes up , and the fact that there are trillions of cells that compose you . That does n't leave much room for each cell , does it ? Each of these cells must store your DNA , and DNA is , as I mentioned earlier , a very large molecule . This is where chromosomes come in . A chromosome is essentially DNA in compact form . DNA compacting itself into a chromosome is similar to the way thread can be rolled up onto a spool . This makes the DNA take up much less space in your cells .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "You can withdraw from CPP as early as 60. However, by doing so, you will permanently reduce the payments. The reduction is calculated based on average life expectancies. If you live for an average amount of time, that means you'll receive approximately the same total amount (after inflation adjustments) whether you start pulling from CPP at 60, 65, or even delay your pension later. People may have pensions through systems other than CPP. This is often true for big business or government work. They may work differently. People who retire at 55 with a pension are not getting their pension through CPP. A person retiring at 55 would need to wait at least five years to draw from the CPP, and ten years before he or she was eligible for a full pension through CPP. Canada also offers Old Age Security (OAS). This is only available once you are 65 years old or older, though this is changing. Starting in 2023, this will gradually change to 67 years or older.

{"text": "In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.\nIf proving a statement requires that the prover possess some secret information, then the verifier will not be able to prove the statement to anyone else without possessing the secret information. The statement being proved must include the assertion that the prover has such knowledge, but without including or transmitting the knowledge itself in the assertion. Otherwise, the statement would not be proved in zero-knowledge because it provides the verifier with additional information about the statement by the end of the protocol. A zero-knowledge proof of knowledge is a special case when the statement consists only of the fact that the prover possesses the secret information.\nInteractive zero-knowledge proofs require interaction between the individual (or computer system) proving their knowledge and the individual validating the proof.\nA protocol implementing zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge must necessarily require interactive input from the verifier. This interactive input is usually in the form of one or more challenges such that the responses from the prover will convince the verifier if and only if the statement is true, i.e., if the prover does possess the claimed knowledge. If this were not the case, the verifier could record the execution of the protocol and replay it to convince someone else that they possess the secret information. The new party's acceptance is either justified since the replayer does possess the information (which implies that the protocol leaked information, and thus, is not proved in zero-knowledge), or the acceptance is spurious, i.e., was accepted from someone who does not actually possess the information.\nSome forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs exist, but the validity of the proof relies on computational assumptions (typically the assumptions of an ideal cryptographic hash function).", "label": "hc3human"}

Essentially , you need to think of the efficiency of a solar cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy . Now in the body of the solar cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected . These include metallic impurities ( Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole ( which we call charge carriers ) . The more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency . So what happens out in the field over time ? There are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread . We also have a few such as PID ( potential induced degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours . Now this problem has largely been solved .

{"text": "Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more compute in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IOT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. \nOne of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).\nAWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a \"Pay-as-you-go\" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.\nAmazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.[10] All services are billed based on usage, but each service measures usage in varying ways. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[11][12]", "label": "hc3human"}

The symptoms you described indicate that it is due to either estrogen deficiency or a condition called Asherman's syndrome (adhesion or fibrosis of the endometrium after dilation and curettage). Though this is uncommon after an abortion by suction method, it is usually seen when abortions are done with metal instruments and done very vigorously. This results in adhesions in the inner uterine lining which result in less blood flow during the period. The other possible reason is decreased estrogen production in your body. This could be either due to stress or mental anxiety. Try a hysteroscopy to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. It will not be diagnosed with an ultrasound.

{"text": "How to 'use' your shares: If you own common shares in a company (as opposed to a fund) then you have the right (but not the obligation) to excersize one vote per share on questions put before the shareholders. Usually, this occurs once a year. Usually these questions regard approval of auditors. Sometimes they involve officers such as directors on the board. You will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in.  Preferred shares usually are not voting shares,but common shares always are.  By the way, I do not recommend owning shares in companies. I recommend funds instead,either ETFs or mutual funds. Owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company. Owning funds spreads that risk around,thus reducing your exposure.  There are, really, two purposes for owning shares 1) Owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2) Owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future. (Hopefully at a profit)  One obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to 'write' (sell) covered put options. But options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point.

{"text": "Imagine that you are driving a car at its max speed of 60 mph ( the gas is stuck at full throttle ) on a flat plane . You see another car travelling the same speed beside you . At first it is travelling in the same direction as you . So you see it as traveling 60 mph forward and 0 mph sideways relative to you . Then it veers off . Now it is travelling less than 60 mph forward and greater than 0 mph sideways relative to you . This might seem like it does not apply , but in reality it is a decent analogy for spacetime . Just replace forward with time and sideways with space . The idea is that we are all traveling through spacetime with a constant speed . We see ourselves as traveling through only time ( forward ) . Others can seem to be traveling only through time ( forward ) if they are moving with us . In other words , they do n't seem to be moving relative to us . However , if another object is traveling with some speed relative to us , we will see them as traveling slower in time ( forwards relative to us ) . Since not every objects is traveling in the same direction as us , other objects appear to be traveling through space at different speeds . They of course see us as traveling slower through time relative to them as well ( think of the car metaphor ) . The actual math is a bit more complex , but that is n't important .

The county approaches the property owner , tells them they need the land for whatever reason , and offers them money for it . The owner can either accept , fight the whole process , or fight the amount . Fighting the whole process is n't usually a good option because the government will likely be able to take the land if it wants to . However , fighting the award is usually worth it .

{"text": "Programmer here . There are * lots * of reasons why a piece of software may crash . A divide - by - zero error is one possible reason , though not the most common . Running out of memory -- or accessing the wrong section of memory -- is another potential cause . Another possibility is running out of the bounds of an array -- for example , if the program 's code says to \" look up the first five items \" , and there are only four items . The number of potential reasons for a program to crash are as numerous as programs themselves . Why is n't the software fully tested ? Well ... we try , as a rule . But the number of use - cases ( i.e. , \" What can the user do ? \" ) for complex software can make this difficult , especially if the business department is pushing for the software to be released soon ( buggy software can be patched , and unreleased software earns no money . ) To look at a relatively simple program , consider a calculator . Adding two positive numbers together is a use case . Adding a negative and a positive is a different use case . So is adding an integer to a non - integer . So is multiplying two positive integers . Every possible combination of operators and types of numbers is a different use case . And that 's just a calculator . After a certain point , it becomes difficult to even remember all the possible use cases , let alone test for all of them . Most programmers I know will try to test as they go along , but even then , and even with separate QA departments ( which you 'll find at most larger companies ) , it 's possible for certain things to slip through . And then there are the problems that arise from outside one 's own code . Software does n't exist in a vacuum . If I write a program , it has to run on your machine , with that machine 's hardware and operating system , and the drivers that are installed on it .... And all of * those * things have their own bugs . Even if the code I wrote were theoretically perfect , it could crash due to something being wrong with one of those . If my company has a large QA department , they can cover a lot of different combinations of OSs , drivers , hardware , and so forth ... but they can never cover every combination , at least not with computers ( consoles , having a uniform configuration , were a different matter , though nowadays that 's changed as well due to being able to upgrade system software . ) If you 've ever noticed with some games that some people have a consistent crash problem and other players do n't , this is often the reason why : it 's a bug that comes about through the interaction with a specific combination of hardware and software , and not all users have that combination . And finally , there are cases that are simple user error . Sometimes this can be accounted for by the programmer ; I can prevent you from entering the word \" blue \" when I 'm asking for a number . But a programmer ca n't prevent you from , for example , running more programs than your system can handle . If someone attempted to run three separate 3D renderers on a 4 GB memory system and then started up * Batman : Arkham City * , it would n't matter how good a job the programmers did at making all those programs operate efficiently , they 're going to bring that system to a screeching halt .", "label": "hc3human"}

You can also flip which side of 0 you 're on if the second number is negative . So we 'll think of multiplication by a real number as a stretch or squish and maybe a flip . Now imagine a big sheet . It goes on forever in all directions . Let 's pick a point on this sheet and call it a \" complex number . \" Now I can label the point by two real numbers - how far to the right / left of 0 I am and how far above / below 0 I am . These are the \" real \" and \" imaginary \" parts . The thing that makes these complex numbers different from just a pair of real numbers is that you can multiply them in a really cool way . When you multiply our complex number by another complex number , it both squishes / stretches the number towards / away from 0 and * rotates * where the number is . So remember how -1 \" flipped \" a real number ? We can think of that instead as taking our number and rotating it half a circle around 0 . Real numbers are stuck on a line , so the only rotations you can get from multiplying by real numbers are 0 and half a circle . But with complex numbers you can get any rotation you like ! And they 're really easy to manipulate , too . If you multiply a ton of different complex numbers together and want to know the result you just add up all the rotation angles and multiply all the ( real ) stretches and squishes . Now , you say , what 's this got to do with square roots ? That 's where you hear about imaginary numbers ! Well , the imaginary number i is a rotation by 90 degrees ( a quarter circle ) with a stretch / shrink of 1 ( no stretching ) . What happens if you take i x i ? I said you multiply the stretches and add the rotations , so you get a stretch of 1 x 1 = 1 and a rotation of 90 + 90 = 180 degrees . But remember , we just realized that we can think of -1 as a rotation by 180 degrees with no stretch ... So i x i = -1 . This means that i is a square root of -1 .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day   in the far future? You've informed them of the error and they've informed you that nevertheless the points are yours and you should use them. So you have a couple of issues: have you made what your jurisdiction considers a reasonable effort to correct the mistake, and did the customer service rep actually have the authority to make such a large goodwill gesture as letting you keep all the points? The first is your legal responsibility (otherwise you're stealing), and you need to know specifically for your jurisdiction whether a phone call is sufficient. I can't tell you that. Maybe you should send them a letter, maybe you should wait until you've had written confirmation from them, maybe you're OK as you are. You might be able to get free advice from some body that helps with consumer issues (here in the UK you could ask Citizen's Advice). The second is beyond your ability to know for sure but it's not dishonest to work on the basis that what the company's proper representative tells you, is true. With the usual caveats that I'm not qualified to give legal advice: once told you've been clearly told that it's an intentional gift, I don't see any way you could be held to have done anything fraudulent if you then go about enjoying it. The worst case \"far future\" problem, I would expect, is that someone decides the gift was never legitimately made in the first place. In other words the company made two separate errors, first crediting the card and then telling you the erroneous points stand. In that case you might have to pay them back whatever you've spent on the card (beyond the points you're entitled to). To avoid this you'd need to establish what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction, so that you can say \"no, the point balance was not erroneous and here's the legal reason why\", and pay them nothing. You might also need to consider any tax implications in receiving such a large gift, and of course before paying tax on it (if that's necessary) you'd probably want to bug them for confirmation in writing that it really is yours. If that written confirmation isn't forthcoming then so be it, they've rescinded the gift and I doubt you're inclined to take them to court demanding that they stand by the words of their rep. Use them and play stupid. It's not my duty to check their math, right?  That's potentially fraud or theft if you lie. You did notice, and even worse they have proof you noticed since you made the call. So never say you didn't notice. If you hadn't called them (yet), then you've been given something in error, and your jurisdiction will have an opinion on what your responsibilities are. So if you hadn't already called them, I would strongly suggest that you should call them or write to them about it to give them the opportunity to correct the error, or at least seek assurance that in your jurisdiction all errors in the customer's favour are final. Otherwise you're in the position of them accidentally handing you their wallet without realising, and you deciding to keep it without telling them. My guess is, that's unlikely to be a legally binding gift, and might legally be theft or fraud on your part.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "So you 've got Socrates ' idea of how arguments work through thesis , antitheses and synthesis as /u / ameba spells out above . Basically you talk , you find common ground , and the new common ground forms the basis of your future understanding . Socrates thought you did that until you got to the \" right \" answer , then stopped . Then Hegel took it to the next step and basically said all thought , all words , and all understanding of everything , but particularly in terms of philosophical concepts , is the consequence of dialectic . We talk , we argue , we come to a shared understanding . That understanding = what we think is the correct answer at that point . Until someone else builds on it by arguing more . So there is no right answer , there 's just the evolution of understanding through time . Then Marx takes it one step further with his concept of * dialectical materialism * . That basically means that if you apply the idea of the dialectic to history and to politics you realise that reality itself is what we decide it is , and so we can change it through argument . Take any assumption you make about the way the world is and Marx will say that that assumption is historical : it is correct now but it might not be correct in future because we are constantly changing our conception of reality through conversation and debate . So take the idea that \" Communism is a good idea in theory but it would never work in practice because people are selfish and money oriented \" . Dialectical materialism says well that might be true now , but through argument we can slowly shift our idea of reality over time and at some future point people wo n't be selfish or greedy because selfishness and greedyness are products of our society and culture which can be altered by sustained debate shifting the cultural and historical norms . I 'd need to see the context but I think the phrase \" dialectically related \" I think just uses the old fashioned Socratic sense of the term dialectic .

{"text": "So, the price-earnings ratio is price over earnings, easy enough. But obviously earnings are not static. In the case of a growing company, the earnings will be higher in the future. There will be extra earnings, above and beyond what the stock has right now. You should consider the future earnings in your estimate of what the company is worth now. One snag: Those extra earnings are future money. Future-money is an interesting thing, it's actually worth less than present-money- because of things like inflation, but also opportunity cost.  So if you bought $100 in money that you'll have 20 years from now, you'd expect to pay less than $100. (The US government can sell you that money. It's called a Series EE Savings Bond and it would cost you $50. I think. Don't quote me on that, though, ask the Treasury.) So you can't compare future money with present-money directly, and you can't just add those dollars to the earnings . You need to compute a discount. That's what discounted cash-flow analysis is about: figuring out the future cash flow, and then discounting the future figuring out what it's worth now. The actual way you use the discount rate in your formula is a little scarier than simple division, though, because it involves discounting each year's earnings (in this case, someone has asserted a discount of 11% a year, and five years of earnings growth of 10%). Wikipedia gives us the formula for the value of the future cash flow:  essentially adding all the future cash flows together, and then discounting them by a (compounded) rate.

{"text": "Simulation-based optimization (also known as simply simulation optimization) integrates optimization techniques into simulation modeling and analysis. Because of the complexity of the simulation, the objective function may become difficult and expensive to evaluate. Usually, the underlying simulation model is stochastic, so that the objective function must be estimated using statistical estimation techniques (called output analysis in simulation methodology).\nOnce a system is mathematically modeled, computer-based simulations provide information about its behavior. Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed. This is a time-consuming method and improves the performance partially. To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution. Such methods are known as \u2018numerical optimization\u2019 or \u2018simulation-based optimization\u2019.\nIn simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.\nSpecific simulation\u2013based optimization methods can be chosen according to Figure 1 based on the decision variable types.\nOptimization exists in two main branches of operations research:\nOptimization parametric (static) \u2013 The objective is to find the values of the parameters, which are \u201cstatic\u201d for all states, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing a function. In this case, one can use mathematical programming, such as linear programming. In this scenario, simulation helps when the parameters contain noise or the evaluation of the problem would demand excessive computer time, due to its complexity.\nOptimization control (dynamic) \u2013 This is used largely in computer science and electrical engineering. The optimal control is per state and the results change in each of them. One can use mathematical programming, as well as dynamic programming. In this scenario, simulation can generate random samples and solve complex and large-scale problems.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'm not really sure why this is marked as answered but I 'll give it a shot anyway . The real scope of what happens is a bit complicated for an eli5 because it 's all neurochemistry but here goes : Hallucinogens are chemicals that \" look \" like the molecules your brain uses to talk to itself . The names are n't important , but neurons talk to each other by sending special molecules to other neurons , which catch them with special ' receptors ' . When you take stuff like mushrooms its molecules look similar to the ones your brain uses ( namely serotonin ) . When digested , its molecules enter your blood and go to your brain , where they start attaching to receptors all over your brain , with no plan or reason behind them ! This makes your brain confused since it 's used to receptor binding meaning very specific things : binding in the visual parts of your brain to meaning ' color ' or ' motion ' for example . When the mushrooms molecules are in your brain they tricks it into signalling ' color ' even where there is none ! Your brain then combines the ' color ' signal coming in through your eyes with the mushrooms signal , and you get colors where there are none , or a variety of other visual hallucinations . Since hallucinogens are n't targeted to a specific area of the brain but they just flow with the blood all over , all your brain 's systems ( visual , memory , etc ) start signalling in ways they otherwise would n't ! This leads to strange frames of mind , visual or perceptual distortion , etc . ---- \" Dream states \" sometimes feel very similar due to dreams during sleep arising from synchronized waves of activation passing over your brain . If you think about it it 's a similar mode of action where neurons are stimulated without rhyme or reason , leading to a whacky conscious experience .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "* * What 's Bitcoin * * Bitcoin is a relatively new ' crypto - currency ' . It is a unit of currency that is completely decentralized in its management , instead relying on strong encryption and peer - to - peer communication to manage it . It has been referred to as a sort of ' digital cash ' in that you must actually possess it in order to use it , and since there is no central authority keeping track of everything , if you lose your bitcoins ( eg . through a hard drive crash , reformat , etc . , ) they 're gone -- there 's no - one you can talk to to get them back . * * What 's a Bitcoin * * A bitcoin is a random string of characters that , when put through the bitcoin algorithm , will arrive at a result that indicates it 's a bitcoin . The algorithm is designed so that it is extremely difficult for any particular random string to meet the requirements to be considered a bitcoin ; only 1 in several hundred billion possible random strings will work . Bitcoins are stored in a wallet file on your computer . The wallet file contains a list of all the bitcoins you own . A bitcoin file also contains information about every transaction that bitcoin has gone through , listing in an unbroken chain every wallet ID it has passed through . You own a Bitcoin when your wallet ID is the last in the chain . You give it to someone else by adding their wallet ID to the end of the chain . All of these transactions are passed around the peer network , and each peer will check it for validity by running various cryptographic tests . If all the tests pass , the peer will agree that the transaction is valid . The more peers validate the transaction , the more certain you can be that the transaction is valid ( generally 6 - 10 validations are enough for a transaction to be \" valid \" enough for most people . ) * * Mining for Bitcoins * * Bitcoin mining involves testing millions and millions of random strings of the proper specification in order to find the strings that ' pass ' the algorithmic test to be a Bitcoin block . Once a particular string is found , at least six other peers must agree that the string is a valid Bitcoin block . Each bitcoin block contains 50 bitcoins . Because of the sheer number of strings that must be tested , and the complexity of the algorithm , this process requires a significant amount of time and processing power . The protocol also adjusts the algorithm periodically , making it more and more difficult as more aggregate computing power is used to mine for bitcoins .

{"text": "Given you mention a check clearing, in addition to debit card holds as JoeTaxpayer notes, you may also have funds that are on hold for that reason.  While the bank may have stated it would be a one day hold, some banks may mean business days (Monday-Friday), and so it will become available on Monday. This is because checks are not always instantly withdrawn from the other account (although this is becoming much more common post-electronic check reform), so the bank wants to make sure it actually is getting the money from the check; after all, if the check you deposited bounces, the bank doesn't want to end up footing the bill. The bank allows you some portion up front, largely as a customer service; the amount varies from bank to bank, but it's generally a small amount they don't mind risking.  $200 is a pretty good amount, actually; back when I was just out of college and frequently spending the last $50 in my account, the pre-clearance amount was usually $50. If the bank does this to you regularly and you feel that it is unfair in how long it holds checks, you might consider shopping around; different banks have different hold policies, or might allow you a larger amount up front.

{"text": "This is a good question , one that many mathematicians have dedicated their lives to studying . I 'll try to keep the explanation simple , but since you are asking for a higher level of rigor , the explanation may be a little heavy . What you are looking for are the [ Peano axioms ] ( URL_0 ) . These are a collection of statements which are assumed to be true for the natural numbers ( the numbers 0,1,2,3 , etc ... ) . One thing that you 'll have to get used to is the fact mathematics is all built upon assumptions like this , with no proof . The challenge comes from the requirement that you only use a certain set of axioms , and no more . Thus , any * other * statements must be shown to logically follow from these axioms . Anyway , the Peano axioms are : 1 . 0 is a natural number . 2 . For every natural number n , S(n ) is also a natural number . ( S(n ) is called the successor function , it just gives you the next natural number . ) 3 . There are no natural numbers n such that S(n)=0 . 4 . For any two natural numbers n & m , if S(n)=S(m ) , then n = m. ( If you compare with the Wikipedia page , you 'll notice that there are more , but I have skipped those in order to keep the explanation more clear . ) Now , we have to say what the numbers are : we define 1 to be S(0 ) , 2 : = S(1 ) , 3 : = S(2 ) , and so on . ( The : = sign means we are defining something . ) Now we have to say what addition is . First , for a natural number n , we say that n+0 = n. Then , for natural number n & m , we say that n+S(m)=S(n+m ) . This is enough , as we will see later . We now have enough assumptions and definitions to prove that 2 + 2=4 , and additionally , that 2 + 2 is not 5 . Theorem : 2 + 2=4 . Proof : Remember how we defined the numbers , 2 = S(1)=S(S(0 ) ) , and 4 = S(3)=S(S(2))=S(S(S(S(0 ) ) ) ) . So , 2 + 2=2+S(1)=S(2 + 1 ) . Now , 2 + 1=2+S(0)=S(2 + 0 ) , and 2 + 0=2 . So , S(2 + 0)=S(2)=3 , so S(2 + 1)=S(S(2 + 0))=S(S(2))=4 , so since 2 + 2 = S(2 + 1 ) , we have that 2 + 2=4 . Theorem : 2 + 2 is not 5 . Proof : Remember that 2 + 2=4 . So the problem is the same as showing that 4 ! = 5 . ( ! = means ' not equal to ' ) . Well , what if they * were * the same ? That would mean that 4=5 , or S(3)=S(4 ) . By axiom 4 , this means that 3=4 . From this , we see that S(2)=S(3 ) , so 2=3 , so S(1)=S(2 ) , so 1=2 , so S(0)=S(1 ) , so 0=1 , so S(0)=0 . This last one contradicts axiom 3 , only one of them can be right . Since we are assuming the Peano axioms are right , S(0)=0 must be wrong ! But that means that 0=1 is wrong , as is 1=2 , etc ... all the way up to 4=5 . So 4=5 is wrong , which means that 2 + 2=5 is also wrong , so 2 + 2 ! = 5 .", "label": "hc3human"}

So 75 years ago, those individual cents made a pretty bid difference.  Inflation causes prices to go up, but doesn't get us to just change our currencies patterns. In your example, you are assuming that in an average day, the rounding errors you are willing to accept happen a couple of times.  2 or 3 cents here and there mean nothing to you.  However to the merchant, doing hundreds or thousands of transactions per day, those few cents up and down mean quite a bit in terms of profit. To an individual, looking at a time frame more than a single day (because who only participates in economies for a single day) there are potentially millions of transactions in a lifetime, mean potentially giving away millions of dollars because they didn't want to wait. And as for the comment that people working each 3 cents every 10 seconds, I would assume at least some of the time when they are waiting for rounding errors, they are not at work getting paid.  That concept is assuming that somebody is always willing to pay them for their time regardless of where that person is in the world; I have no facts and wild assumptions, but surely that can't be true for even a majority of workers. Finally, you should be happy if you happy to have an income high enough that you don't care about individual cents.

{"text": "In this type of strategy profit is made when the shares go down as your main position is the short trade of the common stock. The convertible instruments will tend to move in about the same direction as the underlying (what it can be converted to) but less violently as they are traded less (lower volatility and lower volume in the market on both sides), however, they are not being used to make a profit so much as to hedge against the stock going up. Since both the bonds and the preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid if the company declares bankruptcy and the bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest as well, both also help protect against problems that may occur with a long position in the common stock.  Essentially the plan with this strategy is to earn fixed income on the bonds whilst the stock price drops and then to sell both the bonds and buy the stock back on the market to cover the short position. If the prediction that the stock will fall is wrong then you are still earning fixed income on the debt and are able to convert it into stock at the higher price to cover the short sale eliminating, or reducing, the loss made on the short sale. Effectively the profit here is made on the spread between the price of the bond, accounting for the conversion price, and the price of the stock and that fixed income is less volatile (except usually in the junk market) than stock.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "First off, you should contact your health plan administrator as soon as possible.  Different plans may interact differently with Medicare; any advice we could provide here would be tentative at best.  Some of the issues you may face: A person with both Medicare and a QHP would potentially have primary coverage from 2 sources: Medicare and the QHP. No federal law addresses this situation. Under state insurance law an individual generally cannot collect full benefits from each of 2 policies that together pay more than an insured event costs. State law usually specifies how insurance companies will coordinate health benefits when a person has primary coverage from more than one source. In that situation, insurance companies determine which coverage is primary and which is secondary. It\u2019s important to understand that a QHP is not structured to pay secondary benefits, nor are the premiums calculated or adjusted for secondary payment. In addition, a person with Medicare would no longer receive any premium assistance or subsidies under the federal law. While previous federal law makes it illegal for insurance companies to knowingly sell coverage that duplicates Medicare\u2019s coverage when someone is entitled to or enrolled in Medicare Part A or Part B, there has been no guidance on the issue of someone who already has individual health insurance and then also enrolls in Medicare. We and other consumer organizations have asked state and federal officials for clarification on this complicated situation. As such, it likely is up to the plan how they choose to pay - and I wouldn't expect them to pay much if they think they can avoid it.  You may also want to talk to someone at your local Medicare branch office - they may know more about your state specifically; or someone in your state's department of health/human services, or whomever administers the Exchanges (if it's not federal) in your state. Secondly, as far as enrolling for Part B, you should be aware that if she opts not to enroll in Part B at this time, if your wife later chooses to enroll before she turns 65 she will be required to pay a penalty of 10% per 12 month period she was not enrolled.  This will revert to 0 when she turns 65 and is then eligible under normal rules, but it will apply every year until then.  If she's enrolling during the normal General Enrollment period (Jan-March) then if she fails to enroll then she'll be required to pay that penalty if she later enrolls; if this is a Special Enrollment Period and extends beyond March, she may have the choice of enrolling next year without penalty.", "label": "hc3human"}

In rare cases where the same person tries to vote twice , or someone tries to vote in place of someone else , this is easily caught and they investigate and throw out the invalid ballots . Between 2000 and 2010 [ there were only 13 cases of in - person voter fraud ] ( URL_0 ) , where someone either tried to vote twice or claimed they were someone else . Only 13 ! And all of them were caught , no fraudulent votes were ever counted . So the first part of the answer is , voter fraud is so rare that we do n't need new measures to prevent it ! Here 's the other part of the answer : Approximately 10 % of U.S. Citizens do not have a photo ID . Many do n't need it or do n't want it . Photo IDs usually cost money , but voting is free . So requiring photo ID does n't prevent any fraud , but it does either exclude some people from voting , or adds a financial burden for them to get the photo ID they otherwise do n't need . Why do Democrats oppose it more ? Because most of the people who do n't have an ID vote Democratic .

Predictive techniques, such as forecasting, can be applied, but contemporary futures studies scholars emphasize the importance of systematically exploring alternatives. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the social sciences and an extension to the field of history. Futures studies (colloquially called \"futures\" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to explore the possibility of future events and trends.\nUnlike the physical sciences where a narrower, more specified system is studied, futurology concerns a much bigger and more complex world system. The methodology and knowledge are much less proven than in natural science and social sciences like sociology and economics. There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science, and it is sometimes described as pseudoscience; nevertheless, the Association of Professional Futurists was formed in 2002, developing a Foresight Competency Model in 2017, and it is now possible to academically study it, for example at the FU Berlin in their master's course.

File the 1040 correctly, and then deal with SNAP as you note.  Do deal with SNAP, though; otherwise they might be in trouble if SNAP notices the discrepancy in an audit of their paperwork. Further, SNAP doesn't necessarily care here either.  SNAP defines a household as the people who live together in a house and share expenses; a separated couple who neither shared expenses nor lived together would not be treated as a single household, and thus one or both would separately qualify.  See this Geeks on Finance article or this Federal SNAP page for more details; and ask the state program administrator.  It may well be that this has no impact for him/her.  The details are complicated though, particularly when it comes to joint assets (which may still be joint even if they're otherwise separated), so look it over in detail, and talk to the agency to attempt to correct any issues. Note that depending on the exact circumstances, your friend might have another option other than Married Filing Jointly.  If the following are true: Then she may file as \"Head of Household\", and her (soon-to-be) ex would file as \"Married Filing Separately\", unless s/he also has dependents which would separately allow filing as Head of Household.

Your income and saving is good and you have two clearly defined goals of retirement saving and saving for a house each with very different time frames ~30 years and 3-5 years respectively. For medium term money, like saving for a house, just building up cash is not actually a bad idea. This minimizes the chance that a market crash will happen at the same time you need to withdraw the money.  However, given you have the means to take more risk a generally smarter scheme would be to invest much of the money in a broad liquid bond funds with a somewhat lower percentage in stocks and then reduce the amount of stock each year as you get closer even moving some into cash.  This gives reasonable positive expected return while lowering the risk of having to sell during a crisis as the time to purchase gets shorter and shorter. The retirement money should be invested for the long term as usual.  A majority in low-fee index stock funds/etfs is the standard advice for good reason.", "label": "hc3human"}

Now you need water , so you place the end of the pipe inside let 's say your bathtub and unclog it . At that moment your water supplier has to send water through the pipe to keep it full .

Now there is actually unused energy . Since you do n't have to send a message to the power plant whenever you want to turn on your computer , they always have to have a potential of offering more energy than is used right now . They already provide the energy your fridge and your lamps need , but now you turn on your TV and need the energy * immediately * , so the power plant must have that at hand , too . As a result they have to get rid of that surplus on energy as long as it is not used . This often is done by just producing steam and letting the steam out into the open .

If you were to step half the distance between you and the wall and repeat this many times , you would say to me \" I am touching the wall , I can not step any more \" . But theoretically , this is impossible . You are always dividing the distance between you and the wall by two , and you can never divide into zero . But if you were to divide the distance by 2 and infinite number of times , the distance is so small ( by an infinite amount ) that mathematicians like to say that the distance would be zero . Thus , you reaching the wall is equivalent to the limit of dividing the distance between you and the wall by 2 . A practical application of this could be as follows : you have a plastic pool that you want to swim in , but there is a problem . Your pool has a leak ! But you really want to swim . So you decide that you are going to put in the hose and hope that the rate at which the water leaves the hose is greater than the rate at which the water leaves the pool .

I only get filled from that one exchange and this happens noticeably after I see my limit price print, and my fills are always better than my limit price. Whereas with my US-based broker, I can see my regular lotsize limit order in the order book (depth of book data) prior to any fills.  I will routinely be notified of a fill before I see the limit price print.  And my fills come from any number of US exchanges (NYSE, ARCA, BATS, etc.) even for the same stock.

The main problem is that cancer does not consist of other ( so called ' foreign ' ) cells , like bacteria , but of your own . Due to an excessive growth of these cells , more cells are being created every 24 hours ( or minute , whatever time period you choose ) , than die in that same period . This will create a lump . There are two main differentiations to make between cancers : benignent and malignant . Benignent means that the tumor is still located in one place , surrounded by a little film , if you will , that keeps it in place , and more importantly prevents the cells from getting out . Depending on where this is located , the prognosis for this is good ( it is possible to differentiate between the types with a microscopic sample , or biopt ) . Easier to reach = better prognosis . Malignant means that some of the cancer cells have breached the little layer on top , or that the layer is not in place . These cells can then travel through the lymphatic system into your blood and spread elsewhere through your body . They can then form a new tumor there . This is called metastasis , and severely curbs the prognosis .

Anyways I feel honour bound to do an ELI5 of it now ! Will do my best although its very late in Geneve so appologies if its not clear First , what do we mean by a scale ? A scale refers to a rough \u201c order of magnitude \u201d and the physics happening depends on this scale . For example you can completely ignore relatively at the speeds we encounter in our daily life , these are \" non relativistic scales \" . So at a given \" scale \" , different physics processes become important . And particle physicists like to measure everything in terms of eV ( and I do mean everything ! ) , when an eV is an electron volt and is the energy an electron will gain when it passes though a potential of one volt . Through the magic of E= mc2 , this relates to masses . A proton weighs 1 million electron volts ( GeV ) while the heaviest known particles way ~125 ( the Higgs ) and 174 GeV. A TeV would be 1000 GeV. So physicists have this great model which describes almost all known physics , this is known as the standard model . And its got a bunch of particles . There are the eV scale particles ( neutrinos ) , the MeV scale particles ( electrons , muons , light quarks ) , GeV scale particles ( protons , taus ) and a bunch of 100 GeV scale particles ( Higgs , W , Z bosons , top quark ) . And that s as far as the previous colliders could really go . Energy is conserved so to make a TeV particle , you have to put a TeV in , previous colliders just did nt have the omph . So for this paper , we had a shiny new toy , the LHC which can go up to 7 TeV ( although not all the energy you put in can be used ) . That paper was in 2011 when the LHC was brand spanking new , simply we were exploring a region we had never seen before so we were seeing if there were any lovely new particles to find there . Exploring the unknown to see what is out there ! Turns out there was nothing there but it was a reasonable assumption if you \u2019ve seen new particle every time you increase your energy by a factor 10 in the past , you might see a new particle going from around 100 GeV to around 1 TeV. But we have nt given up and we \u2019re still looking for them to this [ day ] ( URL_0 ) , we have lots more data on the way !

{"text": "Pruning is a data compression technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that are non-critical and redundant to classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.\nOne of the questions that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree.  A tree that is too large risks overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples.  A small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space.  However, it is hard to tell when a tree algorithm should stop because it is impossible to tell if the addition of a single extra node will dramatically decrease error.  This problem is known as the horizon effect.  A common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information.\nPruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross-validation set.  There are many techniques for tree pruning that differ in the measurement that is used to optimize performance.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There are a couple of tricks you can use involving the parallax effect , measuring an object from two different locations to attempt to triangulate it 's position , though that becomes less effective the further away it is . There 's also a doppler effect which helps us : The further away an object is , the faster it 's moving away from us . No matter which direction , that rule holds up . If that 's confusing to you , try to imagine the universe as a balloon that 's expanding , and we 're a dot , placed on the surface of the balloon using a sharpie . Another star is another dot . As you blow more air into the balloon , everything gets further apart . But these tools eventually break down for sufficiently distant objects , and it 's hard to tell the difference between a nearby red , dim star , and a far away bright bluer star . For those objects there is a miracle in Cosmology , known as the [ Type Ia Supernova ] ( URL_0 ) . It 's a little complicated to explain , but basically it works like this : Let 's say you 've got a binary star system . ( There are lots of those . ) And let 's say one star is more massive than the other . ( Lots of those , too . ) Now let 's say the bigger star has already burned out into a White Dwarf . There are lots of those as well . Now , if the bigger star has burned out , the smaller star probably has not . That 's because the larger a star is , the * shorter * it 's lifetime . The big stars burn hotter and faster . Now , you 've got this binary system , where one White Dwarf circles a hydrogen - helium sister . The gravity from the White Dwarf is massive , so the orbit 's likely to decay from tidal forces . Eventually the White Dwarf is going to start siphoning hydrogen off the surface of it 's sister . Now , as it does , it immediately fuses that hydrogen off it 's surface into more carbon & oxygen , which is what White Dwarfs are made of . And it starts getting more massive . The White Dwarf continually accretes mass until it hits a point known as * Chandrasekhar mass * , ( it 's very very close to , but not exactly equal to the * Chandrasekhar LIMIT * ) which is the limit where electron degeneracy can no longer hold back the collapse of the star . Now here 's the magical part : At that moment , an infinitesimally short time before hitting the limit , that White Dwarf star is 100 % * * degenerate matter * * . That means every atom in the star is in precisely the same quantum state . Or , at least , they 're all in the absolutely lowest quantum state possible for each atom . Why is this relevant ? Because the moment the White Dwarf crosses the * Chandrasekhar mass * , * * every single atom in the star undergoes fusion at once ! * * This is a massive , amazingly energetic explosion , that totally obliterates not only the White Dwarf , not only the sister star , but also the solar system they live in . But most importantly , because every White Dwarf that crosses that limit has exactly the same mass , * * EVERY TYPE Ia SUPERNOVA IS EXACTLY THE SAME ! * * They all look alike in spectrum and magnitude , and we can calculate what they look like ! So this wonderful supernova , where every single one looks exactly the same , gives us a perfect calibration tool to determine how far away they are . We look at the spectrum , realize it looks like type Ia , only redshifted by some amount , and we calculate the amount of redshift , which tells us how far away it is . We can also compare these Ia 's to other stars nearby to determine what 's in front of them , and what 's behind .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "It is a rather complex system, but here is a rough summary. Interbank tranfers ultimately require a transfer of reserves at the central bank. As a concrete example, the bank of england system is the rtgs. Only the clearing banks and similar (e.g. bacs) have access to rtgs. You can send a chaps payment fairly quickly, but that costs. Chaps immediately triggers an rtgs transfer once the sending bank agrees and so you can be certain that the money is being paid.  Hence its use for large amounts. Bacs also sits on the rtgs but to keep costs down it batches tranfers up. Because we are talking about bank reserve movements, checks have to be in place and that can take time. Furthermore the potential for fraud is higher than chaps since these are aggregrated transactions a layer removed, so a delay reduces the chance of payment failing after apparently being sent. Faster payments is a new product by bacs that speeds up the bacs process by doing a number of transfers per day. Hence the two hour clearing. For safety it can only be used for up to 10k. Second tier banks will hold accounts with clearing banks so they are another step down. Foreign currency transfers require the foreign Central Bank reserve somewhere, and so must be mediated by at least one clearing bank in that country. Different countries are at different stages in their technology.  Uk clearing is 2h standard now but US is a little behind I believe.  Much of Europe is speeding up. Rather like bitcoin clearing, you have a choice between speed and safety. If you wait you are more certain the transaction is sound and have more time to bust the transfer.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Mutations can occur when radioactive particles damage DNA molecules . This happens on an individual cell basis so animals exposed to radiation do not mutate in any meaningful way ( they may contract cancer ) . However widespread mutations may occur during reproduction where one or both of the reproductive cells ( sperm or egg ) have been damaged , this damage is then reproduced throughout every cell as the cells divide . This kind of mutation is actually the very same kind that powers evolution although due to higher levels of radiation there is more of it going on . Usually mutations within the DNA do nothing at all , most of our DNA does n't do a whole lot , in other cases it might cause drastic changes which will likely kill the undeveloped fetus . The kind of mutations I assume you are referring to are somewhere in the middle , small changes that can have a variety of effects from survivable deformities ( a 6th digit on each hand ) to things that may be neutral or in rare cases even beneficial like changes in pigmentation ( perhaps aiding camouflage ) . All in all accelerating the mutation process is likely detrimental as each animal will likely harbor more negative mutations than positive mutation . Going forwards these animals will pass these on to their offspring , but in the grand scheme of things they will probably be diluted within the animals gene pool due to interbreeding with animals who were not affected by radiation .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "In the past , if you went to college in the US , you were pretty much promised an above - average job with a decent salary . There was also a strong stigma against manual labor jobs ( mainly because they become far worse as your body ages ) and a lot of praise for office jobs for how much money you could make in some fields . In the 90 's , the generation that grew up on these ideals had kids and wanted them all to go to college . All of them . So suddenly massive amounts of kids were being pushed into college . The colleges reacted by raising their prices . Sometimes this was justified : they had many more students so they needed more dorms , more food , more teachers . But ultimately , college prices went out of control . The parents still wanted to send their kids to college ( thinking it was how they 'd get a good job still ) and decided to take out loans to pay for their school . BUT these loans were taken out on behalf of the kids so the loans were in their kid 's names ( in most cases anyway ) . All at once , a lot of kids with college degrees flooded the job market . Employers now had millions of applicants with college degrees . In the past , they 'd have many applicants but one or two would be college educated . Now ... everyone had one . This meant that the college degrees lost a lot of value . Since everyone had one , it stopped being special . There * are * plenty of degrees that are still useful and that you needed in your field ( medical , legal , financial , computer science ) , but a lot of kids ( myself included ) were told that they 'd be fine no matter what degree they got . And many were misguided by the college system ( who wanted money more than for their student 's to be well - prepared for the ever - changing job market ) . And of course , it 's super easy to argue that a teenager , with no real world experience , should n't be making a decision that will cost them tens of thousands of dollars , that will also greatly impact the course their career . So now ... we've got a lot of kids with degrees that may or may not be useful . They ca n't get a job in the field they studied for . Well , they can still get low paying jobs in another field just to make ends met . No big deal right ? WRONG ! Remember those loans ? That does n't go anywhere . These young adults suddenly have a lot of debt to pay off . If their degree / career did n't pan out , debt . If they have a great job and make decent money , debt . If they have a medical degree and become a doctor and start their own private practice and make great money , debt ( the average US doctor pays their loans off after 10 years ) . We now have a huge generation of young people saddled with massive debt with no way to get rid of it and few ways to improve their circumstances . There 's no real way they can afford bigger investments like a house / condo since they 're constantly paying towards debt . A missed payment does horrible things to your credit score , a lack of disposable income screws up your livelihood and social / romantic life , and without skills to get a job that can pay the debt off the debt just gets worse . Best case scenario is that the debt takes years and years to pay off with no missed payments and it 's still a massive source of stress in a person 's life .", "label": "hc3human"}

The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.\nThe result of image segmentation is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted from the image (see edge detection). Each of the pixels in a region are similar with respect to some characteristic or computed property\n, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions are significantly different color respect to the same characteristic(s).

Here is a [ super slow motion video of lightning ] ( URL_1 ) , while this is what a [ lightning burn can look like ] ( URL_0 ) . Explaining how they form is not easy but I 'll give it a shot . In your example I believe that the black and red electrodes have been connected to a high voltage * alternating current * transformer such as the one used in a microwave oven . The wood has also been coated with a layer of salty water ( you can see reflections from the water ) . The water helps the process along because it is a better conductor of electricity than the wood . The two electrodes create an invisible electric field between each other ( the electric field is what makes electricity move ) and this field tends to become focused around pointy objects ( like the pointy electrodes ) . The wood and salty water is not a good conductor of electricity , but if the electric field becomes strong enough it causes the water to \" break down \" and suddenly become more conductive in a small area near the electrode . When the water / wood becomes more conductive it allows much more energy to flow through it , which begins to heat up the wood ( it starts glowing ) . This creates a channel like a wire . Now , this break down process is a bit random so these \" break downs \" tend to happen in random directions , which is why the pattern has this random quality to it . There is also the fact that the transformer that provides the power is * reversing * the direction of the electric field back and forth many times each second . This means that these break downs happen in small steps . The tree - like patterns begin to grow because the channels burned into the wood are like short wires . Now the electric field becomes concentrated at the end of these wires , just like it was initially concentrated at the tips of the electrodes . So each of these short channels can themselves have random breakdowns occur at the end . The tree patterns eventually meet each other because the overall electric field biases these random break downs to happen slightly more often in a direction that brings them together .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It sounds like you 're asking about lobbyists who donate money to politicians campaigns . Lobbying itself is not bribery , it 's just speaking to people who have power and trying to influence them . Political contributions by lobbyists are not bribery for a couple of reasons : 1 ) The money is not a quid pro quo . You do n't hand a check to politician and then tell them how to vote , and politicians do not always vote depending on who gave them money . Now yes , a politician is probably going to be influenced by big donors , but not always . If they do n't side with you , then you can decide not to donate again . But you ca n't ask for your money back , or threaten them because you paid them and they did n't do what you wanted . Thus the only incentive to side with you ( aside from your incredibly persuasive intellectual arguments ) is that you MAY donate to their campaign again . Oppositely , once you 've made a contribution , they have your money and can do what they please . You ca n't get it back . 2 ) The money is tracked . Campaigns are required to disclose who gave them money . Lobbyists are required to disclose who they gave money to , and they are required to disclose who pays them to lobby . 3 ) The money is limited ( at least for direct contributions to a campaign ) . There is a limit to how much each individual and business can give to a single campaign . PACs and other organizations are another story for another time . What the money does do is it buys access . Campaign donors , especially larger ones , are more likely to get a meeting quickly with a lawmaker or have their calls taken . I say quickly because anyone can ask for and get a meeting , but whether or not you 've donated to their campaign and may be likely to do so in the future can influence whether a lawmaker decides to meet with you or not . Also , fundraisers ( where you bring a check and the lawmaker is there ) are easy ways to get 5 - 10 minutes of facetime with a person in power . Edit : One additional point : There are laws about how you can spend campaign contributions . Legally , you can only use them for campaign expenditures ( ads , signs , paying workers , etc . ) . Thus you can not use them to buy yourself a nice new car or watch . Yes , this does happen , but its a violation of campaigning laws , again , not bribery .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Few years working a company chain - Deli counter , simple answer is that is bacteria that is forming on the meat . Indicating that is indeed spoiling . Why you may be encountering that is . Meat generally lasts a little more than a few days . 5 I 'd say is a good average . Sliming can occur earlier if 1 . ) Bad refrigeration on either you or the Deli when they sliced it . 2 . ) The Deli may of used an already opened , day or few old piece of meat . Yes , Delis use few day old meat . It 's not uncommon in the slightest at chain Delis . 3 . ) The product itself is bad . Factories out there nowadays are using cheaper , more disgusting fillers to sell their product . Avoid the obviously super cheap products . You get what you pay for . ( usually ) . My own store has brands that are slimey the moment you open the bag . How to help avoid this : 1 . ) Ask to see the piece of meat , so that you may inspect it / try it yourself . Most obvious way is the smell . If you can smell a pungent stank from your side of the counter , avoid it or ask for a new one to be opened . ( Be warned , depending on your relations with the workers , asking for a new one to be opened 24/7 may agitate them & make fun of you / disrespect you behind your back . Do n't be \" that guy \" . but ensure your own / others ' health comes first ) . 2 . ) Go during busy hours . Yes you will run into a line , but you 'll be giving yourself a better chance at receiving a fresher product with everything being opened in the time window . 3 . ) Stick to the popular items . If you ask for the imported , nitrate - free , low - sodium , raised on a farm in Africa , caught using sterile butterfly nets ; you 'll have to be expecting to be receiving an old product . Sticking to the popular stuff again , will help keep you with the more recently opened , fresher products . Unfortunately you miss out on these premium , overall healthier & better products , but unless they are actually edible , you 'll be happier if you avoided it for the time being . Use Step # 1 often . Also know that it 's no ones purpose to sell customers slimey products . It 's just how they are made & handled . Unfortunately one of the problems is the lack of health & saftey enforcement in Delis . When it 's a busy Sunday afternoon , workers do not like to be stared down while cleaning . Customers start yelling at workers when they do not receive help at these times , so workers are almost forced to put off cleaning & safety guidelines to push the sales .

{"text": "Water clarity is mainly affected by two factors : ( 1 ) sediment floating around in the water and ( 2 ) plankton and other organic material . Like /u / jesonnier said , the Gulf is generally muddy from sediment from the Mississippi river . For the West Coast , it 's a combination of the two . Ocean surface water generally flows west to east due to the earth 's rotation . When deeper water flows in to replace the surface water that flowed out , it often brings more sediment with it that it picked up from the ocean floor . Thus , water near the surface on the West Coast has a fair amount of sediment in it that it loses as it moves further out east . The sediment also tends to be smaller than that in the water in the Caribbean , so it stays suspended near the surface more easily . The water near the West Coast is also more nutrient rich so there 's more plankton and other organic material . The Caribbean ( and other places , such as Hawaii ) do n't experience the influx same amount of deep , sediment - rich ocean water that the West Coast does . It also has more barrier reefs , which help keep sediment - rich water away from the coast . There are also fewer nutrients in the water and less plankton as a result .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Multiplying by positive numbers can be thought of as stretching ( or shrinking ) and multiplying by ( 1 ) does nothing . Additionally , multiplying by ( -1 ) in mathematics is a lot like \" turning around 180 degrees \" in real life ( like flipping something upside down ) . Turning around twice is like making one complete circle and coming back to your starting position . In other words , it is like multiplying by ( 1 ) because it does not change anything . So , in the case of multiplying by ( -1 ) , we have ( -1 ) times ( -1 ) equals ( 1 ) , multiplying by ( -1 ) twice does nothing ... (-1)^2 = 1 Now , instead of turning around by 180 degrees , what if you only made a quarter turn of 90 degrees ... Call that multiplying by X ( for now ) ... then you have to multiply by X four times to get back to ( 1 ) that is , X^4 = 1 , and only doing it twice is like turning around 180 degrees ( two quarter turns ) , so multiplying by X twice is like multiplying by ( -1 ) , that is , X^2 = -1 . Call that X by i and then i is the \" number \" that represents a quarter turn . So anything mathematically that includes things that move in quarter turns ( or move in quarter cycles ) can be described using the imaginary number i. Complex numbers let us step up the game to describe any kind of turn . It turns out that any turn by an angle & amp;theta ; can be described by multiplying by cos ( & amp;theta ;) + isin ( & amp;theta ;) . Here you can check that for a 1/4 turn ( pi/2 ) you get i , and for a half turn ( pi ) you get ( -1 ) and for both 0 and 2pi you get back to ( 1 ) .

{"text": "When scientist say \" the universe \" they are actually quite sloppy since they should clearly say either \" the observable universe \" or \" the entire universe \" . Those two are two different things which all to often are simply called the universe without distinction . Lets look at both cases . The observable universe is actually just an illusion ( a very big illusion ) . You can easily imagine the observable universe as a big three dimensional bubble where we are in the center . And it is simply all the light than possibly can reach us since the beginning of time . It also have a definite volume which is a sphere with radius = ( 13.8 billion lightyears + the expansion of space ) ~= 46 - 47 billion light years . This bubble is simply expanding at the speed of light in to the bigger \" entire \" universe . And then we have the entire universe ( or just the universe ) . This one we do nt know so much about . The observable universe is of course a part of the much much bigger \" the entire universe \" , but beyond the observable universe we really do n't know what s out there . Many believe that the entire universe is infinite in space , and our theories allows the entire universe to be infinite , but we really do n't know . What we do know about the entire universe however is that it had a beginning 13.8 billion years ago , and that is was a lot denser back then . We also know that space itself must always either be expanding or be shrinking and right know it is expanding . So if the universe is infinite then it can of course not be expanding in to anything . Since infinite far away it must still be the universe ( not matter how far you go ) . But something infinite can still be expanding . If you imagine a grid with no end in sight . If you stretch out each square in this grid in every direction , the distance between every object in the grid have increased but the whole grid have remained the same size ( infinite ) . An other theory is that of the multiverse . Now there are many different interpretations of different kinds of multiverse ( and there are no evidence for any of them so its just speculation ) , but one of them can easily be explained by the two concepts i explained above . In this case the infinite \" entire \" universe is the multiverse . In this infinite multiverse there can be many other universes of any kind of size and age ( note that the multiverse is allowed to be of any age , whereas we know that our universe have a definite age ) . Our own universe ( not just our observable universe but our entire universe ) could be one of these universes in this infinite multiverse . In this case our entire universe could be of finite size and could simply be expanding in to this multiverse just as our observable universe is expanding in to our \" entire \" universe . tl;dr : observable universe < our entire univsere < a multiverse . The smaller thing expands in to the larger thing . The largest thing is probably infinite but can still be expanding , maybe . tl;dr : We do n't know .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "They still exist , and they still get used . So first , you need to know what the laws have always said : * you ca n't do things that make it impossible for your competitors to compete , UNLESS * doing so makes your product better , or is helpful for your customers in some way It 's that second part that 's the key . If you 're doing something that screws your competitors , like , making a product that 's just too awesome to compete with , that 's just plain old competition , and it 's good . It 's only when you do something that severely cripples your competitors that seems to have * no benefit * to your customers that it 's considered anti - competitive . Here 's an example . I do n't know if this is a true story , so take it for what it 's worth . Once , there was a mega oil company called \" Standard Oil . \" One of the things they ( supposedly ) did once was buy up all the oil barrels for miles . This made it impossible for competing oil companies to ship their oil . This would be considered anti - competitive by today 's standards because it 's just screwing with competitors , AND because they ca n't justify it in terms of making their own product better . Here 's an interesting example ( again , from memory , so do n't trust me on this ): PC vendors used to pay Microsoft for each PC with Windows , but the contract said they had to pay * even if * the PC did n't include Windows . That meant that if the PC vendor wanted to use any other operating system , they had to pay for * two * operating systems . However , I believe it may have been found to be legal , because competing operating system vendors could create similar contracts with their own dealers , tit - for - tat . So the playing field was still level , in a sense . But that last case seems a little borderline to me . I believe they were challenged on it . I 'm not sure if they still do that - or , for that matter , if I have those facts right . In any case , you hear about these challenges all the time . Businesses frequently back off their most egregious behaviors before the challenge has a chance to go anywhere , to avoid trouble . So that 's why you rarely see anyone being punished - the companies avoid prosecution by stopping what they 're doing before the trial even begins , making it all moot .

So if you dig down into the earth 1 mile , the gravitational pull of all of the stuff above you exactly cancels with everything on the other side of the earth .

If we assume that the earth does n't have layers , we can look at the volume as 4/3(pi)(r^3 ) .

{"text": "Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics\u2014or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning\u2014are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "To add on to the other answers, in asking why funds have different price points one might be asking why stocks aren't normalized so a unit price of $196 in one stock can be directly compared to the same price in another stock.  While this might not make sense with AAPL vs. GOOG (it would be like comparing apples to oranges, pun intended, not to mention how would two different companies ever come to such an agreement) it does seem like it would make more sense when tracking an index.  And in fact less agreement between different funds would be required as some \"natural\" price points exist such as dividing by 100 (like some S&P funds do). However, there are a couple of reasons why two different funds might price their shares of the same underlying index differently. Demand - If there are a lot of people wanting the issue, more shares might be issued at a lower price.  Or, there might be a lot of demand centered on a certain price range. Pricing - shares that are priced higher will find fewer buyers, because it makes it harder to buy round lots (100 shares at $100/share is $10,000 while at $10/share it's only $1000).  While not everyone buys stock in lots, it's important if you do anything with (standardized) options on the stock because they are always acting on lots.  In addition, even if you don't buy round lots a higher price makes it harder to buy in for a specific amount because each unit share has a greater chance to be further away from your target amount. Conversely, shares that are priced too low will also find fewer buyers, because some holders have minimum price requirements due to low price (e.g. penny) stocks tending to be more speculative and volatile. So, different funds tracking the same index might pick different price points to satisfy demand that is not being filled by other funds selling at a different price point.", "label": "hc3human"}

In some cases parity doesn't seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative & legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but don't impact the ADR holder (since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs). It's also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly: the law of one price doesn't apply for very short time-frames, just that if you're not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you won't see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU won't be able to take advantage of it (In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average half-life of ~3 days). Some price divergence might be expected: ADR holders shouldn't be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence. There does seem to be some opportunity for arbitrage doing what you suggest in markets where it is not legally possible to short shares, but that likely is the value added from being able to short a share that belongs to a market where you can't do that.", "label": "hc3human"}

Essentially when something feels cold or hot , what you are feeling is * NOT * the temperature of the item itself , but the transfer of the energy to or from that item and your hand . ( Obviously , the temperature of the items also matters ) . So it really comes down to how fast things transfer . Instead of air vs water , consider metal vs plastic . A metal item will feel colder than a plastic one because the heat can transfer faster through the metal than through the plastic . Well , air is extremely poor at transferring heat .

{"text": "Kenneth Wayne Jennings III (born May 23, 1974) is an American game show host, author, and former game show contestant. He is the highest-earning American game show contestant, having won money on five different game shows, including $4,522,700 on the U.S. game show Jeopardy! which he currently hosts, sharing duties with Mayim Bialik.\nHe holds the record for the longest winning streak on Jeopardy! with 74 consecutive wins. He also holds the record for the highest average correct responses per game in Jeopardy! history (for those contestants with at least 300 correct responses) with 35.9 during his original run (no other contestant has exceeded 30) and 33.1 overall, including tournaments and special events. In 2004, he won 74 consecutive Jeopardy! games before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg on his 75th appearance. His total earnings on Jeopardy! are $4,522,700, consisting of: $2,520,700 over his 74 wins; a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance; a $500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions (2005); a $300,000 second-place prize in Jeopardy!'s IBM Challenge (2011), when he lost to the Watson computer but became the first person to beat third-place finisher Brad Rutter; a $100,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades (2014); a $100,000 second-place prize (his share of his team's $300,000 prize) in the Jeopardy! All-Star Games (2019); and a $1 million first-place prize in the Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time (2020).\nDuring his first run of Jeopardy! appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings. His total was surpassed by Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions, adding $2 million to Rutter's existing Jeopardy! winnings. Jennings regained the record after appearing on several other game shows, culminating with his results on an October 2008 appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, though Rutter retained the record for highest Jeopardy! winnings and once again passed Jennings' total after his victory in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament. In 2020, he once again faced off with and won against Rutter, as well as James Holzhauer, in a special primetime series, Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time.\nAfter his success on Jeopardy!, Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006. In September 2020, he signed on as a consulting producer of Jeopardy!, a job that will include an on-air role reading categories. He held this role until the start of the show's thirty-ninth season.\nFollowing Alex Trebek's death on November 8, 2020, Jennings hosted Jeopardy! as the first of a series of guest hosts. His episodes aired from January 11, 2021, to February 19, 2021. Following Mike Richards' exit early in the 2021\u201322 season, Jennings and Mayim Bialik were both named hosts; Jennings\u2019 hosting duties are exclusive to the daily syndicated series (Bialik hosts syndicated series episodes as well as primetime network specials).[10] Jennings will continue to split hosting duties with Bialik for the 39th season of the series.[11][12]", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site .

{"text": "I can give an objective opinion as an economist typically categorized as \" conservative / libertarian / capitalist / wacko \" in a political discussion . I 'm also European so my perspective is a bit different here and I have no political preferences when it comes to US political circus . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ What is wrong with your question / suggestion is that it tries to understand the problem from the same biased , narrow - minded perspective as most of the opponents of minimum wage hike on Fox or CBS business or whatever . The problem with minimum wage is n't whether it would increase cost of goods or services . The problem is how it would effect the everyday workings of the economy how it would affect the way companies hire people , which companies struggle and which do n't , which jobs would disappear temporarily and which permanently . The economy as a whole is a huge resilient system that can handle and take a lot . It 's the little people however who can have their whole lives turned upside down by one small change . To respond to your main question however - In most cases the price increase would be minimal if the minimum wage did not exceed $ 10 - 11 for the expensive states ( Conn. , Mass. , NY , Ca . ) and $ 8 - 9 for the cheaper states ( Tex . Miss. ) It probably would n't change too much if it went 12 and 10 dollars respectively . Some businesses which rely on low minimum wage to make additional profit would find themselves in trouble but they would n't be able to raise the prices too much because the competition would quickly get in and drive them out of business . Of course by \" quickly \" I mean 3 - 5 years . So it would definitely cause a small increase in otherwise stable prices - it would be simply necessary for most businesses to wither the transition and re - arrange their costs and revenue streams - but it would n't be a huge increase ( unless a company used it as an excuse to rise prices ) because labour costs are not the most problematic factor in America because of its liberal employment law . It would only force companies to manage their employees more efficiently and being able to fire and hire at will is a good thing in such a situation . So to answer your question * partly * - no , the price increase would be insignificant and it 's mostly Pavlovian response and overblown scare because what it would do is eat into current profit margins for many businesses . However there are the other problems which * really * need addressing . In this sense focusing on \" prices will rise \" is really a diversion rather than addressing the real problem . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three of them are the most significant : * * * It would disproportionately hit lowest - skilled employees and impoverished communities * * - mainly black - which already struggle for many reasons and unfortunately are not perceived as reliable labour . It 's likely illegal employment would take a chunk of the labour market there whenever possible . Also most economically unproductive employees would be laid off to take the heat of the company . Some temporarily , some permanently . We need to remember that raising the minimum wage does n't help if you do n't have the job anymore . * * * It would disproportionately hit small businesses * * , especially those which are managed poorly ( most of them ) . A large company such as Wal - Mart or Target can deal with it because they have stable credit lines , cash reserves etc . A small pizzeria in a resort town might get in trouble if the hike is too big - say 50 % ( $ 7.25 to $ 11 ) . It would help the big chains to get a bigger chunk of the local market - where it exists . * * * It would reinforce the incorrect , erroneous belief that everything can be resolved by just \" paying workers more \" . * * The current problem with cost of living in America is related to the falling purchasing power of the dollar which has dropped dramatically in the last two - three decades . The process ( known in economics as * Cantillon effect * ) is very closely related to the explosion in the ubiquity of consumer credit and the push from finance industry for further \" deregulation \" ( which is n't deregulation at all ) . This drives the prices of everything up in a very asymmetric manner and makes people more and more dependent on loans instead of their earnings . There is a reason why so many left - wing billionaires and financiers were fine with OWS movement . This movement did not address the fundamental issues of how and why they get so rich but only demanded that they * share * their profits . That 's fine for a business . You have to remember one of the most basic laws of economics : * * every intermediate cost is passed over to the customer in the long run * * . If they have to share more they 'll steal more from you in return and there 's nothing you can do because they 've bought up the congress . Not you . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ That third problem - it is important on a whole different level . It 's like confusing the rationale behind the war on terror vs whether some Islamists in Syria currently making a mess are a problem . By pretending that all that 's necessary is just a minimum wage hike you divert much needed attention from inflationary practices of the financial sector and the government completely messing up the whole economy and into the worn - out cliche of evil capitalists exploiting poor workers . A distorted debate where spokespeople for businesses will demand freezing of minimum wage ( for their benefit ) and union reps will demand a 100 % hike ( for their benefit ) and both sides engage in finger - pointing is precisely what is wrong with considering the issue of some people having a hard time making ends meet in shitty jobs on shitty wages . People need to understand that when you need a raise because you ca n't make the ends meet anymore it usually means that something is really really wrong with the economy ( unless you became really irresponsible with the money ) . So it * * ca n't * * be papered over with a temporary hike in your earnings because the same problem which made your initial sufficient wage suddenly insufficient will come back in a year or so ... Fix the problem - not the symptom . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In the end however a minimum wage hike might not be such a bad idea in the * * practical sense * * , especially if its matched by some tax relief targeted at the smallest businesses to let them adjust better in the short term . The federal government is throwing trillions at the big players but they skimp every dollar on the poor . But most importantly the hike should be gradual and tied to the actual cost of living in a state . Perhaps increase it by 10 % every year for 5 years ? That would be $ 11.67 for current $ 7.25 . That 's a bit too high ... perhaps 5 % then ... Now you have to run it against cost of living in Connecticut and Missouri so it does n't strangle the small business sector in Missouri while leaving people in Connecticut wanting an additional buck or so . So I guess that would require re - working of current federal minimum wage laws?The minimum wage should n't be an arbitrary number - it needs to cover the * minimum requirement * . Which is bullshit anyway considering how fucked up American healthcare system is ... No amount of minimum wage hikes can help if you have an urgent medical bill due in USD and not insurance to help out . So while I would n't recommend it and are generally opposed to the idea of minimum wage at all ( in theory ) I do recognize that in America the minimum wage is long overdue looking from the mainstream perspective ( trying to keep the minimum wage level with a basket of basic goods etc ) so increasing it will not create a massive disaster as it 's commonly presented in the media . However - and that is something that I want to stress here - raising the minimum wage wo n't solve even a fraction of the issues that many low - earners have today in America . It 's just a populist approach to solving economic issues ' gib mor moni ! ' Unfortunately there are many issues both economic and social which ca n't be solved by throwing money at it . It will just provide a temporary and partial relief after which the problems will come back with vengeance . The US needs systemic change ... not a minimum wage hike . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TL;DR : Because of how the US labour market is structured and regulated a * * moderate * * minimum wage hike ( 30%)- preferably on * * state level * * - and introduced in a gradual manner * * would not result in a significant cost increase * * . It might be used as * * an excuse to raise prices depending on local conditions * * . It would however cause a lof ot mess as the businesses which got accustomed to quasi - exploitative business model and inefficient management of low - skill employees would trip over themselves trying to reconcile new reality with corporate demands or generally get in trouble with their traditional poor management . * * Employees with lowest productivity would lose jobs * * . There would be changes to the market as * * big chains would be better suited for competition than small businesses * * . The average customer however would in most instances barely feel it in terms of some significant pocket drain . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ EDIT1 & 2 : I edited it a bit .

Thus, while you can say there is \"rising-interest rate environment\" what else are you prepared to assume and how certain are you of that happening? An alternate theory here would be that \"junk bonds\" may do well because the economy has to be heating up for rates to rise and thus the bonds that are priced down so much because of default risk may turn out to not go bust and thus could do well. Course this would carry the \"Your mileage may vary\" and without a working time machine I couldn't say which funds will be good and which would suck.

{"text": "Maria, there are a few questions I think you must consider when considering this problem. Do fundamental or technical strategies provide meaningful information? Are the signals they produce actionable? In my experience, and many quantitative traders will probably say similar things, technical analysis is unlikely to provide anything meaningful. Of course you may find phenomena when looking back on data and a particular indicator, but this is often after the fact. One cannot action-ably trade these observations. On the other hand, it does seem that fundamentals can play a crucial role in the overall (typically long run) dynamics of stock movement. Here are two examples, Technical: suppose we follow stock X and buy every time the price crosses above the 30 day moving average. There is one obvious issue with this strategy - why does this signal have significance? If the method is designed arbitrarily then the answer is that it does not have significance. Moreover, much of the research supports that stocks move close to a geometric brownian motion with jumps. This supports the implication that the system is meaningless - if the probability of up or down is always close to 50/50 then why would an average based on the price be predictive? Fundamental: Suppose we buy stocks with the best P/E ratios (defined by some cutoff). This makes sense from a logical perspective and may have some long run merit. However, there is always a chance that an internal blowup or some macro event creates a large loss.  A blended approach: for sake of balance perhaps we consider fundamentals as a good long-term indication of growth (what quants might call drift). We then restrict ourselves to equities in a particular index - say the S&P500. We compare the growth of these stocks vs. their P/E ratios and possibly do some regression. A natural strategy would be to sell those which have exceeded the expected return given the P/E ratio and buy those which have underperformed. Since all equities we are considering are in the same index, they are most likely somewhat correlated (especially when traded in baskets). If we sell 10 equities that are deemed \"too high\" and buy 10 which are \"too low\" we will be taking a neutral position and betting on convergence of the spread to the market average growth. We have this constructed a hedged position using a fundamental metric (and some helpful statistics). This method can be categorized as a type of index arbitrage and is done (roughly) in a similar fashion. If you dig through some data (yahoo finance is great) over the past 5 years on just the S&P500 I'm sure you'll find plenty of signals (and perhaps profitable if you calibrate with specific numbers). Sorry for the long and rambling style but I wanted to hit a few key points and show a clever methods of using fundamentals.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Zero? Ten grand? Somewhere in the middle? It depends. Your stated salary, in U.S. dollars, would be high five-figures (~$88k). You certainly should not be starving, but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement, money can indeed be tight month-to-month at that salary level, especially since even in Cardiff you're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most U.S. markets (EDIT: actually, 3-bedroom apartments in Cardiff, according to Numbeo, range from \u00a3750-850, which is US$1200-$1300, and for that many bedrooms you'd be hard-pressed to find that kind of deal in a good infield neighborhood of the DFW Metro, and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown New York, LA, Miami, Chicago etc for that price. What job do you do, and how are you expected to dress for it? Depending on where you shop and what you buy, a quality dress shirt and dress slacks will cost between US$50-$75 each (assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between US and UK, that's \u00a330-\u00a350 per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands). I maintain about a weeks' wardrobe at this level of dress (my job allows me to wear much cheaper polos and khakis most days and I have about 2 weeks' wardrobe of those) and I typically have to replace due to wear or staining, on average, 2 of these outfits a year (I'm hard on clothes and my waistline is expanding). Adding in 3 \"business casual\" outfits each year, plus casual outfits, shoes, socks, unmentionables and miscellany, call it maybe $600(\u00a3400)/year in wardrobe. That doesn't generally get metered out as a monthly allowance (the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of slacks), but if you're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it's a good average. I generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when I get \"extra\" paychecks (26/year means two months have 3 checks, effectively giving me a \"free\" check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills). Now, that's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that won't get me fired. My wife currently stays home, but when she worked she outspent me, and her work clothes were basic black. To outright replace all the clothes I wear regularly with brand-new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand, and that's for the average U.S. software dev who doesn't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis. If I needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily, I'd need a two-week rotation of them, plus dress shirts, and even at the low end of about $350 (\u00a3225) per suit, $400 (\u00a3275) with dress shirt and tie, for something you won't be embarrassed to wear, we're talking $4000 (\u00a32600) to replace and $800 (\u00a3520) per year to update 2 a year, not counting what I wear underneath or on the weekends. And if I wore suits I'd probably have to update the styles more often than that, so just go ahead and double it and I turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years. None of this includes laundering costs, which increase sharply when you're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton-poly in the washing machine. What hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have? A movie ticket in the U.S. varies between $7-$15 depending on the size of the screen and 2D vs 3D screenings. My wife and I currently average less than one theater visit a month, but if you took in a flick each weekend with your wife, with a decent $50 dinner out, that's between $260-$420 (\u00a3165-270) monthly in entertainment expenses. Not counting babysitting for the little one (the going rate in the US is between $10 and $20 an hour for at-home child-sitting depending on who you hire and for how long, how often). Worst-case, without babysitting that's less than 5% of your gross income, but possibly more than 10% of your take-home depending on UK effective income tax rates (your marginal rate is 40% according to the HMRC, unless you find a way to deduct about \u00a330k of your income). That's just the traditional American date night, which is just one possible interest. Playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport. Soccer (sorry, football) just needs a well-kept field, two goals and and a ball. Golf, while not really needing much more when you say it that way, can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses. Hockey requires head-to-toe padding/armor, skates, sticks, and ice time. American football typically isn't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in Europe, but in the right places in the U.S., beginning in just a couple years you'd be kitting your son out head-to-toe not dissimilar to hockey (minus sticks) and at a similar cost, and would keep that up at least halfway through high school. I've played them all at varying amateur levels, and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them. How much do you eat, and of what?. My family of three's monthly grocery budget is about $300-$400 (\u00a3190-\u00a3260) depending on what we buy and how we buy it. Americans have big refrigerators (often more than one; there's three in my house of varying sizes), we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks, we refrigerate or freeze a lot of what we buy, and we eat and drink a lot of high-fructose corn-syrup-based crap that's excise-taxed into non-existence in most other countries. I don't have real-world experience living and grocery-shopping in Europe, but I do know that most shopping is done more often, in smaller quantities, and for more real food. You might expect to spend \u00a3325 ($500) or more monthly, in fits and starts every few days, but as I said you'd probably know better than me what you're buying and what it's costing. To educate myself, I went to mysupermarket.co.uk, which has what I assume are typical UK food prices (mostly from Tesco), and it's a real eye-opener. In the U.S., alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks, and we refrigerate the heck out of everything anyway, so a low-budget food approach in the U.S. generally means nixing beer and wine in favor of milk, fruit juices, sodas and Kool-Aid (or just plain ol' tap water). A quick search on MySupermarkets shows that wine prices average a little cheaper, accounting for the exchange rate, as in the States (that varies widely even in the U.S., as local and state taxes for beer, wine and spirits all differ). Beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board, especially for brands local to the British Isles (and even the Coors Lite crap we're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there), but in contrast, milk by the gallon (4L) seems to be virtually unheard of in the UK, and your half-gallon/2-liter jugs are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon (unless you buy \"organic\" in the US, which carries about a 100% markup). Juices are also about double the price depending on what you're buying (a quart of \"Innocent\" OJ, roughly equivalent in presentation to the U.S. brand \"Simply Orange\", is \u00a33 while Simply Orange is about the same price in USD for 2 quarts), and U.S.-brand \"fizzy drinks\" are similarly at a premium (\u00a31.98 - over $3 - for a 2-liter bottle of Coca-Cola). With the general preference for room-temperature alcohol in Europe giving a big advantage to the longer unrefrigerated shelf lives of beer and wine, I'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than Americans. Beef is cheaper in the U.S., depending on where you are and what you're buying; prices for store-brand ground beef (you guys call it \"minced\") of the grade we'd use for hamburgers and sauces is about \u00a36 per kilo in the UK, which works out to about $4.20/lb, when we're paying closer to $3/lb in most cities. I actually can't remember the last time I bought fresh chicken on the bone, but the average price I'm seeing in the UK is \u00a310/kg ($7/lb) which sounds pretty steep. Anyway, it sounds like shopping for American tastes in the UK would cost, on average, between 25-30% more than here in the US, so applying that to my own family's food budget, you could easily justify spending \u00a3335 a month on food.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Oh jezz , firstly , the testicles do NOT create semen , they create sperm . The prostate creates semen and finishes the maturation of sperm so everything is ready for ejaculation . Edit : The epididymis matures the sperm , which then goes to the prostate to make viable sperm - containing semen . Secondly , we know that nocturnal emissions , or wet dreams , are directly related to the amount of time you go without ejaculating / masturbating . The longer you go without ejaculating , the more likely you are to have a wet dream . The exact reason we have wet dreams is n't known . The best theory at the moment is that it empties out your prostate so a new fresh batch of sperm and semen can come into being . Sperm does n't live very long and semen does n't support sperm much longer either , so by removing the old and replacing it with a new \" batch \" is our best understanding as to why . However , I should note that sperm and semen are constantly made , not just when you 're aroused . Another idea is that wet dreams keep the muscles and nervous systems involved in ejaculation fully operating and prevent them from becoming weak with non - use .

{"text": "Hi- I 've been a registered lobbyist in the US so I can give you a perspective different than most of the others here . First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something . And yes , you do see that some companies are able to getting everything that they want from certain members of congress , but the reality is that * * they were bought and sold before they even ran for office . * * Another thing -- if you talk to lobbyists , a large percentage , i 'd say half , will say that money really does ruin politics . I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else .

They may or may not have somewhat comparable terms, but generally the terms are fairly different. As a holder of an expiring employee option, you can only choose to exercise it by paying the specified price and receiving the shares, or not.  It is common that the exercise system will allow you to exercise all the shares and simultaneously sell enough of the acquired shares to cover the option cost of all the shares, thus leaving you owning some of the stock without having to spend any cash.  You will owe taxes on the gain on exercise, regardless of what you do with the stock. If you want to buy publicly-traded options, you should consider that completely separately from your employer options other than thinking about how much exposure you have to your company situation.

{"text": "The short answer is, with limited credit, your best bet might be an FHA loan for first time buyers.  They only require 3.5% down (if I recall the number right), and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580. The problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines (such as signing up for new credit cards, etc.), they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit.  First, your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor, then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added. While your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts, your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect, assuming you're making all of the payments on time. A good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history, and to make sure it's a mix of account types, such as store cards, installment loans, and credit cards, to show that you can handle various types of credit. Be careful not to add TOO much credit, because it affects your debt-to-income ratio, and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing. I really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores, because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what you're trying to do.  They also offer credit score simulators, which can help you understand how your score might change if, for instance, you add new credit cards, pay off existing cards, or take on installment loans.

Maybe it 's a bank or a government or a company , but there 's somebody that everyone else has to go to if they want to use the money . Some guy in Japan was thinking \" I wonder if you could have a money without having one big guy in charge ? \" That would be nice , because then you would n't have to worry about the guy in charge being a jerk . So , he came up with a way to make a money where instead of having one big guy in charge , zillions of people all watch each other and they all vote to make sure they all agree on how much money everyone has . Everyone knows how much money everyone else has and every time someone gives someone else some money , they both tell the whole world and it goes into the Bitcoin Public Permanent Record . That way , if someone tries to lie about what happened later , the whole world can check the Permanent Record and prove that they 're lying . So , the guy in Japan had a problem : He needed to make adding something to the Bitcoin Public Permanent Record super - duper hard to do so that it would be super - duper hard to fake and trick everyone , but how could he get anyone to actually do all that hard work ? He came up with the idea that every entry in the Permanent Record would record a bunch of people 's trades , but it would also have one , extra special trade of 50 coins that can go to anybody . The rule was that whoever did the work that set up the entry to be good enough for the Permanent Record could give mark those 50 coins as going to anyone he wants --even himself ! A lot of people liked this idea and they started trading bitcoins for fun . Eventually , it got popular enough that some people started trading stuff for bitcoins and even dollars for bitcoins ! How many dollars for a coin ? Well , that depends on how much the guy with dollars wants a coin .

{"text": "Wow I have n't played Halo in a while . I 'll try though . Obviously there will be spoilers in here . Alright starting off , Halo 1 . Halo 1 begins with the fall of Reach . Master Chief is on the Pillar of Autumn when they make a random slipspace jump . This is because there is a law against making a direct jump towards human population centers . Once they exit slipspace , they see the first Halo . It 's a large artificial structure supposedly built by the Forerunners . They were built to contain and study the Flood . The Forerunners are an ancient race that had extremely advanced technology , but were wiped out trying to contain the Flood , something I guess they managed to do ; the Flood has been contained in 7 different Halo constructs . HALO 1 PLOT : Halo 1 begins with the Pillar of Autumns ( PoA ) approach to the Halo ring . You awaken from cryogenic sleep to fight off boarding parties . You then crash land on Halo . Captain Keyes ' lifeboat has landed pretty far away and the entire bridge crew is captured by the Covenant . After a mission where you save Marines , you take a group of them into the Truth and Reconciliation : the battlecruiser in which Keyes is being held . Later in the game , Keyes is looking for a weapons cache that will help you defeat the Covenant . However , instead of finding weapons , he gets attacked by the Flood , which the Covenant has activated by accident . To stop the Flood , 343 Guilty Spark tells Master Chief to find the Index to activate Halo 's defense systems . As Master Chief is about to activate them , Cortana stops him . She says that Halo 's defense system wipes out all sentient life in the galaxy because the Flood needs it to spread . 343 Guilty Spark confirms this . The Chief then decides the next best thing would be to destroy Halo . Cortana tells him he needs to overload the reactors on PoA and the resulting explosion will tear out a chunk big enough so that Halo 's centrifugal force will tear itself up . To destroy the PoA though they need Keyes ' neural implants . By the time they find him , he has already been killed by the Flood . They take the neural implants back and overload the reactors . They barely escape in a Longsword fighter . Everyone else dies except for Johnson but Halo is destroyed . End Halo 1 . I would say the most significant events in this game would be that we have discovered Halo . At this time we think there 's only one so destroying it was a pretty big deal . Keyes is also killed , survived by his daughter Miranda . You fight alongside here later in the series . HALO 2 PLOT : Halo 2 begins with a disgraced Elite being stripped of his rank . This is the Arbiter . When gameplay starts , the Covenant have found Earth . They are repelled by the UNSC fleet for the time being , but a carrier with the Prophet of Regret slips by to New Mombasa . They are shut down by Master Chief and the make a Slipspace jump . The UNSC follow them . When they exit they find another Halo installation . Miranda Keyes sends Master Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson look for the Index . Master Chief kills Regret but is bombarded and falls into a lake on Halo . The Arbiter finds 343 Guilty Spark and is sent by the Covenant to activate Halo . He captures the Index , Johnson , and Keyes . Tartarus , a Brute , informs him the the Prophets have ordered the extermination of the Elites . He sends the Arbiter to Gravemind , where he meets Master Chief . Gravemind is the leader of the Flood on this installation . The Gravemind tells the Arbiter that the Great Journey would destroy all sentient life . The Great Journey is just bullshit the Prophets have been feeding the Covenant . Tartarus activates Halo but is killed by Johnson and the Arbiter . They remove the index hoping to destroy the installation . Instead they put the one they are on and the other 5 on standby . Now they can all be remotely activated from the Ark. End Halo 2 . I 'd say the most significant events would be that they discover that there are way more Halos than previously believed and that they have all been put on standby mode . That makes beating the Covenant to the Ark critical . Want Halo 3 ? This took a while to type but I can type Halo 3 . Sorry if the explanation for Halo 2 was a bit confusing , I have n't played it in forever .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "If the stock is below its purchase price, there is no way to exit the position immediately without taking losses. Since presumably you had Good Reasons for buying that stock that haven't changed overnight, what you should probably do is just hold it and wait for the stock to come back up. Otherwise you're putting yourself into an ongoing pattern of \"buy high, sell low\", which is precisely what you don't want to do. If you actually agree with the market that you made a mistake and believe that the stock will not recover any part of the loss quickly (and indeed will continue going down), you could sell immediately and take your losses rather than waiting and possibly taking more losses. Of course if the stock DOES recover you've made the wrong bet. There are conditions under which the pros will use futures to buffer a swing. But that's essentially a side bet, and what it saves you has to be balanced against what it costs you and how certain you are that you NOW can predict the stock's motion. This whole thing is one of many reasons individuals are encouraged to work with index funds, and to buy-and-hold, rather than playing with individual stocks. It is essentially impossible to reliably \"time the market\", so all you can do is research a stock to death before making a bet on it.

{"text": "In mathematics, a Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete-time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.\nAt each time step, the process is in some state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n, and the decision maker may choose any action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n that is available in state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward \n\n\n\n\nR\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n\u2032\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}\n\n.\nThe probability that the process moves into its new state \n\n\n\n\ns\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function \n\n\n\n\nP\n\na\n\n\n(\ns\n,\n\ns\n\u2032\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}\n\n. Thus, the next state \n\n\n\n\ns\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s'}\n\n depends on the current state \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and the decision maker's action \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. But given \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n and \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.\nMarkov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. \"wait\") and all rewards are the same (e.g. \"zero\"), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.", "label": "hc3human"}

I 'll skip the historical details ( [ although you should read about it here ] ( URL_0 ) ) and cut to the chase : It turns out that everything with a non - zero temperature emits light all the time . This is n't necessarily the type of light that your eyes can detect , but it 's there all the same . It was discovered experimentally long before it was explained theoretically ( it took until the year 1900 ) , but now we have a pretty good understanding of what 's happening inside things when they glow . In fact , it 's the same reason that a hot object in a fire will begin to glow red , and why fire itself is orange at the top . This radiation is called Blackbody Radiation , named so because the form of the radiation is derived by assuming that the body is completely black , i.e. , it absorbs all incoming light and does n't scatter or reflect any . The only light that is emitted is actually generated inside the object , not just reflected from a nearby flashlight . The useful thing about blackbody radiation is that the spectrum of light that 's emitted is determined by the temperature and nothing else . That means that we can measure the spectrum of emitted blackbody radiation from an object and immediately know its temperature . There are some caveats though ; some materials do n't play by the rules , instead choosing to emit light that 's not well - described by the blackbody radiation spectrum . Luckily for us , the sun is one of the most ideal blackbody radiators that we 've discovered : that means our estimate of the temperature ( on the surface anyway ) is really quite accurate .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "You can have as many IRA accounts as you want (whether Roth or Traditional), so you can have a Roth IRA with American Funds and another Roth IRA with Vanguard if you like. One disadvantage of  having too many IRA accounts with small balances in each is that most custodians  (including Vanguard) charge an annual fee for maintaining IRA accounts with small balances but waive the fee if the balance is large. So it is best to keep your Roth IRA in just one or two funds with just one or two custodians until such time as investment returns plus additional contributions made over the years makes the balances large enough to diversify further. Remember also that you cannot contribute the maximum to each IRA; the sum total of all your IRA contributions (doesn't matter whether to Roth or to Traditional IRAs) for any year must satisfy the limit for that year. You can move money from one IRA of yours to another IRA (of the same type) of yours without any tax issues to worry about. Such movements (called rollovers or transfers) are  not contributions and do not count towards the annual contribution limit. The easiest way to do move money from one IRA account to another IRA account is by a trustee-to-trustee transfer where the money goes directly from one custodian (American Funds in this case) to the other custodian (Vanguard in this case). The easiest way of accomplishing this is to call Vanguard or go online on their website, tell them that you are wanting to  establish a Roth IRA with them, and that you want to fund it by transferring money held in a Roth IRA with American Funds. Give Vanguard the account  number of your existing American Funds IRA, tell them how much  you want to transfer over -- $1000 or $20,000 or the entire balance as the case may be -- and tell Vanguard to go get the money.  In a few days' time, the money will appear in your new Vanguard Roth IRA and the American Funds Roth IRA will have a smaller balance, possibly a zero balance, or might even be closed if you told Vanguard to collect the entire balance.  DO NOT approach American Funds and tell them that you want to transfer money to a new Roth IRA with Vanguard: they will bitch and moan and drag their heels about doing so because  they are unhappy to lose your business, and will probably screw up the transfer. Talk to Vanguard only. They are eager to get their hands on your IRA money and will gladly take care of the whole thing for you at no charge to you. DO NOT cash in any stock shares, or mutual fund shares, or whatever is in your Roth IRA in preparation for \"cashing out of the old account\". There is a method where you take a \"rollover distribution\" from your American Funds Roth IRA and then deposit the money into your new Vanguard Roth IRA within 60 days, but I recommend most strongly against using this because too many people manage to screw it up. It is 60 days, not two months; the clock starts from the day American Funds cuts your check, not when you get the check, and it is stopped when the money gets deposited into your new account, not the day you mailed the check to Vanguard or the day that Vanguard received it,  and so on. In short, DO NOT try this at home:  stick to a trustee-to-trustee transfer and avoid the hassles.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Electricity is generated by magnets moving across wires . Winding the wire up into a coil is better than a straight wire , and having three coils is even better . Arranging three coils around a spinning magnet is the basic principle of the power station 's generator . There will be a transformer box somewhere in your block that has three coils that are connected to the power lines . The coils create a spinning magnet force field , rotating at the same speed as the magnet in the generator . Then there are three more coils , but smaller ones , in the transformer . These secondary coils see the rotating field and it appears just like a spinning magnet to those three smaller coils . So they generate too , but at a lower voltage that is safer for the houses in your street . The three coils can be connected together as a \" star \" like a Y or as a triangle \" Delta \" . The power lines connect to the corners of the triangle or the points of the star to give 3 phase power . The centre of the star is also connected and that cable is called \" neutral \" . Wall sockets are connected to one of the 3 phases and neutral . Big motors in factories can use all three phases . Big office blocks will use different phases for different power outlets to keep a balanced load . The voltage between two of the phases is more than the voltage from phase to neutral because in a star connection ( Y ) that is the voltage across two of the coils .

{"text": "Cells can only split a limited number of times before they degrade to the point that they can no longer do so . As they split ( [ mitosis ] ( URL_0 ) ) , the double - helix of the DNA \" unzips \" itself and each 1/2 strand then populates with DNA material to complete the double helix in both strands and consequently become two cells .

{"text": "I suspect you 're talking about China . First of all , you should understand that China 's ' authoritarian regime ' * did n't * have staying power and durability . While technically China 's modern government descends from Maoist China , it 's in name only . Mao 's attempts to seize and centralize China came crashing down in the 70s - his government ' fell ' , for lack of a better word , and was replaced by a more traditional Chinese - style bureaucracy . The reason * why * it fell is because China is ' too big ' to run that way . Once a state reaches a certain level of economic complexity , no one can possibly even * understand * the nuances necessary to run it - much less control it or set policy . Authoritarian regimes are predicated on simple economies , normally ones based around easily controlled resource exploitation - plantation agriculture or mineral resources . In such an economy , you can use a pseudo - military structure of a single ruler or small group of faction leaders to force the rest of the state to comply because you control the only thing that matters - that major resource . In China , there is no such major resource to control . While China has various natural resources , they 're all dwarfed by its massive population . As a result , there is n't really a way to establish a stable ' authoritarian ' government in the sense we most often mean . China is n't a democracy , but that does n't mean it is n't subject to the will of the people - if the Chinese leadership is n't delivering the goods , they 'll face enormous inertia from the bureaucracy that undermines the policies they want to implement . Note that the Chinese Empire has been this way for most of recorded history . The bureaucrats run China , not the nominal leaders . This is very different than , say , North Korea - which is a traditionally authoritarian regime . There are very few resources in North Korea , they 're all controlled by the central authority and that central authority takes great effort to ensure the people are impoverished enough that no other resources are developed . Long - term , this will almost certainly lead to political instability . Remember , North Korea has only been going for about 60 years and it 's been supported by ( much more powerful ) outside forces for the entirety of its existence . It 's actually quite likely that if China walked away from North Korea , you 'd find Kim Jong Un floating in a river the next morning - a large portion of his power stems from the fact that he 's the guy the Chinese think leads the nation . In reality , a large part of the reason we view China as ' authoritarian ' is simply because they have different traditional values than we do . The West was built in a cauldron of war , with enormous emphasis on social and technological progress simply because it was necessary . The ultimate winner of this vicious competition would inevitably be the society that took the most risks and managed to get lucky on those risks . In contrast , China has been largely stable for millennia . While there were political overthrows every now and then , they did n't really impact the lives of the average Chinese person very much ( until World War II and the Japanese invasion ) - it was just replacing one set of nominal leaders with another while the bureaucracy and the peasantry remained intact . The upside for risk was minimal while the downside - destabilization of a basically functional system - was massive . This made Chinese culture extremely risk - averse and tradition - bound . They had no need for such things as ' free speech ' because they thought that anyone with anything worth saying already had a platform from which to say it . They do n't view personal liberty as a particularly compelling notion compared to personal security . They do n't view compliance with social mores as significant compared to the burden of tolerating violations of social mores . To someone raised with the values derived from Europe 's warrior cultures , this can seem oppressive . To most Chinese , it just seems sensible and natural . Similarly , there is nothing magic about democracy . All civilizations tend to have unifying mythologies . Once upon a time , we thought our kings and emperors were supernatural beings . In the old Soviet Union , they viewed themselves as champions of the ideology of International Socialism . In modern Western nations , the mythology is ' mass democracy ' . But while you may be better treated that a medieval peasant , you do n't actually have any more say over the policies of your nation than they did . Whatever tiny fragment of power is accrued from your vote is cancelled out by some other person 's vote - and the same sort of people who run every society just need better mathematical models to stay in power than they would with a more direct system . The centralizing mythology of democracy was never part of the Chinese tradition , so they do n't use it . Instead , they use a notion of China as the ' central nation ' . Ultimately , what you view as ' authoritarian ' is more cultural differences than anything else . Your average Chinese person does n't view themselves as being oppressed and - given a choice - is perfectly happy living under the Chinese regime . Certainly , they may have specific issues - but that 's no different than an American having issues with their own government .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Pretty much all of these answers so far are wrong . * History is not science * . Due to the way records and writings tend to get lost over time , * absence of evidence is not evidence of absence * . Although the proof that Jesus really did exist is n't all that great , nearly all historians believe that Jesus was an actual man who actually was crucified by Pontius Pilate . In reality , there is actually much less information that survived from antiquity than most people think . For example , we still are not totally sure if Homer ever existed , nor do we know all that much about Plato besides his approximate birth date , let alone if he actually wrote everything that is attributed to him . Anyway , back to Jesus . There are two main \" contemporary \" ( they were actually written decades afterwards , but remember , this was * 2000 * years ago ) sources : Tacitus and Josephus . Tacitus 's account is universally considered to be authentic and reliable . He was a Roman senator who was n't even particularly fond of Christians himself . He states > called Christians by the populace . Christus , from whom the name had its origin , suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators , Pontius Pilatus The other account is from the Jewish historian Josephus . He mentions Jesus , \" who was called Christ \" , and also his brother James . This source , however , was messed with later on by some zealous Christians who added in some stuff , like calling him the Messiah , but scholars agree that the core is authentic . There is also some stuff about Jesus 's baptism by John the Baptist , which historians also agree is authentic since it would be against the Church 's interests to make that up . Now to restate , * History is not science * . Some of these explanations may not seem very satisfactory . However , given that all this happened nearly 2000 years ago , it would be absurd to think that we should have perfect evidence for events .

{"text": "Languages do n't get simpler , because simplification in one place means making something else more complicated . For example , English has no case system like , say , Russian . It used to have a case system , but it 's pretty much dead now . Good stuff , you might think , because the Russian case system means that the word for \" house \" can be \" dom \" , \" doma \" , \" domye \" , \" domu \" or \" domom \" , depending on its role in the sentence . But no case system means that in English , words have to go in a particular order , so \" Jack builds a house \" makes sense but \" A house builds Jack \" does n't . And then you have problems when you need to change the word order for certain reasons , meaning you have to add an auxiliary verb or construct a sentence with a relative clause , just so that the sentence means what you want it to say . How languages get complicated is a fascinating question , and it has no easy answer . I would recommend a book called * The Unfolding of Language * by Guy Deutscher , which attempts to explain how this could have come about in layman 's terms . Essentially , though , if you start with a very simple language , it can convey some basic concepts , but that might not be enough . You can say \" Jack builds house \" , but how do you express that , for example , the house is now complete , or that the construction is still in progress , or that Jack builds houses generally , or any one of countless subtle variations ? Here 's the sentence in an imaginary language : \" Jack pin dot \" . Some other words in this imaginary language are : \" pat \" = \" behind \" and \" dan \" = \" in front \" . Now we use these words to change the time of the building , thus : * \" Jack pin - pat dot \" = \" Jack built a house \" ( past tense ) * \" Jack pin - dan dot \" = \" Jack will build a house \" ( future tense ) Now , when people speak , they are fundamentally lazy , so \" pin - pat \" and \" pin - dan \" become , over time , condensed . Additionally , \" pinpat \" is difficult to say quickly , and the \" p \" causes the \" n \" to change to an \" m \" . So our sentences are now \" Jack pimpat dot \" and \" Jack pindan dot \" , and already we have a headache for future generations of students , who will have to learn this pattern under a fancy name like \" second declension \" . ( \" All verbs ending in ' -n ' fall into this category ; the ' -n ' mutates to ' -m- ' in the past tense . \" ) And so simple words added to sentences become prefixes , suffixes , particles and so on , evolving into a complex system of tenses , cases and so forth .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Propositional calculus is a branch of logic.  It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. Propositions that contain no logical connectives are called atomic propositions.\nUnlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.", "label": "hc3human"}

Many people think If they put $X a month aside, then pay just before the 6 months, 12 moths or no-payment before 2014 period ends then I will be able to afford the computer, carpet, or furniture. The interest rate they will charge you if you are late will be buried in the fine print. But expect it to be very high. Pay on time, but now that you have a card with their logo on it.  So now you feel that you should buy the accessories from them. They hope that you become a long time customer. They want to make money on your next computer also. Their \"Bill Me Later\" option on that site as essentially the same as the preferred account. In the end you will have another line of credit. They will do a credit check. The impact, both positive and negative, on your credit picture is discussed in other questions.  Because two of the three options you mentioned in your question (cash, debit card) imply that you have enough cash to buy the computer today, there is no reason to get another credit card to finance the purchase. The delayed payment with the preferred account, will save you about 10 dollars (2000 * 1% interest * 0.5 years).  The choice of store might save you more money, though with Apple there are fewer places to get legitimate discounts. Here are your options: How to get the limit increased: You can ask for a temporary increase in the credit limit, or you can ask for a permanent one. Some credit cards can do this online, others require you to talk to them. If they are going to agree to this, it can be done in a few minutes. Some individuals on this site have even been able to send the check to the credit card company before completing the purchase, thus \"increasing\" their credit limit. YMMV. I have no idea if it works.  A good reason to use the existing credit card, instead of the debit card is if the credit card is a rewards card. The extra money or points can be very nice. Just make sure you pay it back before the bill is due. In fact you can send the money to the credit card company the same day the computer arrives in the mail.

So after three years the value is 1.331, the same as y0 (1 + 0.1)^3. Depreciating (like inflation) by 10% (to demonstrate) gets us back to y0 = 1 Appreciating and depreciating by 10% cancels out: Appreciating by 10% interest and depreciating by 3% inflation: This is the same as y0 (1 + 0.1)^3 (1 + 0.03)^-3 = 1.21805 So for 50 years the result is y0 (1 + 0.1)^50 (1 + 0.03)^-50 = 26.7777 Note You can of course use subtraction but the not using the inflation figure directly.

In fact , if you run a current through a wire that 's curled around in a circle , it acts almost exactly like a bar magnet .

In fact , you can make an [ extremely simple motor ] ( URL_1 ) with just a bunch of copper wire , a battery , and a magnet . * Real motors use the same basic principle , but have much more involved and efficient designs .

{"text": "Because English is horribly complicated when it comes to forming questions . If you start off with \" This means X , \" that 's simple enough . If you want to turn it into a question , in most languages that 's fairly simple : just use an interrogative if you need one , and swap a couple of words around . In some languages , you do n't even bother swapping the words around . For example , the equivalent sentence in German is : \" Das bedeutet X \" . In our question , we do n't know what X is , so that 's our question : we use the interrogative \" was \" ( which means \" what \" ) . Then we put the interrogative first , and then swap the order of the subject ( \" das \" ) and verb ( \" bedeutet \" ) . That gives us \" Was bedeutet das ? \" If we translate that word for word , we get : \" What means this ? \" But in modern English ( things were different in Shakespeare 's day ) that does n't sound right . A question in English has the following form : interrogative - auxiliary verb - subject - main verb . So here is the process a foreign student has to learn to turn \" This means X \" into a question : 1 . First , we need the interrogative \" what \" . 2 . Now we need an auxiliary verb . But the original sentence does n't have an auxiliary verb , so we must add one . We use the verb \" to do \" . 3 . Because the subject is a third person singular and we are using the present tense , we must take the third person singular present tense form \" does \" . 4 . Next comes the subject . This bit 's easy : it 's \" this \" . 5 . Now the main verb . But we must be careful here : in our original sentence , the verb is in the third person singular present tense . But we have now added an auxiliary verb , so we must use either an infinitive or a participle . The auxiliary verb we used is \" to do \" , so the main verb must be in the infinitive form \" mean \" -- so we must remember to drop the final \" -s \" .

In general, I consider a \"cheap\" home to cost 20% or less of your income, \"affordable\" between 20-30% and \"not affordable\" over 30%. When you start comparing rent vs. buy, there are other factors that you need to think about: Renting is an easy transaction.

The \"cost\" of the low risk is that you have virtually no prospects of recouping any value out of the cash that you are laying out for your home. Buying is more complex. You're buying a house, building equity and probably making money due to appreciation. You need to be vigilant about expenses and circumstances that affect the value of your home as an investment.

It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records. Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years; previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.\nThe Greek language holds a very important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek. Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics.\nDuring antiquity, Greek was by far the most widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world. It eventually became the official language of the Byzantine Empire and developed into Medieval Greek. In its modern form, Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. It is spoken by at least 13.5 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the many other countries of the Greek diaspora.\nGreek roots have been widely used for centuries and continue to be widely used to coin new words in other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There were several areas where the mortgage and car loan have affected your credit.  The mortgage had the following impacts, The car loan (purchased shortly after the house) had the following impacts, You did not mention your payment history, but since you had an 800 prior to the house purchase, we can assume that your payment history is current (nothing late). You did not mention your credit utilization, but you want to keep your utilization low (various experts suggest 10%, 20% and 30% as thresholds).  The down payment on the house likely drained your available funds, and replacing the car may have also put stress on your funds.  And when you buy a house, often there are additional expenses that further strain budgets. My guess is that your utilization percentage has increased.  My suggestion would be to reduce your utilization ratio on your revolving accounts.  And since you have plenty of credit lines, you might want to payoff the car. Your Chase card has a good age, which helps with age of credit, and though you will find experts that say you should only have 2-4 revolving accounts (credit cards), other experience shows that having accounts with age on them is a good thing.  And having a larger number of accounts does not cause problems (unless you have higher utilization or you miss payments). You did not mention whether the Chase card has any fees or expenses, as that would be a reason to either negotiate with Chase to reduce or eliminate the fees, or to cancel the card.

If the US were to remove all of it 's troops we would have no influence in the region . We would be unable to negotiate from a place of power with countries like Iran and Syria . There would also be a power vacuum left . Countries like Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as others that we have quieter relations with , would struggle to develop their militaries into an effective fighting force against the terrorist groups like ISIS operating in the area . I would estimate that within 12 months the Iraqi government would fail leading to a breeding ground for terrorists . Within 24 months the Afghani government would fail . I say this because Iraq is under a larger more immediate threat , where the Afghani government is in a more drawn out fight that is going to need US guidance over the coming years to develop their military properly .

{"text": "Only 3 - 5 civilizations have ever invented a written language with absolutely zero input from anyone else - all other writing systems descend from or were inspired by one of these . Definitively , writing systems developed in the Middle East ( Sumerian for sure , possibly Egyptian as well ) , China ( Bronze Age glyphs ) , and Mesoamerica ( Mayan ) . In all three cases , what you saw was urbanizations , meaning communities whose populations too big for a single individual or even a group of individuals to keep track of by memory . Additionally , these were also the cases where enough of the population was in the same area , and recieving the same influences and education , for any given \" code \" to become widely used and understood . All languages are , in a sense , a code - the sender and the recipient must both understand the code a message is in for that message to be useful . If you do n't know the language , then the message is meaningless . Cities marked the first time you had enough of a population in one area to support a group of people who have the time and inclination to study \" codes \" to communicate or store data . It perpetuated because it was also easy to share this information across large distances , as well as pass information \" down \" to future generations who might need that knowledge . Most early writing systems were practical things - i.e. trade , family history , agricultural information , etc . Then , they expanded to things like stories and histories . In villages , tribes , and other smaller communities , people usually only needed to keep track of what was going on in their immediate area , a single herd of animals , a single giant farm ( or a collection of smaller farms ) , etc . Meanwhile , stories or histories were preserved in oral tradition , which did require intense training and study , but preserved those stories and histories in someone 's living memory , to be recited upon need or command . This was how information was preserved to pass \" down \" to future generations . If a community did not participate extensively in trade , they would 've had little need to communicate over long distances , so a system of spreading knowledge or information without an actual person to \" carry \" it from Point A to Point B ( whether those points are across time , distance , or both ) would never have been needed . Writing is not the only way to store information without a living person to actually carry and distribute that information orally . There have been many , many artistic traditions that conveyed story and history without a word . Meanwhile , there have historically been other mechanisms of storing and sharing more practical , day - to - day information like quipus ( \" talking knots \" ) . However , over time , writing systems proved to be the most efficient and versatile way to store and share knowledge and information , so most of these other methods died out over time . Even amongst writing systems , only a certain style really remains and prevails today , and that is the mechanism of using symbols to convey a * sound * ( and thus stringing together several symbols to convey a word ) , rather than symbol conveying a * word * or concept . The only major language that still uses the latter system today is Chinese - and even this language is only partially logographic ( \" pictures / symbols as words \" ) , and is also partially phonetic ( characters or character alterations that convey sound , to combine with the logogram to convey the actual word or sentence correctly ) . And even now , Chinese is evolving somewhat phonetically - Simplified Chinese is a little more phonetic and less logographic than Traditional Chinese , and many places even in China are more apt to just use Western numerals than Chinese ones ( though the Chinese numerals still prevail in the country ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

An FM radio wave is about 9 feet/3 meters long , so the antenna has to be about 27 inches/75 cm long . This is the simplest , cheapest form of radio antenna , and it 's adequate for the expected range of FM radio . An even number like 1/4 allows electric current to resonate with the radio wave , so that it can receive the signal clearly . If you make the antenna too short , even if it 's still an even number like 1/8 , then you start to lose the signal , because the flow of electricity through the antenna itself generates an electric field , which will \" push back \" against the ability of the radio waves to make the electric current flow . This is called reactance . To fight against that , you can use another electric property called inductance . Inductance is like reactance , but it creates magnetic fields instead of electric fields , and it can cancel out reactance . To make the magnetic field you need to wrap the antenna into a coil shape , like making an electromagnet out of a wire and a pencil . This is why you 'd see old cell phone antennas with that \" springy \" shape at the bottom . And when you see a modern car 's radio antenna , you 'll see it has a short section at the bottom which is fatter . Inside there is a coil .

You should always haggle and price match your vendors. You can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference. For example, call up a florist and say you need X, Y, and Z for a corporate banquet or for a special event for which you cannot give the details. If you then tell them its actually a wedding, and they blindly raise it without a good justification, move on. That said, they jack up the price because they know most people will says \"it's my wedding\", \"it's once in a lifetime\", \"it's MY special day\", etc.... The same is true about diamonds, their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio, just the perception that has been created.

We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as possible ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 Representative spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts / Representatives and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you 've abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet tall then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .", "label": "hc3human"}

For example , employees should have some say in how the company they work for should be run , parents should have a say in how the school their children attend is run , etc . Wikipedia assures me that in English this is called co - determination . The next step , is that if you already depend on eachother , and decide stuff together , you have some responsibility to take care of eachother . There 's dozens of variation on these basic ideas . In Western Europe there 's a lot of Social Democracy , which seperates the idea of decisionmaking and ownership , so that for example employees might have certain rights to make decisions for the company they work for , but does not entitle them to a share of the profit , or to make decisions that do not directly affect their work . Another type of socialism is communism . This is based on the writing of Marx , and the basic idea is that the right to decide and ownership are inextricably linked , and belong to all people together . The way communism is supposed to organize this , is by people working together , sharing together and deciding together in councils ( hence the name \" communism \" ) . These councils ( or \" soviet \" in Russian ) , or their representatives , would come together in an overarching council that would make decisions for the entire country , and own everything on behalf of these councils . Or at least , that 's the theory . For a lot of countries , if not all , that tried to implement communism , the result was that a leader would end up being in control of the overarching council and being able to lead the local councils , rather than the other way around , which opens up lots of possibilities for abuse and general dictatorship .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount. This is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from - in the form of its own currency. We will continue with this analogy, if the central bank says these \"shares\" are worth $1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $0.80 and decreasing, then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg, and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank's solvency. (People will know the $1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is, because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services, especially when it comes to imports. Shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor, which happens no matter what the government's punishments are for doing so). Swiss National Bank (central bank) did this in early 2015, as it experienced volatility in the Euro which it had previously been trying to keep it's currency pegged to. It became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own. The central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve, such as selling a lot of foreign currency X, buying more of currency Y. They can and do take losses doing this. (Swiss National Bank is maintaining a large loss) They can also flood their economy with more of their currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. People colloquially call this \"printing money\" but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools. The good and service goes onto the central bank's balance book, and the company/entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash (another reading is that the bond is as good as cash). The bond didn't previously exist until the central bank said it did, and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds.

Or even better, try and make most of your purchases on a 0 fee credit card and every 6-8 months get a new credit card to have multiple lines of ongoing credit.  to use the mortage to establish credit isnt worth the 4% hit in wealth that it offers. now mind you if your options were to buy the house with your own money outright or get a mortgage i would say get the mortgage because the added leverage would help your investments beat the market most years . figure if you get 6% an average portfolio each year and you can write off the taxes on your mortgage you will be ahead by more than 2%", "label": "hc3human"}

Just like if you buy a house, the money you paid moves to the former owner, but what you are getting is a clear asset in return that you now own. Via mutual funds/indexes this can get a little more complicated (voting rights etc tend to go to the mutual/indexing company rather than the holders of the fund), but is approximately the same thing: the fund buys assets on the open market, then holds them, buys more, or sells them on behalf of the fund investors.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "The program has to be written to take advantage of that hardware . The Windows GUI , for example , being your desktop - that rendering code was written before hardware acceleration was ubiquitous . All of your windows , button , and icons are all rendered \" in software \" , aka on your CPU . And your CPU is n't designed specifically for rendering , so reducing effects improves performance . And some of the big costs in rendering has to do with blending . Transparency is expensive , as can be anti - aliasing . And Windows desktop rendering is done on a single thread , so no matter how many CPUs or cores you have , it wo n't have much of an impact . Further , rendering happens on the \" main thread \" , which , I believe , is also responsible for IO if memory serves me ... When you 're busy rendering , there 's an event queue of everything you 've clicked or typed that 's waiting to be processed ; not until the screen is refreshed . Many desktop apps are written to be single threaded , so they only execute on one core , so everything the program does happens in sequence . If rendering the window is going to take a long time , everything else in the queue is waiting to get processed . A programmer using C or C++ as their programming language has to write multi threading code themselves to take advantage of it . Microsoft would have to rewrite that whole software layer to take advantage of a GPU , and they 're not going to do that , because they 're insane about backwards compatibility . Instead , they wrote a new GUI layer that developers can use going forward . Migration is always slow .

This idea led him to build an underwater city where artisans and scientists could live and prosper , advancing like never before , without impedance . The city was named \" Rapture \" . It was all good for a time , until the scientists discovered these sea slugs that produced \" Adam \" , a psychoactive and mutating drug . It was eventually used to make plasmids which were injections that gave you super human powers and tonics which granted perks . Then , shit went down ... way down . They needed a way to recycle the Adam from dead people so they abducted little girls ( 5 - 6yo 's ) and implanted them with a sea slug . They would meander around with large syringes and stab bodies to draw blood . They lived in an ignorant haze and thought the people were \" angels \" . People tried to steal the \" Little Sisters \" for their own Adam gain so men were drafted and grafted into large diving suits to follow the sisters and protect them with their lives . They 're \" Big Daddies \" . Andrew could n't have children so he had an embryo created . A super criminal stole this , programmed it to grow hyper - fast , leave rapture and grow up , come back , and kill Ryan . You 're the embryo . You board a plane and kill the pilot , crashing near the island to enter rapture via bathysphere . You traverse rapture , find all this out , and kill the super criminal and Ryan ( by his own request ) .

{"text": "The taste after you swallow , called \" the after taste \" , is a real part of the tasting experience . Taste is about dissolution and absorption . These things take time and involve density of material . So you bring something near your face and you smell it , which is part of the overall taste process . Then it touches the wetness of your mouth . The saliva begins reacting with and carying the substance around . As each detectable molecule arrives on a sensor the signaling begins . You process the strongest and most pervasive signal first , which is why over - salting ( or any other overwhelming seasoning ) or burning ( as in \" this toast is burnt \" ) foods can \" overpower \" all the rest of the flavor . The stuff that arrives fastest tends to depart fastest as well . So you 'll get the water soluble flavors first , and the fat soluble flavors take longer to arrive and so longer to depart . Indeed strictly fat soluble molecules can hang around a long , long time . This is why some peepers have a \" long slow build and a lasting burn \" as you eat dishes that contain them . Some of the \" metallic \" tastes are fast ans some are slow . And almost all tastes other than the big five instants \" sweet , salty , ~~savory~~ sour , bitter , and umami / savory \" are complex . So you 've learned to associate some complex tastes with particular things . This is why people will say wine has \" earthy \" or \" woody \" \" notes \" . And \" earthy note \" is the taste of dirt from your childhood , etc . Finally alcohol content is a real kicker . The reason that most \" extracts \" ( such as vanilla extract ) are created by soakiing the thing ( e.g. the vanilla ) in alcohol is that alcohol is good for forcing both the fat and water soluble flavors out of things and then holding them in suspension . That also means that alcohol both delivers and washes away flavors . Alcohol is therefore better at making flavors \" fast \" . And vinegar is great for bringing out flavors because the ph ( acidity ) makes some things more aggressive as the acid is neutralized in your mouth . As an added bonus , once some stuff is in your blood stream trace amounts of the more volatile bits may exit the blood into your lungs and be breathed out . So like \" garlic breath \" from garlic oils . And breathing out those chemicals will re - trigger taste and smell . So flavor is a continuous process . Alert flavors first ( bitter==poison , spit it out ! ) and evaluation flavors second ( gee , I needed some potassium ) and pleasure flavors third to a large degree .

{"text": "The important thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't breathe through their mouths like us ; they do n't even have lungs . They have tiny holes in their exoskeleton which allows oxygen into system of tubes , which carry oxygen to their organs . With that in mind , let 's think about what happens when something increases in size . Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In other words , volume and surface area increase by different rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It has a volume of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides , 4 sq ft per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times * , but the surface area only increased by * four * . 3x3x3 ? Volume of 27 , surface area of 54 . The volume more than tripled , whereas the surface area roughly doubled . Now , the point here is that * volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That means that there 's more organs and whatnot , all of which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen available , though , depends on * surface area * . Insects get oxygen from their skin , so to increase their oxygen intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You ca n't add more holes in the exoskeleton to increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because that makes the exoskeleton weaker . The exoskeleton is * already * under extra strain trying to support the increased weight , so that wo n't work . This means that there 's essentially a point where an insect ca n't grow any bigger , because it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) to make up for the increased volume / weight ( need for oxygen ) . For more evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be much bigger millions and millions of years ago during dinosaur times . The atmosphere was richer in oxygen back then , so it makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

I suppose some people are in a position where the chances that they will face any sort of financial emergency are remote. If you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near-zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system, you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs, you ride the bus or subway and don't own a car so that's not an issue, etc etc, maybe there just isn't any likely scenario where you'd suddenly need cash.

{"text": "Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.\nIn both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.\nIf sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Because it is one of the simplest self - organization principles , along with the golden ratio * phi * ( which is the limit of the ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers ) , and the golden angle ( which is the golden ratio applied to the circumference of a circle ) . It would be useful for a sunflower to pack as many florets as possible into the space available , to increase likelihood of pollination and send as many seeds out into the world as possible . There are several ways it could do that : anything from randomly arrayed florets to some complex close - packing algorithm . But it 's a plant , so it needs a simple rule that results in an optimal configuration : it needs a simple ' self - organizing ' principle . And the simplest rules ( known to plants ) that lead to the greatest optimization tend to involve Fibonacci numbers . The spirals come in because they fill round spaces efficiently . Suppose a flower has * m * lines of seeds , each containing * n * seeds . If those lines ran out radially from the center , the seeds would be too crowded near the center and too sparse further out , wasting space and resources . So you decide to curve them , to wrap them around the circle . If you do n't curve enough , you get gaps between the curves . If you curve too much , you run into the next curve . The way to get the most out of the space is to find curves that turn just the right amount and intersect each other at just the right place to put a seed . ( Anything else would leave spaces between the seeds , where one curve hit the other at a non - integer seed position and left a useless gap . ) Take all of those constraints together , and the simplest efficient self - organizing solutions occur when * m * and * n * are ( often consecutive ) Fibonacci numbers and , because these things go hand in hand , when the amount of curvature is related to the golden ratio . ( There are all sort of arrangements of * this * number of curves containing * that * number of elements where those numbers are * not * Fibonacci numbers , but they mostly run into the problem that plants are not very good at math . Fibonacci numbers and various related golden ratios are very simple , but lead to very efficient coverage . A plant that figured this out would suddenly have a huge edge over other plants ; millions of years later most of the plants that exist have * some * sort of simple - but - efficient harmonious relations , often involving Fibonacci numbers . ) mini - tl;dr : When you look at a sunflower you can see some number of clockwise spirals , another number of anti - clockwise spirals ; only when those numbers are Fibonacci numbers do the lines curve in such a way that every seed is the intersection of two curves and unused space is minimized . Looking at it from the other direction , the golden ratio is a simple but efficient principle for self - organizing , and any time it affects the curvature of something there are resonances that occur when the numbers of the elements making up the curve are Fibonacci numbers . These numbers are given * way * too much significance in the popular press , but they do show up - almost always as part of some self - organizing principle - in many parts of nature . Like : it would be useful for plants to stagger their leaves such that they receive as much sunlight as possible . Too far away , there might not be enough leaves to collect the energy the plants need . Too close together , and the higher leaves cast a shadow over the lower leaves . The number , size , and shape of leaves that leads to optimal energy intake are often related to Fibonacci numbers ; the spacing of branches around trunks and leaves around branches is often related to the golden angle . EDIT : Despite the disclaimers in my original comment , a large number of people seem to not just disagree with my words , but to be pissed off by them . Which seems weird , because despite all of the vehemence most of their issues boil down to semantics . It is true that nature does n't ' realize ' that this or that plan will result in an advantage ; the hexagons in honeycombs are n't there because the bees ( or nature ) ' figured out ' that hexagons are the most efficient way to pack a bunch of circular cells together . But hexagons * are * the most efficient way to pack a bunch of circular cells together . The bees are just trying to build as much as they can with the resources they have , something that happens everywhere in nature . That the bees have no idea that their honeycomb is so efficient does n't detract from the fact that the design really * is * efficient . So how is it that bees are building things that match up so well with mathematical ideas about close - packing ? The same process that drives everything in nature : dumb luck . And the way dumb luck helps is that if something has a random mutation that grants it an advantage , that thing 's offspring are more likely to survive . If the advantage is great enough , a few hundred generations down the line anything that * did n't * have that advantage will have died out and that random mutation will have become the norm . Bee colonies that used less efficient shapes for their honeycombs got less work done , had fewer offspring , and stored fewer resources for the winter months . This is a natural process that in no way implies bees are thinking about hexagons , or that nature is ' guiding ' the process in any willful way . The process occurs naturally in the world because efficiency is usually a good thing , given that there are only so many hours in a day and only so much material to work with . The idea that efficient use of resources can result in something that can also be arrived at mathematically is all that is needed for the golden mean to show up in nature , and anywhere the golden mean shows up , Fibonacci numbers show up too , though often only approximately . Some plants have - through dumb luck trial and error , resulting in more efficient ways to do things - stumbled on arrangements of leaves that maximize the amount of leaf surface area that is in the sun while minimizing the amount by which lower leaves are in the shadow of higher leaves . The distribution of leaves that does this for many shapes of leaves and types of stalks / branches often involves the golden mean . The fact that New Age hippies have a bunch of spacey ideas * about * the golden mean - or how other people feel about that - does not alter the fact that it is something that has turned up repeatedly in nature like pi , e , or the square root of 2 .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function)  is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.\nIn statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cram\u00e9r in the 1920s. In optimal control, the loss is the penalty for failing to achieve a desired value. In financial risk management, the function is mapped to a monetary loss.", "label": "hc3human"}

Once they leave it alone the flag stops moving . * \" Astronauts look too well lit from all around , so there must be a lighting rig \" . With no atmosphere , the sunlight is very bright on the moon , and the lunar surface reflects a lot of light . * \" Some of the shadows are in different directions , so lighting rig \" . Shadows on different slopes appear to go in different directions . Examples given are all at the edges of craters etc . , the shadows make sense for the shape of the ground there * \" The little X markers on the camera are sometimes partially obscured , therefore incredibly sloppy photo editing \" . In the examples , the objects ' covering ' the Xes are always white objects in direct sunlight , which would be so bright as to ' white out ' the little markings on the camera . * \" In two photos that are supposed to be taken in different places , they have the exact same hill in the background , so that 's a fake backdrop \" . With no atmosphere to make far away things hazy , it 's not easy to tell a small close object from a large distant object . It 's not actually a nearby hill , it 's a massive mountain miles and miles away , which you would n't expect to change much when viewed from a slightly different location . It 's all this kind of thing , and then they go from that to \" therefore enormous nationwide conspiracy with hundreds of conspirators , none of whom have that good a reason to keep consistently lying for decades \" .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Linux is like play dough . Not play - doh , because its home made in a sense . Anyone can use the linux software recipes for free , but sometimes that s a bit of work . Some people say that s part of the fun . In other words , it means it is the user community that is generating software for itself . There are some companies charging for linux software , but mostly linux is unattractive to them , because someone will just make a free version . How various pieces of software work in linux is wide open ; secret software recipes are frowned upon . This is called \" open source \" or \" free software \" . Windows is more like Lego . Buying software is like buying kits of parts , and everything fits together great . Many other companies make Windows software that you can buy . That usually works very well , but occasionally can have small problems . In fact , anyone can make their own windows software , similar to linux , but it has to interface with Windows and Microsoft can be very secretive about how their system works . Whether this is good or bad depends on who you ask . Windows is called closed source , proprietary or commercial software . Purchased software is too . Mac OS is more like an action figure or doll . Someone -Apple- went to great trouble to design the software and hardware just the way they think is best . All the accessories are company approved , so they fit correctly . Other people can make things for OS X , but they sometimes must seek Apple 's permission , and they have to follow Apple 's strict guidelines . Apple is also closed source ; They are secretive about the inner workings . If you read that in another sense , it shows that linux software is very flexible , but it can be floppy , sloppy and messy - but not all of it is . Some of it is great . Windows software is tailored to certain ideas about how things should click together . Microsoft does nt care * what * you make with it , just as long as you do nt try to change how parts interact . You can buy completed kits , or follow your whims . Apple software is created so that the user gets a certain experience . It can be rigid and perhaps limited(some would say ) , but that means it works very consistently . However , in all the operating systems , many people use some open source software , particularly web browsers like firefox or chrome . Maybe you do too . I 'm a linux user .

{"text": "The simplest way to understand this is through an economic concept called Pareto improvement . Any trade is a Pareto improvement if both parties regard themselves as better off for having made the trade . Imagine buying a hamburger . You prefer having the hamburger to having the $ 2 that it costs ( otherwise you would n't have bought it and would have kept the money ) and the restaurant prefers selling you the hamburger than keeping it ( because they make a profit ) . By buying a hamburger , you have slightly increased the total value of the global economy , by improving the efficiency by which resources are allocated . The same principle applies to the vast majority of trades - if both parties did n't think that they would be made better off for making the trade , then they would n't do it . The vast majority of trades in a functioning economy are Pareto improvements . Every time one of those trades takes place , the total wealth of the world improves slightly , because the underlying resources have been allocated in a way that provides a greater amount of utility . Not all of these transactions are ideal , but they 're better than no transaction at all . Situations in which trades are made with no Pareto improvement are sufficiently unusual that they have a specific name in economics , a \" market failure \" . Examples of market failures include things like monopolies ( where someone can control a market and coerce people into making unfavourable trades ) and pollution ( where a third party is made worse off by an economic activity ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Interest rates do generally affect house prices but other factors do too, especially the unemployment rate. However, everything else being equal, when interest rates drop, it makes the borrowing of money cheaper so tends to stimulate the economy and the housing market, increasing the demand for houses and generally causes house prices to increase (especially if the supply of new housing doesn't increase with the demand). When interest rates go up the opposite happens. Usually interest rates go down in order to stimulate  a slowing economy and interest rates go up to slow down an overheated economy. Regarding your situation you are able to get a 30 year fixed rate at today\u2019s interest rates (in Australia the longest fixed rate you can get is for 10 years and the rate is usually 1 or 2 percent higher than the standard variable rate. Most people here go for the variable rate or a fixed rate of between 1 to 3 years). This means that even if rates do go up in the future you won't be paying a higher rate, which is a positive for you. You are buying the house to live in so as long as you can keep making the repayments you should not be too worried if the price of the house drops sometime in the future, because if your house has dropped and you want to sell to buy another house to live in, then that house would have also dropped relative to yours (give or take). So your main worry is that rates will go up causing both house prices to fall and unemployment to rise, and you yourself losing your job and eventually your house. It is a risk, but what you need to consider is if you can manage that risk. Firstly, I believe rates won't be going up in the US for a number of years, and if and when they do start going up they will most probably start going up slowly. So you have some time on your side. Secondly, what can you do between now and when interest rates do start going up in a few years: Try to put more saving away to increase your safety net from 6 months to 12 months or more, or make extra repayments into your home loan so that you are ahead if things do go wrong. If you are worried that you could lose your job, what can you do to reduce your chances of losing your job or increasing your chances of getting a new job quickly if you do lose it? Improve your current skills, get new skills, become an invaluable employee, or look at possible opportunities to start your own business. Do your own research on the types of houses you are looking at buying, the more houses you look at the better prepared you will be when the right house at the right price comes along, and the less chance that you will be rushed into buying what might be an overpriced house. So to sum it up; do as much research as you can, have an understanding of what your risks are and how you are going to manage those risks.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The decline of the American automobile industry was not helpful , but it was not the primary cause of Detroit 's decline , which started beforehand , and was not reversed or slowed during the 90s SUV boom when the Big 3 were making record profits , increasing their market share , and hiring new workers . Rather , the first major event that caused Detroit to become what it is today was the race riot of 1967 , in which so much of the city was burned that it resembled a war zone , thousands of businesses were looted , snipers took pot shots at white people on the streets , and President Johnson literally had to send in the army with tanks and live ammunition to restore order . The trend of \" white flight \" immediately hit Detroit harder than anywhere else in the nation , as white ( ex-)residents , and many middle - class blacks , understandably , feared for their lives . The shift in racial composition meant that Detroit elected its first black mayor , Coleman Young , in 1973 , and he would continue in that role until 1994 . Unfortunately , Young was an extremist demagogue who was openly hostile to whites , and what remained of the white population quickly left during his tenure , taking almost the entire Detroit property tax base with them , leaving the city unable to pay for basic services like street cleaning , garbage pickup , the fire department , etc . Young also made the main theme of his mayorality harassing , cutting funding for , limiting the operations of , and attempting to sue or prosecute members of the police force . * With the police cowed into submission and most of the force 's veterans intimidated into quitting , criminals could act with impunity , and Detroit quickly gained a reputation as the most dangerous city in America , and was hit harder by the crack epidemic and related gang violence than pretty much anywhere else . Young did nothing to stop this crime wave and only continued his demagogic campaign against the police as it happened . The mayors that followed Young were arguably even worse . Thus , Detroit as it has been for the last 40 years . \\*The Detroit police * were * , in Young 's defense , de facto segregated and notoriously violent and racist , it 's just that Young went much , much too far in the opposite direction . .

And for the record , yes , this is a bit of an oversimplification ( it 's ELI5 ) , and I 'm not claiming that Detroit 's problems started with the 1967 riots , they were more of a turning point after which things only got worse .", "label": "hc3human"}

Prior to his acting career, he obtained a degree in law from the Kyiv National Economic University. He then pursued a career in comedy and created the production company Kvartal 95, which produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series Servant of the People, in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. A political party bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.\nZelenskyy announced his candidacy in the 2019 presidential election on the evening of 31 December 2018, alongside the New Year's Eve address of then-president Petro Poroshenko on the TV channel 1+1. A political outsider, he had already become one of the frontrunners in opinion polls for the election. He won the election with 73.23\u00a0percent of the vote in the second round, defeating Poroshenko. He has positioned himself as an anti-establishment and anti-corruption figure. As president, Zelenskyy has been a proponent of e-government and of unity between the Ukrainian and Russian speaking parts of the country's population.:\u200a11\u201313\u200a His communication style makes extensive use of social media, particularly Instagram.:\u200a7\u201310\u200a His party won a landslide victory in the snap legislative election held shortly after his inauguration as president. During the first two years of his administration, Zelenskyy oversaw the lifting of legal immunity for members of parliament (the Verkhovna Rada), the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic recession, and some limited progress in tackling corruption in Ukraine.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Zelenskyy promised to end Ukraine's protracted conflict with Russia, and he has attempted to engage in dialogue with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[10] His administration faced an escalation of tensions with Russia in 2021, culminating in the launch of an ongoing full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. Zelenskyy's strategy during the Russian military buildup was to calm the Ukrainian populace and assure the international community that Ukraine was not seeking to retaliate.[11] He initially distanced himself from warnings of an imminent war, while also calling for security guarantees and military support from NATO to \"withstand\" the threat.[12] After the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy declared martial law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international praise, and he has been described as a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance.[13][14] Zelenskyy was named the Time Person of the Year for 2022 and opinion polls in Ukraine have ranked him as Ukraine's greatest president.[15][16][17][18]", "label": "hc3human"}

Our drives are arranged in what is generally called a RAID 6 setup ( my system is Solaris , where it 's called raidz2 ) . Our data is set up in disk pools , and each pool can survive up to two drive failures without losing any data at all . Yesterday , a drive in one of these pools failed .

At that point , a spare drive in the system , which had been sitting there just waiting for a failure , was activated . Data automatically started moving to this spare drive from the other drives in the pool . This happened while I was happily asleep in my bed . When I got in yesterday , I saw the failure . For this particular pool , it would take about 24 hours for the array to rebuild itself , copying the data from the other drives to the spare . I got into work about 15 minutes ago to take a look , and this is the status : scan : resilver in progress since Mon Mar 10 07:07:38 2014 45.1 T scanned out of 47.3 T at 520M / s , 1h15 m to go 1.15 T resilvered , 95.25 % done So , in a little more than an hour , I will walk into the computer room , and remove the failed drive .

This new drive will become the new spare drive in the pool , replacing the old spare that is now an integral part of the pool . I will take that failed drive and send it back to the vendor under the maintenance contract we have with them , and they will send me a new drive -- which I will put on the shelf . * * TL;DR -- Extra parity drives in disk arrays allow for a drive failure to not significantly affect system operations or data integrity * *", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "What makes a lawyer more expensive ? His opportunity costs . An expensive lawyer will have more work than he has time , so he raises his billable hour rate until his workload is equal to the amount of time that he 's willing to spend working . In other words , expensive lawyers are * in demand * lawyers . So the real question is , what makes a lawyer in demand ? A lawyer is in demand , and thus charges high billable rates , when the lawyer has established him or herself to be an excellent lawyer . I will use the male pronoun below but let 's be clear , many women are lawyers , and there are just as many excellent women lawyers as male lawyers . 1 . * * Responsiveness * * . An excellent lawyer will be very responsive - you contact him ( by phone , mail , or email ) , and he either responds within 24 hours or he lets you know that he got your message but has n't had time to review it yet ( and then he follows up within a few days and responds to your contact ) . An excellent lawyer does this all the time , for all client communications . 2 . * * Project Management * * . An excellent lawyer can draft a document in one hour that takes average lawyers three hours - and the excellent lawyer will do it at the same quality ( or better ) . An excellent lawyer will know the usual process for things , and will plan out all of the steps for your case in a way that is time efficient - no \" oops forgot that step , we need to put this part on hold until we can do that other step , \" no \" oops I forgot I 'm on vacation that month , we 'll need to reschedule the hearing \" , no \" oh I 'm unprepared I 'll need to get a continuance , \" no \" I 'm not yet finished with your documents but here 's a work - in - progess for you to look at in the meantime . \" 3 . * * Knowledge * * . An excellent lawyer will already have a very strong understanding of his practice area in his head - he 'll remember the important cases , the relevant nuances , which resources are crucial to check . When researching , he will be quickly confirming his understanding of the law , plus perhaps ivnestigating a nuance that is new to him . An excellent lawyer 's research is specifically tailored , precise , and to - the - point . An average lawyer 's research , by contrast , will take longer and involve more irrelevant material . 4 . * * Experience * * . An excellent lawyer will have already spent his time in the trenches , learning at the feet of older attorneys - in other words , an excellent lawyer will have years of experience to draw on when formulating strategy , predicting jury / judge responses , predicting negotiation tactics , etc . 5 . * * Quality * * . An excellent lawyer drafts very tight and technically correct documents for business transactions , prepares persuasive and well - written legal briefs , provides sophisticated and nuanced legal analysis , and is familiar enough with his typical clients that he understands their businesses . An excellent lawyer addresses all of the relevant issues , giving his client all of the necessary information to evaluate the legal strategy . An excellent lawyer 's work is well - written , solidly supported with citations , entirely relevant , and easy to understand ( as much as possible given the complexities of the issues involved ) . 6 . * * Connections / Reputation / Social Standing . * * An excellent lawyer has strong relationships with the other members of the bar , and with practitioners in his field who work in other areas . An excellent lawyer has friendly ( but professional ) relationships with the relevant authorities ( court judges , administrative law judges , regulatory agencies , etc . ) . An excellent lawyer gets along decently with everyone he meets , and does n't make unnecessary enemies . In his long career , he has gotten to know the power players who affect his practice area ( state legislators , governors , attorneys general , etc . ) , and while he wo n't call in favors in a manner that violates his ethical obligations , he will call on those relationships in an effort to find solutions to his clients ' problems without having to file a lawsuit . So what makes an expensive lawyer better ? A combination of all of the things that I outlined above . Not every expensive lawyer has those traits , of course , but those are the things that typically define the best attorneys . You 'll note that I do n't mention success rate or anything like that , mostly because lawyers who possess most of the above traits are going to be more successful than lawyers who do not . While clients may be most interested in \" win rates \" or success stories , the truth is that you want a lawyer who consistently displays as many of the above traits as possible , because that 's the lawyer who will give you the best chance of success . A note on larger firms : many large firms have very high overhead and the billing rates of their attorneys must capture the overhead costs , so those firms set their attorneys ' rates higher than small / mid - sized firm lawyers . Individually , many attorneys at large law firms will have inflated billing rates - if they were trying to practice on their own , or at a smaller firm , they 'd be billing less . Additionally , large firms have spent decades cultivating a brand of only hiring the best lawyers from the best law schools , of requiring their lawyers to work long hours , etc . These firms have pushed the message that the * pedigree * of their attorneys , plus the \" training by fire \" that they give to their attorneys , justify the high billing rates that you see at large firms . But you 'll note that schooling does n't obviously play a big role in some of the factors that I listed above , so there 's definitely an evolving conversation among large firm clients about whether they are overpaying for legal services when they hire large firms . Second note : I have tried to outline reasons why a particular lawyer may bill more than a similar lawyer in the same practice area and in the same geographical market . I 'm not trying to say that every expensive lawyer is a good lawyer - certainly not .

Basically , when you place an object in a liquid / gas ( water ) , it gets pushed back up due to how much volume it displaces . The amount of force pushing the object up is proportional to the density of the liquid / gas and the volume the object displaces .

{"text": "Yes , it does have to do with the shutter speed . Shutter speed is the amount of time the shutter is open which allows light to come in contact with the image sensor ( or film ) . An image becomes blurry when the shutter is open long enough that the object and/or the camera move . A short shutter speed is necessary to get non - blurry action shots ( like sports photos ) . The trade of is that when the shutter is only for a short amount of time only a minimal amount of light comes in contact with the image sensor so you need to have good lighting . Since the vast majority of cameras automatically choose shutter speed , ISO , and other settings you will notice that taking pictures at night often leads to blurry pictures . This is because the camera knows that it will need to leave the shutter open longer to allow more light in and this means you are much more likely to move the camera while the shutter is open , causing a blur . Generally , you will need a tripod for any shutter speeds slower than 1/60th of a second .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It 's a mix between intentionality and philosophy . Picasso famously said : > It took me 4 years to paint like Raphael , but a lifetime to paint like a child . This gives you a window into his philosophy . The artist is putting intentional value on a simplified form of drawing . Asking yourself why this might be is the act of art criticism . Picasso was a founding cubist . He was part of a cultural shift between two ways of looking at art . He wanted to emphasize [ different tools :] ( URL_0 ) > The Cubist painters rejected the inherited concept that art should copy nature , or that they should adopt the traditional techniques of perspective , modeling , and foreshortening . They wanted instead to emphasize the two - dimensionality of the canvas . So they reduced and fractured objects into geometric forms , and then realigned these within a shallow , relieflike space . They also used multiple or contrasting vantage points . If art is about making beauty , Picasso is rewriting the rules with which people usually recognize beauty . This has been pushed even further on march from Modernism ( which started around the age of Van Gogh ) to Post - Modernism ( Pollack and his peers ) . Abstract Expressionism is the genre of art you probably associate with the \" I could do that \" argument . Pollack is the famous one , where he famously splattered paint on canvas . URL_1 Pictures do n't really do this piece justice . You really need to see it in person . When you do , you 'll notice some details . One is that Pollack is using paint somewhat sculpturally . He applies it in thick strands overlaying each other and criss crossing in a material way . Despite this , the impression is that Pollack was controlling this to make the plane of his painting as * flat * as possible . In fact , the entire painting is a lesson in ordered chaos . Despite the seemingly haphazard application , Pollack was surprisingly controlled and thoughtful when making the composition . The tension between the chaos and the order come together to the point where you can appreciate the painting for what it is , not an illusion of a hillside or a projection of the psyche , but as an attempt by a man to make something plainly beautiful in a way that has n't been seen before .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'll try to actually explain it simple terms , because it really is surprisingly simple compared to sports in other countries . Things \" in quotes \" might be unfamiliar phrases . 2 teams , 11 players per team on the field at once . One team is \" in possession \" of the ball at a time . The team with the ball is \" on offense \" . The object of the game is to somehow end up in possession of the ball at the far side of the field , the side the team without the ball ( \" on defense \" ) is trying to protect . The game is not fluid . It is broken up into \" downs \" , essentially single plays . The ball is placed wherever it was at the end of the previous \" down \" . The teams must all be on one side of the ball . The down begins whenever the team on offense decides ( there is a time limit , or \" play clock \" ) . They \" snap \" the ball , which simply means they pick it up ( more to this , I can explain in more detail if you 'd like ) . During a down , a whole lot happens at once , but it 's all to try and achieve the same goal . The team on offense is trying in any way they can to move the ball forward , the team on defense is trying to prevent that . players can run forward holding the ball ( a \" running play \" ) or try to throw the ball to someone ( a \" receiver \" ) who is closer to the goal - zone ( \" endzone \" ) . A down ends when either the ball touches the ground ( in the case of an incomplete pass ) or when someone carrying the ball touches the ground . The game is then essentially paused ( timing is harder to explain ) , and the teams regroup on their side of the ball for the next down . An offense gets 4 downs to try and move the ball 10 yards . If they reach that 10 yard mark , their number of downs get refilled to 4 . If they do n't the other team goes on offense , switching out all of their players . Reaching the other team 's endzone is worth 6 points . If you 're close , but out of downs , you can kick a \" field goal \" by kicking the ball through the posts at the end of the field instead of running or passing it . This is worth 3 points . During a down , the big mess in the middle is called \" the line \" , in which large player from both the offense and the defense try to push each other around . If the defense is pushing forward , they have a better chance to stop the ball from moving forward . If the offense is winning here , they have an easier time simply running the ball straight forward . The rest of the positions involve either running or passing the ball , or defending running or passing the ball . On offense , a \" quarterback \" begins with the ball at the beginning of a down . His skill set almost always includes a strong and accurate throwing arm , so as to complete passes . Sometimes , he is also very fast , and essentially tricks the defense by running the ball forward himself . Behind the quarterback ( or sometimes to his side ) is the \" running back \" . This player is very good at holding on to the ball , and is usually either very fast / quick to elude defenders , or very strong , to essentially push them away . On the edges of the field , away from the line , are \" wide receivers \" . They usually specialize is finding space to run to to catch a pass and/or having sure hands when the pass reaches them . Together , these 3 players are called the \" skill positions \" , because they require some special talent . On defense , there are \" linebackers \" , who , as the name suggests , stand behind the line . They usually judge what the offense is trying to do , and either jump forward to defend against a running play or drop back to defend against a short pass . The rest of the defense , besides the line and the linebackers , are collectively called \" defensive backs \" . There are all sorts of various positions here , but they all do the same thing-- attempt to stop a pass from being completed . I think i covered most of it ... any questions ?", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Zaire ebolavirus, more commonly known as Ebola virus (/i\u02c8bo\u028al\u0259, \u026a-/; EBOV), is one of six known species within the genus Ebolavirus. Four of the six known ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD, and was the cause of the 2013\u20132016 epidemic in western Africa, which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths.\nEbola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus. The virus was renamed \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus, which is assigned to the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The members of the species are called Zaire ebolaviruses. The natural reservoir of Ebola virus is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans through body fluids.\nThe EBOV genome is a single-stranded RNA, approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).[10]\nBecause of its high fatality rate (up to 83 to 90 percent),[11][12] EBOV is also listed as a select agent, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), a US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, US CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group.[citation needed]", "label": "hc3human"}

As workloads have increased , people have become more and more unhappy with Intel 's reluctance to push performance forwards , and their high prices . Intel have gotten away with coasting for so long because AMD ( the only other desktop CPU manufacturer left ) have n't offered any sort of competition . With Ryzen , AMD promised to change that .

{"text": "Say you 've got a pipe that runs into your house , which delivers a bunch of different things to you . You can use that pipe to get movies , play games , read mail , and even buy groceries . The internet is that pipe , and it works on delivery of digital content -- things that do n't exist physically , but only exist on electronics like computers or televisions with internet connections . The way that pipe works now , everything goes through it equally . If I want a movie , it can come through the pipe the same way I can play a game through it , or listen to music through it . The company that sends the material through the pipe can charge me more to get things faster , or by how much stuff I take from the pipe total , but they ca n't charge me based on * what * that stuff is . This is because a large group of adults ( called the FCC ) make sure that companies that control things like these pipes are n't cheating to make themselves more money . This is called * net neutrality * , and it means that all content that goes through the pipe is treated equally , regardless of what it happens to be or who it happens to come from . There are a couple of well known consequences to taking it away . Firstly , the companies can choose to charge you based on * what * you take from the pipe , not just how much . Think about TV channels -- you pay more if you want some channels , like HBO or all the sports channels , then if you just want basic cable . But unlike with TV channels , the internet companies do n't actually pay for any of the material that comes through the pipe -- they just fund the pipe itself . If they can charge you more for some material , they can affect businesses that operate by sending things through the pipe . Netflix , for example , charges money to send movies through the pipe . If on top of that Comcast were to charge money to access Netflix movies , it would make Netflix more expensive , but the extra money would be going to Comcast , not Netflix . You would n't have a choice if you wanted to watch movies , so either you 'd pay more , or you 'd stop watching movies . Further , companies can use it to cheat their services into first place . What if Comcast charged less money to use their video streaming service than Netflix 's ? Then suddenly it 's cheaper to use Comcast , no matter what Netflix does ( even if they make their service free ) . Another downside is that people have gotten accustomed to things coming through the pipe * fast * . This has made it so that if a webpage takes longer than about three seconds to load , the average user will leave the page . Right now , companies that control the pipes can charge you more for faster services -- but all the services are equally faster . What if other companies could pay more to make their services go through the pipe the fastest ? One company like Microsoft might pay Comcast a bunch of money so that while the Apple and Sony websites still load in about 10 seconds , the Microsoft website loads in 2 . PS : Company names are merely for examples , none of these companies have necessarily done any of that , and Comcast does n't have a comparable online streaming service to Netflix at this time .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The best-known types are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term \"intellectual property\" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems.\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.[10]\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\", since an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without its being depleted.[11][page\u00a0needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.[12]", "label": "hc3human"}

Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\nA backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\nMany systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system.\nDefault passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version.[10]\nIn 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.[11]", "label": "hc3human"}

Observers have found that the incredible skills of many \" savants \" reflect an incredible amount of time spent obsessively practicing or memorizing one thing --- like say the calendar --- allowing them to perform impressive feats --- like telling you the day of the week for any date within 1000 years almost instantly . But , there 's another aspect to some Autistic savants . Researchers have found that some savants have reduced activity in the parts of the fore - brain that are responsible for what we usually think of as information processing --- basically the part of the brain that packages information in a way we understand . In you , presumably , this part of the brain takes a bunch of lines drawn on a piece of paper and tells you that it 's , say , a house . If you wanted to draw it later , this part of your brain would remember \" house \" and then try to rebuild the lines from that memory , plus the sensory memories that accompanied it . This is why most people 's drawings of a house are house - like , but hardly photo realistic . In the savant , that first step is suppressed . So they see the lines , but they do n't remember it as \" house , \" they remember it as \" bunch of lines . \" So , later , when they try to draw it , there 's no interference from this organizing principle . They just reproduce the lines , sometimes in an order that would make no sense to a non - savant ( part of the roof , than a corner of a window , then the top half of the door ) , and can reproduce it with startling accuracy .

{"text": "As a person who has had several part time assistants in the past I will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located. If you have an assistant, personal or business, virtual or otherwise, and you don't trust that person with this type of information, get a different assistant.  An assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work. Modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less. Either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else.  An assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful. That being said, there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the Philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country. However, what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong.  If you and your virtual assistant are both located in the US you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong.  I suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs. cost.  If you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings, then find someone in the states to do this work.  Depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a CPA or other licensed/bonded professional.  Yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind. As a side note you might even consider finding a local part-time assistant. This can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think. If you can live without someone being bonded.  (or are willing to pay for the bonding fee) yourself,  depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified EA or other person that wants some after hours work.   If you are in a college town, finance, accounting or legal majors make great assistants.  They will usually work a couple hours a week for \"beer money\", they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate.

{"text": "Diesel is a cut of crude oil vs. gasoline ( petrol ) which is a mix of different cuts of crude oil . Diesel is heavier and more energy dense and has a higher rvp ( Reid vapor pressure ) meaning it does n't ignite as easily as gasoline . When you compare the engines , it 's all about the compression ratio . Because diesel has a higher rvp , it can withstand higher compression which means it can pack more energy per explosion in the engine . This is why Diesel engines do not have spark plugs , they compress until they ignite . Gasoline ca n't withstand the same compression because it would ignite at a lower pressure . This is why you do n't want to mix the fuels in your engine . If you put diesel into a gasoline engine you get too much power when you ignite with spark plugs which can damage the engine . If you put gasoline into a Diesel engine , you get a lot of knocking because it explodes before the engine makes a full cycle . You can have torque ( power ) or you can have velocity ( speed ) . Some trucks use diesel because the compression ratio gives more torque which can be desired when carrying heavy loads .

{"text": "Chemical engineering student here . Just spent a semester studying water purification systems . The problem with contaminated water is there 's suspended solids ( dirt ) , bacteria ( living things ) , salt ( salty water ) , organic compounds ( chemicals that might come from farming ) and heavy metals ( little bits of metal ... kinda ) . I know it 's a little more complicated than that , but this is ELI5 . First of all , boiling the water requires a lot of effort . You have to gather all the logs , start a decent fire , then get the water boiling . It takes a very long time to boil enough drinking water for just a day , and it 's recommended that you boil for at least ten minutes . I do n't think that third world countries would be able to do this on a regular basis . But anyway , if they could , here 's your problem . Boiling for long enough will kill all the nasty living things and removes some types of chemicals . However , it wo n't solve your problems of removing the dirt , the salt or the bits of metal . To remove the dirt , you can let the water stand for an hour or two so that the dirt sinks to the bottom , then pour the cleaner water off . But again , this does n't remove your heavy metals and you 're still stuck with salty water that might still have chemicals in it . That 's about all you can remove through boiling , unless you want to set up a distilling apparatus ( something that collects the steam when the water is boiling and lets it condense somewhere else ) That would remove the heavy metals and the salt , leaving you with near pure water , except if there are chemicals that boil at the same time as water . I think that 's a bit beyond the capabilities of third worlders though . It also requires a * * lot * * of energy .

{"text": "Let 's say you bake bread and I have a dairy cow . Every day you and I trade some amount of your bread for some amount of my milk . This is great , until one day you decide you 're going to take a break from milk for a couple of days ... your orange tree just fruited and you 're going to drink orange juice for awhile . I still want bread , though . So I tell you , \" Hey , listen , we 've been doing business for a long time . If you give me bread like always anyway , then you can let me know anytime and I 'll give you some extra milk whenever you want it . You can give it as a gift or whatever . \" You think that sounds good , so you keep giving me bread , and later when you have your parents visit from out of town , you 'll get some extra milk for them . Now , I 'm in your debt as soon as you give me the bread , until I give you the milk . I maybe traded the milk you would have normally consumed for something else , plus I have your bread . You 're ok with this because you trust that when it comes time for me to make good on giving you extra , I will . Assuming we 're both trustworthy , what has really happened here is nothing more than time - shifting the distribution of goods . Instead of an even trade every day , I get a little more than usual now , and you get a little more than usual later . Everything evens out . Every time we do this kind of a deal , we could track how much bread or milk is owed to the other person by using shells . These shells , in this context , are a form of money . Notice that normally we do n't actually need any money . It 's only when we want to time - shift someone 's production to some later time that we actually have to create money . So in that sense , the total amount of money that exists is a measure of how much is owed . ( If no one owes anyone , we simply leave the shells undisturbed on the beach and do without them . ) You could think of these shells as being a measure of the amount of debt that is owed ... but this is n't quite right . If this was what debt is , then you can clearly see that your question is exactly right ... we ca n't both owe each other money , right ? It just cancels out and we owe each other nothing in that case , and there 's no amount outstanding . But this is n't actually debt . What the shells represent in this example is actually credit . ( Or , if you want to get more complicated , it 's a form of stock really , because you now have \" ownership \" of a small part of my operation ... and that means you have a stake in it . If my dairy cow dies and I ca n't afford to buy a new one , that affects you because you wo n't get that milk you 're owed when your parents come to visit , even though I did get your bread . ) So what 's debt , then ? Let 's say Bob comes along and says , \" Hey , did you know that Sam over the hill makes great wine ? I want some of your milk right now , and in exchange , I will buy you some of his wine and give it to you whenever you want it . \" I say ok , sounds good , so I give you some milk and we collect some shells to symbolize what you now owe me . This is debt . Why is this debt and not credit ? ( Warning : This post is intended to give a visceral understanding for how money works , please do n't think I 'm defining / using legit economic terms here . See here for a bit more explanation - URL_0 ) For one simple reason : Sam never promised to give me or Bob any wine . No one in the entire system has promised to produce anything in exchange for those shells I have . It might be the case that Sam 's wine production is all spoken for ; he has regular customers and they take all he can make everyday , so the only way I can get anything is if somehow he finds a way to bring up his production to give Bob so many shells ' worth . Why would I make this deal with Bob in the first place , then ? Significantly , * I might not ! * If I choose not to let this money be created because I do n't think it 's worth anything because I do n't believe Sam can ever provide me with wine for it , then the market has spoken and demand for Sam 's wine has not been created . Because I know Bob , he 's a good guy , and I 'm willing to say , eh , it 's his problem and I 'll trust him to sort it out when I want that wine . A lot of the time , humans are aspirational , optimistic beings , though , and even the prospect of maybe having that wine is valuable to me and I 'm willing to bet some of my milk on it . It turns out that in any economy , some amount of debt is actually a good thing . It pushes Sam to explore ways to make more wine because he finds out there is an increased demand for his product . It might lead to some winemaking innovations . ( ELI5 warning : Ignore everything in these parens if you 're actually 5 . This is why the emergence of \" investment banking \" is key to the growth of any economy . What investment bankers do is play the role of Bob , creating enough debt for everything that people want . If you read about the history of the United States , you 'll get to the part where the Founding Fathers were arguing about whether to create a Central Bank for the country . Once they did that , they created the conditions for an investment banking industry and the size of the economy exploded because people could suddenly afford to buy whatever anyone could figure out a way to produce . ) However , if there is too much debt for just our three little operations , that means we have given a bunch of our previous production to people like Bob that are n't actually producing anything , and the people that are producing find they ca n't supply enough for their regular customers as well as all those that are owed on behalf of others . If those people that were owed were really planning on having that stuff \u2013 like I might have invited my parents over thinking I 'd have that wine to give them , but now they have to go thirsty \u2013 we might come to a point where I say I really need it and Sam says he does n't have it , and Bob is caught in the middle . ( ELI5 warning : This right here is why the government needs to have some way of regulating investment banking , i.e. , a Central Bank . Investment bankers are happy to keep gambling , creating more and more debt , based only on what people want to buy without any regard for what suppliers can reasonably produce . The answer of the investment banker is always , \" Do n't worry ! If we provide the demand , they 'll figure out a way to provide the supply ! \" Over the long term , when Sam is pushed by big incentives to research ways of making loads of wine , this is completely right ; he 'll eventually find a way to do it if there 's enough shells to collect from people or someone else will . If Sam allows others to step into the wine business , he might soon find himself with more competition than he can handle , so it 's a good idea to take these opportunities when they come up . In the short term , though , if we let investment bankers run wild they 'll create far too much debt way faster than Sam can keep up . Then we get bubbles like the 2008 real estate market crash . This is why the Central Bank was a precursor to investment banking : the Central Bank was the mechanism whereby the govt could regulate and set policy for the entire investment banking industry . ) Notice that when we created debt , we also used shells to represent it . At this point , when we did that , we change what the shells mean . Before , the total amount of shells being held in the entire world represented the total amount of credit in the system . This is a measure of how interdependent people are , how much stake they have in seeing each other succeed . When we used shells to represent debt as well , we have a situation where now the shells represent credit * as well as * how much stuff has been promised to people without consulting the suppliers that actually produce anything , i.e. , credit plus debt . In short , when most of the money out there represents credit , that 's a very good thing because it means a lot of trustworthy people have made promises to each other based on actual plans to meet those obligations . When most of the money represents debt , however , that means a lot of promises have been made with no specific plans to pay them back ... it 's left to the future to figure out how to increase production or otherwise get those items to pay folks back . Like I said , a little debt is good ; a lot ... not so much . But hopefully this also explains how you can have a lot of debt without anyone being the benefactor . If you suddenly get a lot of Bobs that make a lot of promises but do n't produce anything , boom , total debt goes up without anyone being better off .", "label": "hc3human"}

So if your best friend joins Phi Upsilon Kappa ( made up , does n't exist as far as I know ) at All - American University , does n't mean you have to join Phi Upsilon Kappa at your university . In Greek life , you get to meet a lot of people ( especially if you go to a big school like me ) and it makes a big campus feel smaller because you meet people from mixers / raids / invites whatever you want to call them . I 've gotten so many connections for professors , classes , and any help I 've needed . A lot of my best friends are in Greek life , but I also have friends who refuse to be in Greek life and friends who dropped out of Greek life . It 's not like some elite club where you ignore everyone else .

However , the sun also produces light of other colours that are invisible to our eyes . Next to red , there is light that is \" even redder than red \" and likewise there is \" more violet than violet \" . \" Redder than red \" is named infra - red and \" more violet than violet \" is ultra - violet . The light that we can see is harmless . Infrared light makes sunlight warm and enough of it ( e.g. concentrating the light with a magnifying glass ) will make your skin so warm that it is burned . Importantly , * this is not the cause of a sunburn * . It is ultraviolet light that causes sunburn . As the invisible ultraviolet light shines through the skin it actually damages the cells within the skin , in quite a different way compared to heat burn . Burns from ultraviolet light are initially painless ( you do not feel it happening ) and the damage only becomes apparent hours later when your body recognises the damage and initiates a protective reaction to the damage that makes sunburns painful and red . Sunscreen is basically just a paint that lets visible light shine through ( that 's why it 's clear once you apply it ) but very effective at blocking ultraviolet light .

So banks have to decide whether they want to spend more to convenience the customer , or spend less . Most national banks opt for the latter , while hometown banks opt for the former . An additional factor banks have to consider , is that having multiple denominations in an ATM also increases the risk factor for malfunctions . Our ATMs distribute 10s and 20s , and we often have to shutdown ATMs for hours because one or the other jams . ATMs that distribute multiple denominations have more moving parts , as there are multiple \" tapes \" ( plastic containers that hold the money ) that the ATM has to pull from . Another humorous ( read : annoying ) malfunction , is that sometimes the company that refills the money ( most of the time this is n't the bank ) will put the tapes in backwards , which causes more problems . Most ATMs have a failsafe so it wo n't distribute the wrong denominations , but sometimes the ATM does n't catch it , and someone withdraws $ 20 , and gets a $ 10 instead . tl;dr ATMs can distribute any number of different denominations , but banks have to decide if they want to spend more money to provide this convenience .

These are kind of \" ultimate causes \" and pretty general . But we can follow them into more direct causes . For instance , your tissues are getting rigid . Specifically , your arteries .

A margin account can help you \"leverage\" a small amount of capital to make decent profits. Beware, it can also wipe out your capital very quickly. Forex trading is already high-risk. Leveraged Forex trading can be downright speculative.   I'm curious how you arrived at the 96% success ratio. As Jason R has pointed out, 1-2 trades a year for 7 years would only give you 7-14 trades. In order to get a success rate of 96% you would have had to successful exploit this \"irregularity\" at 24 out of 25 times.   I recommend you proceed cautiously. Make the transition from a paper trader to a profit-seeking trader slowly. Use a low leverage ratio until you can make several more successful trades and then slowly increase your leverage as you gain confidence.

{"text": "As already noted, options contain inherent leverage (a multiplier on the profit or loss). The amount of \"leverage\" is dictated primarily by both the options strike relative to the current share price and the time remaining to expiration. Options are a far more difficult investment than stocks because they require that you are right on both the direction and the timing of the future price movement. With a stock, you could choose to buy and hold forever (Buffett style), and even if you are wrong for 5 years, your unrealized losses can suddenly become realized profits if the shares finally start to rise 6 years later. But with options, the profits and losses become very final very quickly. As a professional options trader, the single best piece of advice I can give to investors dabbling in options for the first time is to only purchase significantly ITM (in-the-money) options, for both calls and puts. Do a web search on \"in-the-money options\" to see what calls or puts qualify.  With ITM options, the leverage is still noticeably better than buying/selling the shares outright, but you have a much less chance of losing all your premium. Also, by being fairly deep in-the-money, you reduce the constant bleed in value as you wait for the expected move to happen (the market moves sideways more than people usually expect). Fairly- to deeply-ITM options are the ones that options market-makers like least to trade in, because they offer neither large nor \"easy\" premiums. And options market-makers make their living by selling options to retail investors and other people that want them like you, so connect the dots. By trading only ITM options until you become quite experienced, you are minimizing your chances of being the average sucker (all else equal). Some amateur options investors believe that similar benefits could be obtained by purchasing long-expiration options (like LEAPS for 1+ years) that are not ITM (like ATM or OTM options). The problem here is that your significant time value is bleeding away slowly every day you wait.  With an ITM option, your intrinsic value is not bleeding out at all. Only the relatively smaller time value of the option is at risk. Thus my recommendation to initially deal only in fairly- to deeply-ITM options with expirations of 1-4 months out, depending on how daring you wish to be with your move timing.", "label": "hc3human"}

Fico is strong (assumption). If this is your scenario, please see image. Yellow is important, more debt increases your backend-DTI which is not good for the deal. As long as it's less than 35%, you're okay.  Can someone do this loan, the short answer is yes. It's smart that you want to keep more cash on hand. Which is understandable, if the price of the property declines, you've lost your shirt and your down payment, then it will take close to 10 years to recover your down. Consider that you are buying at a peak in real estate prices. Prices can't go up more than they are now. Consider that properties peaked in 2006, cooled in 2007, and crashed in 2008. Properties declined for more than 25-45% in 2008; regardless of your reasons of not wanting to come to the full 40% down, it's a bit smarter to hold on to cash for other investments purposes. Just incase a recession does hit.  In the end, if you do the deal-You'll pay more in points, a higher rate compared to the 40% down scenario, the origination fee would increase slightly but you'll keep your money on hand to invest elsewhere, perhaps some units that can help with the cashflow of your home. I've highlighted in yellow what the most important factors that will be affected on a lower down payment. If your debt is low or zero, and income is as high as the scenario, with a fico score of at least 680, you can do the deal all day long. These deals are not uncommon in today's market. Rate will vary. Don't pay attention to the rate, the rate will fluctuate based on many variables, but it's a high figure to give you an idea on total cost and monthly payment for qualification purposes, also to look at the DTI requirement for cash/debt.

{"text": "The ELI5 version of this is that it interferes with a plant 's ability to build amino acids . Amino acids are simple ( well , for organic chemistry ) molecules that are combined to form proteins , which are all of the building materials for life . What makes glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup , a clever herbicide is that it only acts on what 's called the \" shikimic acid pathway \" , which is a particular method of synthesizing these amino acids . It turns out that all animals get these particular amino acids from plants in our diet , so glyphosate has no known ill effects in humans - we do n't rely on this particular method for our needs . Why is it considered bad : this is complicated . The easiest criticism to understand is that it 's way , way overused . Essentially , we 're raining death on the plant world increasingly more in production agriculture , simply because it 's so effective . Too much of a good thing . It has a tendency to run off of fields when overused , to the point where we 've been able to see it in aquifers and streams far from fields , where , presumably , it could still kill plants in a high - enough concentration . It 's also greatly linked with Roundup Ready plants , plants which have had their genes modified to be resistant to roundup ( the shikimic acid pathway is modified in such a way as for the glyphosate molecules to no longer be as sticky as they are in non - modified plants , so they ca n't gum up the works and prevent the amino acids from forming ) . For those who oppose GMO plants , Roundup is sort of an enabler for the technology . Monsanto , the company which produces Roundup and Roundup Ready plants , has a long history of not being very responsible in a \" big picture \" sort of way ( e.g. Agent Orange , DDT , and PCBs were products of theirs as one of a number of chemical companies providing these goods ) , and they 've been known to use monopolistic practices in businesses that harm farmers by squeezing their finances from all sides - providing the seeds , providing the Roundup , and ~~owning the grain elevators that take the grain after its grown~~ * * Edit : it was pointed out to me that Monsanto does n't actually own the grain elevators . * * _ Hard to keep track of these sort of things : the agriculture business , like all of corporate America , is full of lots of corporation games . For instance , just parcel out what happened when [ Monsanto merged with Pfizer ] ( URL_0 ) - so far as I can tell , that move spawned 2 new companies as subsidiaries of Pfizer , then a decade later Pfizer sold its controlling interest when things got hairy . Maybe ? Who owns what is hard to track . Mea culpa . _ . Finally , there have been some rumblings that Roundup , or glyphosate more specifically , _ may _ act as a carcinogen in very large enough doses ; the mechanism , as far as I know , is still unknown , but it 's this last that 's put it in the news recently . Still , as a herbicide , you ca n't get much better than Roundup : it kills plants with no known serious harmful effects on the farmers and field workers who use it . It all has to be taken in context - is it better or worse than backbreaking hand - weeding ? Hard to say definitively . tl;dr : much of what is \" wrong \" with Roundup is due to the political and technological environment in which it 's being used - sort of how , say , gasoline is not a villainous liquid , but it _ has been _ a big part of global warming due to how we use it .

{"text": "I'll compare it to a situation that is different, but will involve the same cash flow.  Imagine the buyer agrees that you buy only 70% of the house right now, and the remaining 30% in 7 years time.  It would be obviously fair to pay 70% of today's value today, pay 30% of a reasonable rent for 7 years (because 30% of the house isn't owned by you), then pay 30% of the value that the house has in 7 years time. 30% of the value in 7 years is the same as 30% of the value today, plus 30% of whatever the house gained in value.  Instead you pay 70% of today's value, you pay no rent for the 30% that you don't own, then in 7 years time you pay 30% of today's value, plus 50% of whatever the house gained in value. So you are basically exchanging 30% of seven years rent, plus interest, for 20% of the gain in value over 7 years. Which might be zero. Or might be very little. Or a lot, in which case you are still better off.   Obviously you need to set up a bullet proof contract. A lawyer will also tell you what to put into the contract in case the house burns down and can't be rebuilt, or you add an extension to the home which increases the value.  And keep in mind that this is a good deal if the house doesn't increase in value, but if the house increases in value a lot, you benefit anyway. A paradoxical situation, where the worse the deal turns out to be after 7 years, the better the result for you.

{"text": "The best answer to this is: Read the fine print on your credit card agreement. What is common, at least in the US, is that you can make any charges you want during a time window.  When the date comes around that your statement balance is calculated, you will owe interest on any amount that is showing up as outstanding in your account.  Example...  To revise the example you gave, let's say Jan 1. your account balance was $0. Jan. 3rd you went out and spent $1,000.  Your account statement will be prepared every XX days... usually 30. So if your last statement was Dec. 27th, you can expect your next statement to be prepared ~Jan.24 or Jan. 27.  To be safe, (i.e. not accrue any interest charges) you will want to make sure that your balance shows $0 when your statement is next prepared.  So back to the example you gave--if your balance showed $1,000... and you paid it off, but then charged $2,000 to it... so that there was now a new set of $2,000 charges in your account, then the bank would begin charging you interest when your next statement was prepared.  Note that there are some cards that give you a certain number of days to pay off charges before accruing interest... it just goes back to my saying \"the best answer is read the fine print on your card agreement.\"", "label": "hc3human"}

This can include hospital transfers , patient transport to diagnostic centers , and a host of other medical transport needs . Your city might have a contract with Company A for 911 services , but Company B and Company C compete for IFT services . or Your city might provide 911 EMS through the Fire Department and allow Companies A , B , and C to compete for IFT . To give you an example of how it can vary town to town : I volunteer at a local volunteer corp that is contracted to the town for 911 services . We respond to emergency calls and can provide basic life support ( BLS ) . We in turn , however , contract with a 3rd party private ambulance company to provide us a Paramedic who can operate a higher level ( Advanced Life Support - ALS ) .

{"text": "There absolutely is a specific model that makes this so popular with so many credit card companies, and that model is \"per transaction fees\". Card companies also receive cost-sharing incentives from certain merchants. There is also a psychological reasoning as an additional incentive. When you want to accept credit cards as a source of payment as a business, you generally have three kinds of fees to pay: monthly/yearly subscription fees, percentage of transaction fee, and per transaction fee.  The subscription fees can be waived and sometimes are expressed as a \"minimum cost\", so the business pays a certain amount whether you actually have people use credit cards or not. Many of these fees don't actually make it to the credit card companies, as they just pay the service providers and middle-men processing companies. The percentage of transaction fee means that the business accepting payment via credit card must pay a percentage usually ranging from 1-3% of the total transactions they accept. So if they get paid $10,000 a month by customers in the form of credit cards, the business pays out $100-300 a month to the credit card processor - a good portion of which will make it back to the credit card issuing company, and is a major source of income for them. The per transaction fee means that every time a transaction is run involving a card, a set fee is incurred by the business (which is commonly anywhere from $0.05 to $0.30 per transaction). If that $10,000 a month business mentioned previously had 10 customers paying $1,000 each at $0.10 a transaction, that's only $1 in fees to the credit card processors/companies. But if instead that business was a grocery store with an average transaction of $40, that's $25 in fees.  This system means that if you are a credit card company and want to encourage people to make a specific kind of purchase, you should encourage purchases that people make many times for relatively small amounts of money. In a perfect world you'd want them to buy $1 bottles of water 5 times a day with their credit card. If the card company had 50,000 card holders doing this, at the end of 1 year the company would have $91,250,000 spread across 91,250,000 transactions. The card company might reasonably make $0.05 per transaction and %1 of the purchase total. The Get Rewarded For Drinking More campaign might earn the card company $912,500 in percentage fees and over $4.5 million in transaction fees. Yet the company would only have to pay 3% in rewards from the percentage fees, or $2.7 million, back to customers. If the card company had encouraged using your credit card for large once-yearly purchases, they would actually pay out more money in rewards than they collect in card-use fees. Yet by encouraging people to make small transactions very often the card company earns a nice net-income even if absolutely every customer pays their balance in full, on time, and pays no annual/monthly fees for their card - which obviously does not happen in the real world. No wonder companies try so hard to encourage you to use your card all the time! For card companies to make real money they need you to use your credit card. As discussed above, the more often you use the card the better (for them), and there can be a built-in preference for small repeated transactions. But no matter what the size of transaction, they can't make the big bucks if you don't use the card at all! Selling your personal information isn't as profitable if they don't have in-depth info on you to sell, either. So how do they get you to make that plastic sing? Gas and groceries are a habit. Most people buy one or the other at least once a weak, and a very large number of us make such purchases multiple times a week. Some people even make such purchases multiple times a day! So how do people pay for such transactions? The goal of the card companies is to have you use their product to pay as much as possible. If you pay for something regularly you'll keep that card in your wallet with you, rather than it getting lost in a drawer at home. So the card companies want you to use your card as a matter of habit, too. If you use a card to buy for gas and groceries, why wouldn't you use it for other things too? Lunch, dinner, buying online? If the card company pays out more and makes less for large, less-regular purchases, then the ideal for them is to have you use the card for small regular purchase and yet still have you use the card for larger infrequent purchases even if you get reduced/no rewards. What better way to achieve all these goals than to offer special rewards on gas and groceries? And because it's not a one-time purchase, you aren't so likely to game the system; no getting that special 5% cash-back card, booking your once-per-decade dream vacation, then paying it off and cancelling it soon after - which would actually make the card company lose money on the deal. In the end, credit card companies as a whole have a business model that almost universally prefers customers who use their products regularly and preferably for small amounts a maximum number of times. They want to reduce their expenses (like rewards paid out) while maximizing their revenue. They haven't figured out a better way to do all of this so well as to encourage people to use their cards for gas and groceries - everything else seems like a losing proposition in comparison. The only time this preference differs is when they can avoid paying some or all of the cost of rewards, such as when the merchants themselves honor the rewards in exchange for reduced or zero payment from the card companies. So if you use an airline card that seems to give you 10% back in airline rewards? Well, that's probably a great deal for the card company if the airline provides that reward at their own expense to try to boost business. The card company keeps the transaction-related fees and pays out almost nothing in rewards - the perfect offer (for them)!  And this assumes no shenanigans like black-out periods, \"not valid with any other offers\" rewards like on cars where only a fool pays full MSRP (and sometimes the rewards are tagged in this sort of way, like not valid on sale/clearance items, etc), expiring rewards, the fact that they know not everyone uses their rewards, annual fees that are greater than the rewards you'll actually be obtaining after accounting for all the other issues, etc. And credit card industries are known for their shenanigans!", "label": "hc3human"}

So you have  But you want to know what you have in EUR, not USD.  So if I ask Google how much $845.81 is in EUR, it says \u20ac708,89.  That's even lower than what you're seeing.   It looks like USD has fallen in value relative to EUR.  So while the stock price has increased in dollar terms, it has fallen in euro terms.  As a result, the value that you would get in euros if you sold the stock has fallen from the price that you paid.   Another way of thinking about this is that your price per share was \u20ac101,72 and is now \u20ac101,33.  That's actually a small drop.   When you buy and sell in a different currency that you don't actually want, you add the currency risk to your normal risk.  Maybe that's what you want to do.  Or maybe you would be better off sticking to euro-denominated investments.   Usually you'd do dollar-denominated investments if some of your spending was in dollars.  Then if the dollar goes up relative to the euro, your investment goes up with it.  So you can cash out and make your purchases in dollars without adding extra money.   If you make all your purchases in euros, I would normally recommend that you stick to euro-denominated investments.  The underlying asset might be in the US, but your fund could still be in Europe and list in euros.   That's not to say that you can't buy dollar-denominated investments with euros.  Clearly you can.  It's just that it adds currency risk to the other risks of the investment.  Unless you deliberately want to bet that USD will rise relative to EUR, you might not want to do that.   Note that USD may rise over the weekend and put you back in the black.  For that matter, even if USD continues to fall relative to the EUR, the security might rise more than that.  I have no opinion on the value of VBR.  I don't actually know what that is, as it doesn't matter for the points I was making.  I'm not saying to sell it immediately.

{"text": "Intuitive? I doubt it. Derivatives are not the simplest thing to understand.  The price is either in the money or it isn't. (by the way, exactly 'at the money' is not 'in the money.') An option that's not in the money has time value only. As the price rises, and the option is more and more in the money, the time value drops. We have a $40 stock. It makes sense to me that a $40 strike price is all just a bet the stock will rise, there's no intrinsic value. The option prices at about $4.00 for one year out, with 25% volatility. But the strike of $30 is at $10.68, with $10 in the money and only .68 in time premium. There's a great calculator on line to tinker with.  Volatility is a key component of options trading. Think about it. If a stock rises 5%/yr but rarely goes up any more or less, just steady up, why would you even buy an option that was even 10% out of the money? The only way I can describe this is to look at a bell curve and how there's a 1/6 chance the event will be above one standard deviation. If that standard deviation is small, the chance of hitting the higher strikes is also small.  I wrote an article Betting on Apple at 9 to 2 in which I describe how a pair of option trades was set up so that a 35% rise in Apple stock would return 354% and Apple had two years to reach its target. I offer this as an example of options trading not being theory, but something that many are engaged in. What I found curious about the trade was that Apple's volatility was high enough that a 35% move didn't seem like the 4.5 to 1 risk the market said it was. As of today, Apple needs to rise 13% in the next 10 months for the trade to pay off.

{"text": "To answer your original question: There is proof out there. Here is a paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that might be worth a read.  It has a lot of references to other publications that might help answer your question(s) about TA.  You can probably read the whole article then research some of the other ones listed there to come up with a conclusion.  Below are some excerpts:  Abstract: This article introduces the subject of technical analysis in the foreign exchange market, with emphasis on its importance for questions of market efficiency.  \u201cTechnicians\u201d view their craft, the study of price patterns, as exploiting traders\u2019 psychological regularities.  The literature on technical analysis has established that simple technical trading rules on dollar exchange rates provided 15 years of positive, risk-adjusted returns during the 1970s and 80s before those returns were extinguished.  More recently, more complex and less studied rules have produced    more modest returns for a similar length of time.  Conventional explanations that rely on risk adjustment and/or central bank intervention do not plausibly justify the observed excess returns from following simple technical trading rules.  Psychological biases, however, could contribute to the profitability of these rules. We view the observed pattern of excess returns to technical trading rules as being consistent with an adaptive markets view of the world.    and  The widespread use of technical analysis in foreign exchange (and   other) markets is puzzling because it implies  that either traders are   irrationally making decisions on useless information or that past   prices contain useful  information for trading.  The latter   possibility would contradict the \u201cefficient markets hypothesis,\u201d   which holds that  no trading strategy should be able to generate   unusual profits on publicly available information\u2014such as past    prices\u2014except by bearing unusual risk. And the observed  level of   risk-adjusted profitability measures market  (in)efficiency. Therefore   much research effort has been directed toward determining whether   technical analysis is  indeed profitable or not. One of the earliest   studies, by Fama and Blume (1966), found no evidence that a particular   class of TTRs could earn abnormal profits in the stock market.   However, more recent research by Brock,  Lakonishok and LeBaron (1992)   and Sullivan, Timmermann an d White (1999) has provided contrary   evidence. And  many studies of the foreign exchange market have found   evidence that TTRs can generate persistent profits (Poole  6  (1967),   Dooley and Shafer (1984), Sweeney (1986), Levich and Thomas (1993),   Neely, Weller and Dittmar (1997),  Gen\u00e7ay (1999), Lee, Gleason and   Mathur (2001) and Martin (2001)).", "label": "hc3human"}

The ship is destroyed in the second novel and makes no further appearances.\nClarke and Kubrick developed the first novel and film in parallel, but there were some differences to suit the different media.  Kubrick dropped the cooling fins of the ship, fearing they would be interpreted as wings.  The itinerary of Discovery One in the book is from Earth orbit via gravitational slingshot around Jupiter to Saturn and parking orbit around the moon Iapetus.  Kubrick changed this to the simpler route from Earth to Jupiter's moon Europa.\nFor the film, Kubrick built an exceptionally large model of the ship so that focus changes did not give away the true small size to the audience.

{"text": "There are two separate questions here - why and how . I think the ' why ' is fairly obvious - there are some pretty horrific methods of warfare and ways of carrying out violence . In the past it was simply accepted that as an army passed through an area it would rape , loot and steal everything not nailed down , prisoners taken would be tortured and forced to work or fight for the enemy . This largely is no longer the case . Chemical and biological weapons are more or less unused , certainly by major powers , as are mines and cluster weapons . We consider these things too horrific or non - specific - that is , they mostly target innocent civilians . There was no such thing as a war crime before the 20th century - now we have a somewhat functional justice system capable of holding people to account for their actions during war . As to how these laws are enforced - it 's entirely possible . More or less by mutual agreement , gas weapons were never used in world war 2 . Chemical weapons have never ( with the arguable exception of Vietnam , but that was officially ' deforestation ' ) been used in open conflict without the total condemnation of the international community , similarly with biological agents . It works because the amount of damage using such a weapon would do to a country 's diplomatic prospects ( trade sanctions , general mistrust from other countries , maybe even war ) is just not worth the risk . Often these ' non - conventional ' weapons , warfare targeting the civilian population , and similar strategies are used in response to the other side using them . So by taking them off the table entirely , countries no longer need to stock up on chemical or biological weapons in the first place because they know with fair certainty that nobody else is either .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The blue line is illustrating the net profit or loss the investor will realise according to how the price of the underlying asset settles at expiry. The x-axis represents the underlying asset price.  The y-axis represents the profit or loss. In the first case, the investor has a \"naked put write\" position, having sold a put option.  The strike price of the put is marked as \"A\" on the x-axis.  The maximum profit possible is equal to the total premium received when the option contract was sold.  This is represented by that portion of the blue line that is horizontal and extending from the point above that point marked \"A\" on the x-axis.  This corresponds to the case that the price of the underlying asset settles at or above the strike price on the day of expiry.  If the underlying asset settles at a price less than the strike price on the day of expiry, then the option with be \"in the money\".  Therefore the net settlement value will move from a profit to a loss, depending on how far in the money the option is upon expiry.  This is represented by the diagonal line moving from above the \"A\" point on the x-axis and moving from a profit to a loss on the y-axis.  The diagonal line crosses the x-axis at the point where the underlying asset price is equal to \"A\" minus the original premium rate at which the option was written - i.e., net profit = zero.  In the second case, the investor has sold a put option with a strike price of \"B\" and purchase a put option with a strike price \"A\", where A is less than B.  Here, the reasoning is similar to the first example, however since a put option has been purchase this will limit the potential losses should the underlying asset move down strongly in value. The horizontal line above the x-axis marks the maximum profit while the horizontal line below the x-axis marks the maximum loss. Note that the horizontal line above the x-axis is closer to the x-axis that is the horizontal line below the x-axis.  This is because the maximum profit is equal to the premium received for selling the put option minus the premium payed for buying the put option at a lower strike price.  Losses are limited since any loss in excess of the strike price \"A\" plus the premium payed for the put purchased at a strike price of \"A\" is covered by the profit made on the purchased put option at a strike price of \"A\".", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "For simplicity, let's start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I'll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn't affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the \"refund\" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule that the IRS is OK with. It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles- the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income. However, I would not go out of my way to abuse this \"loophole\". Typically, things like travel (airfare, hotel, car rental, meals) are expected. But I wouldn't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you. The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received. (Or more realistically, negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check.) Part 3: Would there be any difference between credit card points and brand-loyalty points? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company's loyalty system (not a CC), would that yield a different result? There is no difference. Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity, you can't call that a \"donation\" of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement. Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work, and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them, but it ends up being a wash.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "In finance, form is function, and while a reason for a trade could be anything, but since the result of a trade is a change in value, it could be presumed that one seeks to receive a change in value. Stock company There may have been more esoteric examples, but currently, possession of a company (total ownership of its' assets actually) is delineated by percentage or a glorified \"banknote\" frequently called a \"share\".  Percentage companies are usually sole proprietorship and partnerships, but partnerships can now trade in \"units\".  Share companies are usually corporations. With shares, a company can be divided into almost totally indistinguishable units.  This allows for more flexible ownership, so individuals can trade them without having to change the company contract. Considering the ease of trade, it could be assumed that common stock contract provisions were formulated to provide for such an ease. Motivation to trade This could be anything, but it seems those with the largest ownership of common stock have lots of wealth, so it could be assumed that people at least want to own stocks to own wealth. Shorting might be a little harder to reason, but I personally assume that the motivation to trade is still to increase wealth. Social benefit of the stock market Assuming that ownership in a company is socially valuable and that the total value of ownership is proportional to the social value provided, the social benefit of a stock market is that it provided the means to scale ownership through convenience, speed, and reliability.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The important thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't breathe through their mouths like us ; they do n't even have lungs . They have tiny holes in their exoskeleton which allows oxygen into system of tubes , which carry oxygen to their organs . With that in mind , let 's think about what happens when something increases in size . Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In other words , volume and surface area increase by different rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It has a volume of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides , 4 sq ft per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times * , but the surface area only increased by * four * . 3x3x3 ? Volume of 27 , surface area of 54 . The volume more than tripled , whereas the surface area roughly doubled . Now , the point here is that * volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That means that there 's more organs and whatnot , all of which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen available , though , depends on * surface area * . Insects get oxygen from their skin , so to increase their oxygen intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You ca n't add more holes in the exoskeleton to increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because that makes the exoskeleton weaker . The exoskeleton is * already * under extra strain trying to support the increased weight , so that wo n't work . This means that there 's essentially a point where an insect ca n't grow any bigger , because it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) to make up for the increased volume / weight ( need for oxygen ) . For more evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be much bigger millions and millions of years ago during dinosaur times . The atmosphere was richer in oxygen back then , so it makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

The Americans used the war as political leverage to leapfrog England into the pre - eminent position of power in the western world , and Germany was once again saddled with heavy punishment and reparation payments ( which they 're still making to this day ) . Japan got nuked and suffered from permanent military occupation by the Americans ( which still goes on to this day ) . Russia got their ass kicked in the first half of the war , but rebounded strongly enough to make them a superpower in their own right . The Americans absolutely hated that , which led to a long period of uneasy relations between the US and Russia which we now call the Cold War ( which , in a way , is also still going on to this day ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Current account offers a lot of benefits for sole proprietors. Think of it like bank account for a company. The bank provides a host of facilities for the company. A sole proprietor does not have enough value as that of a company for a bank but needs similar services. Thus Indian banks offer a toned down version of the account offered to a company. Current account offer very good overdraft ( withdrawing money even if balance is zero). This feature is very useful as  business cycles and payment schedules can be different for each supplier/customer the sole proprietor does business with. Imagine the sole proprietor account has balance of zero on day 0. customer X made payment by cheque on day 1. Cheques will get credited only on Day 3 (Assume Day 2 is a national holiday or weekend).  Sole proprietor gave a cheque to his supplier on day 0. The supplier deposited the cheque on Day 0 and the sole proprietor's bank will debit the the proprietor's account on day 1. As customer's cheque will get credited only day 3, the overdraft facility will let the proprietor borrow from the bank Interestingly, current accounts were offered long before Indian banks started  offering customized accounts to corporate customers. The payment schedule mentioned in my example is based on a clearing system > 10 years ago.

{"text": "Been playing since launch day , I can try to sum up what I notice a lot of people have problems with : * Always - On DRM - You have to be online ( which means their servers have to be up ) to play , even when playing alone . A lot of people dislike this , but now that the mad dash has pretty much subsided , outside of server maintenance , the server up - time is pretty good . Personally , it 's been very rare that I 've been unable to play due to server outages . * HUGE lack of consistency between what players thought they were getting and what they got - There were TONS of leaked videos , sponsored events hinting at gameplay features , even things in the beta , that were pulled from the final release . A lot of players think these features would 've helped make the game far more enjoyable . * Hyper - Linear gameplay - Pretty much the entire game is focused around a linear story . There are almost no side quests outside of optional \" events \" that really bear no meaning and have little in the way of rewards . You 're forced to play through the story over and over , even if all you want to do is go kill a boss to farm loot . In a game that 's endgame is 100 % farming , this gets old . Fast . It 's made worse by the fact that you 're forced to say in one section ( \" Act \" ) of the game at a time . You ca n't teleport between areas in the same way you could in Diablo 2 . * An unspoken but very visible push by blizzard to drive users to the auction house - Blizzard implemented an auction house in - game for users to buy and sell gear . While a great idea in theory , the execution has been terrible . Blizzard takes a percentage cut of both in - game gold and real money ( there are two separate auction houses , one which operates on in - game money and another that works off real world cash ) . Due to the obvious business desire to have players buying things off the auction house , many players feel a lot of changes are being made to push users towards the AH and away from farming ( things like nerfing popular farming routes , constant forum suggestions to \" go to the AH if you need better gear \" instead of farming it for yourself , etc ) . * Auction House implementation - To be frank , it 's complete garbage . You 're very limited in the number of attributes you can search for on your items ( you can only select 3 at a time , when any item worth buying for end - game needs to match 5 - 6 criteria ) . There are filters missing for some stats , even some that are extremely sought after , meaning you need to search through page after page of garbage gear that * almost * meets your needs in order to find something . This comes back to the previous bullet point : An earlier screenshot released prior to the launch showed a completely different AH UI that was vastly superior in every way shape and form to the one in - game today , which shows that someone , somewhere down the line made the conscious decision to nerf the UI intentionally . Blizzard has been extremely quiet about complaints to this effect , which is n't helping matters . * Blizzard patching things that seem to be far less game - breaking than what the community is seeing - Blizzard is fixing random bugs here or there , toying around with drop rates for end - game level gear , and making minor UI changes to menus , while the AH remains untouched , the game still feels annoyingly repetitive ( even for Diablo ) , and a lot of things just feel unpolished . * The story - Oh . My . God . The story is awful . Just , comically bad . Blizzard has never been known to be the world 's best story - tellers , but the cartoonish behavior of the main villians in this game just adds on to the poor voice - acting , random yet utterly predictable plot turns , and pointless errand - boy tasks the player is asked to perform . Over - all , the game was overhyped , which lead to a lot of really high expectations . I have faith that Blizzard will eventually get their shit together on this ( The launch - date Diablo 2 was HORRIBLE compared to what it is today ) , and nostalgia can be blamed for a lot of what players do n't like , but the game really does feel unpolished and goofy .", "label": "hc3human"}

In the novels , his back story is that he is born within one of the worst prisons in the world , somewhere in South America , and is made to serve out the remainder of his dead father 's life sentence . Throughout the time he was imprisoned in this hellhole , he develops on his natural abilities : he becomes extremely intelligent , reading eveything he finds , and gets hench and becomes awesome at fighting . Notably , throughout his time in prison his dreams get plagued by an image of a bat . After becoming essentially the ' badass ' of this prison , he gets chosen to become a test subject for an experimental drug called ' Venom ' . Once taken , Bane becomes insanely strong and powerful , but has to take it every twelve hours or he suffers from intense withdrawal effects . In the Knightfall storyline ( which TDKR is loosely based on ) , he escapes the prison and heads to Gotham City . He does this because he wants to destroy Batman - he is fascinated by him because like in prison , Gotham is ruled by fear , only it is fear of Batman and not Bane . He also believes Batman is a bat from his nightmares and believes it is fate that he must fight Batman . He then breaks open Arkham Asylum , unleashing all the supervillains , and Batman is forced to run himself ragged trying to capture them all . When Batman is on his last legs , Bane emerges , breaks his back , and essentially takes over Gotham City . Oh yeah , and Bane works out Batman = Bruce Wayne before they battle . Now in the movie TDKR , they change it around a bit . Bane 's mask supplies him with anesthetic rather than venom ( presumably to make the film more ' realistic ' ) . His motivation is different also ; it is revealed that he was actually Talia Al - Ghul 's accomplice and his whole scheme was actually part of the League of Shadows . This kind of spoiled the movie a bit for me as once this is revealed Bane seems less menacing .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In computability theory, the Church\u2013Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the  Turing\u2013Church thesis, the Church\u2013Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:\nChurch, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is \u03bb-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).\nOn the other hand, the Church\u2013Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.\nSince its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church\u2013Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).", "label": "hc3human"}

After all , why pay for the insurance when I 'm healthy if can just buy insurance if I start to feel sick ? Because fewer healthy people are signing up ( people who would be cheaper for the insurance company ) and the sick ones are still able to ( expensive ) , the average expenditures the insurance company has to make for each person goes up .

{"text": "It was n't always . Back in the ' 50s the US was generally less supportive than western European democracies like the UK and France . The initial wave of support came from Cold War politics . Whenever the Soviets gained a client the US immediately sought to gain clients to counter balance and if possible to pry the Soviet client back out of the Soviet sphere . So when nations in the Middle East started to buy equipment from the USSR we tried to sell to them as well ( Iraq and Egypt ) and to make alliances in the area . Israel as a western style parliamentary democracy with a large western population was a natural fit as an ally . Once the basic relationship was established several other factors have continued it . First - The continued need for allies in the area . And while there are a number of downsides to siding with Israel ( like generally pissing off everyone else in the region ) , there are good reasons to stay with them . Not least is to prove to other allies across the world that we 'll stick with them . So we stick with them to show to countries like Japan and South Korea that we are the type that will stick with them even if China or Russia starts something with them . And Israel has generally been a pretty good ally for the US . Second - There is a huge Jewish population in the US . In general they support Israel and lobby hard for it . This is even when they disagree with some specific Israeli policies . The idea of maintaining a specifically Jewish nation and homeland is viewed as something that would help should another Holocaust or other lesser pogrom happen again . Israel would in such a case act as both a refuge and someone who could act in international forums . So even when they disagree with Israeli policies , the concept and fact of Israel is enough to maintain their support . Third - The Evangelical Christians also strongly support Israel . This is generally for doctrinal reasons , mostly to do with the predicted second coming . Millennial prophesies ( as they interpret them ) require an Israeli state . And this also goes for groups that are n't in the normal Evangelical fold like Mormons . It also influences other non - millennial groups who see their other Christian neighbors supporting Israel and join in ... without quite knowing why . This support is also largely independent of any specific Israeli policy . Fourth - There is n't a large Palastinian , Arab , or Muslim minority in the US . So when the other two groups lobby or otherwise pressure the government to support Israel there is n't much of another side to oppose it . So one side provides funding and votes to the politicians and the other does n't .

A 10 mm is more powerful than a 9 mm , partly because it makes a bigger hole , but also because it 's heavier and hits you harder . Those are both measured in millimeters . For other calibers we measure in inches . Common ones include .22 , .38 , .357 , .40 , and .45 . Any time you see a decimal in front , it 's an inches measurement . Everything I 've listed so far is a pistol caliber . ( Well , mainly , .22 is also used in rifles , and any pistol caliber can be used in a \" carbine \" which is basically a rifle using a bullet mainly used for pistols . ) By and large , bigger is more powerful , but an exception is that .357 is more powerful than .38 . The reason is that .357 cartridges have a lot more gunpowder , so the bullet goes faster . More energy , more impact . Which brings us to rifles . Most rifle cartridges have lot more gunpowder than pistol cartridges . You have that long rifle barrel , and with lots of gunpowder you can accelerate the bullet the whole way . If you used that much gunpowder from a pistol , a lot of it would burn after the bullet leaves the muzzle , making a big flash and a lot of noise but not pushing your bullet that much more . So generally rifle calibers are a lot more powerful even though they might be smaller . The military uses .223 , almost the same size as .22 but it goes way faster and will do a lot more damage . ( Actually they use 5.56 mm , almost the same but with slightly different specs ... but any 5.56 rifle can fire .223 . ) And of course you can shoot a lot farther with rifles . .308 is a bigger rifle cartridge , better at penetrating cover and shooting long - range . It 's the smallest rifle caliber commonly used by snipers . Shotguns are completely different . The common sizes are 12 - gauge and 20 - gauge , and the 12 - gauge is bigger . The measurement works like this : take a lead ball that just fits inside the barrel . How many lead balls do you need to make a pound of lead ? That 's the gauge .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The Globe and Mail has an interesting article on what you can do with your RRSPs. Be aware that the article is from early 2011 and rules change. They describe holding your own mortgage inside your RRSP. That is, if you have $100,000 inside your RRSP already and your remaining mortgage is $100,000, you can use that money to pay off your mortgage, then pay back the money at interest, generating a tax-deferred profit inside your RRSP. That approach may be viable, though you'd want to talk to your accountant first. I'd be very cautious about loaning money to someone else for a second mortgage using my RRSP, though. Second mortgages are inherently risky, so this is a very speculative investment. Once you make an RRSP contribution, that space is used up (barring a couple of exceptions such as the life-long learning plan). So, let's say you used $100,000 of your RRSP to loan to someone for a second mortgage. Any interest payments should be sheltered inside the RRSP (substantial benefit), but if the person defaults on the second mortgage (which you should expect to be a significant possibility), you've lost your entire $100,000 contribution room (as well as, obviously, the $100,000 that you loaned out). I can't tell you whether or not it makes sense to invest in risky second-mortgage loans and I can't tell you whether, if you choose to do so, it definitely should be done inside an RRSP. There are substantial risks in the loan and there are both costs and benefits to doing so inside an RRSP.

{"text": "A Turing machine is * not * in a CPU and it does * not * manipulate binary data . It is important to not start with false assumptions , I think . :-) A Turing machine is more like a rule - based game than a physical toy . Think of it like the game Solitaire . You start with a deck of shuffled cards and lay them out according to the rules of the game . This is one part of the Turing machine , which we call the input . The next part of the Turing machine is the end state --- this describes the conditions when the game has ended . In Solitaire you win by getting all your cards into numerical ordered columns ; and you lose by getting through all your cards without managing to do this , so you have no further options . The third important part of the Turing machine is the rules of the game : at each stage it tells you which moves you can make . In some types of game there are several moves you can make at each step , and it 's a matter of the player to choose . Others there is no choice and the fun of the game comes from having it unfold in front of you even though you ca n't affect the outcome . The Turing machine was invented to make formal the notion of rules and processes . The question that Alan Turing wanted to answer was about the \" end game \" . Is it possible to know whether you will win a game of Solitaire without playing the game of Solitaire ? Could you be stuck in an endless loop if there was no way to lose , only to win ? In the process of answering this question he realised that he could write down each of his Turing machines as a grouping of symbols , like { input , rules , end conditions } and that would be a complete definition of that Turing machine . This would be the ultimate formal definition of Solitaire , or whatever . But once you 've got a definition of a Turing machine as a series of symbols , you can feed that to a Turing machines whose rules tell it how to recognise symbols . So let 's say I have a Turing machine called SolTM = { input deck , Solitaire rules , end conditions } . And I have a new one called UTM = { input TM , rules , end conditions } . If I manipulate SolTM using the rules defined in UTM then I am making the UTM _ act like SolTM _ . This is the essence of Alan Turing 's _ Universal Turing Machine _ , a device that can pretend to be other devices if given a description of how they work . I appreciate this may be some pretty hairy stuff , and over the heads of most 25 year - olds :-) but it 's also the foundations of our understanding of computation , ie the question of \" mechanically \" producing an output from input+rules .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "\" when \" is complicated : in modern cars , the engine control unit ( a specialised computer that controls all the functions of the car related to the core functions of being a car , rather than ones like running a satnav or the stereo ) monitors speed , the engine RPM and the position of the gear selector at a minimum , and potentially a whole bunch of other factors like tyre grip , to select the most appropriate gear ratio for the current conditions . In older cars ( without a computer - controlled transmission ) , the number of sensors monitored was smaller ( usually just the three mentioned above , or even just RPM and selector position if the transmission does n't skip gears , which is a fair assumption ) and they were monitored with mechanical sensors which would operate either relay logic or very simple discrete logic . ECUs have been around for a long time , however : anything after about ' 95 will probably have one , unless it 's a land rover or something else designed to work After The End . In both cases , after the selection logic has done its ' thing , the mechanism to actually select gears is pretty much the same : most automatic gearboxes use a system called a \" planetary gearbox \" , where there are three sets of gears : an outer pawl ( toothed track , like the reverse of a gear ) , a \" planet carrier \" with a number of identically - sized \" planet gears \" spaced around it ( usually four , sometimes more , almost never less ) which engages the outside pawl on the outside of the planet gear and the \" sun gear \" on the inside . The clever part comes in the fact that any one of the rings or gears can do one of four things at any one time : it can be locked still , allowed to turn freely , connected to the input shaft ( to the engine ) , or connected to the output shaft ( to the diff and the wheels ) . So to get one gear ratio of 1:1 , the planetary gears are locked , the sun gear is connected to the input and the pawl is connected to the output , and the whole thing moves as one . If we wanted a higher ratio , we would connect the planet carrier to the input shaft , and the outer ring to the output , lock the sun gear and leave the planet gears free : now as the planet carrier moves , the planet gears have to turn like wheels to catch up , so the outer ring has to move faster to stay engaged with the planet gears . Wikipedia has a much more elegant summary and shows [ all the ways you can hook up a planetary gearbox :] ( URL_0 ) there are actually twice this number , since you can also swap the driving and driven shafts to get the reciprocal ratio ( 2:1 rather than 1:2 ) . Most automatic gearboxes wo n't use all of these ratios , and will have four or five plus reverse , although there are bigger gear sets possible . Neutral is obviously selected by disengaging clutches so that the output is disconnected . Each of the parts of the gearbox is usually engaged by a system of hydraulic clutches and solenoids : the amount of pressure involved means there 's not much loss through the clutches ( a little more than a manual transmission loses , but not much at all in a decent gearbox ) . Automatics also use a torque converter in place of a normal clutch , which is sufficiently complicated to need its own ELI5 , but it provides a way for the engine to change rotation speed smoothly without too much loss of power , rather than you having to clutch - let off the gas - change - declutch ( in an upshift ) to match the engine speed to the gearbox . They use a viscous fluid , and exploit fluid coupling to do this , losing energy to heat along the way , but again modern TCs are quite efficient . Very modern automatic transmissions use a completely different method , which actually bears more resemblance to a manual than an automatic : two ( manual ) gearboxes are driven in parallel by the engine , each going through a traditional clutch . One has gears 1,3,5 and the other 2,4,6 .You could have more , but that 's getting silly on things that are n't massive trucks : more gears means more rotational inertia and lower efficiency , so because car engines have reasonably wide power bands and are n't required to hit near - perfect efficiency for cost reasons , it 's more cost - effective to have less gears and make the engine work more . The ECU controls each clutch and gearbox independently : if we imagine starting in first , the ECU will engage first gear on gearbox 1 and second on gearbox 2 , but keep gearbox 2 's clutch disengaged : we hit the gas , and accelerate in first . Now when we change up ( most of these gearboxes are in cars with \" electronic manual \" , or flappy - paddle gearboxes ) , or the engine RPM gets high enough , the ECU disengages clutch 1 and engages clutch 2 in the space of a few milliseconds , while simultaneously blipping the throttle down to match engine speed precisely . Gearbox 1 now selects third , and waits for you to reach the right speed / RPM to engage it . The ECU is constantly monitoring what you 're doing ( through huge numbers of sensors , including things like turn rate ) to figure out whether you want to go up or down a gear next , and usually gets it right ( and gives you an incredibly fast shift ) - if you can fool it , it catches up in a few hundred milliseconds ( tenths of a second ) , which is about as fast as most drivers can make any change : race drivers can do sub-1/10th - of - a - second changes if they 're good , but it 's not easy . These dual - clutch gearboxes are popular in very high performance cars ( the Bugatti Veyron uses a very , very good six - speed for instance ) because they lose less power in the transmission itself , but they weigh about the same as a normal automatic and require much more advanced ECUs than a traditional automatic . They are starting to appear in lower - end cars , though : Smart have been using them for a while , and I think the new Ford Focus has one : they give a lot of the \" feel \" of using a manual ( the direct link between engine and transmission helps ) while providing some of the efficiency benefits of an automatic , since the engine can decide for itself what gear is most appropriate to put the engine closest to the \" power band \" ( where the engine is outputting the most horsepower ) or the point of maximum efficiency ( which is usually close ) . I 've explained to a five - year - old driver in places : hopefully 5YO you can reach the pedals .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Wrote an essay about this topic for my 3rd year evolutionary psychology class last semester . Basically , there 's no definitive answer yet but there a couple popular hypotheses for why homosexuality has persisted in males : * * * Female Fecundity Hypothesis * * - states that certain genes , when possessed by males , predispose them towards a homosexual orientation . However , these genes are not eliminated from the gene pool because they drastically increase the reproductive fitness when inherited by a female . ELI5 version - So given certain gene , if male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby making * * * The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis * * Argues that genes that express feminine physical characteristics and personality traits increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version - being a little bit feminine can increase your chances of getting lucky with the opposite gender , but too much feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in the past , males used sexual contact with other males as a way to form / strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient Greece , it was not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual behaviour with younger males while being married to a woman . Also note that it is only within the past couple centuries that the division of sexuality into heterosexual and homosexual identities has occurred .

But lets assume you are in a country where none of this laws are in place : When doing something on the internet every bit of data you send or receive goes through your ISP . So they can see everything . But how do they find traffic that s potentially illegal ? There are several ways . One is to look at the port on the other site . If its not a common port of a server you probably have P2P traffic . This might mean that you are using Torrents or some other kind of filesharing tool . Some providers went overprotective and disabled such connection completely . This caused issues because not all traffic in this ranges is P2P(eg . CS : S / TF2 servers ) , not all P2P traffic is torrents and not all torrents are illegal . Another way is to get a list of domains that contain potiental illegal content(OneClick Hoster , Torrents , Warez ) . If the user uses the DNS - Server of the ISP almost everytime he wants to reach a website he will have to send a request to his ISP asking them to give them the IP - Adress to this site . If the requested site is on the list they can take a note and mark the user for suspicious behaviour . But if the user uses another DNS - Server the isp can look into the data send . If its an unencrypted request the target adress will be readble . Even if its encrypted , the target IP - Adress MUST be contained and using this one can get a list of sites . If one of the sites is on the blacklist the user can be marked for suspicious behaviour . If the user causes much traffic something might eb off too . He might just be playing video games , hosting a gaming server or he uses torrents . If a user is to suspicious the ISP can then go and look deeper into what he is doing , what files he dowloaded or uploaded unencrypted and if one of the files is copyrighted material he done goofed .", "label": "hc3human"}

Now lets say I told you to \" turn on the TV and the music , but keep the lights off . \" You would turn the first lever to off , and the other two to on . If we say that \" 0 \" means off and \" 1 \" means on , then that means in this example the first lever is 0 , and the second two are 1 . So you could write that very simply as the following sequence : 011 Which means that the lights are off , but the music and TV are on .

{"text": "You will make a profit in nominal dollars (or nominal units of whatever currency you used to buy the token).  Whether you'll make a profit in real dollars depends on inflation, and in practice whether it would be possible to sell your existing tokens to someone else for the new price. Suppose when the price was 50 U (50 \"units\", since you didn't specify a currency), you bought one token.  Today you can either spend 52 U for a token, and get a liter of milk, or you can spend your existing token (for which you paid 50 U) and get a liter of milk.  It looks like you are making a profit of 2 U by spending your token. However, whether that profit is real or illusory depends on what else you could do with the token.  For instance, suppose that, since the price of a token is now 52 U, you will have no trouble finding someone who wants to buy your token from you for 52 U.  If you sell your token for 52 U, you'll still only be able to buy 1 L of milk.  So if you measure your wealth in milk, you have made no profit: in the past you had a token representing 1 L of milk, and today you still have a token representing 1 L of milk. Suppose now that in the past, when a token cost 50 U, a hamburger also cost 50 U.  Suppose further that a hamburger now costs 52 U.  So you can sell your token for 52 U, but that 52 U will still only buy you one hamburger.  So, again, if you measure your wealth in hamburgers, your have made no profit.  In the past, you could have sold your token and bought a hamburger; today, you can still sell your token and buy a hamburger, and you'll have nothing left over, so you have gained nothing. If, on the other hand, the price of a hamburger today is still 50 U, then you call sell your token for 52 U, buy a hamburger for 50 U, and still have 2 U left over.  You have made a profit. What this all goes to show is that, in practice, the idea of \"profit\" depends on the overall economy, and whether you could exchange the currency units you have in your possession for a greater quantity of goods than you could in the past.  Whether this is possible depends on the relative changes in price of various goods.  In other words, if you get your money by selling Product A, and later you buy Product B, you may or may not make a profit depending on how the prices of the two products moved relative to one another. Also, in your hypothetical setup, the \"currency\" (the token) is directly linked to the value of a single good, so you can always at least get 1 L of milk for your token.  Most real currency is not bound to specific goods like your milk token, so it is possible for your currency to lose value in an absolute sense.  For instance, suppose you sell a book for $5.  The $5 is not a \"book token\" and you cannot rely on being able to exchange it for a book in the future; in the future, all books may cost $10, and the prices of all goods may rise similarly, so your currency will actually be worth less no matter how you try to use it.  This could happen with the milk token if the milkman announces that henceforth 1 L of milk will cost 2 tokens; your existing token suddenly loses half its value. In sum, it is easy to calculate whether you made a profit in currency units.  What is harder is to calculate whether you made a profit in \"real terms\" (often referred to as \"real dollars\" or \"inflation-adjusted dollars\", or the equivalent in your favorite currency).  The reason this is hard is because the idea of \"real dollars\" is fundamentally linked to the possibility of exchanging currency for goods (and services), and so it depends what goods you're buying.  Inflation statistics published by governments and the like use a \"basket\" of goods to approximate the overall price movements in the economy as a whole.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The 'appropriate' amount of cash/bonds to hold will be largely a matter of opinion, but here are the general reasons why having at least some is a good idea: Cash is very liquid, and bonds are often mostly liquid. This means you can access them very quickly, without taking on losses. To get the most liquidity out of your bonds, you can do what is called 'laddering'. This means that you take out different bond amounts with different maturity dates, and periodically renew them on a schedule, so that you always have some bonds maturing, which you can access without paying an interest penalty. You can look this term up online for more details. Cash and bonds are low risk. If you have absolutely no low-risk assets, then in the event of, say, a market crash, you may have no savings to fall back on. By owning some bonds, and some equities, you are able to earn a modest return, without being too risky. However, note that some bonds are just as risky as equities - any bond which pays an abnormally high interest rate does so because the entity backing the repayment (government, company, whomever) is thought to not be guaranteed to be able to do so. The 25% figure given by your author is his opinion on the appropriate mix of cash/bonds to equities, but there are many views on the matter.

There are a many ways to forecast the future cash flows of assets. For example, for companies: It seems like calculating expected/required rate using CAPM does not belong to either fundamental or technical analysis, does it? I would qualify the CAPM as quantitative analysis because it's mathematics and statistics. It's not really fundamental since its does not relies on economical data (except the prices). And as for technical analysis, the term is often used as a synonym for graphical analysis or chartism, but quantitative analysis can also be referred as technical analysis. the present value of future cash flows [...] (called intrinsic price/value, if I am correct?) Yes you are correct. I wonder when deciding whether an asset is over/fair/under-valued, ususally what kind of price is compared to what other kind of price? If it's only to compare with the price, usually, the Net asset value (which is the book value), the Discount Cash flows (the intrinsic value) and the price of comparable companies and the CAPM are used in comparison to current market price of the asset that you are studying. Why is it in the quote to compare the first two kinds of prices, instead of comparing the current real price on the markets to any of the other three kinds? Actually the last line of the quote says that the comparison is done on the observed price which is the market price (the other prices can't really be observed). But, think that the part: an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset means that, since the CAPM gives you an expected rate of return, by using this rate to compute the present value of future cash flows of the asset, you should have the same predicted price.

In terms of modern cameras there are actually a few different kinds of sensors involved . They usually consist of a small square which light is sent towards using the lenses in the front of the camera . The sensor itself is actually made up of millions of very tiny sensors arranged in a grid pattern , just like how a bitmap image you see on a computer screen is made up of a grid of pixels . One type of sensor ( called a 3CCD sensor ) is actually a set of three separate grids that have light split apart by a prism before it reaches each sensor , so one sensor only sees blue light , one sees red , and one sees green . A microchip acts as a brain that recombines the three primary colors sensed by the three separate sensors to create a full color image .

A common example of a PRNG is the linear congruential generator , which takes the form : Xn+1 = a*Xn+c mod m where a , c , and m are constants . That is , to obtain the next \" random \" number , you multiply the current number by a , add c , and then compute the remainder upon division by m. M is often chosen to be a power of two , which allows the modulo operation to be replaced with bitmasking , which is much faster- but this seriously degrades the randomness of the output . The [ wikipedia article ] ( URL_3 ) has a list of examples implementations and the constants they use . Other examples of PRNGs include : * [ Linear feedback shift register ] ( URL_2 ) * [ Mersenne twister ] ( URL_0 ) * [ Blum Blum Shub ] ( URL_1 ) PRNGs vary in the quality of the randomness they produce- LCGs and LFSRs are very fast , but produce poor quality random numbers : the sequence looks random , but statistical tests can show that it is n't . For applications such as cryptography , it 's important that the numbers are statistically random .

{"text": "TL;DR up front : It comes from a Supreme Court ruling called Citizens United . It 's a good thing because that 's what they said is law and that it 's supported by the first amendment to the constitution . But it 's a bad thing because , basically , corporations * are n't * people , and the decision lets corporations have an unfair advantage over regular people in politics . _ _ _ So we 'll start with the basics . You 've got free speech , right ? That does n't just mean you can shout stuff , it also means you can hang out with certain people and do a lot of other stuff that the Supreme Court has previously decided count as \" speech . \" For a while , the government had said that there were limits to the amount of money that could be given to political campaigns . Really really rich corporations could n't give a ton of money to a candidate , because that would mean that the CEO had more political power than some random redditor without billions of dollars . But in 2010 , the Supreme Court decided a case called Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission . I 'm not going to go into the details of the case . The decision went like this : * * * People have free speech * * . * Money can make a statement - if you buy a certain thing , you 're supporting the company that made it . If you donate to a certain politician , you 're supporting them with your money . * Therefore , * * money is protected by the first amendment * * , which protects free speech . * People have free speech , which includes money . * People can come together as a group , and they still have free speech . Just because you and your friend BOTH shout \" I hate Obama \" at once , it does n't take away your freedom of speech . * Groups can include things like non - profits , unions , and corporations . * So if money = speech and * * groups have the same power of free speech as an individual * * , the government ca n't limit the money they spend in politics , because that would violate the first amendment . Simplified , * * this is the idea that \" corporations are people \" - that they get the same rights and protections and ability to make political donations and everything * * . People who support the idea say that it 's protected by the first amendment . However , a lot of people criticize this idea , because they say that corporations are NOT the same as people . And letting corporations give a ton of money to politics is n't fair to actual people who do n't have as much money . Hope that helps !", "label": "hc3human"}

If the condition is satisfied the employee becomes entitled to a payment on 31 December 2004 but is only entitled to payment of it on 30 June 2005.

{"text": "Edited to incorporate the comments elsewhere of @Atkins Assuming, (apparently incorrectly) that duration is time to maturity: First, note that the question does not mention the coupon rate, the size of the regular payments that the bond holder will get each year.  So let's calculate that. Consider the cash flow described.  You pay out 1015 at the start of Year #1, to buy the bond.  At the end of Years #1 to #5, you receive a coupon payment of X.  Also at the end of Year #5, you receive the face value of the bond, 1000.  And you are told that the pay out equals the money received, using a time value of money of 4.69% So, if we use the date of maturity of the bond as our valuation date, we have the equation: Maturity + Future Value of coupons = Future value of Bond Purchase price 1000 + X *( (1 + .0469)^5-1)/0.0469 = 1015 * 1.0469^5 Solving this for X, we obtain 50.33;  the coupon rate is 5.033%.  You will receive 50.33 at the end of each of the five years.   Now, we can take this fixed schedule of payments, and apply the new yield rate to the same formula above;  only now, the unknown is the price paid for the bond, Y. 1000 + 50.33 * ((1 + 0.0487)^5 - 1) / .0487 = Y * 1.0487^5 Solving this equation for Y, we obtain: Y = 1007.08", "label": "hc3human"}

Passing the course is very little indication that you understand what's important about investing, for example, you won't be taught much of anything about the theory of investment, or the markets, or things like the efficient market hypothesis.\" Src: EfficientMarket.ca on the CSC So it appears that the CSC is necessary to work as certain types of financial agencies. That being said, I doubt it will be enough to get your foot in the door. This seems more like a prerequisite rather than a true qualification, so you'll be competing with MBAs/Finance students and other people who either have experience or training in the financial industry.

The issue is that in most states ( with Maine and Nebraska being the exceptions ) all the electoral college votes go to the popular vote winner .

The reason you can win the election while losing the popular vote is because anything MORE than 51 % in a state does n't get you any closer to victory , since you already get all those electoral college votes .

{"text": "The common advice you mentioned is just a guideline and has little to do with how your portfolio would look like when you construct it. In order to diversify you would be using correlations and some common sense. Recall the recent global financial crisis, ones of the first to crash were AAA-rated CDO's, stocks and so on. Because correlation is a statistical measure this can work fine when the economy is stable, but it doesn't account for real-life interrelations, especially when population is affected. Once consumers are affected this spans to the entire economy so that sectors that previously seemed unrelated have now been tied together by the fall in demand or reduced ability to pay-off. I always find it funny how US advisers tell you to hold 80% of US stocks and bonds, while UK ones tell you to stick to the UK securities. The same happens all over the world, I would assume. The safest portfolio is a Global Market portfolio, obviously I wouldn't be getting, say, Somalian bonds (if such exist at all), but there are plenty of markets to choose from. A chance of all of them crashing simultaneously is significantly lower. Why don't people include derivatives in their portfolios? Could be because these are mainly short-term, while most of the portfolios are being held for a significant amount of time thus capital and money markets are the key components. Derivatives are used to hedge these portfolios. As for the currencies - by having foreign stocks and bonds you are already exposed to FX risk so you, again, could be using it as a hedging instrument.", "label": "hc3human"}

But why must that be the case ? There is certainly beauty in recreating the physical world ( such as is the case with a portrait ) .

{"text": "(See also the question How many stocks I can exercise per stock warrant? and my comments there). Clearly, at the prices you quote, it does not seem sensible to exercise your warrants at the moment, since you can still by \"units\" (1 stock + 1/3 warrant) and bare stock at below the $11.50 it would cost you to exercise your warrant.  So when would exercising a warrant become \"a sensible thing to do\"? Obviously, if the price of the bare stock (which you say is currently $10.12) were to sufficiently exceed $11.50, then it would clearly be worth exercising a warrant and immediately selling the stock you receive (\"sufficiently exceed\" to account for any dealing costs in selling the newly-acquired stock). However, looking more closely, $11.50 isn't the correct \"cut-off\" price. Consider three of the units you bought at $10.26 each. For $30.78 you received three shares of stock and one warrant. For an additional $11.50 ($42.28 in total) you can have a total of four shares of stock (at the equivalent of $10.57 each). So, if the price of the bare stock rises above $10.57, then it could become sensible to exercise one warrant and sell four shares of stock (again allowing a margin for the cost of selling the stock). The trading price of the original unit (1 stock + 1/3 warrant) shouldn't (I believe) directly affect your decision to exercise warrants, although it would be a factor in deciding whether to resell the units you've already got. As you say, if they are now trading at $10.72, then having bought them at $10.26 you would make a profit if sold. Curiously, unless I'm missing something, or the figures you quote are incorrect, the current price of the \"unit\" (1 stock + 1/3 warrant; $10.72) seems overpriced compared to the price of the bare stock ($10.12). Reversing the above calculation, if bare stock is trading at $10.12, then four shares would cost $40.48. Deducting the $11.50 cost-of-exercising, this would value three \"combined units\" at $28.98, or $9.66 each, which is considerably below the market price you quote. One reason the \"unit\" (1 stock + 1/3 warrant) is trading at $10.72 instead of $9.66 could be that the market believes the price of the bare share (currently $10.12) will eventually move towards or above $11.50. If that happens, the option of exercising warrants at $11.50 becomes more and more attractive. The premium presumably reflects this potential future benefit. Finally, \"Surely I am misunderstand the stock IPO's intent.\": presumably, the main intent of Social Capital was to raise as much money as possible through this IPO to fund their future activities. The \"positive view\" is that they expect this future activity to be profitable, and therefore the price of ordinary stock to go up (at least as far as, ideally way beyond) the $11.50 exercise price, and the offering of warrants will be seen as a \"thank you\" to those investors who took the risk of taking part in the IPO. A completely cynical view would be that they don't really care what happens to the stock price, but that \"offering free stuff\" (or what looks like \"free stuff\") will simply attract more \"punters\" to the IPO. In reality, the truth is probably somewhere between those two extremes.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Yes , broadly speaking . Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * . There 's more to this explanation than just that - radioactivity , transition elements , metals , different levels of valence shells , different types of bonds , subatomic forces , resonance , etc , but that is basically an entire chem course worth of information . But valence electrons are the most important thing overall .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Curious, why are you interested in building/improving your credit score? Is it better to use your card and pay off the bill completely every month? Yes. How is credit utiltization calculated?    Is it average utilization over the month, or total amount owed/credit_limit per month? It depends on how often your bank reports your balances to the reporting agencies. It can be daily, when your statement cycle closes, or some other interval. How does credit utilization affect your score?  Closest to zero without actually being zero is best. This translates to making some charges, even $1 so your statement shows a balance each statement that you pay off. This shows as active use. If you pay off your balance before the statement closes, then it can sometimes be reported as inactive/unused. Is too much a bad thing?  Yes. Is too little a bad thing? Depends. Being debt free has its advantages... but if your goal is to raise your credit score, then having a low utilization rate is a good metric. Less than 7% utilization seems to be the optimal level.  \"Last year we started using a number, not as a recommendation, but as a fact that most of the people with really high FICO scores have credit utilization rates that are 7 percent or lower,\" Watts said.

{"text": "Data and information visualization (data viz or info viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or information is numerous as for example a time series.\nIt is also the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. It is related to infographics and scientific visualization. One distinction is that it's information visualization when the spatial representation (e.g., the page layout of a graphic design) is chosen, whereas it's scientific visualization when the spatial representation is given.\nFrom an academic point of view, this representation can be considered as a mapping between the original data (usually numerical) and graphic elements (for example, lines or points in a chart). The mapping determines how the attributes of these elements vary according to the data. In this light, a bar chart is a mapping of the length of a bar to a magnitude of a variable. Since the graphic design of the mapping can adversely affect the readability of a chart, mapping is a core competency of Data visualization.\nData and information visualization has its roots in the field of statistics and is therefore generally considered a branch of descriptive statistics. However, because both design skills and statistical and computing skills are required to visualize effectively, it is argued by authors such as Gershon and Page that it is both an art and a science.\nResearch into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information.", "label": "hc3human"}

Assuming you are not operating as an incorporated business, you would need to declare the freelancing income on both your federal and provincial tax returns.  You should be able to deduct certain costs related to your business \u2013 for instance, if you paid for software, hosting, domain name registration, etc.  That is, only the profit from your business would be subject to income tax.  With income and expenses arising from self-employment, you may want to use a professional to file your taxes. On the sales taxes: You may also need to charge federal GST and provincial QST (Quebec Sales Tax) on your services:  You must enroll and charge GST and QST once you exceed the \"small supplier\" revenue threshold of $30,000 measured over four consecutive quarters.  (You can still choose to enroll for GST/QST before you reach that amount, but over that amount enrollment becomes mandatory.  Some businesses enroll before the threshold is reached so they can claim input tax credits for tax paid on expenses, but then there's more paperwork \u2013 one reason to perhaps avoid enrolling until necessary.)

{"text": "The major drawback to borrowing to invest (i.e. using leverage) is that your return on investment must be high enough to overcome the cost of finance. The average return on the S&P 500 is about 9.8% (from CNBC) a typical unsecured personal loan will have an interest rate of around 18-36% APR (from NerdWallet). This means that on average you will be paying more interest than you are receiving in returns so are losing money on the margin investment. Sometimes the S&P falls and over those periods you would be paying out interest having lost money so will have a negative return! You may have better credit and so be able to get a lower rate but I don't know your loan terms currently. Secured loans, such as remortgaging your house, will have lower costs but come with more life changing risks. The above assumes that you are getting financing by directly borrowing money, however, it is also possible to trade on margin. This is where you post a proportion of the value that you wish to trade with as collateral against a loan to buy the security. This form of finance is normally used by day traders and other short term holders of stocks. Although the financing costs here are low (I am not charged an interest rate on intraday margin trading) there are very high costs if you exceed the term of the loan. An example is that I am charged a fee if I hold a position overnight and my profits and losses are crystallised at that time. If I am in a losing position at that time the crystallisation process and fee can result in not having enough margin to recover the position and the loss of a potentially profit making position. Additionally if the amount of collateral cash (margin) posted is insufficient to cover the expected losses as calculated by your broker they will initiate a margin call asking for more collateral money. If you do not (or cannot) post this extra margin your losing position will be cashed out and you will take as a loss the total loss at that time. Since the market can change very rapidly, such as in a flash crash, this can result in your losing more money than you had in the first place. As this is essentially a loan you can be bankrupted by this. Overall using leverage to invest magnifies your potential profits but it also magnifies your potential losses. In many cases this magnification could be sufficient to lose you more money than you had originally invested. In addition to magnification you need to consider the cost of finance and that your return over the course of the loan needs to be higher than your cost of finance as well as inflation and other opportunity costs of capital. The S&P 500 is a relatively low volatility market in general so is unlikely to return losses in any given period that will mean that leverage of 1.25 times will take you into losses beyond your own capital investment but it is not impossible. The low level of risk automatically means that your returns are lower and so your cost of capital is likely to be a large proportion of your returns and your returns may not completely cover the cost of capital even when you are making money. The key thing if you are going to trade or invest on leverage is to understand the terms and costs of your leverage and discount them from any returns that you receive before declaring to yourself that you are profitable. It is even more important than usual to know how your positions are doing and whether you are covering your cost of capital when using leverage. It is also very important to know the terms of your leverage in detail, especially what will happen when and if your credit runs out for whatever reason be it the end of the financing period (the length of the loan) or your leverage ratio gets too high. You should also be aware of the costs of closing out the loan early should you need to do so and how to factor that into your investing decisions.", "label": "hc3human"}

Short term gains taxed at your marginal rates, whereas long term gains have preferable capital gains rates (up to 20% tax rate, instead of your marginal rate). So if you're selling at gain, you might want to consider to sell FIFO and pay lower capital gains tax rate instead of the short term marginal rate. If you're selling at loss and have other short term gains, you would probably be better selling LIFO, so that the loss could offset other short term gains that you might have.  If you're selling at loss and don't have short term gains to offset, you can still offset your long term gains with short term losses, but the tax benefit will be lower. In this case - FIFO might be a better choice again.

{"text": "Supervised learning (SL) is a machine learning paradigm for problems where the available data consists of labelled examples, meaning that each data point contains features (covariates) and an associated label. The goal of supervised learning algorithms is learning a function that maps feature vectors (inputs) to labels (output), based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a \"reasonable\" way (see inductive bias). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured through the so-called generalization error.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Milliondollarjourney.com has a couple of articles on this topic. How Investing Taxes Work part 1 and part 2. The following is a summary of that article. Capital gains and dividends are taxed at a preferred rate, while interest tax is taxed at your regular rate. Interest is taxed at your marginal rate, but capital gains are taxed at only 50% of your marginal rate. That means that it makes sense to place the interest bearing account inside the RRSP but keep stocks outside. Additionally, you can claim your losses on your capital appreciating stocks against your gains if they are outside of your RRSP. Hopefully, your stocks will never go down but that's not very realistic. Dividends from Canadian companies are eligible for a dividend tax credit, but not dividends from foreign companies.

{"text": "Many mutual fund companies (including Vanguard when I checked many years ago) require smaller minimum investments (often $1000) for IRA and 401k accounts.  Some also allow for smaller investments into their funds for  IRA accounts if you set up an automatic investment plan that contributes  a fixed amount of money each month or each quarter.  On the other hand,  many mutual fund companies charge an annual account maintenance fee ($10? $20? $25? more?) per fund for IRA investments unless the balance in the fund is above a certain amount (often $5K or $10K$).  This fee can be paid in cash or deducted from the IRA investment, and the former option is vastly better. So, diversification into multiple funds while starting out with an IRA is not that great an idea. It is far better to get diversification through investment in an S&P 500 Index fund (VFINX since you won't have access to @JoeTaxpayer's VIIIX) or a Total Market Index fund or, if you prefer, a Target Retirement Fund, and then branch out into other types of mutual funds as your investment grows through future contributions and dividends etc. To answer your question about fund minimums, the IRA account is separate from a taxable investment account, and the minimum rule applies to each separately.

{"text": "Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.\nThe observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel (and former CEO of the latter), who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,[a] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. While Moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue, his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a \"law\".\nMoore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth.\nIndustry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore's law will cease to apply. Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, slightly below the pace predicted by Moore's law.", "label": "hc3human"}

By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered \"psychedelic\".\nIn common parlance \"psychedelic art\" refers above all to the art movement of the late 1960s counterculture, featuring highly distorted or surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance psychedelic experiences. Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to psychedelic rock music.

{"text": "Social Security itself can not run out . The common misconception is that Social Security is deposited into some big account that will eventually run out . This is not true . Basically think of Social Security like a business : You have the Social Security tax , which is revenue . Then there are people being paid social security , which is an expense . Since Social Security 's conception , there has always been a surplus ( where the government takes in more taxes than pays out benefits ) . This surplus goes to an account called \" Social Security Surplus \" . ~~The money in the Surplus Account is used to pay down the national debt.~~ The problem that politicians refer to , however , is that with the entirety of the Baby Boomers ( the largest segment of the U.S. Population ) about to retire in the next decade , for the first time in U.S. history there is going to be a Social Security deficit . This is fine for the first year , but when people retire between 55 and 65 generally , we can reasonably expect that they will live another 20 - 30 years assuming they are healthy in most regards . The dilemma with this is that the expense will continue to grow , but due to the Recession and unemployment rates , fewer people are paying into Social Security , so less revenue is actually being taken in . So while the government might be able to foot the bill for awhile , and the Baby Boomers might be ok with their retirement , there will most certainly not be enough money to cover Generations X and Y when they retire in 30 - 50 years . To answer the other part of your question , welfare is exclusively an expense , with no specific revenue to counteract it . The government actually makes profit off of Social Security , so it 's a huge deal when that goes away . In addition , people are naturally selfish ( not insulting anyone , that 's just part of being human ) , so the idea that we may not be able to retire as comfortably as we expected ( good lord man , do n't tell me we have to * save our money ? ! ? ! ? ! * ) and that all the money we 've paid into Social Security since we were 16 is going to be wasted kind of ticks us off . * If my answer was unsatisfactory , [ Khan Academy ] ( URL_0 ) does an excellent explanation on this subject . * * * EDIT :* * Corrected misinformation about the uses of the Social Security Trust account", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Hi I 'm an HIV scientist . Hivologist . Human immunodeficiency virologist . I study the damn virus . Genetically and morphologically , both siv and HIV are nearly identical . How did a virus like this start ? Lets forego the rather contentious discussion on how viruses began and their purpose . Lets start with the virus simply existing in a chimp population . Siv is good at its job in chimps . Does n't kill them , lets the virus propagate . Successful virus . Imagine there 's a large population of chimps infected with the virus . Within every host , retroviruses like siv / hiv produce a large genetically diverse reservoir of viruses . Lets say the genome is 10 k bases in length . That 's a very small genome . We have more than 3 billion for reference . It just so happens there are multiple mechanisms inherent to the virus that make its reproductive steps increase genetic variability . Now , this only means it has a lot of mutations ( relative to a DNA virus or even our genome ) . In addition , more than half of all viruses produced in the body are non - infectious for a list of reasons . What we have now is the possibility for a single virus to experience a couple mutations in its genome in the right places that enable siv to infect humans . One of these such mutations is the vif protein . Mutations in one amino acid enable siv propagation in humans . So now we have the putative patient zero . Somehow this poor bastard was exposed to fluid containing a virus of siv with the correct mutations in its genome to confer upon it the ability to fuck up humans . So sorta how it came to be from chimps to humans is answered by this . If you want to hear some of the ways we think siv originated I can answer after my flight lands .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Over the last couple of centuries , we ( people on Earth in lots of different places ) learned that we could manipulate electricity by sending it through different materials . Some materials would lower it 's current ( That 's the flow of electricity ) and others would control it 's voltage ( that 's the force in electrical current ) , we found materials that would allow electricity to flow in only one direction . Some materials allowed us to control * where * it would go . The transistor is a special device that acts as a switch . It has 3 connections : input , output , and on * . If you have a power source attached to the input , and you attached the power source to the ' on ' connection , it would allow that power to flow from the input to the output , kind of like a valve . This is the foundation of computers . They 're amazing counting machines . We take a lot of switches and put them together to count numbers in a system called [ * Binary * ] ( URL_0 ) Binary lets us store information . These switches can also be used to make decisions ( as described above ) . Suppose you have a set of transistors ( which we 'll describe with 0s and 1s ): 0000 abcd < - switch names Let say this represents a decision that the microcontroller makes . * If switch a is on , then we 'll add a number to another one . * If switch b is on , then we 'll subtract that number from another * If switch c is on , we 'll multiply them * If switch d is on , we 'll divide them So we have our two numbers : 2 and 3 and our switch set is : 0100 and we know that means that we should subtract the first number from the second . So we get 3 - 2 = 1 If our switch were 0010 We know we have to multiply the two numbers : 3 * 2 = 6 Since we can make decisions based on what switches are set , and we can set switches using electricity , we can use electricity to make decisions . We use resistors , capacitors , and diodes to keep from damaging our switches . That 's the basic basic basic version . We 've put Billions of transistors into a single chip , think of how many decisions that is ! These transistors rely on basic physics to operate , and we use our understanding of logic to put the transistors together in the order that will make them output information we can understand . Using transistors , we store data we need superfast in RAM ( random access memory ) . Using magnetics ( north(on ) or south(off ) ) we store data we need for a long time on hard disks ) . When the computer starts it has a simple set of instructions stored in it 's BIOS . Then it gets more instructions from the OS on the disk drive and loads all those little 1s and 0s into it 's memory ( RAM again ) so it knows which decisions it should make when it 's presented a choice . It 's really fascinating . Naturally , this topic is very complex and much more than could be explained in a short item like this . I hope you got a basic understanding .

It 's like putting everything into a blender for a beverage and then not putting the lid on . When it 's done you then swing it around to really get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles this pairing . We have things called routes , so we 're going to tell the application(website ) to point to the ItemController when the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show ) ; So what does that do ? Simple , really . In our InventoryController class we have a method called show . All we 're doing is saying when item is requested go here if there is a parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC car above had an i d of 0 . We 'd go to : URL_0 and the example above would be rendered . Controller time ! InventoryController extends Controller { public function show($id ) { //Item is in our auto load . This class is accessible app wide . $ data = Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Details for \" . data['item_name ' ] ; //View is in the same boat . Auto loaded . return View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that returns the view above , just like before . Now though , we 're going to spice it up ! We have another product . i d = 1 ; item_name = \" RC Boat \" ; price = \" $ 25.00 \" ; When we call to URL_1 guess what ! Our application automagically fills in the information for the item matching the i d of 1 . Fancy ! Back to the ELI5 attempt : Automatic coloring books and stencils = MVC . ( kind of ) . Code Reuse ( stencils ) is considered , for good reason , to be a sign of a capable developer . We get to reuse the same files passing in only a parameter to change the outcome . When we first called the page we had an i d of 0 . The RC Car was returned . Then we simply changed the URL to have a 1 which returned the RC Boat . Same files different page . In a real world example we 'd probably have a master page(coloring book ) that served as the main template for all pages . This would have our CSS , JS , and other elements all centrally located . MVC means you no longer have to update your pages individually to change something like your navigation or header . It 's all in one spot . It means no need for nasty database interaction spattered all over your php files . All of that is handled in your database object . That is a central concept . Centralized code management and maintenance . I do n't think I quite hit the ELI5 nail on the head , but I hope this helps anyone that might be confused . I know it took me a bit to figure out this MVC thing .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I understand that if I have multiple health insurance policies, I can only make claim from only one of them if ever I incur medical expenses (I'm from the Philippines). In the US, you cannot simultaneously submit a claim for payment of a medical bill, or request reimbursement for a bill already paid, to multiple insurance companies, but if you are covered by more  than one policy, then any part of a claim not paid by one company  can be submitted to another company that is also covering you. In fact, if you have employer-paid or employer-provided coverage, most  insurance companies will want your employer-provided insurance company  to be billed first, and will cover whatever is not paid by the employer coverage. For example, if the employer coverage pays 80% of your doctor's bill, the private insurance will pay the remaining 20%. But, the private  insurance policies are also quite expensive.  Some professional groups in the US offer major medical coverage to  their US members, and might be offering this to non-US members as well (though I suspect not).  These policies have large deductibles so that coverage kicks in only when the total medical expenses in that year (whether wholly or partially reimbursed, or not reimbursed at all) exceed the large deductible.  These types of policies actually pay out to only a few people - if you have more than, say, $20,000 of medical expenses in a year, you have been quite ill,  and thus the premiums are usually much smaller than full-fledged coverage  insurance policies which pay out much more frequently because of much smaller deductibles.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.\nThe test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'\" Because \"thinking\" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the \"imitation game\", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: \"Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?\" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that \"machines can think\".\nSince Turing introduced his test, it has been both highly influential and widely criticised, and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Some of its criticisms, such as John Searle's Chinese room, are themselves controversial.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In mathematics, statistics, finance, computer science, particularly in machine learning and inverse problems, regularization is a process that changes the result answer to be \"simpler\". It is often used to obtain results for ill-posed problems or to prevent overfitting.\nAlthough regularization procedures can be divided in many ways, following delineation is particularly helpful:\nIn explicit regularization, independent of the problem or model, there is always a data term, that corresponds to a likelihood of the measurement and a regularization term that corresponds to a prior. By combining both using Bayesian statistics, one can compute a posterior, that includes both information sources and therefore stabilizes the estimation process. By trading off both objectives, one chooses to be more addictive to the data or to enforce generalization (to prevent overfitting). There is a whole research branch dealing with all possible regularizations. The work flow usually is, that one tries a specific regularization and then figures out the probability density that corresponds to that regularization to justify the choice. It can also be physically motivated by common sense or intuition.\nIn machine learning, the data term corresponds to the training data and the regularization is either the choice of the model or modifications to the algorithm. It is always intended to reduce the generalization error, i.e. the error score with the trained model on the evaluation set and not the training data.\nOne of the earliest uses of regularization is Tikhonov regularization, related to the method of least squares.", "label": "hc3human"}

This means lots of tough grains that involve a lot of chewing and grinding with the molars , and meat that was roughly butchered with simple tools , and then you 'd have a chunk of it and chomp down and cut it into smaller pieces with your incisors -- your front teeth . In doing so , you 'd pull your front teeth and help to move them into place with an edge - to - edge bite . Nowadays , we have complex knives and food processors that chop our food into small pieces before it even gets to the mouth .

It 's normal for the upper teeth to be more forward than the bottom teeth . We use our front teeth so little that usually people have ridges on the bottom of the front teeth for their entire lives .

{"text": "The chances of the sun damaging your eyes that quickly is pretty low . Damage to the retina by bright light is called solar retinopathy , and it repairs itself as long as its not too severe and it takes a while to occur in most people . I 've only had it occur once- 5 gentlemen who took LSD all came in on the same day . The day before they had taken LSD and stared at the sun ... Once they sobered up they were so confused why they could not see ! None of them remembered looking at the sun for hours straight together the day before . I 'm not totally sure but I am going to speculate on the reason it appears less bright towards the center : 1 ) the sun appears relatively small 2 ) when you look at any object , your eyes are constantly making small eye movements called micro - saccades . these tiny movements are n't noticable by you but will focus the small sun on slightly different portions of your macula ( macula = centermost area of your retina ) . Some people think micro - saccades have a purpose , either to correct normal drifting of the eyes or to prevent the troxler effect on the object we are looking at . 3 ) something called the troxler 's effect causes you to ignore constant stimuli to your retina . So if an area of your retina is getting a constant stimuli , say a certain color , your eye will adapt to that stimuli and watch for a change in stimuli . This can sometimes cause color confusion , because once part of your retina has adapted to one color ( takes about 10 seconds perhaps ) your perception of color will be off in that area of the retina . THE RESULT therefore is that only the exact center of your macula is being constantly exposed to the sun , the micro - saccades are preventing the edges of your retinas macula from being constantly exposed to the light . Since it is not constantly exposed , you do not have the troxler 's fading effect on the edges of the sun- in other words , you do not adapt to the stimulus that is changing but you do adapt to the center of the sun because the center of the sun correlates to the center of the macula which is the only region always being stimulated , non - stop , despite your microsaccades .

{"text": "Much of the research on sleep involves EEGs , or Electroencephalography , which involves recording electrical activity on one 's head . Other electrodes can also be used to monitor other aspects of the body , such as heart rate , respiration , or skin conductance during sleep . We can physiologically characterize sleep based on different waveforms going on in the brain . When we are * * Awake * * , EEGs show two different patterns of activity , which we can call A activity and B activity ( short for alpha and beta ) . A activity shows up as medium - frequency waves , and occurs when we are at rest ( but awake ) , sort of just hanging out not really doing anything . B activity consists of irregular , low amplitude waves , and shows up when we are alert and attentive to things in our environment , or thinking actively . Now when we go to sleep , we start to get drowsy and enter * * Stage 1 sleep * * , characterized by T activity ( theta ) , which is really a transition from sleep to wakefulness . Your eyes are rolling , and eyelids may slowly open and close . 10 minutes later you 'll enter * * Stage 2 sleep * * , where the EEG is irregular but has some T activity , but also is characterized by sleep spindles and K complexes , which are two other waveforms we can distinguish in Stage 2 ( especially K complexes , which are also the forerunners of Delta waves , which show up in deep sleep ) . K complexes are like sharp wave spikes ( like a big ocean wave ) in an otherwise lower ocean of waveforms . So you 're definitely asleep now ( in the example , hopefully not from reading!) ... if you were awoken now , you probably would deny that you have actually been asleep for around 15 - 30 minutes ! You are entering * * Stage 3 sleep * * now , characterized by the occurrence of D activity ( delta ) , where the theta waves are really startin ' a rockin ' , large amplitudes , big crashing theta waves . * * Stage 4 sleep * * , or slow wave sleep , contains only D activity . This goes on for a few more minutes , and then , about 90 minutes after the beginning of sleep , we notice a crazy change : the EEG becomes very desynchronized , which only a few theta waves , and it actually starts to look like Stage 1 , or even like being awake ! The EEG ( or other measures , like the EOG or EMG , for eye movement or muscle activity ) become very silent . The person becomes somewhat paralyzed here , and the cornea in the eye produces a big bulge that can be seen to move about ( by the EOG ) . This time is what is referred to as * * REM sleep * * . The odd thing about REM ( rapid eye movement ; stages 1 - 4 are called non - rem sleep , btw ) sleep is that while this is the time where people report having the most vivid , narrative , story - like dreams , the EEG looks like we 're awake ! If you were woken up in Stage 3 - 4 , you might not report having been dreaming , but this is the deepest sleep stage , and it will be hard to wake you up ( and you will be very groggy ! ) During the rest of the night you will alternate between REM and non - REM sleep , with each cycle being AROUND 90 minutes long , with 20 - 30 minute bouts of REM sleep . So an 8 - hour sleep cycle will have 4 - 5 periods of REM sleep , and periods of REM sleep INCREASE as the night goes on , while periods of slow - wave sleep ( stage 4 especially ) , tend to only occur in the early hours of the night .

There are some solutions to this difference between the lunar and solar years . The Romans said \" screw the Moon \" , and made the months 30 or 31 days long , so that a 12 - month period would equal a solar year ; this at the cost of the months having nothing to do with the phases of the Moon any more . Theirs was the basis for our current civil calendar ( we just found out they had a bit too many leap years ) . The Muslims said \" screw the Sun \" ; their calendar has 12 lunar months and , as such , is shorter than our civil calendar . You can notice this by seeing that their religious celebrations ( the holy month of Ramadan , the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca ) happen about 11 days earlier every year . This implies the Muslim calendar has nothing to do with seasons , which was n't much of a problem for the original desert nomadic Muslims . We Jews did n't say \" screw \" anything . Jewish months are lunar - based , alternating between 29 and 30 days . However , in our tradition it was important to keep accurate track of the seasons , so we sometimes insert a thirteenth month in the year to make up for those 11 days the lunar year is shorter than a solar year . Initially , the decision of how long a month would be , and whether or not to include an extra month in a given year , was made by observation , but afterwards it was standardised in mathematical rules . Given that sometimes we have to add or subtract a day to prevent a year from beginning in some days of the week , the cost of the system is that it is very complicated for someone to know exactly what the calendar for a given year will be !", "label": "hc3human"}

Anyways matter ( atoms ) does the same thing , only it 's a lot more \" heavy \" so most of the time we treat it as a particle and not as a wave . This is where things get interesting : when you cool down matter ( take away energy ) , just like a photon when it has less energy , it spreads out . If you get a bunch of atoms and you make them all really cold , their wave functions overlap , which means that they are indistinguishable from one another , and presto , Bose Einstein Condensate ( BEC ) . You can think about it as if millions of atoms ( most BECs have around 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 atoms in them ) are all behaving as if they were one giant atom . Most BECs to date have been made with Alkali and Alkaline Earth elements because we can control them with lasers relatively easily . Not terribly LY5 but hope that helps a little . Making a BEC is a complicated process typically involving laser cooling , atomic traps , and radio frequency evaporation , but that 's for another post maybe . What you do with a BEC varies greatly and I can elaborate on that if people want . Source : 2nd year PhD student working in a lab that makes BECs", "label": "hc3human"}

Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, dashboard development, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. \nBI tools can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop, and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability, and help them take strategic decisions.\nBusiness intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions involve priorities, goals, and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an \"intelligence\" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.\nAmong myriad uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments, and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.\nBI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as \"BI/DW\"\nor as \"BIDW\".

{"text": "This is actually a trick question , as according to most modern historians , the Roman Empire * did n't * ' collapse . ' The traditional date given for said event is 476 C.E. , when the ' last ' \" real \" Roman Emperor was deposed by his Master of Horse , the ' barbarian ' Odoacer . Notice the large number of quotations I had to use in that sentence . The truth is that this date is really rather arbitrary , as are many of the widely - memorized dates in popular history . Basically , you have an Emperor , Romulus Augustulus ( a pejorative term meaning ' the little Augustus ' ) , ostensibly being forced out of his place at the head of the government of Rome by his second - in - command , Odoacer , a man of German descent . The truth was that Odoacer had really been in control all along . You see , the Master of Horse was a position that at the end of the Empire -- the last century , or so -- was used by strong - men to seize power without actually holding the dangerous office of emperor . In fact , the last dozen or so emperors are now commonly referred to as the ' puppet emperors ' for just this reason : Odoacer and his predecessors did the heavy lifting behind the scenes while some patsy stood in the spotlight . Clearly Odoacer just tired of the charade in 476 when he deposed Augustulus and took sole power , and my guess is that it was just easier to have done with it . Now , since Odoacer had really been in power all along , you may wonder why 476 is such an important date in Roman history . Well , the truth is that it was n't . If you were a Roman at the time , you probably would n't have cared all that much , except for if you were directly affected -- i.e. , you were a vehement and vocal supporter of Augustulus . So why do history books emphasize this date so much if it does n't matter ? That 's because it 's convenient . Most people learn this date in high school from a book that has thousands of others like it . It 's dumbed - down , simplistic history made for teenagers who do n't really care all that much . As for the true story , as always in history the answer is extremely complex . There are multiple , sometimes - conflicting theories about the ' fall ' of the Empire , but most of them agree on one thing : the Roman Empire lasted for centuries after the traditional 476 fall , and instead of ceasing to exist it * * transitioned * * into a different stage . In this way it was like the transition from Monarchy to Republic , or Republic to Empire , except the process was perhaps more subtle . One theory emphasizes that the Roman Empire that ' collapsed ' with Augustulus was really only * half * of the Roman Empire . Hundreds of years earlier , the Empire had been divided into two administrative sections ( and then four , and then back to two ) , the East and the West . The part which ' fell ' was the West , with its official capital at Trier , not Rome . The East , with its capital at Constantinople -- formerly called Byzantium -- was hardly affected by the ' crisis ' in the West , probably because it was so filthy rich that it could ( and did ) pay off all its violent neighbors . This half of the Empire is in modern times called the \" Byzantine \" Empire for a number of reasons , but partly because it makes the whole \" when did Rome fall \" issue simpler . In fact , though , the \" Byzantines \" continued in every way to be the Eastern Roman Empire for another thousand years until the Ottoman Turks finally conquered them in 1453 . They even considered themselves Romans , and their leader was considered to be the Roman Emperor . So this is one strong theory about the ' fall ' of the Roman Empire . Another theory is that the Roman Empire lived on ' under new management ' under the guiding hand of Odoacer and his peers and successors . The truth of the matter is that very little of the existing structure of governance was actually changed ; the Germans who did take new roles knew the system worked , and actually stood in awe of it . They did n't want to * destroy * Rome , they wanted to * be * Romans . It was such a good system , why not ? So there is a mountain of evidence for this theory , too . Another theory is that the Roman Empire lived on in the Catholic Church . It 's a bit less well - founded , but the Church and the Empire were inexorably tied together after Constantine and perhaps a little before that . In fact , the Church 's organizational system is 100 % based on Roman organization : ' diocese ' is an Anglicization of a Latin word that meant something very similar . There are others , too . Some historians believe that the Arabs were the successors to the Romans , as they really absorbed Roman learning within a very short time and expanded upon it . I do n't know if this makes sense within the context of \" the Empire did n't actually fall , \" though . So , now you know that the Empire did n't actually ' fall . ' To answer you original question , which could be better phrased as \" Why was the Western Roman Empire forced to transition in the 5th century ? , \" the truth is again , complicated . But I 'll cover the broad strokes . A huge contributing factor was the one you probably already know : the ' barbarians . ' However , the Germanic peoples who are nearly always depicted as the enemies of everything Roman were definitely not actually that . In fact , they were very envious of Roman prosperity , and many times their incursions into Roman territory were the result of Roman racism interfering with good foreign policy . For instance , one of the largest Visigoth ' invasions ' was due to the bungling of a certain Roman aristocrat who was overseeing a huge settlement of Visigoths in unused Roman territory , but allowed conditions to get so bad that there was nothing for the Germans to do but attack . More than envy , though , what was pushing the Germanic tribes into Roman territory was fear : the Huns were coming . The terrible Huns of legend were a force to be reckoned with : according to stories from the time the Huns were expert horsemen -- supposedly , men , women , and children would stay on horseback all day , not even dismounting to eat and sleep . As these crazed military geniuses ravaged northeastern Europe , the Germanic tribes on the borders of Rome slowly became more and more exposed until they had to encroach on Roman borders . Faced with certain death from the Huns , they preferred the promise of relative safety in Roman borders . It was not unusual for Romans to allow the various tribes to settle in unused Roman land . Unfortunately , as I have said , they usually treated them as second class citizens , and many costly revolts resulted . Because these began within Roman borders , the Empire was particularly exposed to danger , and there was a great deal of devastation in the West -- including the sack of Rome itself in 410 . The East largely escaped unscathed using the incredibly - effective method of paying exorbitant amounts of money to their would - be attackers to keep themselves safe . You see , the West could not afford such luxuries , as the East contained the richest provinces -- most notably the ' bread - basket ' of the old Empire , Egypt -- where the West was mostly a group of blood - suckers by comparison . So the West had to take its beatings . This was a major contributing factor to the transformation of the West from ' late Roman Empire ' to ' post - Roman era . ' A second contributing factor is the devaluing of the Roman currency . To be a popular -- not to mention breathing -- emperor , one had to keep the Army happy , above all else . To reward the army on a job well done , one emperor decided it would be nice to raise their pay . As such , he increased each soldier 's pay from something like 200 denarii a month to 350 denarii a month . What a deal for the army , right ? Well yes , but there was a catch . The Roman government , by law , operated on a balanced budget . Because there was no extra billion denarii sitting around in the budget , this change was basically untenable except for one ingenious and disastrous innovation : melting down the denarii and adding a very amount of a common metal to increase the number of coins without adding more silver . That way , the army got paid more but no more money was actually needed than what they already had . The soldiers get more money , the emperor gets their loyalty , and the budget is balanced -- everybody wins , right ? Well , except that the Romans did n't understand modern economics very well . As the coins were melted down , again and again over decades , there was less and less silver per coin . This effect was exacerbated by subsequent emperor 's own increases to the army 's pay . As such , within a century or so the denarius was valued so little that people just refused to use it . The problem was that this USED to be how everyone was paid by the government and it was fine , but now they got paid the same or a little more and it was worthless . Slowly but surely , the * entire system * broke down , and the denarius was basically scrap metal . People used gold coins when they could -- these had not been devalued -- but they were worth so much that they generally could n't be used for everyday purchases . This was a problem that plagued the Empire for decades , and eventually forced the entire Empire to turn back the clock and start trading * * in kind**--using livestock , grains , etc . as currency . It was mayhem . This weakened the Empire considerably , especially in regard to its ability to pay its all - important army -- not to mention the terrified tribes on its borders . Those are easily the two most important factors in the ' collapse ' of the Empire . There are at least a dozen more , but they require a bit of background knowledge and it took me a half hour to write all of this , so I hope this will suffice .", "label": "hc3human"}

An asset or investment this is certainly held for a year into the day or less, and sold at a loss, will create a short-term capital loss. A sale of any asset held for over a year to your day, and sold at a loss, will create a loss that is long-term. When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040.

{"text": "A bit of both . There can definitely be science to it : Science - If you * * adjust the \" levels \" * * ( hard to explain , but kind of like adjusting the contrast at different brightnesses ) you can sometimes physically see the modification . For example in a recent controversy , this photo won an award : [ \" Original \" ] ( URL_4 ) . Can you see what 's wrong with it ? ( Clue : it 's possible to see by looking closely at the right place ) If you said the plane has been photoshopped in , you 'd be right . And if you did n't already see it , maybe you can now . If not , how about we adjust the levels : [ Adjusted image ] ( URL_2 ) Well , that 's dramatic , is n't it ? This is a fairly obvious one where , to be honest , the photoshopping was n't done that well - but it can still work pretty well for detecting this kind of image made from other images . This works because an image edit is done to fool the human eye - people will edit the picture enough to fool someone looking at it , and not much more . To counter it , we change things enough that we 're limiting the amount of information . By removing the colour and bumping the contrast up , we can see small changes much more clearly . Then there are other techniques : you can * * compare the compression ratio on different parts of the image * * . Basically this involves looking at a group of pixels and ( with knowledge of how an image is compressed ) working out whether different areas of the image have different compression ratios by seeing how many mistakes there are . These ca n't be seen ( easily ) by the human eye , but can be calculated by a computer . Why does that matter ? Because if you can tell that two different part of the image have been compressed by different amounts , that 's a pretty obvious sign that the image has been modified : one part has been compressed more times than another part , so the part with fewer compressions ca n't have been there in the first place . Experience - science - Sometimes you can apply a scientific technique based on experience . For example if you know the camera that made an image , you may know that the camera has a \" signature \" , eg an unusual colour balance . Some camera phones , for example , have an unusually blue hue to photos . If the photo was taken by that phone , but has a different hue to others in the series , it may have had the colour adjusted . This is where we start to get into experience , rather than straight up analysis . There may well be other techniques I 'm not aware of , but those will catch a lot of edits . Kinda - science - Then there are simpler checks : some image editing programs will add information to the file to state that it was saved by that program , or the date may change : eg if you send me a series of 6 photos from the same place , and all of them have a \" last modified \" date that fits , but one is a few days / weeks later , that 's a fairly clear sign the file has been changed ... a clever editor will usually change these , but you may forget or miss one . Experience - And then we have the truly \" experience \" stuff , where it comes down to knowing what to look for and finding clues or evidence . For example on that plane photo , it was originally caught out because people looked closely and caught the telltale \" rectangle \" shape around the aircraft that shows it was copied in and then attempted to blur the two images together . In other photos , they may look for things like missing fingers or limbs ( surprisingly common , [ example ] ( URL_0 ) ) in photos of people , or for straight lines \" bending \" , eg if someone has tried to adjust a person 's figure to make them look thinner / fatter , sometimes they will accidentally move a nearby doorframe or stripy carpet . [ Example ] ( URL_1 ) Other things to look for are \" perfect \" hair or where someone has over - done the photoshop , making things a little too good to be true . Hair is always a good one to look at , as it 's very difficult to edit perfectly , and you can sometimes find strands that are a different colour where they were missed . Reflections are always a great one for this : [ Example ] ( URL_3 ) With hair particularly , but also generally , you can look at the areas between colours and see if the editor accidentally slipped over onto the \" next \" area when modifying them .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "While the social and cultural reasons here may be true , a big reason is simple genetics . Male humans have an X and a Y chromosome , while females have two X chromosomes . The X chromosome has all the genetic information needed to make a human , but most animals have 2 chromosomes to support each other with dominant healthy genes when one chromosome might have an unhealthy recessive gene ( albinism , for example ) . In Albinism , a person can have the expressive gene for it on one chromosome but not exhibit the trait because the other chromosome has the dominant healthy gene overpowering it , and therefore albinism is not present in the organism and it does not suffer the detriments that it otherwise could . Unfortunately for males , though , the Y chromosome is much shorter than the X chromosome and does not have code for all traits that can be expressed . In most cases the X chromosome has the healthy gene , but for some sex - linked diseases like colour - blindness , the gene responsible for seeing colours is only found on the X chromosome and not the Y. This means that if a male child gets the recessive gene from their mother , there is no other chromosome to pick up the slack and express the dominant gene for seeing colour and they are colour - blind . If the child is female and they get a colour - blindness gene in one of their X chromosomes , they have another chance for the other X chromosome to cover for it . Therefore colour - blindness is extremely rare in females but affects about a tenth of males in some degree . This is just one example of a sex - linked disease , but I used it to demonstrate that every single dangerous sex - linked disease is much more harmful to men than women because they only have one 50/50 chance to resist the disease when given a recessive gene from their mother 's X chromosome ( the egg ) as the father 's Y chromosome does not give instructions on that particular part of development and function . Women however have two chances to resist the disease , because if one of their X chromosomes loses the 50/50 chance then their other X chromosome can take over if it succeeds in its own 50/50 chance ( assuming both the mother and father are passing on the recessive gene , which is very unlikely ) . In summary this means that men contract more genetic diseases than women , and on average die sooner due to any number of these diseases .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "PMI IS Mortgage insurance. It stands for \"Private Mortgage Insurance\". This guy is just trying to get you to buy it from him instead of whoever you have it with now.  Your lender would always be on the policy since it is an insurance policy they hold (and you pay for) that protects them from you defaulting on the loan. Don't think of it as insurance for you in case you can't pay. If that should happen, your credit would still be trashed, the bank just wouldn't be out the money. You don't really get any benefit at all from it. It is just the way a bank can mitigate the risk of giving out large loans. This is why people are keen to drop it as soon as possible.  The whole thing about keeping the house in your estate after you die makes me think he is trying to sell you a different type of insurance called Mortgage Life Insurance. PMI isn't typically about that type of situation. Your estate will go into probate to work out your debts if you die and my understanding is that PMI doesn't usually pay out in that situation.  If this is what he is selling, buying such a policy would be on top of your PMI insurance payment, not instead of it. Be forewarned, personal finance experts usually consider mortgage life insurance to be a ripoff. If you want to protect against the risk of your heirs losing the house because they can't make the payments, you are better off with Term Life Insurance.  However, don't worry that they will inherit your debt on the house unless they are on the loan. If they don't want the house, they won't be obliged to make payments on it (unless they want to keep it). It won't affect their credit if they just walk away and let the bank have the house after you die unless they are on the note.

{"text": "Hair length is completely controlled by the length of the anagen phase of your hair follicle . How long this period lasts is generally determined mostly by genetics , but can also be affected by hormones , and even extreme stress . More specifically , there is a chemical signal that ultimately controls the exact growth cycle . Following the anagen phase is the catagen phase . It is n\u2019t yet known what triggers the catagen phase , but once it is triggered , the outer part of the root ends up being cut off from its nutrient supply ( blood ) , as well as the cells that produce new hair , thus your hair stops growing . This phase lasts about three weeks . Next up comes the telogen phase where the follicle is in a resting state and your hair is now a \u201c club hair \u201d , completely dead down to the root . During this stage , these hairs are relatively easy to pull out ( as can happen while brushing / combing / washing your hair ) , but if they manage to last long enough , they \u2019ll eventually be pushed out by a new hair as the cycle begins again . Obviously hairs on your arms or legs have a very different anagen period than hairs on your head , thus why your leg hair does n\u2019t grow two feet long without trimming . Further , different people , thanks mostly to their genetics , have differing lengths of the anagen period for a given body part compared to other people . For the hair on your head , the average length of the anagen phase is about 2 - 7 years . For your arms , legs , eyebrows , etc . , this phase usually lasts just 30 - 45 days . However , in extreme cases which are quite rare , some people have anagen periods for their heads as small as most people \u2019s anagen phases for their arms and legs . The opposite is also true , with people whose anagen phase can last decades for their scalp hair . Both of these extremes are very rare URL_0 any given time about 85%-90 % of your hair is in the anagen phase , 1 - 2 % is in the catagen phase , and 10 - 14 % is in the telogen phase . However , extreme stress can trigger the anagen phase to stop prematurely and hair can rapidly progress to the telogen phase , even as much as 70 % of the hair on your body . When this happens , the majority of your hair that should still be growing can fall out all at once . Under normal circumstances , though , you can get a rough estimate of how long your anagen phase is based on how long your hair grows naturally without cutting on a given area . First , assuming your hair is n\u2019t already as long as it can get , measure your hair length , then exactly a month later measure it again and note the difference . Now you have your growth rate ( usually about 1 cm every 28 days or 1 inch every 71 days ) . So if , without cutting , the hair on your head eventually grows 16 inches long max , then your anagen phase lasts : ( inches*period per inch ) . So using the average of 1 inch every 71 days , ( 16 inches * 71 days / inch ) = approximately 1136 days or 3.11 years . Now to specifically answer the second part of your question \u201c \u2026 but then when you cut it , it will grow back to its maximum length \u201d , this is just because when the cycle restarts , new hair comes in that can grow to the maximum length , eventually replacing the old hair that will be shorter than it could have been because you cut it . As you might have now guessed from the fact that hair growth is completely controlled by what \u2019s going on under the surface , within your hair follicles , and that genetics and hormones are the primary things determining hair growth length , which are in no way affected by shaving , shaving does not in any way alter your hair growth rate nor does it alter the color of the hair .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Noise reduction is the process of removing noise from a signal. Noise reduction techniques exist for audio and images. Noise reduction algorithms may distort the signal to some degree. Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio.\nAll signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device's mechanism or signal processing algorithms.\nIn electronic systems, a major type of noise is hiss created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise.\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger-sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise. To compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level.", "label": "hc3human"}

This means that if you aimed both of them at a white ceiling , your room would be lit up about the same amount . The laser , however has a much tighter beam ( about 2.1\u00d710 ^ -6 steradians vs about 10 for the candle ) . This means that the candle has about 1 candela while the laser has about 5 million . This means that the laser would be as bright from 5 million metres away as the candle would be from 1 . To explain lux , imagine you 're in a dark room and you 're trying to read a book .

This has been [ studied extensively ] ( URL_2 ) . Basically you run a propellant ( i.e. hydrogen ) through a hot reactor . It can be made to work , it 's just very expensive and it is very heavy . There are a lot of proposed ways to do this , but all basically work in a similar way . * Nuclear reactors as electricity sources , to power e.g. ion engines . [ This too has been studied quite a lot ] ( URL_0 ) . Again , heavy and expensive , but probably not a bad choice though for spacecraft meant to go pretty far in space .

Up - side is that it is one of the few really feasible ways to get big ships to go really fast over long distances . Why do n't we do any of these except for RTGs ? It 's probably not so much that any of the other designs are infeasible ( except maybe the exploding atomic bombs one , for political reasons ) , other than the fact that they are expensive ( though all space travel sort of is ) . It 's more likely the case that _ nobody is at all interested in building long - range , heavy - duty spacecraft _ . That is , the space - faring nations built up a space infrastructure around liquid fuel rockets , trying to achieve tasks that are pretty easily achieved through liquid fuel rockets \u2014 putting up satellites , for example . You do n't need nuclear rockets to put a satellite , or even the Space Shuttle , in space and you probably do n't get many advantages out of doing so \u2014 certainly no advantages worth the cost of switching systems for .

{"text": "You can certainly try to do this, but it's risky and very expensive. Consider a simplified example. You buy 1000 shares of ABC at $1.00 each, with the intention of selling them all when the price reaches $1.01. Rinse and repeat, right? You might think the example above will net you a tidy $10 profit. But you have to factor in trade commissions. Most brokerages are going to charge you per trade. Fidelity for example, want $4.95 per trade; that's for both the buying and the selling. So your 1000 shares actually cost you $1004.95, and then when you sell them for $1.01 each, they take their $4.95 fee again, leaving you with a measly $1.10 in profit. Meanwhile, your entire $1000 stake was at risk of never making ANY profit - you may have been unlucky enough to buy at the stock's peak price before a slow (or even fast) decline towards eventual bankruptcy.  The other problem with this is that you need a stock that is both stable and volatile at the same time. You need the volatility to ensure the price keeps swinging between your buy and sell thresholds, over and over again. You need stability to ensure it doesn't move well away from those thresholds altogether. If it doesn't have this weird stable-volatility thing, then you are shooting yourself in the foot by not holding the stock for longer: why sell for $1.01 if it goes up to $1.10 ten minutes later? Why buy for $1.00 when it keeps dropping to $0.95 ten minutes later? Your strategy means you are always taking the smallest possible profit, for the same amount of risk. Another method might be to only trade each stock once, and hope that you never pick a loser. Perhaps look for something that has been steadily climbing in price, buy, make your tiny profit, then move on to the next company. However you still have the risk of buying something at it's peak price and being in for an awfully long wait before you can cash out (if ever). And if all that wasn't enough to put you off, brokerages have special rules for \"frequent traders\" that just make it all the more complicated. Not worth the hassle IMO.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "1) Are the definitions for capital market from the two sources the same? Yes.  They are from two different perspectives.  Investopedia is looking at it primarily from the perspective of a trader and they lead-off with the secondary market. This refers to the secondary market: A market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities. This refers to the primary market: Organizations/institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds. Also, the Investopedia definition leaves much to be desired, but it is supposed to be pithy.  So, you are comparing apples and oranges, to some extent.  One is an article, as short as it may be, this other one is an entry in a dictionary. 2) What is the opposite of capital market, according to the definition in investopedia?  It's not quite about opposites, this is not physics.  However, that is not the issue here.  The Investopedia definition simply does not mention any other possibilities.  The Wikipedia article defines the term more thoroughly.  It talks about primary/secondary markets in separate paragraph. 3) According to the Wikipedia's definition, why does stock market belong to capital market, given that stocks can be held less than one year too? If you follow the link in the Wikipedia article to money market: As money became a commodity, the money market is nowadays a component of the financial markets for assets involved in short-term borrowing, lending, buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less. The key here is original maturities of one year or less. Here's my attempt at explaining this: Financial markets are comprised of money markets and capital markets.   Money is traded as if it were a commodity on the money markets.  Hence, the short-term nature in its definition.  They are more focused on the money itself.     Capital markets are focused on the money as a means to an end. Companies seek money in these markets for longer terms in order to improve their business in some way. A business may go to the money markets to access money quickly in order to deal with a short-term cash crunch.  Meanwhile, a business may go to the capital markets to seek money in order to expand its business. Note that capital markets came first and money markets are a relatively recent development.   Also, we are typically speaking about the secondary (capital) market when we are talking about the stock or bond market.  In this market, participants are merely trading among themselves.  The company that sought money by issuing that stock/bond certificate is out of the picture at that point and has its money.   So, Facebook got its money from participants in the primary market: the underwriters.  The underwriters then turned around and sold that stock in an IPO to the secondary market.  After the IPO, their stock trades on the secondary market where you or I have access to trade it.  That money flows between traders.  Facebook got its money at the \"beginning\" of the process.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Almost 80 years ago some local farmers began having problems with the local Emu population . The Emus believed themselves to be King Tut and strutted around the area . They had a large population and needed the land more than a few measly farmers . The farmers recognized they were greatly outnumbered and called in assistance from the Australian Government . They sent in military aid in the form of a handful of soldiers and automatic weapons . The Gods showed kindness to the Emus and sent rain , slowing the soldiers down for a bit . On November 2nd the Great Emu war began . Soldiers set up a firing line , but because the Emus are so cunning they recognized this and stayed outside of the effective firing range of the enemy soldiers weapons . Local farmers were sent out to try and lure the Emus into the ambush , but the Emus knew the trap and broke down into small herds / teams to make themselves more difficult to target . Unfortunately nearly a dozens Emus lost their lives that day . On November 4th the Australian soldiers were able to successfully set up a ambush near the local dam , a place where Emus went to refresh themselves with drink and bathe . The Gods once again smiled upon the Emus , no more than 12 fell that day before the coward Australian soldier guns jammed , stopping their assault and giving the Emus time to escape . Various mistakes on the soldiers part gave great help to the Emus being able to outlast their opponents . On November 8th the Emus were able to successfully push back the Australians after a battle of attrition . The Australians wasted numerous resources on this engagement for little results . Because of their victory the Emus were embolden , and began attacking crops , they were looking to make the local farmers pay for their collaboration with the Australian soldiers .

Since the end of the Great Emu war the Emus never once forgot the death and destruction that was inflicted upon them .

Your lowest balance would have been about $51k, and at this point the possibility of you losing your job was probably at a peak. Today you would be left with $170k assuming no withdrawal.

{"text": "This is a very complicated task , so let 's look at it from a historical perspective . The motivation behind the space race was to showcase American technical supremacy over the Russians . Doing this mission was considered so important , that expenditures well over 3 % of the total federal budget for a few years were deemed acceptable to accomplishing this goal . In addition , it was * not * a scientific mission primarily . It was a technological mission , and a show of technological supremacy . That 's why only one scientist ever went to the moon ; all others had a military background . After this goal was accomplished , the Russians scaled back their space program , and other issues became more pressing . The space program went through a period of great austerity , as it 's mission was reclassed to a discretionary spending program and primarily scientific mission . There was also a general understanding of how a space program would expand to spread humanity throughout the solar system . The accepted strategy was that humanity should focus on first building a permanent habitat in low Earth orbit ; a place to study , learn about space , practice building structures in space , and a base for future expansion missions . This is known as the [ Collier 's plan ] ( URL_0 ) , the 1952 space exploration roadmap laid out by Wernher von Braun and other scientists in the Collier magazine . This plan , for better or worse , has been the guide to space exploration objectives for the past 60 odd years . With the moon missions finished , the logical step was to focus on building the space station through which humanity could explore the solar system . This required ( or , people thought it did ) the creation of a ( somewhat ) reusable space shuttle , as the building project was expected to take many launches . The design of the shuttle took years to complete , and was much more complex than originally anticipated . Construction of the station took even longer to get started , as various presidential administrations decided they did n't want to be known for starting building one of the most expensive projects in history . Eventually , it morphed , went through numerous redesigns , added on international partners ( including the Russians ) , and started getting built . Building took longer than anticipated ( due in part to the Challenger and Columbia accidents ) , and full work on the station was n't completed until 2009 . It 's job finished , and it 's lifetime coming to an end , the shuttle was finally retired a few years ago . We 'll be sending astronauts back around the moon in just a few years ; not a bad turnaround time since the end of the shuttle , all things considered . So , why have n't we gone back ? Lack of political will , lack of funds , and scientific and research objectives that were focused on completing alternative projects . Exploration has been focused , in the last 40 years , on building the capability and knowledge base to survive in space , and we are now much more prepared to do that than we were when we first went to the moon , in spacecraft with limited life support systems , cramped spaces , and no power generating capacity .

Now, about your car: Your transportation to your job is very much one of your basic needs, as it will enable you to pay for your other needs.  If you can use public transportation until you can get a working car again, or you can find someone that will give you a ride, that will solve this problem.  If not, you'll need to get a working car. You definitely don't want to take out another loan for a car, as you are already having trouble paying the first loan.  I'm guessing that it will be less expensive to get the engine repaired than it will be to buy a new car at this point.  But that is just a guess.  You'll need to find out how much it will cost to fix the car, and see if you can swing it by perhaps eliminating expenses that aren't necessary, even for a short time.  For example, if you are paying installments on medical debt, you might have to skip a payment to fix your car.  It's not ideal, but if you are short on cash, it is a better option than losing your job or taking out even more debt for your car. Alternatively, buying another, functional car, if it costs less than fixing your current car, is an option.  If you don't have the money to pay your current car loan payments, you'll lose your current car. Just to be clear, many of these options will mess up your credit score.  However, borrowing more, in an attempt to save your credit score, will probably only put off the inevitable, as it will make paying everything off that much harder.  If you don't have enough income to pay your debts, you might be better off to just take the credit score ding, get back on your feet, and then work to eliminate the debt once you've got your basic needs covered. Sorry to hear about your situation.  Again, this advice is just general, and might not all apply to your financial details.  I recommend talking to the pastor of a local church and see if they have someone that can sit down with you and discuss your options.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Let 's imagine your computer is a dining room and the food is computer resources ( memory , cpu , disk space , i / o ) . Old operating systems served the food buffet style . ALL the food was put out and people just came in and had all they wanted . Naturally , people ( programs ) who came in later had less food to choose from . So we upgrade the operating system to include some multi - tasking rules . And we teach people ( programs ) how to form a line , take only one plate of food at a time , and this makes things more fair and manageable . This works so well that soon we had rules ( like \" please \" and \" thank you \" and asking people to \" pass \" things ) that enabled everyone to SIT at the table and enjoy a nice dinner together . It was great -- as long as everyone knew the rules . But kids do n't know the rules . And often , kids ca n't understand the rules if you explain them . So the kids keep running into the room and grabbing whatever they want from the table , being greedy , eating from other people 's plates , causing a mess and creating chaos . So we create a \" kids table . \" ( VMWare ) This is a completely separate table where the children can sit and food is brought to them ( they ca n't get their own ) . The kids are allowed to \" be kids \" and do what they want -- AS LONG AS THEY DON'T LEAVE THE TABLE . This keeps the adult table sane and pleasant , but someone DOES need to check in on the kids every so often . Most of the time the kids are sitting quietly , playing , doing their own thing . Sometimes , though , there 's a \" Lord of the Flies \" situation and some cleanup is necessary . Docker , in this example , is for slightly older \" kids . \" Kids who are \" ready \" to sit at the adult table . Docker is the equivalent of saying to a program \" you can sit here but you do NOT speak unless spoken to , you sit up straight , eat slowly , no slurping , say please and thank you , do not tell that joke you know ... \" These limitations allow the kid to BE at the adult table , while not really being an adult . It requires a different kind of management than kids sandboxed at the kid 's table . Not really less or more , just different . The advantage is that it 's much easier to set an extra place at the table than to set up a whole other table . Edit : I hated how this was written . Re - wrote for clarity . This is , more or less , the technical difference : In vmware , programs are treated like wild animals who must be put in different cages to be fed or they would fight over their food . In Docker , the programs are more like people at a restaurant , who know not to eat from their neighbor 's table ( or people at a thanksgiving table , who know which plate is theirs ) , and so are allowed to occupy the same room at meal time .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "They might be predicting one of two things ( potentially both of them ) . Either they 're saying that the purchasing power of the dollar could go down ( IE - let 's say an apple that costs $ 3 today suddenly costs $ 4.50 ) due to inflation , so any money you currently hold , ignoring everything else , is worth less . The other thing they could mean is that the dollar could decrease in value relative to other currencies . Currencies are typically measured against each other . An American Dollar might get you $ 1.10 Canadian today and in a year , it might get you $ 1.20 or only 90 cents . That matters because countries trade with each other and it makes the cost of imported good more / less expensive ( so if you 're buying apples from Canada and the Canadian Dollar is more valuable , those apples will cost more ) and it will make your exports more / less expensive ( if the American dollar increases in value , then Canadians might be less inclined to buy American apples ) . It 's important to note that a currency devaluing is n't inherently undesirable . In fact , some countries prefer to keep the value of their currency down relative to others .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Note : this is a simplified explanation . This is because this thread is in ELI5 . BMP stores your image as data in a grid . It essentially stores information as X1 , Y1 : blue . X2 , Y1 : blue . X3 , Y1 , red . It ( normally ) has no compression at all and takes up a huge amount of space on disk . TGA works similarly to BMP , but also supports more features . Most important is the ability to store \" transparency \" - that is , how \" much \" of a color shows as opaque vs how much it lets whatever is \" behind \" it bleed through . This format takes even more space than BMP in normal situations , but can support compression ( it usually does n't ) . PNG is similar to BMP and TGA in that it is \" lossless \" . If you save your image as a PNG , it will look EXACTLY the same in the future . No data will be lost . Like TGA , it also supports transparency . The key difference is that it 's a more modern format and is always compressed . This means it will take SUBSTANTIALLY less space than BMP or TGA under default settings . JPG is the \" lossy \" image storage format . Saving an image as a JPG will always lose data - even if you already have a JPG , and change only a small item - after re - saving it , you will lose more data . It works by telling the computer \" I want an image that looks like this \" . The computer then decides what the best approximation of that image would be to the human eye , and how best to save that without taking up too much space . It then saves the approximation to disk . This means the image will ALWAYS lose data . To summarize : * BMP has its uses . But typically most people do not want to use this format unless you need it specifically for a programming reason . * TGA used to be the \" de - facto \" lossless format years ago . It currently takes much more space than PNG and is n't worth your time unless you need it specifically for a programming reason . * PNG is the best format to use if you MUST have \" lossless \" image saving . Since it 's compressed differently from JPG , it can actually beat JPG in size AND quality when the image contains large blocks of exact solid colors . It also is the only good choice among these 4 for transparent images used on web pages . * JPG is the best format to use for photos if size is a concern . It offers the best balance of speed , usability , and quality for images which come from a photographic source and have many real - life incongruities which are otherwise indistinguishable to the naked eye .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Let 's try an intuitive , rather than mathematical explanation . Generalizations , sweeping statements and oversimplifications will be made : Imagine you want to alphabetize your baseball card collection . It should be easy to see that if you only have 3 cards , you can solve this problem a lot quicker than if you have 3000 of them . Now imagine you still have n't organized your collection and you want to check if you have Albert Pujols somewhere in your pile of cards . Again , if you only have 3 cards , you can find the answer to this problem quickly ; but if you have 3000 , it might take you all afternoon . A lot of problems , the interesting ones that mathematicians like to study , are like that - the bigger the set of things that you have to look at to solve a particular problem ( let 's call this the \" input \" to the problem ) , the longer it will take to solve . * * Big - O notation aims to give you an idea of how much longer it will take to solve a problem as the input gets bigger and bigger . * * Notice I did n't say \" how long \" it takes , but * how much longer it takes * for every extra element you add to the input . Big - O notation says \" as the input gets bigger , the time it takes to solve the problem will grow by * * no more * * than this factor here . \" Going back to the Pujols problem , the only way to solve it is to look at every card in the pile . Sure , we might get lucky and find the card we 're looking for in the first try , but in the worst - case scenario we 'll find it dead last or not find it at all ; we 'll just have to look at every card to be sure we 've got the right answer . If looking at one card takes 1 second , looking at three cards will take 3 seconds , but looking at three thousand cards will take 3000 seconds . So to solve the Pujols problem it will take some constant amount of time ( e.g. , 1 second ) for every element of the input ( e.g. , 3000 cards ) . Conventionally , we call the size of the input * n * , so the total amount of time to find Pujols in an unsorted pile of cards is * n\\*1sec * . Since the 1 second is constant , the only thing really affecting how much longer it takes to solve the problem as * n * gets larger , is * n * itself , so we say that the Pujols problem is * O(n ) * ( pronounced \" Big - O of * n * \" or alternatively \" Order * n * . \" ) Now let 's imagine I asked you to find the Pujols card * * after * * you alphabetized all 3000 cards in your collection . This is a much quicker problem to solve ! Just turn to the \" P \" section of your card binder and look at every card . If turning to the right page takes 5 seconds and every section in the binder holds at most 200 cards ( remember , looking at a card takes 1 second ) then the worst - case scenario for finding Pujols will take * 5sec + ( 200\\*1sec ) = * * * 205 seconds * * ( you can actually make this quicker , but I 'm not going to get into that . Google \" binary search \" ) . You could have 200 cards , or you could have 5000 cards and it would still take 205 seconds in the worst case , usually a lot quicker . So by alphabetizing and indexing ( computer scientists would call this \" hashing \" ) your collection , you essentially made the size of the input irrelevant , we can now solve the Pujols problem in constant worst - case time . In Big - O notation , we denote this * O(1 ) * , which is like saying \" adding elements to the input multiplies the time it takes to solve the problem by a factor of * 1 * \" - no time increase at all . Other problems can respond differently to increasing * n * , so you 'll see things like * O(log n ) , O(n log n ) , O(n^2 ) , O(2^n ) * and many other variations . The important thing to remember is that the function between the parenthesis gives you an upper limit to how fast the time to solve a problem grows as the size of the input grows . The time could always grow slower than what the Big - O notation says , but never faster .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Since no one else has jumped in . Firstly , see the post on [ offshore bank accounts ] ( URL_0 ) it explains money laundering as well . So , I 'm a person who wants to make money in a less then legal fashion . Lets say I extort people with threats of burning down their house . I make a million dollars every quarter doing this . For me to spend this money on things I enjoy , it needs to be legitimate . Should the feds take a look at me , because I own a mansion with 12 swimming pools ( I like swimming in different temperatures ) I 'll need to account for where all my money is coming from . So , the money that I get from my extorting , is dirty . I ca n't spend it , or it could be traced back to my illegal activities . I need to make it appear as though I legitimately earned this money . This is where money laundering comes in . I run a legitimate carpet cleaning business . It has a store front , I have carpet cleaning equipment , maybe I even clean a carpet every once in a while . In reality , I rarely clean a carpet , but by the books , this is one of the most successful carpet cleaning business in town . When I get $ 500 from someone in exchange for not burning down their house , I enter this money as profit into the carpet cleaning business . I make appropriate receipts , and even create customers . I can take the money to the bank , and deposit it in the carpet cleaning account . This money , is arguably now \" clean \" . It is appear to be legitimately earned income . I can spend it , as the owner of the carpet cleaning business . Hell , I could even pay taxes on it ( I probably wo n't , see the off shore banking ) . This same thing is done many times , with a great number of businesses . Although a paper trail as simple as the one I laid out could be easily followed , when you do this many times , the trail is harder to follow . So maybe I have an organisation , some of the businesses are more legitimate then others . All of them move money around for me in exchange for a small fee . Some times you actually get something in return , like say , I do n't want to carry around my extorted money . So I go to the butcher and buy some bacon , I get a couple pounds of bacon and spend a few hundred dollars on it . This excess pays to pick up the butchers dry cleaning , a few hundred for a clean pressed shirt . The dry cleaner takes the excess to another business . ( Remember , all this does n't actually have to involve money moving , just the paperwork involved so that when inspected , it appear legitimate ) Lather , rinse , repeat .

{"text": "I want to first state that I'm not an attorney and this is not a response that would be considered legal advice.  I'm going to assume this was a loan was made in the USA.  The OP didnt specify.   A typical auto loan has a borrower and a co-borrower or \"cosigner\".  The first signer on the contract is considered the \"primary\".  As to your question about a primary being a co-borrower my answer would be no.  Primary simply means first signer and you can't be a first signer and a co-borrower.  Both borrower and co-borrower, unless the contract specifies different, are equally responsible for the auto loan regardless if you're a borrower or a co-borrower (primary or not primary).     I'm not sure if there was a situation not specified that prompted the question.  Just remember that when you add a co-borrower their positive and negative financials are handled equally as the borrower.  So in some cases a co-borrower can make the loan not qualify.

{"text": "Unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change. Gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company (which you would be working for). There are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly, and you should definitely consult an RIA (registered investment adviser) before investing in something that isn't extremely standardized (traded on an major exchange). The issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized (in terms of legal structure/settlement terms). Registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are (theoretically) given specific training to understand these kinds of non-standard investments and are (theoretically) qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these, make well informed investment decisions, and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme.  There are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups. What % of the company/ the company's profits are you entitled to? How long can the company go without paying you a dividend? Do they have to pay you a dividend at all? How liquid will your investment in the company be? Unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business, and other non-standard contract clauses. For example, some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business. This makes your investment essentially worthless - the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend. If you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either. The probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small.. so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment (though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow!)  Overall, the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned. If you want to invest in companies on FundersClub build a relationship with an RIA and work with that person to invest your money. It is easier, less risky, and not all that more expensive :)", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "As far as I understand, OP seems to be literally asking: \"why, regarding the various contracts on various exchanges (CBE, etc), is it that in some cases they are 'cash settled' and in some 'physically settled' -?\" The answer is only that \"the exchange in question happens to offer it that way.\" Note that it's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically, and happens in the billions as a daily matter.  Conversely zillions in \"cash settled\" contracts play out each day.  Both are totally commonplace. Different businesses or entities or traders would use the two \"varieties\" for sundry reasons. The different exchanges offer the different varieties, ultimately I guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable.  There's no \"galactic council\" or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering - ! Recall that \"a given futures contracts market\" is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company (just like Burger King sells different products). I believe in another aspect of the question, OP is asking basically:  \"Why is there not, a futures contract, of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts, of currency futures, which, is 'physically' settled rather than cash settled ..?\" If that's the question the answer is just \"whatever, nobody's done it yet\".  (Or, it may well exist.  But it seems extremely unlikely?  \"physically\" settled currencies futures are for entities operating in the zillions.)

France has 10.4 % unemployment whilst the UK has 7.1 % . Not only that , but the only labour reforms France has bother to undergo have come at the margin and this has led to a more pronounced dual sector labour market .

Pretty much any time , day or night , if you said to yourself \" I am going to go pee , even though I do n't need to , \" you would manage to pee at least something . Your stool , unlike your urine , is based on the food that you eat . You eat food in short time segments , in between which are long periods of not - eating . The food you eat has a VERY long path to travel from your mouth to your bowel , so long that when you pass stool , it is probably from food you ate the day before . Since food passes through your digestive tract slowly , the individual food - remains stay separated , and the urge to pass each stool only arises when the fecal matter comes into the area of the anal sphincter , which your brain interprets as a need to use the toilet . The release of stool and the release of urine both require relaxing sphincters in your pelvic region . So when you need to poo , it is simply convenient also to pee ( as you are pretty much guaranteed to have urine waiting to be expelled ) .

{"text": "Social darwinism is an attempt to use Darwin 's idea of natural selection , or \" the survival of the fittest , \" to explain or , in my experience usually * justify * , the mistreatment of one group of humans by another . In normal polite discourse , it is almost never a good thing to be accused of being a Social Darwinist . Social Darwinism has an ugly history of being used to justify mistreatment of groups of people and even genocide . People who may subscribe to some ideas of Social Darwinism usually do n't like to use the term because of the ugly connotations . Here 's an example : why are some people poor ? The Social Darwinist would say some people are poor because they are dumber , lazier , or otherwise not as capable of competing with smarter , harder working , * richer * people . Similar to how natural selection causes less fit types of organisms get outcompeted by more fit ones , the Social Darwinist would believe that poor people will over time be removed from the gene pool because they can not compete with the people who are more fit . Basically , survival of the fittest for humans . Here 's where it gets really ugly . If you believe in survival of the fittest for humans , you might think it is in humanity 's best interest and therefore your duty to oppress or even kill the \" lesser people . \" This leads to all kinds of persecutions . How do groups wind up on the list of \" lesser people ? \" Usually , historical biases . Nazi Germany is sometimes considered to be a Social Darwinist regime ( there is some debate about their motivations ) . They believed the Aryan race to be superior to the Jews and gypsies and actively tried to kill them . By exterminating the undesirables they believed they were making the gene pool stronger . So Social Darwinism became a justification to murder millions of people they did n't like . It is pretty easy to see how Social Darwinism can be used to justify genocide . It is n't just genocide though . This principle was used to justify colonialism and imperialism as well . As with people and gene pools , it was believe that stronger cultures would dominate over weaker cultures . The prevailing thought was that Europeans and European culture were superior and therefore it was desirable that they ruled over other groups of people and destroyed their cultures . In a nutshell , under Social Darwinism if you do n't like a group of people you can justify your mistreatment of them by saying that you are strong and they are weak . Therefore , it 's a * good * thing when you mistreat them or kill them . This is all sorts of awful , and why Social Darwinism gets a bad rap .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "As someone who dislikes them all equally , I 'll give it a go . At least no one can accuse me of being biased . * * Conservatives * * - nicknamed the Tories . The larger party in the current coalition government . A centre - right party , and so are interested in lowering taxes and using free trade as a means to bolster the economy . They believe in small government , which under Thatcher meant privatisation of public services like railways , utilities and the mail . These services used to be run by the government , but were sold off to private companies . Under the current administration , they have been cutting the budgets of remaining public services like welfare , local authorities and the NHS at the same time as cutting taxes for top - earners and letting companies like Starbucks and Vodafone away with not paying corporation tax . Basically letting the rich get richer and the poor get shat on . * * Labour * * - traditionally the party of the working class , and up until the late 1990s , the opposite of the Tories . They are a centre - left party , interested in a society in which the rich help the poor by way of free public services , a robust welfare system , and higher taxation for the wealthy . Before the 1997 general election , Tony Blair took the party in a new direction ( \" New Labour \" ) which similarly appealed to the middle classes as well as the working class . Effectively , he moved the party away from all - out socialism to a more centrist party . The party is now at odds with itself , with some members looking for \" Blairism , \" a more centrist party , and others still rocking the old socialism . The party does not have a strong leader , they are about to lose swathes of voters in Scotland which was previously a Labour stronghold ( more on this later ) , and do not have policies which could reverse the damage done to the lower classes ' quality of life under the current administration . If British politics was Sega vs Nintendo in the 90s , then Labour are Sega . They used to be giants , now they 're fucking nothing . * * Liberal Democrats * * - The smaller party in the current coalition . Another centre - left party , but a little more radical and progressive than Labour . Since Tony Blair , they have moved to occupy the leftist void left by Labour 's move to the centre . They have always been a little too intellectual and \" out there \" to engage the working class as Labour did , but they have strong policies on social justice , welfare and the role of local authority . There were a strong third party when British politics was all Labour vs Tory . Since coming to power as part of the coalition , the party has been on a thundering campaign of self - harm . They do n't have the electoral clout to stop the Tories ' harsher policies , and have gone back on their own election promises ( like not raising tuition fees ) . Their leader was once seen as a ray of sunshine in British politics , now he is just Cameron 's stooge . * * UKIP * * - the UK Independence party . The party started as a crowd of ex - Tories who were annoyed by the Conservative party 's embracing of European politics . They pledged to withdraw the UK from the European Union . They do alarmingly well in council and European elections , and seem to draw media attention far greater than their electoral representation should warrant . They have policies on immigration that seem outright racist , and have a habit of blaming immigration for all the country 's woes . People will still vote for them , because people turn to nationalism in times of austerity , sad as that is . * * SNP * * - the Scottish National Party . Speaking of nationalism ... There was a referendum on Scottish independence this year . The pro - independence side lost , but not by very much . The final vote was 55%-45 % in favour of staying in the union . The SNP was the largest party in the Yes coalition ( the pro - indy side ) , and their membership has skyrocketed since the referendum . They are now apparently the third - largest party in the UK , despite only representing 10 % of its population . Scottish Labour were pro - union during the referendum , which many party supporters saw as a betrayal , since they were jumping into bed with the Tories ( properly called the Conservative & Unionist Party ) . Labour support in Scotland has plummeted . Away from the referendum , the SNP do extraordinarily well as leaders of the devolved Scottish Government . They are the majority party in an electoral system that is not supposed to allow one party to hold an outright majority . They have very popular policies like free travel for over-60s , free prescriptions for all , low tuition fees and a student loan system , and a freeze on council tax . They are expected to do very well indeed in the next general election , perhaps representing a majority of Scottish voters at Westminster . * * Plaid Cymru * * - the Welsh national party . Not as popular as the SNP , but not as radical either . They do n't advocate an independent Wales ( despite a lot of Welsh support for just that ) , they only seek to look after Welsh interests in Westminster and the Welsh assembly , which they lead in coalition with Labour . With nationalism on the rise nationwide , they may see a surge in votes at the next election , but not to the same degree as the SNP are expected to . * * Greens * * - as with Green parties worldwide , they have policies of environmental responsibility , sustainability and social justice . I actually like their policies a lot , I 'm even a member , but this is not their time . The Scottish Greens were pro - independence and saw a similar surge in membership post - referendum , but not on anything like the scale that the SNP saw . The Green Party of England & Wales have an elected member and look likely to add a couple more by careful targeting of election seats , but they are n't a party of government quite yet . * * Others * * - there 's also all the Northern Irish parties , which would be an essay unto themselves , and a bunch of parties without any seats right now who do n't look likely to get any in the next election , like the Christian Democratic Party , the Pirate Party , the Scottish Socialists , the Monster Raving Loony Party ...", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A lien is a mechanism to impede legal title transfer of a vehicle, real property, or sometimes, expensive business equipment.  That's why title companies exist - to make sure there are no liens against something before a buyer hands money to a seller. The lien can be attached to a loan, unpaid labor related to the item (a mechanic's lien) or unpaid taxes, and there are other scenarios where this could occur. The gist of all this is that the seller of the vehicle mentioned does not have clear title if there is a lien.  This introduces a risk for the buyer.  The buyer can pay the seller the money to cover the lien (in the case of a bank loan) but that doesn't mean the seller will actually pay off the loan (so the title is never clear!).  This article recommends visiting the bank with the seller, and getting title on-the-spot.  However, this isn't always an option, as a local bank branch isn't probably going to have the title document available, though the seller might be able to make some arrangement for a local branch to have the title available before a visit to pay off the loan. The low-risk approach is for the seller to have clear title before any money changes hands.", "label": "hc3human"}

This is because higher velocities of the particles equates to higher energy available , and some subatomic interactions require an awful lot of energy .

Entropy really involves probability . In statistical mechanics ( kinda like thermodynamics ) , a system is described by its * microstates * , the possible states the system can be in . Take , for example , a row of 5 boxes and 20 distinguishable balls ( assume any box can have any number of balls ) . A possible microstate is 20 balls in the 1st box ; another microstate may be 4 balls in each box . How many total microstates are there ? Well , each ball has 5 choices of box to be placed in . You have 20 balls , so the total number of microstates is 5 ^ 20 ( a huge number ) . Now let us * only consider microstates where all 20 balls are in the same box * ( i.e. , 20 in box 1 , 20 in box 2 , etc . ) There are only 5 of these microstates .

There are now 305540235000 microstates for this situation ( not important how I got that , may be wrong anyway ) . The probability of this state is about 0.3 % as opposed to the 0.0000000000005 % chance all balls are in the same box . 0.3 % sounds small , but it is much much much more likely than 0.00000000000005 % . * * The system is morelikely to evolve to this * consistent * state because it is more probable . * * Another analogy may be shuffling cards .

{"text": "One analogy for the immune system could be like the role of the police within a city . Just as a city is made up of many individual people , houses , and industries , our bodies are made up of many individual cells that work together to make us alive . Just like in our modern cities , the vast majority of citizens are good but there 's always the shadowy threat of bad guys lurking out there . The police have many difficult but essential tasks including : To work out who is good and who is bad ( surveillance ) To actively hunt down the bad guys ( enforcement ) To always be prepared to rapidly mobilise a decisive response when something really serious happens ( counter - terrorism ) Each task requires a different approach . One branch of the immune system responds immediately to crimes in a simplistic fashion when they happen , like a security guard . Later on , a second branch shows up to crime scenes , collects evidence and creates a criminal profile , like a detective . Another branch monitors traffic in streets ( or the blood vessels ) for individuals who match these profiles , like a traffic cop . Yet another branch carefully scans the outside of each house to determine if there is suspicious activity occurring within , like the FBI . We know a lot about the \" how \" of your question , but the \" why \" is much less clear . What can be said is that allergies tend to be associated with a branch that acts like a warning siren . For some reason the detectives wrongly create a profile of a suspected criminal ( Mr Peanut B. Sandwich ) and send it to this alarm system which lies dormant until a match is made on the profile . When a match is made the response is very rapid and aggressive -- loud sirens go off all over the city and everyone starts to panic like there 's some kind of terrorist attack . All available defense personnel are mobilised and start roaming the city . In the confusion , vital systems struggle . Traffic in the streets grinds to a halt ( blood does n't flow very well around the body ) and the city stops functioning properly . Now , it turns out this is a false alarm -- we all know Mr P. B. Sandwich is innocent . But the police have no way of knowing this and continue to freak out and make you sick whenever he is detected . Why do we have this alarm system in the first place ? Hard to say . One theory is that it was developed to deal with parasitic worms , compared to the individual police they are gigantic monsters like Godzilla . Another is that it helps to protect from poisons ( bee venom ) by provoking a huge reaction against a dire threat , like chemical or biological terrorist attack . You ask about a cure . One method of treatment that succeeds in some people is * desensitisation * . Medical personnel introduce the barest trace of Mr P. B. Sandwich into the body , say just a single hair from his head . This is identified but there 's so little evidence of his presence that the reaction is small -- at most it might set off a couple of car alarms . When detectives investigate they find that no crime was committed . Exposing the body to tiny peanut fragments is repeated every couple of weeks and eventually the detectives start to put 2 and 2 together and realise that maybe Mr P. B. Sandwich has been falsely accused . With enough time larger and larger doses of peanut can be introduced without creating a huge panic ( the medical word for this \" panic \" is anaphylaxis ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

Do I need to discount the cashflow to the present, and if so, how? Yes, you need to discount every cash flow to the present time, not just the first one.   When discounting cash flows, the appropriate discount rate needs to represent the opportunity cost of the initial cash outlay.  Meaning if you were to use that money for something else, what rate of return would you expect? You could be safe and assume only a risk-free return (like 2-3%) or use the average rate of return of other investments (e.g. 10-15%). Another common approach is to use your cost of capital if you're raising funds for the project, or would instead have use the funds to pay off existing debt. Once you find a relevant discount rate, then just discount each cash flow by dividing them by e^rt, where r is the annualized discount rate (e.g. 0.10 for 10%) and t is the decimal number of years between now and the cash flow (e.g. 1.5 for 18 months)", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I don't know the legal framework for RSUs, so I'm not sure what is mandatory and what is chosen by the company issuing them. I recently reviewed one companies offering and it basically looked like a flat purchase of stock on the VEST date. So even if I got a zillion shares for $1 GRANTED to me, if it was 100 shares that vested at $100 on the 1st, then I would owe tax on the market value on the day of vest. Further, the company would withhold 25% of the VEST for federal taxes and 10% for state taxes, if I lived in a state with income tax. The withholding rate was flat, regardless of what my actual tax rate was. Capital gains on the change from the market value on the VEST date was calculated as short-term or long-term based on the time since the VEST date. So if my 100 shares went up to $120, I would pay the $20 difference as short term or long term based on how long I had owned them since the VEST. That said, I don't know if this is universal. Your HR folks should be able to help answer at least some of these questions, though I know their favorite response when they don't know is that you should consult a tax professional.

{"text": "Disclaimer: I work in life insurance, but I am not an agent.   First things first, there is not enough information here to give you an answer.  When discussing life insurance, the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values, and the contract itself.  Without these, there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not. So what are the things to look for? A. Risk appetite.  People love to discuss projections of the market, like for example, \"7-8% a year compounded annually\".  Go look at the historical returns of the stock market.  It is never close to that projection.  Life insurance, however, can give you a GUARANTEED return (this would be show in the 'Guaranteed' section of the life insurance illustration).  As long as you pay your premiums, this money is guaranteed to accrue.  Now most life insurance companies also show 'Non-Guaranteed' elements in their illustrations - these are non-guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time.  These columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy (and used to buy paid-up additional insurance, which generates more dividends - this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest).   B. Tax treatment.  I am definitely not an expert in this area, but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment, particularly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries.  Any death benefit (again, listed as guaranteed and maybe non-guaranteed values) is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary. D. Strategy.  Tying all of this together, what exactly is the point of this?  To transfer wealth, to accrue wealth, or some combination thereof?  This is important and unstated in your question. So again, without knowing more, there is no way to answer your question.  But I am surprised that in this forum, so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam.  And even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted. My personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth, you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component.  This is mostly due to your age (higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup) and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy.  But if a 25 year old asked this same question, depending on his purposes, I may suggest that a WL policy is in fact a good idea.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What a lot of people seem not to realize is that there are * tiers * of government in the United States . Assuming you 're a civilian living in a typical place in the United States \u2014 that is , not American Samoa or whatever \u2014 you may be within the jurisdiction of as many as five separate democratically or semi - democratically elected governments : the municipality , the township , the county , the state and the union . Certain hard limits are placed on lower tiers by upper tiers , particularly regarding how those lower tiers must respect basic civil rights . For example , it would be unlawful for * any * tier of government in the United States to charge a poll tax during an election . It 's prohibited by law , and if attempted would be challenged in a court of appropriate jurisdiction and overturned . However , within those basic limits , each tier is more or less left at its own discretion to organize itself however it wants , and that includes setting the rules for local elections . As long as those rules do n't violate fundamental principles of law , the individual bodies politic can do * whatever . * If some municipal government somewhere wanted to change its method of electing its mayor from election by ballot to election by acclamation , and the laws of the locally relevant upper tiers of government \u2014 meaning the state constitution , basically \u2014 did n't expressly prohibit it , they could go right ahead .

{"text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a Price-weighted index.  That means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant, the \"Dow divisor\".  (The value of the Dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the roster.)  This has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price.  That is, if a stock costing $100 per share goes up by 1%, that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing $10 per share goes up by the same 1%. Now look at the price of Google.  It's currently trading at just a whisker under $700 per share.  Most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between $30 and $150, so if Google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index.  That means that relatively small blips in Google's price would completely dominate the index on any given day.  Until June of 2014, Apple was in the same boat, with its stock trading at about $700 per share.  At that time, Apple split its stock 7:1, and after that its stock price was a little under $100 per share.  So, post-split Apple might be a candidate to be included in the Dow the next time they change up the components of the index.  Since the Dow is fixed at 30 stocks, and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors, this probably wouldn't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason.  (Correction: Apple is in the DJIA and has been for a little over a year now.  Mea culpa.) The Dow's price-weighting is unusual as stock indices go.  Most indices are weighted by market capitalization.  That means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value.  This causes large companies like Apple to have a lot of influence on those indices, but since market capitalization isn't as arbitrary as stock price, most people see that as ok.  Also, notice that I said \"company\" and not \"stock\".  When a company has multiple classes of share (as Google does), market-cap-weighted indices include all of the share classes, while the Dow has no provision for such situations, which is another, albeit less important, reason why Google isn't in the Dow.  (Keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the S&P 500.  The answer is (currently) 505!) Finally, you might be wondering why the Dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations.  The answer is that the Dow averages go back to 1896, when Charles Dow used to calculate the averages by hand.  If your only tools are a pencil and paper, then a price-weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market-cap-weighted index with hundreds of constituents.

Generally you see the passenger flipping through a big book of maps ... that 's him tracing their position . The passenger and driver are communicating about what to do next . The passenger will let the driver know that in X meters there will be a turn . Additionally he tells the driver how sharp the turn is , so that the driver knows how fast he should be going into the turn , and how hard to turn the wheel . Essentially , he communicates the nature of the course to the driver , and the driver interprets and executes his instructions . So , yes , the driver does n't memorize the course . Rally drivers can do rally 's on many different courses in a single day . It would be impossible to memorize every turn like a NASCAR driver does ( extreme analogy , i know ) . But , there is so much going on , too , that a mistake because the driver forgot what turn they were going in to would result in a loss or a crash . The driver relies on the passenger for all instruction regarding his driving . Edit : I guess they are n't reading \" maps . \" Instead they are notes regarding the course , where the turns are , the severity , etc . But , really ... they serve the same purpose as maps .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Ditto mhoran_psprep.  I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Where does the money come from? When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock -- to raise initial capital. But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors. Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers. (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said, some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the bank's expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank. If you're thinking, \"Wow, I'm paying back a whole lot more than I borrowed\", well, yes. But remember you're borrowing that money for 20 or 30 years. The bank isn't making very much money on the loan each year that you have it -- these days something like 4 or 5% in the U.S., I don't know what the going rates are in other countries.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Some of the factors that will act on house prices are: There will likely be a recession in that country, which will lower incomes and probably lower housing prices. It will likely be harder to get credit in that country so that too will increase demand and depress demand for housing (cf the USA in 2010.) If Greece leaves the Euro, that will possibly depress future economic growth, through decreased trade and investment, and possibly decreased transfer payments. Eventually the budget will need to come back into balanced which also is likely to push down house prices. In some European countries (most famously Spain) there's been a lot of speculative building which is likely to hang over the market. Both countries have governance and mandate problems, and who knows how long or how much turmoil it will take to sort that out. Some of these factors may already be priced in, and perhaps prices are already near what will turn out to be the low. In the Euro zone you have the nearly unprecedented situation of the countries being very strongly tied into another currency, so the typical exchange-rate movements that played out in Argentina cannot act here.  A lot will depend on whether the countries are bailed out, or leave the Euro (and if so how), etc.  Typically inflation has been a knock-on effect of the exchange rate moves so it's hard to see if that will happen in Greece. Looking back from 2031, buying in southern Europe in 2011 may turn out to be a good investment.  But I don't think you could reasonably call it a safe defensive investment.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In more a scientific sense , entropy is a measure of the probability of certain states . Think of a glass of salt water , the most probable distribution of the water and salt molecules is that of an essentially even distribution throughout the glass . This would be considered a state of high entropy as it is very probable on a statistical level . Conversely , if all the salt and all the water were to spontaneously separate within the glass to form two distinct layers , there is far fewer distributions of the salt and water atoms that could lead to this state . This would be considered a low entropy system , as it is far less statistically probable . When it is said that isolated systems tent towards a state of higher entropy , it is because those states are more probable and therefore are more likely to occur . This is hard to explain much farther beyond this point without getting into thermodynamics and statistical mechanics . On a related note , one point I want to make is that entropy can decrease in a system that is not isolated . In the case of the earth , entropy of the earth is decreasing as we compartmentalize chemicals and form distinct organisms . This is possible because we 're being subjected to MASSIVE amounts of energy from the sun , which is then harnessed to go against the favorability of higher entropic states . The sun is gaining entropy by ejecting energy that we use to lower our entropy . If you 're interested in a more thorough explanation , this is a good introduction : URL_0", "label": "hc3human"}

If no funds are available at a pin-presented transaction, the payment is simply declined. No fee, no overdraft, no mess. 2) This sticking point for a recurring transaction, is that merchants such as Netflix, Gold's Gym etc, CHOOSE to allow payments like this, BECAUSE they are assured they are going to get paid by the financial institution. It prevents them from having issues. Only a gift card will not cost you more money than you put in, BUT I know of several institutions, that too many non-payment periods can cause them to cease doing business with you in the future.

{"text": "Plasma is just gas . But it 's a weird kind of gas which is electrically conductive . And it 's glowing . In detail : normal gas is made of molecules or atoms . Plasma is a gas that 's half made of positively - charged molecules , and half of freed electrons that were knocked off of the molecules . For example with air , instead of nitrogen molecules , an air plasma would be made from a cloud of electrons and a cloud of positive - charged nitrogen molecules . ( Yeah yeah yeah , same with O2 molecules too . ) Or , you could think of plasma as a second kind of evaporation . First the liquid nitrogen evaporates to become nitrogen molecules . Then the molecules themselves \" evaporate \" to become a cloud of electrons and positive nitrogen molecules in equal quantities . One confusing part : we can make plasma by using extremely high temperature , but we can also make it at room temperature using high voltage . Sparks of \" electricity \" are actually air which has been turned into plasma . Glowing blue \" electricity \" does n't exist , the glowing stuff is air - plasma we 've been seeing all along . Lightning bolts ? They 're outbreaks of plasma in air . Lightning is dangerous because it 's a conductor like a wire . So , storm clouds can convert the empty air into a conductive wire , then unreel the wire down to the ground and set things on fire with a huge electric current ? ! ! Yep . The glowy stuff inside neon signs ? Plasma . Strobe lights and camera flash tubes ? Plasma . At sea - level pressure , electrical plasma in air is weird : it 's a \" dendrite . \" It 's like a growth of frost needles , or of metal crystal dendrites , where the tip of each filament grows faster than the sides . Once you have some highly - charged plasma in air , the tips of the sharp conductive filaments will convert more air into plasma , so the tips grow very fast . But it need not be this way : in low pressure gas , the electric plasma grows as big fuzzy patches and globs , rather than thin branching dendrites . So , why do n't the electrons just fall back to the positive - charged atoms , so it turns back to normal gas ? This happens . To keep plasma glowing , either we have to apply a huge voltage - field that slams electrons into the atoms ( and frees more electrons , ) that or we have to heat the gas up to around 20,000F degrees , so the slamming atoms are hitting hard enough to knock their own electrons loose . We had a plasma torch at work , an old \" ICP spectrometer \" from the late 1960s . The plasma inside it was like a flame about an inch across , and bright as an electric welder . Only watch it through the black glass window . PS Orange flames are n't plasma , instead they 're glowing bits of carbon .

{"text": "For starters, the risk-free rate has nothing to do with stocks.  It would be independent of anything.  It pays out the same return in all states of nature.  The definition of a risk-free asset is that regardless of how the universe turns out, including a meteor striking the Earth killing everyone but the recipient, then the payout would happen exactly as planned.  One could imagine a computer still being on, connected to a power supply and printing a check.  Most people use the 90-day t-bill as the risk-free rate.  A beta greater than one implies it is more volatile than the market, not that it moves more perfectly. The CAPM should not be used for this.  Cryptocurrencies should not be used with this model because they have valuation dynamics related to the new issue of coins.  In other words, they have non-market price movements as well as market price movements. In general, you should not use the CAPM because it doesn't work empirically.  It is famous, but it is also wrong.  A scientific hypothesis that is not supported by the data is a bad idea.  My strong recommendation is that you read \"The Intelligent Investor,\" by Benjamin Graham.  It was last published in 1972, and it is still being printed.  I believe Warren Buffett wrote the current forward for it.  Always go where the data supports you and never anywhere else, no matter how elegant. Finally, unless you are doing this like a trip to Vegas, for fun and willing to take the losses, I would avoid cryptocurrencies because you don't know what you are doing yet.  It is obvious from the posting.  I have multiple decades working in every type of financial institution and at every level, bottom to top.  I also have a doctorate, and I am an incredible researcher.  I am professionally qualified in three different disciplines. If you want to learn how to do this, start with the \"Intelligent Investor.\"  Get a basic book on accounting and learn basic accounting.  Pick up economics textbooks at least through \"Intermediate\" for both microeconomics and macroeconomics.  Get William Bolstad's book \"Introduction to Bayesian Statistics.\"  You will need them for reasons that go very far beyond this post.  Trust me; you want to master that book.  Find a statistician and ask them to teach it to you as a special topics course.  It will help you as both either a Marine officer or a Naval officer.  Then after that pick up a copy of \"Security Analysis.\"  Either the 1943 copy (yes it is in print) by Benjamin Graham if you feel good about accounting, or the 1987 copy by Cottle under the Graham/Dodd imprimatur.  Then, if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies and they will be blas\u00e9 by then, then pick up an economics textbook on money.

Add to the fact that a CPU register is inside said CPU , it is very quick to read and write to .

{"text": "Very often in math you wind up dealing with things that seem like they would get a number but when you actually try to find what number you would get you get stuck in a loop . For example : if I ask you to count on your fingers ( i.e. assign one number to each person ) until you run out of fingers then you wind up with 10 ( assuming you have 10 fingers , of course ) . If I ask you to count using people on the planet ( each person gets their own number ) then you wind up with something over about 7 billion -- a bigger number , but still a nice , finite number . If I asked you to count every atom in the universe then you wind up somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 ^ 80 or so ( do n't quote me on that number ) . Once again , a bigger number , but it 's still a nice finite number . What happens when I ask you to count all of the numbers between 1 and 2 , though ? It may seem like you should wind up with a nice , finite number like the other examples ( although the number you wind up with will likely be very very large ) , but let 's see what happens in practice . You start by taking 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5 , 1.6 , 1.7 , 1.8 , and 1.9 ; that 's ten numbers . You also have 1.01 , 1.02 , 1.03 , 1.04 , 1.05 , 1.06 , 1.07 , 1.08 , and 1.09 , as well as 1.11 , 1.12 , ... , 1.19 , and so on . Once you add in 1.01 to 1.99 you have 100 numbers . When you go deeper you find that you have 1000 numbers by including 1.001 to 1.999 , then 10,000 numbers by including 1.0001 to 1.9999 , and so on . Where do you stop ? Nowhere . If you continue this exercise forever then you find that you never run out of numbers . Thus , the number of distinct values between 1 and 2 is said to be infinite . ( aside : this experiment can be taken further to show the difference between a \" countable infinity \" and an \" uncountable infinity , \" but that 's beyond the scope of this discussion ) . Infinity therefore acts as a placeholder . It basically says \" we were expecting a number but instead we got stuck in a loop . \" Infinity acts like a very very big number -- we often say \" Infinity > N \" ( where N is a real number ) , and it is generally accepted that 1 / infinity is zero ( although the opposite is not necessarily true--1/0 is not always considered to be zero ) . Infinity is also sometimes used as an instruction -- it says \" keep going forever , \" or more typically \" figure what would happen if you * could * keep going forever . \" In engineering ( as opposed to pure mathematics ) it is sometimes taken as an instruction to \" keep going until going further is n't making much difference . \" For example , you could see \" the sum of 1 / n^2 from n = 1 to infinity , \" which means take 1/1 ^ 2 + 1/2 ^ 2 + 1/3 ^ 2 + 1/4 ^ 2 + ... and so on , never stopping . Obviously you ca n't carry out an infinite number of additions , but it turns out that this infinite sum actually converges to a value ( pi^2 /6 in this case , interestingly enough , although the proof is somewhat involved ) . You also frequently see infinite sums like this where if you keep going you wind up with another infinity -- the sum of \" n \" from n = 1 to infinity ( i.e. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + ... ) diverges to infinity , which is to say that if you keep adding up numbers in order and you never stop then you keep getting a ( significantly ) bigger and bigger number .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Uh .. Minor point of clarification here : Yeast is not a bacteria . It 's a ' unicellular eukaryote ' which is science lingo for : it 's organized on a cellular level like most of the big stuff on the planet , but it lives alone . We are eukaryotes , and on a cellular level are extremely similar to yeast . Where we start getting different is in the next level of structure : Our cells clump together and start working together to produce tissues , which make up organs , which make whole animals ; Yeast do n't do that . Every yeast organism will live and die all by it 's self . It never teams up with its friends to build a bigger ' something ' . Just a minor thing , but kind of an obvious error in your question . Before I can get to the subject of your question , I need to cover some background info . All living organisms are comprised of cells . Cells are rather complicated , but fundamentally are a drop of water(with alot of stuff dissolved in it ) , shielded from the world inside an oil droplet . This oil makes up the ' cell membrane ' and it gives the cell a distinct boundary , and helps the cell hold onto ' what it owns ' or what 's inside that oil wall . Cells need to ' hold onto ' a certain amount of nutrients , and various molecules otherwise they die ; if they lose their cell membrane , they die . That extremely thin wall of oil is of the utmost importance to a cell 's survival . Alcohol , kills things by dissolving their cell membrane , and releasing everything that used to be inside the cell . Normally Oil and water do n't mix , but alcohols serve as middle men , and allows them to get along just fine . There is some cool chemistry involved in that , but it 's a bit past ELI5 I think . Now , a little of alcohol in water is n't going to spontaneously dissolve all the oil in it , or kill any cells it runs into ; you need to get to a higher concentration before this starts happening . That 's why you normally find 75 - 95 % ethanol / isopropyl alcohol as a cleaning agent against bacteria , it 's complete overkill and that 's what we like when cleaning . Yeast does n't normally make ethanol actually , it does that as a back up plan . Left alone under normal conditions , yeast actually likes to make carbon dioxide using oxygen . Ethanol is a biproduct of fermentation , which only happens when yeast is oxygen starved , like in a fermentation vat , or a wine bottle . Lets go with the wine bottle for a bit as an example . You throw some yeast in grape juice , and seal it up . The yeast starts using what oxygen is around in order to produce energy so it can survive , and as a byproduct produces Co2 . This keeps going until the oxygen is depleted . Now , at this point the yeast has two options : produce no energy and Die , or start generating energy in a way that does n't require oxygen . Yeast decide to do the second , but this is a ' hail mary play ' as it were because the byproduct of this avenue is ethanol , which once enough of it is produced , will kill the yeast as discussed above . It 's a gamble that oxygen will come back before the yeast makes enough ethanol to kill itself . In wine making , and industry processes , the yeast always dies because we care about the ethanol , not the yeast . Poor yeast ... but on the bright side , you can get up to 20 % ethanol by it 's noble sacrifice ! Jesus allegedly died for your sins ... Millions of Yeast definitely died for that drink .

I would be in a better position to help you had you provided the details.Coronary Angiogram is done to evaluate presence of blockages in the heart. On baisi of the findings of angiogram you may be suggested either medical management, or angioplasty or bypass surgery. Angioplasty can be done if there are short blockages on the arteries. It is a 1-3 HR procedure that can be done in the same sitting and the patient usually gets back on his legs on the next day. Bypass surgery is adviced when there are multiple widespread blockages involving the major arteries of the heart. Bypass surgery requires planning, patient preparation etc. Again it takes about 4 days to patient to be back on his legs and some 20 days to recover totally. But the long term results of bypass are very good. Since he is diabetic he has a tendency to develop heart blockages so be prepared for an angioplasty if suggested.

There are many vehicles out there with much higher mileage that are still on the road, and with proper preventative maintenance there's no reason your truck can't do the same. The fact is, you just don't like what you're paying or what you're driving (even though you were good with both when someone was willing to extend you credit), so now you see this other person's willingness to co-sign for you as your ticket out of a situation you no longer want to be in. My suggestion is that you stay with the loan you have, take care of the vehicle to make it last, and prove that you can pay your obligations.  Hopping from loan to loan isn't going to do your credit any favors.  One of the big factors for your credit score is the average age of accounts.  Going and signing a new loan now will only drag that number down and hurt your score, not help it.  And there's no guarantee the next car you buy with your friend's help is going to last the length of that loan either. I would be careful about this \"grass is greener on the other side\" attitude and just bear through your situation, if only to prove to yourself that you can do it.   There's nothing saying your friend won't still be willing to co-sign for you later on down the line of something does happen to the truck, but you can show them that you're trying to be responsible in the meantime by following through on what you already agreed to.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Asking why the p/e was so high is best answered \"because reported earnings were so low\". Recall that the S&P500 bottomed in early March 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion.  As noted on the page you have linked, the reported p/e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months.  During those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value.  This meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings.  Since the financial sector is a large part of the S&P500, this alone had an enormous effect on the index p/e.  However, the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty.  The same site reports earnings for the previous years at $17.11 for the S&P500, compared to $76.17 for the year prior to 2008.  That is a collapse of about 78% in earnings.  Although the S&P500 has suffered badly during this time, stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by May 2009.  Indeed, the S&P500 was up about 33% in just two months, from its low in March2009 to mid May2009.  Thus, by May of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings.  This would account for the anomalous p/e value reporting in May2009.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'll attempt to be concise and simple in my response . Qualification : Senior at the University of Michigan double majoring in Psychology and Biological Sciences . First , let 's talk briefly about the nervous and endocrine system . As information in your surrounding environment is perceived with your senses , it 's transformed into neural signals . Depending on the importance of the information determines whether or not your autonomic nervous system ( automatic part of your nervous system ) activates your body 's fear response . Just because it 's labeled as a fear response does n't necessarily mean you 're afraid . Even happy emotions are products of your body 's nervous system response . The underlying theme here is your body becomes AROUSED . Next , your sympathetic nervous system ( a division of your autonomic nervous system responsible for arousal ) begins preparing your body by signaling other organs to release hormones through your bloodstream . For example , your adrenal glands located directly above your kidneys release epinephrine and norepinephrine . Furthermore , various organs release aid hormones . Your nervous system increases neural firing and dumps extra neurotransmitters in your brain to prepare for the potential stressor . As a result , your heart rate increases , you perspire at greater rates , you salivate less , and above all , blood from internal organs especially your stomach ( digestion becomes less important to your body 's needs ) moves away to aid your muscles . As a result , the lower blood delivery to your stomach is responsible for the subjective feeling of emotion in your stomach . The sense of being \" sick \" to your stomach after sad events , butterflies when you see a cute girl , or feeling nauseous thinking about an upcoming exam are all rooted in the body 's automatic fear response . Keep in mind the response is so sensitive that just thinking about something stressful can trigger it .

{"text": "Actually the process of German reunification while extremely costly and not without its problems did go relatively smoothly . A Korean unification by comparison would be orders of magnitude harder . The price of German unification is estimated to have been over 2 trillion Euro and still be costing a tidy sum each passing year a quarter of a century later . However when Germany reunited conditions were almost optimal for it compared to Korea . The people in West German outnumbered those in the east about 4 to 1 , while currently North Korea has about half as many people as South Korea . It should be obvious that four guys pooling their resources to lift another guy up will have an easier time doing it than if there were just two of them trying the same thing . Another thing that gets often forgotten is that while East Germany was poor compared to West Germany , they were still one of the richest countries of communist block , having relatively high standards of living . Looking back you often hear jokes about the state of the infrastructure and the lack of goods available in East Germany . How there were so few phones and how you had to wait years to get the car you wanted and how there were long lines everywhere . On the other hand in North Korea peasants are literally starving . The state of the industry and infrastructure in North Korea is a joke compared to the one of East Germany a quarter of a century ago . Lifting East Germany technologically up to the level of West Germany was a monumental task , but the gap between the two countries was small compared to the gap between North and South Korea . Then there are the people . Germany was divided for a shorter time than Korea has been so far . When Germany reunited , families reunited . They had only been divided for a few decades and despite the travel restrictions many had never lost contact entirely . People knew each other . They remembered each other . There were plenty of people who remembered what it had been like before the division and people kept writing letters to their cousins and were even allowed to visit sometimes . The result was that when reunification happened in Germany it was for many a personal thing . Older people reunited with family and young children were introduced to their cousins that they only had seen pictures of before . By comparison Korea has been divided since 1948 and with conditions in North Korea ( and for some time to a lesser degree in the south too ) there are n't many left who remember the time before . They occasionally make this show about reuniting families under controlled circumstances , but if you look at the people involved you see that they get older and older . There are n't many people in a country that has to deal with starvation that make it to the age of 80 . Unlike Germany the two populations have been divided much more strongly . There is almost no contact by comparison and by the time a reunification might happen nobody will still be alive to remember family on the other side personally . The two Koreas have become strangers to one another . And it is not just their attitude to one another . East Germans were well educated and if you did n't make the mistake of majoring in something politics related , chances were that your East German University degree would still count for something in a unified Germany . North Korea is falling behind however . And then there is the propaganda . Of course you had propaganda in East Germany too , but it seems to be a lot worse in North Korea . It will be a lot harder to reintegrate someone from North Korea into polite society as they seem to have less of a clue about how the world actually works . All in all reuniting North and South Korea would be a far more daunting tasks than it was to reunificate Germany . Germany is one of the richest country in the world and their tasks was much easier . South Korea while rather rich themselves would have a much harder time of it . It seems impossible for reunite Korea without the financial help of the international community . It would be worth it for the stabilizing influence alone for most of the local and the worlds big players , but it would be a monumental task still that would take many , many trillions and many decades to accomplish . And of course first there must be an opportunity for it . A peaceful transition as happened in Germany is the best case scenario , but it seems unlikely that the North Korean regime would collapse peacefully into a people who actually want democracy and freedom and reunification .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "5,000 years ago humans did n't know much about metal , metalworking , geology , or mining . But they did have a sense for fashion . Most metals exist naturally as rock . The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they do n't look very interesting ( to a non - geologist ) . In the world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold . Gold can be found as \" nuggets \" or \" dust \" . The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some , you 're likely to find more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers , so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it , and then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold without heat . It is \" malleable \" at room temperature , which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it wo n't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things . Gold will not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade . It is much denser than most other materials so it would make a good club , but you do n't get much more head - bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood . So other than as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical \" use \" to an ancient human . But it is pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" next to human skin tones . Why this is so is pretty much a mystery . But it 's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people . In the ancient world \" rich \" was defined as \" do n't have to farm \" . There were only three kinds of people like that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals . Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it , and it was n't good for any practical use , and as a metal it would \" stay all in one place \" and did n't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained , it became a way for rich people to display their wealth . Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold , of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat , or slaves , or land , or whatever . It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale , a cup , some water , and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me . 5,000 years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals . Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins , even though plutonium is worth , ounce for ounce , vastly more than gold . Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that ancient humans did n't know about - it 's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity . And it still looks good next to human skin .", "label": "hc3human"}

Second , it serves to physically remove any of the bacteria from the wound , and is able to penetrate deep ( giggity ) into the wound to get any bacteria that may be lurking below the surface . Third , it also dehydrates your cells in the wound , effectively killing off the surface cells that have been damaged by the bacteria , and washes them away so that the cells underneath can be regenerated and heal more effectively . Any irritation that is caused simply causes inflammation to redirect the healing processes of your body towards the wound , which also contributes to the healing process .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Wrapping your head around higher spatial dimensions ( i.e. past 3 ) is some seriously mind bending stuff . I 'll pass along the explanation I was given back in college , but I 'll warn you it took me quite a while before I could really wrap my head around higher spatial dimensions . You can think of dimensions two different ways . Either as way of locating something or as directions you can move in . If you wanted to find a particular office in a city you could give the north / south street ( It 's on Park Avenue ) and then you could give a cross street ( at 83rd street ) and then you could give the elevation ( 22nd floor ) . Now you can locate that office . Now imagine that inside that office there 's a circular track . To someone outside the office ( i.e. that can only see the three dimensions you 're used to ) you 're just inside the office , not moving . Inside the office you can walk around that track ( and have another number that describes where you at on the track ( let 's go with clock numbers ) ) . So you could walk from 3 o'clock on the track to 6 o'clock on the track . You 've moved through a dimension that the person outside the office ca n't perceive , so to them you have n't moved . The reason that 3 dimensional representations of 4 dimensional object look so trippy is because there 's parts of that object moving in dimensions that you ca n't see . To bring it back to the office , let 's say the track 1 mile around ( it 's big office ) . Every time you get back to 12 o'clock you pop your head out the door and tell someone outside ( that ca n't see the track ) how far you walked . From their point of view ( since they ca n't see the motion ) you 're just standing in the same place telling them numbers . I know the explanation might not make perfect sense , but like I said before , it does require a certain leap in conceptualization that your brain just has to sort out for itself .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics\u2014or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning\u2014are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.", "label": "hc3human"}

Some of those forecasts are based on worst - case - scenario numbers and many of them are the result of policies put into place by the Bush , Clinton , and Reagan administrations .

Obama could then increase that by 16 % , which would be $ 1.72 Trillion . Clearly the use of percentages makes the difference between Bush and Obama 's debt increases seem much bigger than it really is .

The normal set of expenses are easily kept as one bucket, one account.  The savings 2&3 accounts can also be combined and tracked if you really want to think of them as separate accounts.  Now, when you talk about 'Retirement' that can be in tax-wise retirement accounts, e.g. 401(k), IRA, etc. or post tax regular brokerage accounts. In our situation, the Schwab non-retirement account was able to handle emergency (as money market funds) along with vacation/rainy day, etc, in CDs of different maturities. As an old person, I remember CDs at 10% or higher, so leaving money in lower interest accounts wasn't good. Cash would go to CDs at 1-5 year maturities to maximize interest, but keep money maturing every 6-9 months.  Even with the goal of simplifying, my wife and I each have a 401(k), an IRA, and a Roth IRA, I also have an inherited Roth, and I manage my teen's Roth and brokerage accounts. That's 9 accounts right there. No way to reduce it.  To wrap it up, I'd go back to the first 4 you listed, and use the #4 checking attached to the broker account to be the emergency fund.

{"text": "The mind\u2013body problem is a philosophical debate concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. The debate goes beyond addressing the mere question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically. Interactionism arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.\nThe problem was popularized by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism, and by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, in Avicennian philosophy, and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality as in neutral or substance or essence, in terms of which everything can be explained.\nEach of these categories contains numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism, which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and property dualism, which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes; and neutral monism, which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).\nSeveral philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind\u2013body dichotomy. The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment. An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism, and is a position that generally characterized post-war Continental philosophy.\nThe absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension (if there is such a thing) has been raised as a criticism of dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.[10] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.[11][12][13][14]\nAn ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model, described in the Buddhist teachings, explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.[15] Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual's mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.[15]", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It looks like there 's a lot of variety in these razors -- some of them are very serious , some of them are more tongue - in - cheek , all are postulated by different people , etc . What they all have in common is that if a scenario can be explained in , say , five different ways , you can use one of them to eliminate a few of those possible explanations . So , with the disclaimer that I have n't looked into any of these in too much depth : * * Occam 's Razor * * : Really complicated explanations are probably not true . For example , say I flip a switch and my lamp . My friend Bob says \" You know what 's happening ? Flipping the switch probably turns on a second light , hidden inside the lamp . That activates a light - sensitive panel which , in turn moves a hammer , pressing on a second switch inside the lamp . That switch turns the lamp on . \" I think it makes sense that flipping the switch completes a circuit and turns on the lamp . Occam 's Razor says my explanation makes more sense , because Bob is assuming there 's a light - sensitive panel and a hammer , and any of those assumptions could be false . * * Grice 's Razor * * : In linguistics , when a word is used in an unusual way , it makes more sense to say that 's due to the context it is in than to say the word has a second definition . Let 's say I step outside and notice it 's raining , and I say \" Oh , fantastic . \" Do we suppose that the word fantastic has two meanings ( \" awesome \" and \" terrible \" ) ? Or do we assume it only has one meaning , but that I 'm using it sarcastically ? Grice 's Razor tells us to pick the second one . * * Hanlon 's Razor * * : When someone does something mean , they probably did it by accident . Let 's say your mother just passed away , and I went up and wished you a Happy Mother 's Day . Am I trying to make you feel bad ? Or did I honestly screw up , because I did n't know about your mother ? Hanlon 's Razor tells us to pick the second one . * * Hume 's Razor * * : The explanation for an event should actually be capable of causing that event . Let 's say a house in your neighbourhood collapsed . Bob suggests that a really loud motorcycle drove by , and the vibrations caused the house to collapse . Since the vibrations from a loud motorcycle are n't nearly powerful enough to knock down a house , Hume 's Razor says that Bob is either wrong , or forgetting something important ( maybe the house is built on unstable ground and was just about to collapse anyway ? ) * * Hitchens 's Razor * * : When you propose an idea , it 's your job to prove the idea is true . You should n't expect anyone to disprove it . Let 's say I come up and tell you that the city of Los Angeles has been destroyed by a dragon . You say that it clearly has n't . I say \" Well then , prove it still exists ! \" Hitchens 's Razor would say you do n't have to provide any evidence , since I sure as hell did n't . * * Alder 's Razor * * : If you ca n't figure out something using science , there 's no use arguing about it . Let 's say I believe that cats are better than dogs . You think dogs are better than cats . Alder 's Razor says that its useless to even think about this because there 's no surefire way to say who 's right . * * Popper 's Falsifiablity Principle * * : If you 're going to call something a scientific theory , there has to be a way to prove it wrong . Let 's say that a valuable painting was stolen from my house and Bob suggests it was stolen by the cleaning lady . If we search her house and find the paining , Bob will say \" Aha ! So she is the thief ! \" If we search her house and do n't find it , Bob will say \" Aha ! So she 's already sold the paining ! That 's even worse ! \" .

This is sort of like a traffic jam , and negative charges will all start building up on one plate , and all the positive charges that are moving the other way will start building up on the other .

{"text": "The answer probably varies with local law, and you haven't said where you're located. In most or all US states, it appears that after some statutory length of time, the bank would transfer the money to the state government, where it would be held indefinitely as \"unclaimed property\" in the name of the recipient (technically, the payee, the person to whom the check is made payable).  This process is called escheatment.  Most states publish a list of all unclaimed property, so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list, and realize they were entitled to the funds.  There would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state.   Usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money. As far as I know, there typically wouldn't be any way for you, the person who originated the payment, to collect the money after escheatment.  (Before escheatment, if you have the uncashed check in your possession, you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you.) I had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this, but a number of informal sources (found by Googling \"cashier check escheatment\") seem to agree that this is generally how it works.  Here is the web site for a law firm, saying that in California an uncashed cashier's check escheats to the state after 3 years. Until escheatment occurs, the recipient can cash the check at any time.  I don't think that cashier's checks become \"stale\" like personal checks do, and there isn't any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'm assuming this us a UK based question ? The word pub comes from the name public house . It originally meant a building that was open to the public to come and relax , socialise and most importantly consume alcohol . Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person . They are open to buy beer from wholesale shops at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available through the brewery . This means freehouses generally are cheaper than pubs and can have a different clientele . A bar is normally much more about alcohol than socialising . In a pub it is totally fine , in fact often expected , to sit at the bar with your drink and talk to the other people at the bar . You are of course not looked down upon by finding a private area , that is your choice , but it is often polite to stay and chat for a while . Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs . Because pubs are a social location , in the UK at least many pubs open earlier in the day than bars , sometimes noon , but quite often around 4 pm I have found .

{"text": "For an antibiotic to work , it has to target a specific vital part of the bacteria to destroy it . This is difficult because our cells contain many of the same components as bacteria do , with a few important differences . For example , no harm comes to the human when taking penicillin because penicillin breaks down an imporant part of the bacterial cell wall - peptidoglycan , but does not inhibit any biochemical process that goes on within us because we do not have peptidoglycan . Everytime a strain of bacteria becomes resistant to an antibiotic , researchers are forced to search for a component of the bacteria that is different from humans . This is EXTREMELY complicated and it gets more and more dangerous because eventually there may not be a new discovery to selectively kill bacteria with , unless the science can keep up with discovery . Another example is tetracycline , an antibiotic that binds to a structure called a ribosome to inhibit the bacteria from making essential proteins to function and causes the bacteria to eventually die . We have them too . The reason we do n't suffer when taking the antibiotic is because the drug targets ribosomes that are smaller than ours , which bacteria have ! To make effective antibiotics , researchers have to seek out obscure targets in this manner to kill bacteria and not us . The trickiest would be antibiotics to kill bacteria than can infect the brain . How can you come up with an antibiotic that simultaneously crosses the blood - brain barrier , does nt target the human without terrible side - effects AND kills the specific bacteria ? And if the bacteria gets resistant to THAT , you 'd constantly have to keep adding a unique chemical group on the drug to target the bacteria again . Another problem with this is that eventually the drug molecule will be too big to cross the blood - brain barrier . So there are many factors that go into targeting certain bacterial infections and finding ways to not only make the drug safe for humans and reduce side - effects , but also keeping in mind that this drug will be temporary until the bacteria become resistant again .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "When processing credit/debit cards there is a choice made by the company on how they want to go about doing it.  The options are Authorization/Capture and Sale. For online transactions that require the delivery of goods, companies are supposed to start by initially Authorizing the transaction.  This signals your bank to mark the funds but it does not actually transfer them.  Once the company is actually shipping the goods, they will send a Capture command that tells the bank to go ahead and transfer the funds.  There can be a time delay between the two actions.  3 days is fairly common, but longer can certainly be seen.  It normally takes a week for a gas station local to me to clear their transactions. The second one, a Sale is normally used for online transactions in which a service is immediately delivered or a Point of Sale transaction (buying something in person at a store).  This action wraps up both an Authorization and Capture into a single step. Now, not all systems have the same requirements.  It is actually fairly common for people who play online games to \"accidentally\" authorize funds to be transferred from their bank.  Processing those refunds can be fairly expensive.  However, if the company simply performs an Authorization and never issues a capture then it's as if the transaction never occurred and the costs involved to the company are much smaller (close to zero) I'd suspect they have a high degree of parents claiming their kids were never authorized to perform transactions or that fraud was involved.  If this is the case then it would be in the company's interest to authorize the transaction, apply the credits to your account then wait a few days before actually capturing the funds from the bank.   Depending upon the amount of time for the wait your bank might have silently rolled back the authorization.  When it came time for the company to capture, then they'd just reissue it as a sale. I hope that makes sense.  The point is, this is actually fairly common.  Not just for games but for a whole host of areas in which fraud might exist (like getting gas).", "label": "hc3human"}

The first clocks to do this were pendulum clocks , which were first invented in 1656 by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens . One second was defined as being equal to 1/86,400 of a mean solar day . This is easy to derive from the fact that there are 60 seconds in a minute , 60 minutes in an hour , and 24 hours in a mean solar day . In 1956 , the second was redefined in terms of a year rather than a day to make it more accurate . The new second was defined as the fraction \u200b1\u204431,556,925.9747 of the tropical year 1899 on December 31st at 12:00 ( Epoch January 0 1900 ) .

{"text": "In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969\u20131986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988\u20132011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\"[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "MVNO 's are based on the internal accounting principle that every cost shall be applied to the business unit that consumes the good or service . Basically , think of Sprint ( which is the major network company that serves MVNO 's ) as two companies : a wireless network operator , and a wireless service retailer . The network operator builds , maintains and operates the network . The wireless service retailer buys service from the network operator , and resells it to retail customers in the form of cell phone contracts . Using the aforementioned accounting principle , the network company ' buys ' the network ( by building it ) and ' manufactures ' wireless service ; the retail company buys finished wireless service from the network and resells it to consumers . It 's similar to how car manufacturers work - Ford builds a car , then sells it to a dealer wholesale , who then sells it to a consumer , retail . Ford makes a profit when they sell it to the dealer , and the dealer makes a profit when they sell it to the consumer . In actuality , the dealer 's profit on the sale of a single car is often larger than Ford 's profit on the same single car is , but Ford sells millions of cars , whereas the dealer sells maybe a few hundred . The MVNO goes to Sprint ant says \" I can buy the wireless service from your network division for the same amount that your internal retail division does , but I can add value ( lower cost , better service , different phones , different payment methods , etc ) that your retail division ca n't or wo n't . \" Sprint likes this , because it helps earn extra revenue for the network , without doing things it might not like to do ( eg , cutting prices , or changing policies that discriminate against lower - income consumers ) . So your question starts from a few flawed premises : > creating competition Most of the MVNO 's on Sprint 's network ( for example ) do n't compete with Sprint ( they are going after a different market segment - usually pay - as - you - go customers who do n't or ca n't get contracts ) . > undersells your own same product They are underselling the retail division , but they pay at least the same rates as the retail division does for network access - and potentially more . In addition , the MVNO 's probably have to make volume commitments ( ie , guarantee that they will buy $ X Million in service per annum ) which is great for your balance sheet because big commitments are cheaper than a bunch of small ones . > using your own network be bad for business ? From the perspective of the network company it is n't , because they are getting paid more money for the same network service ( ie , they have to pay for the network regardless of how many users are on it , by getting more users they are able to spread the cost of maintaining the network over more users and thus increase profitability ) .

{"text": "While the Vanguard paper is good, it doesn't do a very good job of explaining precisely why each level of stocks or bonds was optimal.

The answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of:  Using these two factors, you construct a risk-averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome, where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes. This produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk. The result will look something like this:   The exact results will depend on the expected risk and return of the portfolio, and the degree of risk aversion specified.  The result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time. For retirement, the glide path needs to be extended to take into account the fact that the portfolio will be liquidated gradually over time, and dynamically take into account the longevity risk of the individual.

The internet is kind of like a maze of rooms , where you can only talk to the people in the rooms attached to yours . Each room has a number ( IP address ) , and there are some special messages ( routing protocols ) you pass back and forth which let you build up a book of all the other numbers on the internet ( routing / forwarding tables ) . Now this book does n't tell you exactly where the other room is , it just tells you where you need to hand off messages to get to this room . Every room updates it 's own book on where to reach every other room based on the special messages , then passes the messages onto all their neighbors to let them know how to reach everything they know how to reach ( in practice we do n't let EVERYONE know how to reach everything , but this is an ELI5 example ) . So I have this big maze , and we 're both somewhere in the middle of it , and I want to send a message to you . So I open my book to your page and it says I need to send a message to Fred to my north . I write the message down , write my room number as the From ( or Source ) address and your room number ( the To or Destination address ) down on it , and I pass the message to Fred . Fred looks at the To room number , sees it is n't his , so he opens up his book and finds your page . He needs to pass the message to Wilma to his east . So he takes the message , and passes it to Wilma . Wilma repeats the same thing , etc , etc , until it eventually ends up being passed to you . Then you can read the message , and write a new one back to me . This is what we call IP routing , which underlies all other communication on the internet . The other important part for browsing websites is what we call the DNS .

DNS works similarly to the room description up above , except it 's built on top of existing network , and it 's built like a tree rather than a mesh . I know the address for my DNS servers , and they know the addresses for servers at the top of the tree . So I send a message to my DNS server saying ' I want the room number for URL_2 ' . My DNS server does n't know where URL_2 is , so he has to ask someone else .

One way she could apply for a loan in her name without her parents is if she is not currently living with them she shouldn't need them to cosign if she doesn't have bad credit. But if she isn't living with them and they aren't financing her room and board they can't claim her as a dependent so if she really wants to stick it to them she can go and try to politely explain how the loans work and tell them if they don't cosign for her then she will apply on her own (which she can only do while not living with them I believe but not sure) and they will HAVE to STOP claiming her as a dependent on their taxes. If they don't agree she can put her foot down and force them to stop claiming her and tell them she will file her own application anyway and if they continue claiming her and get in trouble for it it's their own fault cause she warned them to stop first. They may agree to cosign rather than lose her as a dependent if it makes that big of a difference on their taxes, if they don't then she can forcefully punish them financially and their taxes will go up.

Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. algorithms are \nAlthough search engines use search algorithms, they belong to the study of information retrieval, not algorithmics.\nThe appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as search trees, hash maps, and database indexes.[full citation needed]\nSearch algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys. Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.\nAlgorithms are often evaluated by their computational complexity, or maximum theoretical run time. Binary search functions, for example, have a maximum complexity of O(log n), or logarithmic time. In simple terms, the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space.", "label": "hc3human"}

For example you sell a deep in the money call (sometimes called the last write) on a stock you have held for 5 years, the covered call is classified as unqualified, the holding period is suspened and the gain or loss on the stock will be treated as short-term. Selling out of the money calls or trading in an IRA account keeps things simple. The details below have been summarized from an article I found at investorsguide.com.

{"text": "We are doing ( kinda ) , but perhaps in a way that you might not expect . The only way to increase CO2 uptake really is to increase photosynthesis and growth rate . We do n't want to do that too much to algae because that could choke the lakes and seas , killing fish and devastating the ecosystem . Similarly , we do n't want to do it to bacteria because bacteria were brought up properly by their parents and always share- by which I mean that they can transfer their genes laterally to other species . Think C.Diff is bad ? Imagine if it develops a growth rate that 's twice as fast . Not good . What we * are * doing however , is looking into plants . Depending on when you last studied biology you may or may not know that there are many different types of photosynthesis . Most plants use C3 photosynthesis , which was a lot better back when there was more CO2 in the air and less oxygen , but is increasingly inefficient . Some plants use C4 photosynthesis , which works better in all sorts of ways . C4 plants use less water , grow faster , and generally need less fertiliser . Sugar cane is a crop that naturally uses C4 . A lot of work is being done to engineer more plants to use C4 photosynthesis , which would have the benefits of more food for less water and fertiliser , but equally take more CO2 out of the air . TL;DR , we 're trying to make plants grow faster and more efficiently as a way to give more food and take more CO2 out of the atmosphere Edit : a few follow up questions have been quite common ; - No this would not be a good solution to climate change , most of the CO2 taken up would be released by decomposition , however trees modified to C4 could help with reforestation efforts by growing quickly . C4 trees could possibly grow faster than C3 trees , and if the total amount of biomass increases as a result , then more CO2 will be sequestered . - There are many scenarios where C3 is better than C4 ; it tends to be better in cooler , wetter environments with lower oxygen levels . However as the climate warms up , C4 will be increasingly important . - No , growing algae in vats would not be a good solution . Any fuel generated would release this CO2 back into the environment . Yes , this would possibly reduce the amount of new CO2 being added to the atmosphere by preventing fossil fuels being burnt , at best this is carbon neutral , it does n't actively decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere . - A lot of people are upset by me using the figure of 25 % more efficiency for C4 plants . The fact is that around 25 % of all photosynthesis reactions in C3 plants go wrong , trying to fix O2 rather than CO2 , in a process called photorespiration . If you want a source for this , see : Sage , R.F. , Sage , T.L. and Kocacinar , F. ( 2012 ) Photorespiration and the evolution of C4 photosynthesis . Annu . Rev. Plant Biol . 63 , 19\u201347 .

If he did n't flip the same side twice in a row anywhere in those 100 times , it 's likely he 's lying and just wrote down the numbers systematically , without flipping any coin .

Unfortunately they have no obligation to do business with you unless they take (and keep) your money. If they canceled the order and returned your money you have no binding agreement with them.  On top of that, in the US... 'misleading advertising' usually refers to \"Any advertising or promotion that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities\" (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1125(a)). The main criteria that they evaluate before taking legal action is whether or not someone has suffered harm or loss due to the reliance on the bad information. But you're in Europe. The EU ideas behind misleading advertising tend to focus a lot more on comparing one product to someone else's and making subjective claims or false promises. Pricing does come up, but still, you need to have an ability to prove that you suffered harm or a loss from the business' actions.  Even if you were able to prove that, to force the business to change its price catalog, you would need to go through legal proceedings, demonstrate the harm that you've sustained, and then have a judge decide in your favor and order the supplier to comply. My guess is that it's just not worth it for you, but you haven't specified if this is just an annoying shoe-shopping experience or if you are regularly experiencing bait-and-switch tactics from a supplier that is a crucial part of a business operation.  If it's the former, just like a physical shop reserves the right to kick you out if you're not behaving, (but usually doesn't because they'd like to keep you as a customer), an online shop can update its prices whenever they like. They can change their prices too, and cancel orders.  If it's the latter, then start putting together some documentation on how many times this has happened and how it has damaged your business. But before you get on the warpath I would recommend you look for another place to buy whatever you have in mind, or else try a pound of sugar in your approach to this supplier... My own business experience has shown that can go a lot way in figuring out a mutually beneficial resolution. If you want to see a bit more...

{"text": "Fun fact . If you 're playing a record , you can even hear it with your speakers off . Just put your ear close to the needle and you 'll hear the music . The record is covered in a big long groove that spirals from the outside towards the inside . This groove guides the needle . Along the inside of that groove is a series of bumps . When the needle passes over these bumps , it bounces like when you 're in a car and you hit a bump , although on a much smaller scale . These bounces are what make your music . Now before we had electric record players , there were these things call gramophones ( hence the Grammys ) . In the gramophone , the needle was attached to a membrane that would vibrate as the needle bounced along . The vibrating membrane acted like a driver in your speakers , and there was a large cone to amplify the sound . But who has one of those anymore ? This is n't a perfect analogy but I think it 'll do the trick . Think about the way that gramophone worked , but instead of being physically attached to the membrane ( or speaker ) there was a tube full of water . As the needle bounces , it sends vibrations through the water in the form of small waves . When these waves strike the membrane and it shakes , making sound in your speakers . That is pretty much how the electric record players work , except instead of water it uses electricity , and its ' waves ' are actually changing current in the wire . There is a device in the record player that changes the bouncing of the needle into an electric signal whose current changes depending on how it moves . This signal is then sent through the wires to your speakers . There , it makes your speakers move by running through a small electromagnet . Sorry for the long winded response .

{"text": "The most common route is taking medication by mouth - the oral route . From here the medication has a journey to make that starts from our mouths to the target area . * * Drugs In The Digestive System :* * Once medicines reach the stomach they may start to dissolve . However , some pills that are in capsule form will remain intact until they reach the small intestine . This is because if the capsule was to disintegrate in the stomach the contents would be destroyed by the hydrochloric acid . Therefore some medications , are sealed in special capsules to survive the stomach . They are then absorbed through the lining of the small intestine . Medications are then carried into the blood stream - moving from a high concentration fluid in the intestine to a lower concentration fluid - the blood . * * The Circulatory System :* * No matter what form a medicine takes they will be dissolved and enter the blood stream at some point . In this form the medicines are circulated around the body and so delivered to organs and tissues . This process is very fast . The heart can pump a full cycle of blood in about one minute . During this process the medicine molecules are being delivered throughout the body . The brain will receive the largest portion - about 16 % . The effects of the medicine will continue to be active until metabolism begins . The metabolism for each medicine is different . In other words some are broken down and prepared for elimination more quickly than others . That is why some medicines will be given frequently , for example 2 - 4 hourly , others less so . In fact some medicines may already be breaking down when they passed through the liver for the first time - this is called ' first - pass effect ' . Some form of tablets and capsules may have to go through the liver several times before they can be eliminated from the body . * * Within the body tissues and cells :* * Within the body tissues we eventually get down to the cellular level . The cells of the body can absorb fluids and so will soak up the molecules of medicine within blood fluid that surrounds them . Not all medicines will start to work at the same time . This is because different medicines all have their own specific molecules that will dissolve either quite quickly or more slowly than others . In addition some medicines find it easier to dissolve in human tissue than others . Human cell membranes have a high content of fats . Therefore if you have a medicine that can dissolve in fat then they will begin to work more quickly than those that ca n't . This ability to dissolve in fat is a very important point on how fast a drug will begin to act in the body . Once the dissolved medications are within the cell this is where most of them do their work through biochemical reactions . They then re - enter the blood stream where they will once again enter the liver . Here they will be broken down further and prepared to be eliminated by the body . * * Elimination :* * The main organs associated with elimination of medicines is the liver and kidneys . Basically these organs sieve out toxic substances . The liver breaks them down through a series of complex metabolic reactions . These toxins / waste products are stored by the liver until it is ready to send them to the kidneys . In the kidneys the prepared substances are further processed and then eliminated from the body through the urine .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "To a certain extent, small cap companies will in general follow the same trends as large cap companies. The extent of this cointegration depends on numerous factors, but a prime reason is the presence of systemic risk, i.e. the risk to the entire market. In simple terms, sthis is the risk that your portfolio will approach asymptotically as you increase its diversification, and it's why hedging is also important.  That being said, small cap businesses will, in general, likely do worse than large cap stocks, for several reasons. This was/is certainly the case in the Great Recession.  Small cap businesses have, on average, higher betas, which is a measure of a company's risk compared to the overall market. This means that small cap companies, on average outperform large cap companies during boom times, but it also means that they suffer more on average during bear times. The debate over whether or not the standard beta is still useful for small cap companies continues, however. Some economists feel that small cap companies are better measured against the Russell 2000 or similar indexes instead of the S&P 500.  Small cap companies may face problems accessing or maintaining access to lines of credit. During the Great Recession, major lenders decreased their lending to small businesses, which might make it harder for them to weather the storm.  On a related point, small businesses might not have as large an asset base to use as collateral for loans in bad times. One notable large cap company that used its asset base to their advantage was Ford, which gave banks partial ownership of its factories during hard times. This a) gave Ford a good amount of cash with which to continue their short-term operations, and b) gave the banks a vested interest in keeping Ford's lines of credit open. Ford struggled, but it never faced the financial problems of GM and Chrysler.  Despite political rhetoric about Main Street vs. Wall Street, small businesses don't receive as much government aid in times of crisis as some large cap companies do. For example, the Small Business Lending Fund, a brilliant but poorly implemented idea in 2010, allocated less than $30 billion to small businesses. (The actual amount loaned was considerably less). Compare that to the amounts loaned out under TARP. Discussions about corporate lobbying power aside, small businesses aren't as crucial to the overall stability of the financial system Small businesses don't always have the manpower to keep up with changes in regulation. When the Dodd-Frank Act passed, large banks (as an example), could hire more staff to understand it and adapt to it relatively easily; small banks, however, don't always have the resources to invest in such efforts.  There are other reasons, some of which are industry-specific, but these are some of the basic ones.  If you want visual confirmation that small cap businesses follow a similar trend, here is a graph of the Russell 2000 and S&P 500 indexes:  Here is a similar graph for the Russell 2000 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.   If you wanted to confirm this technically and control for the numerous complicated factors (overlap between indexes, systemic risk, seasonal adjustment, etc.), just ask and I'll try to run some numbers on it when I have a chance. Keep in mind, too, that looking at a pretty picture is no substitute for rigorous financial econometrics. A basic start would be to look at the correlation between the indexes, which I calculate as 0.9133 and 0.9526, respectively. As you can see, they're pretty close. Once again, however, the reality is more complicated technically, and a sufficiently detailed analysis is beyond my capabilities. Just a quick side note. These graphs show the logarithm of the values of the indexes, which is a common statistical nuance that is used when comparing time series with radically different magnitudes but similar trends.  S&P500 and Russell 2000 data came from Yahoo! Finance, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average data came from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Per usual, I try to provide code whenever possible, if I used it. Here is the Stata code I used to generate the graphs above. This code assumes the presence of russell2000.csv and sp500.csv, downloaded from Yahoo! Finance, and DJIA.csv, downloaded from FRED, in the current directory.

{"text": "I 'll do my best ... In the 16th century , the English monarchy wanted to make Ireland a part of the British empire so they confiscated native Irish land and \" planted \" English people there to try to set up colonies of sorts . Hoping that when the poor , underdeveloped Irish saw how the english lived that the Irish would become assimilated ( read : accept their new english rulers as they had a superior culture and quality of life . The english would have considered the Irish to be savages at the time ) . Anyway , things did n't exactly go to plan for the english as the Irish rebelled quite fiercely and unsuccessfully for the 17th,18th,19th centuries . Notably in 1798 a very bloody rebellion for both sides . In 1801 , the Act of Union merged Ireland with great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Ireland and Great Britain . In the 1840s Ireland suffered a potato famine , essentially halving Ireland 's population due to emigration and starvation . Many went abroad to contribute to the massive amounts of people with Irish ancestry abroad today .. Many would blame this famine on the English ruling classes , but it was mainly due to the poor Irish catholic majority who could only really afford to grow potatoes . So when the potato crop failed , they starved . The famine did a lot of damage to the country to nationalism as so many young Catholic ( native ) irish died or left . However in the early 20th century the nationalist cause gathered a lot more steam . A campaign for \" home rule \" caught traction and it seemed like Ireland was set to govern itself as a subsidiary of the UK ( much like Scotland today ) . However , WWI happened which delayed the progress of Home Rule , and so the Irish grew restless and rebelled in probably Ireland 's most famous rebellion the [ 1916 Easter Rising ] ( URL_1 ) . The 1916 rebels declared an Irish Republic , a country entirely of it 's own . The recently formed IRA played a significant part in this rising . The British quickly quashed the rising and excecuted it 's leaders . Enraging the Irish public and leading to the war of independence . 1919 - 21 . The IRA used guerrilla tactics ( hiding and ambushing ) during the war of independence as they were vastly outnumbered and by the end although Britain were much more powerful they wanted to see the end of war . So they gave Ireland it 's own republic but only in the southern 26 counties ( like US states ) and not in the northern 6 counties . There was much debate among the Irish whether agreeing to only part ownership of the island of Ireland was the right thing to do , which resulted in a civil war in the 1920s between those who supported the new treaty and those who did n't ... The IRA did not support the treaty and fought in this civil war although in the end after much bloodshed in this war and declared a ceasefire . The IRA really had no choice as many of their leaders were dead and they were very weak . The country settled into neutrality for the rest of the 20th century until the present day although in the late 1960s the [ troubles ] ( URL_0 ) began in Northern Ireland ( a part of the United Kingdom ) and there was vicious violence between the Irish Republican forces ( IRA ) and English Nationalist forces ( Note : Not the English army , but English paramilitary groups , not officially endorsed by the government . ) These conflicts lead to a lot of death especially of innocent people caught in between the 2 differing sides ( catholic and protestant ) and was a very ugly part of irish history .

{"text": "The house that sells for $200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers. 3% would be $6000/yr or $500/mo. This is absurdly low, and favors renting, not buying. 9% is $1500/mo in which case buying the house to live in or rent out (as a landlord) is the better choice. At this level \"paying rent\" should be avoided.  I'm simply explaining the author's view, not advocating it.  A quote from the article -  annual rent / purchase price = 3% means do not buy, prices are too   high annual rent / purchase price = 6% means borderline annual rent / purchase price = 9% means ok to buy, prices are   reasonable Edit to respond to Chuck's comment - Mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high, the 30 year is about 4.4% and the 15, 3.45%. Of course, a number of factors might mean paying more, but this is the average rate. And it changes over time. But the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different. Very different based on location. See what you'd pay for 2000 sq feet in Manhattan vs a nice town in the Mid-West. One can imagine a 'heat' map, when an area might show an $800 rent on a house selling for $40,000 as a \"4.16\" (The home price divided by annual rent) and another area as a \"20\", where the $200K house might rent for $1667/mo. It's not homogeneous through the US. As I said, I'm not taking a position, just discussing how the author formulated his approach. The author makes some assertions that can be debatable, e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high. In my opinion, the US has had the crash, but the rates are still low. Buying is a personal decision, and the own/rent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision.  Of course the article, as written, does the math based on the rates at time of publication (4%/30years). And the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate. The $60K couple, at 4%, can afford just over a $260K mortgage, but at 6%, $208K, and 8%, $170K. The struggle isn't with the payment, but the downpayment.   The analysis isn't too different for a purchase to invest. If the rent exceeds 1% of the home price, an investor should be able to turn a profit after expenses.", "label": "hc3human"}

I would spend quite a bit of time testing handsets for call quality issues and suchlike , and so it was quite common for me to call colleagues who were sitting as close as the very next desk to try something out . For the most part , there 's nothing wrong with the call quality when you call someone in the same room - the call takes the same route as if you were calling them from the next street - up to the base station , into the network and back out through the base station to the other handset . I suspect that your question is based on one of two things . It could be that you can hear the person talking next to you , at the same time as you 're hearing them through the phone , which makes you aware of how relatively poor phone quality is compared to the real thing . Alternatively , I suspect that what 's happening is that you 're getting confused by hearing your own voice in the earpiece of the handset . Now , all phones feed a little bit of our voice back to the earpiece ; it 's called sidetone , and it 's essential because if we do n't have it , we tend to start yelling to be heard . Having sidetone helps us keep our voice at a reasonable level . However , if you 've got another handset in the room , and your voice is actually being picked up by that handset and is being sent back to your own handset 's earpiece , that means that as well as the sidetone ( which happens in real time ) you 're also getting an ever - so - slightly delayed sound of your own voice too .

{"text": "Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive inferences. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises \"all men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\" to the conclusion \"Socrates is mortal\" is deductively valid. An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true. Some theorists define deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. \nPsychology is interested in deductive reasoning as a psychological process, i.e. how people actually draw inferences. Logic, on the other hand, focuses on the deductive relation of logical consequence between the premises and the conclusion or how people should draw inferences. There are different ways of conceptualizing this relation. According to the semantic approach, an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation of this argument where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The syntactic approach, on the other hand, holds that an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference. A rule of inference is a schema of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their logical form. There are various rules of inference, like the modus ponens and the modus tollens. Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called formal fallacies. Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast to strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion. Deductive reasoning contrasts with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. For ampliative arguments, like inductive or abductive arguments, the premises offer weaker support to their conclusion: they make it more likely but they do not guarantee its truth. They make up for this drawback by being able to provide genuinely new information not already found in the premises, unlike deductive arguments.\nCognitive psychology investigates the mental processes responsible for deductive reasoning. One of its topics concerns the factors determining whether people draw valid or invalid deductive inferences. One factor is the form of the argument: for example, people are more successful for arguments of the form modus ponens than for modus tollens. Another is the content of the arguments: people are more likely to believe that an argument is valid if the claim made in its conclusion is plausible. A general finding is that people tend to perform better for realistic and concrete cases than for abstract cases. Psychological theories of deductive reasoning aim to explain these findings by providing an account of the underlying psychological processes. Mental logic theories hold that deductive reasoning is a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations using rules of inference. Mental model theories, on the other hand, claim that deductive reasoning involves models of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. According to dual-process theories of reasoning, there are two qualitatively different cognitive systems responsible for reasoning.\nThe problem of deductive reasoning is relevant to various fields and issues. Epistemology tries to understand how justification is transferred from the belief in the premises to the belief in the conclusion in the process of deductive reasoning. Probability logic studies how the probability of the premises of an inference affects the probability of its conclusion. The controversial thesis of deductivism denies that there are other correct forms of inference besides deduction. Natural deduction is a type of proof system based on simple and self-evident rules of inference. In philosophy, the geometrical method is a way of philosophizing that starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system using deductive reasoning.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "This summer I used a loan from my 401(k) to help pay for the down payment of a new house. We planned on selling a Condo a few months later, so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months. I also felt like the market might take a dip in the future, so I liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low (spoiler alert: this didn't happen). So in July 2017 I withdrew $17,000 from my account (Technically $16,850.00 principal and $150 processing fee) at an effective 4.19% APR (4% rate and then the fee), with 240 scheduled payments of $86.00 (2 per month for 10 years). Over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was $3,790, but that money would be paid back into my account. I was happy with the terms, and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later. But then I decided to change jobs, and ended up having to pay back the loan ~20 weeks after it was issued (using the proceeds from the sale of the condo). During this time the market had done well, so when I paid back the funds the net difference in shares that I now owned (including shares purchased with the interest payments) was $538.25 less than today's value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan. Combined with the $150 fee, the overall \"cost\" of the 20 week loan was about 4.05%. That isn't the interest rate (interest was paid back to my account balance), but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn. On paper, my account would be worth that much more if I hadn't withdrawn the money. Now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks, you can think of that loan having an APR \"cost\" of around 10.5% (Probably not valid for a multi year calculation, but seems accurate for a 12 month projection). Again, that is not interest paid back to the account, but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account. Sure, the market could take a dip and I may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost, but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market. It also is not something you can really schedule very well, as the loan took 6 days to fund (not including another week of clarifying questions back/forth before that) and 10 day to repay (from the time I initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased). So in my experience, the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does, and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so. Especially since you may be forced to do so at any time if you change jobs or your employment is terminated.", "label": "hc3human"}

He is Founder and CEO of Deep Genomics, Cofounder of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Professor of Engineering and Medicine at the University of Toronto. Frey is a pioneer in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, their use in accurately determining the consequences of genetic mutations, and in designing medications that can slow, stop or reverse the progression of disease.\nAs far back as 1995, Frey co-invented one of the first deep learning methods, called the wake-sleep algorithm, the affinity propagation algorithm for clustering and data summarization, and the factor graph notation for probability models. In the late 1990s, Frey was a leading researcher in the areas of computer vision, speech recognition, and digital communications. In 2002, a personal crisis led Frey to face the fact that there was a tragic gap between our ability to measure a patient's mutations and our ability to understand and treat the consequences. Recognizing that biology is too complex for humans to understand, that in the decades to come there would be an exponential growth in biology data, and that machine learning is the best technology we have for discovering relationships in large datasets, Frey set out to build machine learning systems that could accurately predict genome and cell biology. His group pioneered much of the early work in the field and over the next 15 years published more papers in leading-edge journals than any other academic or industrial research lab. \nIn 2015, Frey founded Deep Genomics, with the goal of building a company that can produce effective and safe genetic medicines more rapidly and with a higher rate of success than was previously possible.[10] The company has received 60 million dollars in funding to date from leading Bay Area investors, including the backers of SpaceX and Tesla.[11] In 2019, Deep Genomics became the first company to announce a drug candidate that was discovered by artificial intelligence.[12]", "label": "hc3human"}

Some may be ultra funds that go for double the return or double the inverse of the return and thus will try to apply the appropriate leverage to achieve that return. Those that use physical replication can still have a small portion be used to try to minimize the tracking error as there is something to be said for what kind of tracking error do you accept as the fund's returns may differ from the index by some measure. Yes.  For example, if you were to have a fund that had a 50% and -50% return in back to back periods, what would your final return be?  Answer: -25%, which if you need to visualize this, take $1 that then becomes $1.50 by going up 50% and then becomes $.75 by going down 50% in a compounded fashion.  This is where you have to be careful of the risks of leverage as those returns will compound in a possibly negative way.", "label": "hc3human"}

What seems like an incredible speed here on Earth is actually very slow out in space , and it will take a long time to get anywhere . For instance Neptune is travelling at 5 kilometers every second - a stupendously fast Earth speed - but it takes 168 years to go around the Sun . Secondly , things on Earth do n't move very fast for very long , because of air . Travelling through atmosphere at space - speeds would be like slamming into a wall , simply because of how much air you need to move out of your way every second . The fastest man - made objects are rockets , which gain most of their velocity way up high where the atmosphere is relatively thin . They simply could n't reach that speed at ground level . Thirdly and perhaps most surprisingly , even if you could somehow overcome the atmosphere , you run into another problem . If you 're going fast enough ( even on the ground ) , you 'll reach escape velocity , and never come back down ! As you 're tearing across the landscape at a few km / s , the Earth 's surface curves away underneath you faster than gravity pulls you down , and you rise up into the sky and disappear .

{"text": "Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents.  If you have $X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and  $Y income overall, then you owe State A a fraction (X/Y) of the income  tax that would have been due on $Y income had you been a resident of State A.  In other words, compute the state income tax on $Y as per State A rules, and send us (X/Y) of that amount.  If you are a resident of State B, then State B  will tax you on $Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus, you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how small $X is.  As a practical matter, many commercial real-estate  investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income (usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040), and the annual  bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report (but do not get to deduct) on the Federal return.  As a result, State A is unlikely to come after you for the tax on, say, $100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will  recover from you. But, when the real estate is sold, there will (hopefully) be a big capital gain, most of which  will be sheltered from Federal tax since the passive losses finally get  to be deducted.  At this point, State A is not only owed a lot of money (it knows nothing of your passive losses etc) but, after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year, it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Mind uploading is a speculative process of whole brain emulation in which a brain scan is used to completely emulate the mental state of the individual in a digital computer. The computer would then run a simulation of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.\nSubstantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain\u2013computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.  According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.\nMind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.\nAmong some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as \"digital immortality\"). Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our \"mind-file\", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a \"logical endpoint\" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology. Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels, films, and games.", "label": "hc3human"}

In other words, they may be less likely to lower your rate just to keep you as a customer or to attract new customers. According to The Motley Fool, issuers dropped their riskiest customers as a result of the new regulations. Some say that new laws simply motivated the issuers to find new ways to \"gouge\" their customers. Here are two NYTimes blog posts about the act: http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/what-the-credit-card-act-means-for-you/ http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/the-effects-of-the-credit-card-act/ As JohnFx states, it does not hurt to ask.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It 's a sci - fi author 's idea to make money through a cult religion that operates in a shady manner akin to a pyramid scheme . L. Ron Hubbard was a sci - fi writer , who is reported to have said at a public sci - fi writers conference , \" You do n't get rich writing science fiction . If you want to get rich , you start a religion . \" Originally he made something called Dianetics , which was supposed to be this idea about how all our problems , including physical illness and disabilities , come from our mind , and conventional psychiatry can not deal with it , just pay him lots of money to find out how to REALLY resolve your issues . It received absolutely no scientific merit and was rubbished , and when legal investigations began into its use as a medical alternative , he quickly backtracked and remarketed it in a much bigger way , as a religion instead of a science . Now , understanding Scientology first means you have to understand how they initiate people . The core concepts are so wacky that it 's easy to point and laugh at how anyone could believe it . But most people who first join are n't aware of the core concepts . They 're just told there are ways to help better themselves , ways that popular Hollywood stars use ! So step into this booth and watch this short movie and maybe think about it while hypnotic brainwashing messages are played . They use aggressive tactics to target people for brainwashing and get them to sign up . They enter into the ' religion ' and are told a little about the nature of the world , how they are an immortal being but have forgotten their true purpose . Over time , they \" advance \" through the levels of understanding by undergoing \" audits \" which cost money . They basically pay to be a higher rank ( Operating Thetan Level ) , and are incited to try and get their friends and family to join up too . The actual beliefs ? Normally you 're expected to pay lots to find out , but now with the internet , as well as a ton of court orders while they were being investigated , it 's all been exposed . The cliffnotes version is that we are all \" thetans , \" immortal beings who have forgotten who we truly are because , like the Christian Adam & Eve , we achieved a level of self - awareness that made us \" impure . \" We die and are reborn over and over . We 're all infested with corrupted \" body thetans \" and following Scientology teaches you how to purify yourself , with auditing \" proving \" you have less body thetans . And then we have Xenu . Ruler of a galactic civilization 75 million years ago , this Galactic Confederacy was really similar to our own . When Xenu was about to be deposed , he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions . With the assistance of psychiatrists , he gathered billions of his citizens under the pretense of income tax inspections , then paralyzed them and froze them in a mixture of alcohol and glycol to capture their souls . The kidnapped populace was loaded into spacecraft for transport , and ultimately thrown into volcanoes . Their now - disembodied thetan souls were rounded up and forced to watch movies ( honestly , I swear this is part of Scientology belief ) for over a month , designed to make them all believe in Christianity and Catholicism and other \" fake \" religions . Then Xenu was overthrown by some of his government and locked under a mountain where he still remains and only the top - level Scientologists know the location . And as for what they do now ? Asides having celebrities like Will Smith and Tom Cruise as members who publically speak out about how psychiatry is evil and damaging ( remember , they 're agents of Xenu ! ) , they have hyper - aggressive lawyers who love to sue for everything they can . They aggressively recruit new members through brainwashing ( if you 're ever asked to partake outside a recruitment center , just say no , do n't even think about doing it \" just for a laugh , \" that shit is effective ) and have them pay to discover the stuff about Xenu mentioned above . Members have to sign away various legal rights , are encouraged to cut off all ties to family and friends who do n't approve of Scientology , and they even had a kind of detention camp they removed some of their midranking people to for misbehaviour . They even use bullying and stalking against reporters and legal representatives who want to investigate them or bring their behaviour to the spotlight . Calling them a cult for rich people does n't quite do justice to what a nasty , harmful and hateful little scam they are .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I love giving non-answer answers.  It will depend on you.  Suppose you are embarrassed by driving older cars, your significant other doesn't like having you drive an older car, you don't really maintain the car well, it develops a variety of problems, acquires a few dents and you really worry about reliability.  Then the value of the car will probably drop rather quickly below the blue book value and you should sell it. On the other hand, if you don't care how the car looks, it runs pretty well (fewer repairs than you would expect), you maintain it yourself (aka cheaply) and do a good job at that, and have plenty of friends who owe you a favor and will give you a ride if your car won't start, there will probably never be a time that the value to you drops below the 'official' blue book value (what others will pay), so you would drive it until the engine drops out of the chassis.  The blue book value represents some kind of rough consensus about what a car of that age and exterior condition is worth to the typical person; it will be the discrepancy between the 'typical' person and you that determines whether you'll sell. An illustration of this:  I know a few people who (1) don't care what their car looks like and (2) are very handy at repairs.  These people started out by buying cheap used cars and ran them until they basically fell to pieces.  However, even though their 'taste' in cars didn't changes, as their incomes increased, it finally reached the point where doing their own repairs was too much of a time sink, so the value of really old cars dropped in their minds and they shifted to buying newer cars and selling them before they completely fell apart.  That's why this is a hard question to answer.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "When buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved.  At one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and don't want to think of it again (apart from watching the rent come in every week). At the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent. Where is the best place to be - well somewhere in the middle. The most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business. They handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day-to-day nitty gritty of the properties. Regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property, you are going to pay a premium for the brand new. A property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium. I once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new. Also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property. You also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property. Another option you may want to look at is Defence Housing. They are managed by the Department of Defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more, whether they have a tenant in the property or not. They also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over. The pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties (up to 15% or more). Personally, I would not go for a Defence Housing property as I consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions. However, considering your emphasis on a passive investment, this may be an option for you.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What you 're asking about is actually known as \" Tilt - shift false miniaturisation \" . Tilt - shift lenses allow you to adjust the \" tilt \" of the lens ( ie . the angle between the lens and the film / sensor ) and the \" shift \" ( offsetting the position of the lens relative to the film or sensor ) . As SneakyPete27 said , this is useful for things like minimizing converging lines when photographing tall buildings , but it can also be used to make false miniatures . It does this by creating a very narrow depth of field ( which is the area in which objects are in focus ) , blurring out the rest of the image . This is very similar to how a macro lens behaves with small objects , and tricks our brains into thinking the photo was taken with a macro lens . You can then do other things such as bumping up the saturation of the image to make everything slightly less realistic and \" plastic model \" looking . You do n't even need a tilt - shift lens to create these photos - you can add the lens blur effects to any photo using Photoshop for instance . There are many tutorials on the web of how to do this .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The ' i ' indicates interlaced video ; the ' p ' indicates progressive video . With interlaced video , each frame contains pixel information for only half the rows of pixels on screen . For instance , one frame may contain data for all the odd rows of pixels while the next frame contains data for the even rows of pixels . At any given moment , half the pixels on the screen are showing data from the previous frame and half are showing data from the current frame . This can result in a sort of temporal distortion that causes a ' combing'/misalignment effect when objects move between frames . With progressive video , each frame contains pixel information for all pixels , so each time the display refreshes to display a new frame , both odd and even rows of pixels are updated together to show a complete image representing a single moment in time . For this reason , progressive video is better . With interlaced video , the effective resolution is reduced by 50 % since only half the pixels get updated each time . It is worth noting though that 1080i will appear almost the same as 1080p when there is little motion between frames ( e.g. during a news report ) . Interlaced video , however , is particularly bad at displaying fast - paced action shots with lots of motion ( such as in the case of sports broadcasts or action movies ) .

{"text": "This one is hard to explain to a five year old because he would have to grasp evolution . So my explanation is actually probably a few years older . So it boils down to how mates are choosen . Or \" sexual selection \" . Sexual selection is similar to natural selection , but where as natural selection picks the individuals that are best acquiring resources and avoiding threats , sexual selection picks the individuals that are best at meeting any kind \" test \" that the female uses to determine who is most fit to mate with . If the female chooses based on first come , first served , then there is little to no \" sexual selection \" going on . In these cases you tend to get big females and small males . This is because big females can make more eggs / offspring , and small males reach maturity quicker and go searching for females quicker . In many of the species in which the males are bigger than the females , females typically mate with the male that has successfully dominated all the other males . Over the generations the males that got to mate were the bigger and fiercer ones and they will have bigger and fiercer children . Now the reason the the females do n't just get bigger like their fathers is because the females only face natural selection where as their brothers have to balance both natural selection and sexual selection . A bigger animal has to acquire more food to grow that big and then acquire more food to maintain that extra mass . That means that they are more likely to starve and less likely to find enough food for their young . So at some point it quickly becomes advantageous for females to not acquire as much mass as their fathers and brothers . Basically the root of almost all sexual dimorphism is what kind of and what degree of sexual selection is going on in the species . The less sexual selection going on compared to natural selection , the more similar the sexes are .", "label": "hc3human"}

Well , little Timmy , just like you have muscles in your arms and legs to move you around , you have two muscles inside your ear ! But these two muscles do n't move anything you can see . The muscles in your ear can actually block sounds and make them seem quieter to you . For example , when you hear a really loud sound , they will tense up to help make the sound seem quieter . This helps protect the insides of your ears when your sister sneaks up on you and screams as loud as she can . Those muscles stretch tight , and that 's why you have trouble hearing out of that ear for a few seconds after . The muscle that makes your ears rumble is called the tensor tympani muscle . Mostly , it makes your chewing sound quieter to you ( like when your mom and I tell you to stop crunching your cereal so loud , and you have no idea what we 're talking about ) . Now , why does it make that sound when you flex it ? Because all muscles vibrate when you flex them . Make a fist as tight as you can . See your hand shaking ? The muscle in your ear does the same thing . And because it 's inside your ear , you can hear it vibrate .

Some foods just happen to have a lot of antioxidants . It 's because food is made up of molecules too , and some of those have more antioxidants than others . They make them on their own as they grow so they do n't get broken by sticky lone oxygen molecules either . Your body makes it 's own antioxidants too ! But sometimes it ca n't make enough on it 's own , so you need to eat them to get more . The healthier you eat , the more antioxidants you can get , and the less likely your body will get hurt by those sticky lone oxygen molecules .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "there are 11 players on each side , played on a big oval pitch ( a field with grass on ) . In the middle of the oval is a pale strip , where the bowler throws a cricket ball at a team of batsmen from the other side . He 's trying to smash the three wooden poles called wickets , with the ball , but sometimes the bowler tries to make the batsmen hit it in the air so that the bowlers teammates can catch the ball . If they catch the ball while it 's in the air , before it 's hit the ground , the batsman is out . The batsman tries to score runs . He hits the ball in different ways so that he and his teammate at the other end of the strip can run back and forward between the wickets and score runs . If he hits it off the pitch without it hitting the ground , he does n't have to run because he gets 6 runs automatically , and no more . If he hits it off the pitch but it DOES hit the floor , he gets 4 runs automatically , but no more . The bowler , and the fielders try to catch the ball and throw it back while the batsmen are out of their ' crease ' , which is a little safe zone they stand in next to the wicket . It 's a line drawn in white . If the batsmen gets put out by the other team , then one of the other 11 players takes up his place . In theory , they should go through all 11 players , and that brings an end to the ' innings ' . Innings can end early because the batting side can say ' we 've had enough ' , or because of bad weather . The bowler is allowed to bowl 6 times . That 's called an ' over ' . Wide balls , and no - deliveries do n't count . In some games , the number of ' overs ' is limited to a set number to shorten the game and make it more exciting . There are a few different kinds of bowling styles . Some people like to throw it really fast to hit the wickets . Some people like to spin the ball and make it go in different directions to get around the batsman or make him hit it badly . The bowler will do whatever he can to try and trick the batsman . There are a few ways the batsman can go out . -Hit the wickets with the ball -The fielders catch a hit ball before it touches the floor -Leg before wickets . The ball is definitely going to hit the wickets , but it hits the batsman 's leg first . -When the batters are scoring runs , and are out of their ' creases ' ( batters safe zone ) the fielders hit the wickets with the ball -The batsman hits his own wickets by accident -The batsman hits the ball twice ( rarely happens ) -Deliberately touches the ball -After a batsman gets put out , if the next one does n't arrive by 3 minutes , he 's out too . After everyone has batted , the teams swap , and whoever has scored the most runs , wins the game ! ! ! Hope this is a good basic guide . edit : to include pitch explanation", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Sorry in advance, but this will be long.  Also, it sounds like your friend is a tool. I hope this \"friend\" is not also your financial advisor... they would be encouraging you to make a very poor investment decision. They also don't know how to do financial math.  For what it's worth, I am not wrong. I have correctly answered a set of changing questions as you have asked them... Your friend is answering based on a third, completely different investment model, which you proposed in the edit to your last post. If that's what you meant all along, then you should have been more clear in the questions you were asking.  Please let me layout the following: How the previous questions//investment proposals were built How to analyze this current proposal What your other option is Why the other option is best in a 'real world' market The First Question My understanding of the initial proposal was to take out a $10,000 loan, invest the proceeds, and expect to not have any money of your own tied up in this. Because that OP did not specify that this is an interest-only loan (you still haven't in any of your questions), the bank will require you to make payments back to them each month that include principal and interest.  Your \"friend\" is talking about the total interest paid being the only cost of a loan. While that is (almost) true, regardless of what your friend says, significantly more cash is involved in making sure that all the payments are made on time---unless you set up an interest-only loan. But with the set up laid out in this post, and with the assumptions I specified there, the principal payments must be included because the borrower has to pay back the bank and isn't not tying up any of their own money.  In that case, my initial analysis is correct--your breakeven is in the low teens for an annual required return.  The Second Proposal Your second proposal... before any edits... refined things a little bit, to try to capture the any possible returns by not selling something. As I indicated there, (with what was an exaggerating assumption), the lack of clarity makes for an outlandish required return.  The Second Proposal...with edits, or the one proposed above I will get to the one proposed above in a second, but first let me highlight a few problems with your friend's analysis.  Simple interest: the only place (in the US at least) that will lend with simple interest is student loans. Any loan that you actually take out will be compound interest.  Not an interest only loan: your \"friend\" is not calculating interest correctly. Since this isn't an interest-only loan, the principal balance will reduce every time you make a payment, by ~$320-$340 each month. This substantially reduces the total interest paid, to $272.79 over the total 24 months.  \"Returns\": I don't know what country, or what business your friend works in, but \"returns\" are a very ambiguous concept. Investopedia defines returns as gains or losses. (I wish I could inhabit the lala land that your friend lives in when returns are always positive). TheFreeDictionary.com defines a return for finance as \"The change in the value of a portfolio over an evaluation period, including any distributions made from the portfolio during that period.\"  When you have not made it clear that any other money is being used in this investment plan (as was the case in scheme #1 and scheme #2a,) the loan still has to be paid. So, clearly the principal must be included in the return calculations.  How to evaluate this proposed investment scheme Key dimensions: Loan ($8,000 ... 24 months ... 0.27% monthly rate... monthly compounding... no loan origination fees) Monthly payment (PMT in Excel yields $344.70). Investment capital (starting = $8,000) Monthly Return (Investment yields... we hope it's positive!)  Your monthly contribution from your salary Taxes = 10%. Transaction Fees = $20  Go and lookup how to build an amortization table for a loan in Excel. Your life will be infinitely better for it.  Now, you get this loan set up and invested into something... (it costs $20 to buy the assets).  So you've got $7980 chugging away earning interest. I calculate that your break even, with you paying in $344.70 of your own money each month is 1.81% annually, or 3.42% over the 24 month life of this scheme. That is using monthly compound interest for the payments, because that's what the real world would use, and using monthly compounding of the investments' returns.  Your total interest expense would be $272.79.  This seems feasible. But let's talk about what your other option is, given that you're ready to spend $344.70 each month on an investment.  Your other option  I understand the appeal of getting $8,000... right away... to invest in something. But the risk behind this is that if the market goes down (and markets do) you're stuck paying a fixed amount for your loan that is now worth less money.  Your other option is to take your $344.70, and invest it step-by-step. (You would want to skip a month or two buying assets in the market, so that you can lessen transaction costs). This has two advantages: (1) you save yourself $272 in interest. (2) When the market goes down, you still win.  With this strategy, you still win when the market goes down because of what is commonly called \"dollar cost averaging\". When the market is up, your investments are also up. When the market goes down, your previous investments decrease in value but you can invest new money at the lower rates.  Why the step-by-step, invest your own money strategy is better At low rates (when you're looking for your break-even), the step-by-step model outperforms the loan. At higher rates of return (~4% + per year), you get the benefit of having the borrowed money earning more gains.  In fact, for every continuous (meaning set... not changing month-to-month) interest rate that you can dream up that is greater than about 4% per year, the borrowed money earns more.  At 10% per year, the borrowed money will earn about $500 more over the 2 years than your step by step investment would.  BUT I recognize that you might feel like the market will always go up. That's what everyone thinks. And that's alright.  But have one really bad month, or a couple of just-not-great-months, and your fixed 'loan' portfolio will underperform. Have a few really bad months, and your portfolio could be substantially reduced in value... but you would still be paying the same amount for it each month.  And if that happened (say your assets declined -3% in 3 of the 24 months...) You'd be losing money relative to the step-by-step portfolio.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Listen closely , Timmy , today I 'm going to tell you a sad story . A very sad story , indeed . Long ago , everyone was a farmer . Sometimes , people got together and decided that they did n't want to have to farm anymore \u2013 so they got other people to do it for them . They did this in different ways in different places , but the pattern was the same everywhere . It always involved the rise of a group of people who controlled both the religion and written knowledge of a much bigger group of people . The Sumerian priests of Ancient Mesopotamia , the Catholic Church in Medieval Europe and , of course , the * Brahmins * of ancient India are all good examples of this . The big difference between the Brahmins and the others mentioned is just in the complexity of the system . You see , Timmy , any system with one group on top is going to have a problem : everybody else is going to want some of that knowledge and power ! So , the Brahmins did something really clever , in a really mean way : they divided everybody else into even smaller groups , called * varnas * . The warriors became * Kshatriyas * , the merchants * Vaishyas * , and the poor laborers became the * Shudras * . Over a long time and lots of space , these varnas split into even smaller groups , called * jatis * . Eventually there were thousands of different jatis , scattered across all of India . However , the Big Four varnas were still the major templates for the all of these jatis , and almost everywhere the concept behind them was the same : Sure , your caste might not be the \" best \" or most powerful ... But at least you were n't a filthy Shudra , so why change the system ? Believe it or not , Timmy , thinking like this kept the caste system going for thousands of years . It 's only been in the last couple of centuries that people have started to realize that those * other * people have thoughts and hopes and dreams , too . Just like you , Timmy . Things have gotten a bit better : in India , you can no longer call people \" untouchables \" ( a nasty word for the unlucky people even below the Shudras . ) Also , at least on paper , you ca n't discriminate people based on which jati they 're from . But you have to remember , Timmy , ideas are immortal . Unlike the poor Shudras , they are n't flesh and blood . Killing them can be very , very hard . Even for grown - ups .

To use an analogy , if you are familiar with Minecraft it almost sounds like they are looking for the real universal equivalent of a [ Farlands ] ( URL_1 ) style \" bug \" in the programming of our universe . These would be limits on laws and features of physics that do n't look programmed , but as if they emerge because the \" computer \" the universe is running on lacks the resources to full express them . To continue the Farlands analogy , Minecraft places every block that makes up the world and the entities in it ( basically everything ) based on a three dimensional grid . X and Z are horizontal distances and Y is the vertical with a cap at how low and high you can go . Each thing in this world is tracked in \" meters \" to five decimal points , for example : X : 42.81942 Y : 63.000 Z : 246.80947 You are n't moving fluidly , but jumping from grid points like Z:246.80947 to 246.80948 to Z : 246.80949 so quickly and in small jumps it appears fluid . X and Z , due to this being Java based , begin to behave weirdly the farther you get from \" 0 \" .

{"text": "Crossfit gets a bad rap because of a few different reasons 1 ) Their teachers only require a weekend certification course , and as such oftentimes give their students subpar lessons on form . This leads to a high rate of injury , which increases exponentially with the WOD being such a variable , with often strange biomechanics . A strength coach for an olympic weightlifting athlete , a professional powerlifter , or a professional bodybuilder usually has either a long history of training champions , or at the very least degree in kinesiology , biomechanics or some other applicable degree . 2 ) The workouts are timed and are often using ramping up weights . Most bodybuilders or powerlifters want to get strong . The reason that the crossfit workout scheme does n't necessarily facilitate that wish is because in weightlifting high reps = /= more strength . [ Rep Chart ] ( URL_0 ) Here is a chart that shows the relationship between reps and strength . As you can see , 1 - 5 reps of heavy weight usually facilitates the greatest gains in strength or myofibilur hypertrophy , 5 - 10 reps of moderate weight increases muscle size , but not as much strength , called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy , and higher reps do n't really increase mass or strength much , but instead work out our slow twitch muscle fibers , which are used for endurance training . When you work out with high reps and low weight , you can increase your endurance quite well . The problem is the hardcore mindset of a crossfitter , combined with weights that are too heavy with no rep scheme , and bad form . As you continue lifting , any lifter will tell you your form has the greatest chance of breaking down in the last reps . This becomes a problem when there is no predisposed last rep , so your form continually breaks down over time . This is a good way to cause an injury . 3 ) The way crossfit people are portrayed , and the way bodybuilders and weightlifters act . Both are very testosterone fueled events , and as such this causes a lot of competition . One of the reasons the average crossfitter experiences negative feelings from a weightlifter is just the way that crossfit advertises itself . Phrases like ' My warm up is your workout ' and the ' hardcore , most elite athletes ' mentality really rustles peoples jimmies . That mentality , combined wth crossfits business dynamic which pumps out countless gyms , sweatshirts with logos made to look tough , and consistent facebook updates garners a lot of contempt over time . That is n't to say bodybuilders do n't have their own set of personality defects , but there has been a much longer time for society to get used to the idea of the meathead than the idea of the crossfitter . at the end of it all though , as people tend to do , we stereotype every group into one idea . The truth is there is a spectrum of different people with different mindsets that participate in every kind of lifting sport . Some of them give their sport a bad rap , some of them are shining examples of doing it right . It all depends on how it was exposed to you , and how you feel about it .

{"text": "While the question is very localized, I'll answer about the general principle. My main question is with how far away it is (over 1000 miles), how do   I quantify the travel expenses? Generally, \"necessary and ordinary\" expenses are deductible. This is true for business and also true for rentals. But what is necessary and what is ordinary? Is it ordinary that a landlord will manage the property 1000 miles away by himself on a daily basis? Is it ordinary for people to drive 1000 miles every week? I'd say \"no\" to both. I'd say it would be cheaper for you to hire a local property manager, thus the travel expense would not be necessary. I would say it would be cheaper to fly (although I don't know if its true to the specific situation of the OP, but as I said - its too localized to deal with) rather than drive from Texas to Colorado. If the OP thinks that driving a thousand miles is indeed ordinary and necessary he'll have to justify it to the IRS examiner, as I'm sure it will be examined. 2 trips to the property a year will be a nearly 100% write-off (2000   miles, hotels, etc). From what I understood (and that is what I've been told by my CPA), IRS generally allows 1 (one) trip per year per property. If there's an exceptional situation - be prepared to justify it. Also, keep all the receipts (like gas, hotel, etc.... If you claim mileage but in reality you took a flight - you'll get hit hard by the IRS when audited). Also while I'm up there am I allowed to mix business with pleasure? You cannot deduct personal (\"pleasure\") expenses, at all. If the trip is mainly business, but you go out at the evening instead of staying at the hotel - that's fine. But if the trip is \"business\" trip where you spend a couple of hours at your property and then go around having fun for two days - the whole trip may be disallowed. If there's a reasonable portion dedicated to your business/rental, and the rest is pleasure - you'll have to split some of the costs and only deduct the portion attributed to the business activities. You'll have to analyze your specific situation, and see where it falls. Don't stretch the limits too much, it will cost you more on the long run after all the audits and penalties. Can I also write off all travel involved in the purchase of the   property? Although, again, the \"necessary and ordinary\" justification of such a trip is arguable, lets assume it is necessary and ordinary and generally justified. It is reasonable to expect you to go and see the property with your own eyes before the closing (IMHO, of course, I'm not an authority). Such an expense can be either business or investment expense.

Organic food tends to be more likely to have slightly more bacteria on it , however . Though this is likely not a hugely significant factor either , I personally prefer non - dangerous \" artificial \" pesticides in my food over potentially sickness - inducing \" natural \" bacteria . With that said , a lot of it is a marketing scheme . However , there are some benefits to organic food . None of it comes from \" eating \" it , but by supporting organic food businesses , you are also supporting smaller farming businesses . These smaller farms often treat their animals better ( though not necessarily always ) and leave less of a footprint on the environment . However , the resulting product is often more expensive as well , in addition to the things mentioned above . On the front of GMOs which are generally not considered organic , no \u2014 there is no benefit to eating non - genetically modified foods . In fact , one could easily make the argument that GMOs are a very good thing , as they not only decrease the costs of food but also improve the quality of the food , making it larger and more disease - resistant . Neither of these are bad things , contrary to what non - GMO purists would argue . However , the major con to GMOs is that they often leave a larger footprint on the environment due to how they are grown . If a genetically - modified crop is engineered to be resistant to a certain pesticide , a farmer can be expected to use more of that pesticide to keep their crops safe . This can be detrimental to the local environment . However , some GMOs have been engineered to have a beneficial , opposite effect .

{"text": "As per color : It 's because black hair is the default color for hair and Africans never had environmental pressures to lose the pigment like Caucasians did . To survive in dark , cloudy Europe , Caucasians needed to lose pigment so that they could absorb more of the sun 's loving rays -- presumably this occurred over thousands of years of mutations , survival of those with the trait , natural selection , and sexual selection . This loss of pigment occurred in both the hair and the skin because the amount of pigment in both is somewhat related . Additionally , different types of pigment changes occurred in hair , but it did not particularly matter what color the hair turned to . As long as the skin lightened , the color of the hair did not matter . Thus , you could have had a genetic line with pale skin and black hair ( with the mutation only being on the skin pigmentation gene , but not the hair pigmentation gene . But , this line would still survive thanks to the light skin ) . Likewise , you could have had a genetic line with pale skin and brown or red hair ( with a mutation on the skin pigmentation genes AND on the hair pigmentation genes . This line would also survive because it had light skin . The mutation providing for red or brown hair was not necessary but not harmful , either ) .

They are really , really expensive , and not terribly efficient . Those systems can take 10 - 20 years to generate enough electricity to pay for themselves . Second problem is they do n't scale well . Each individual cell generates its own power , that power than needs to be run down a wire and combined with all of the power generated by each other cell , and this infrastructure to move the power and take the individual small amounts of power and convert them into high voltage AC current to be put into the grid is expensive . We live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do n't make sense at an industrial scale . However that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements . It has ! And even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point . Its just not fancy looking green photo - voltaic cells that have , it is concentrated solar power(CSP ) systems that have . These systems use mirrors and lenses to magnify the intensity of the sun onto a relatively small point . This small point contains a system that turns heat into steam and turns a steam turbine to create electricity . They are much cheaper at scale because the mirrors and mounting brackets for them do not require the level of manufacture that photo - voltaic does . If solar is ever to take hold at the kind of level required to become the major source of power for the world it is going to be CSP systems that do it , and not photo - voltaic . CSP systems are the only solar solution that can compete with fossil fuels on a price per kWH basis . It was calculated that the entire world power consumption could be met by covering 1 % of the world 's desert climate with CSP .

In most of the United States, the impetus for housing is so strong that it's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation, price in this case being interest rates. Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000.

{"text": "Data dredging (also known as data snooping or p-hacking)[a] is the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant, thus dramatically increasing and understating the risk of false positives. This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.\nThe process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searching\u2014perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.\nConventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis).  This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be reported to be statistically significant (even though this is misleading), since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.\nData dredging is an example of disregarding the multiple comparisons problem. One form is when subgroups are compared without alerting the reader to the total number of subgroup comparisons examined.", "label": "hc3human"}

I assume the opposite is true , get a contradiction , which ca n't happen in the world of math , meaning my assumption about the opposite being true must be false , making my original proposition true . So , let me start off by assuming the there are actually FINITELY many prime numbers , let 's say n of them . I 'll label them p1 , p2 , p3 , ... , pn .

{"text": "A program is just a bunch of very simple instructions for doing something . A programming language lets you say how to do something complicated in terms of several simple steps \u2014 including steps that are repeated ( \" loops \" ) and steps where you might decide which of two or more things to do ( \" conditionals \" ) . For instance , suppose you are programming a little robot that can move around on a piece of paper . The robot has a pen in its belly , so it draws a line wherever it goes . You would like to get the robot to draw a square . But all it knows how to do is * go forward or back by some number of inches * , and * turn left or right by some number of degrees * . So you have to tell it how to make a square out of those moves . You might write a program like this : to draw_a_square forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 end If the robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and ended up back where it started . This is , in fact , a program in the language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which used to be very popular for teaching programming to grade school students . You can find the Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that you can use repeated steps ? You can use these to make a program shorter , like this : to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That 's a lot shorter than the earlier program , but it does the same thing . It 's shorter because instead of repeating instructions ourselves , we tell the robot to repeat doing them . Programs can also take inputs , for instance , telling how big the square should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward : size right 90 ] end Or , even , instead of a square , we could draw an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon : sides : size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 / : sides ) ] end So , programs can repeat themselves and they can do different things based on their inputs . They can also control different parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to the speakers or communicating with other programs over the network .

Comstock , in world B , is unable to have a baby because of experiments done by Leteuce . Comstock in world B wants to have a baby , and Leteuce thinks that she can get him one from the world of her \" brother \" ( who is really her in the alternate universe , similar to how Comstock / Booker are the same person ) . Booker has a ton of gambling debts but no way to pay off the debts , so Male Leteuce says he can pay off the debts by giving them his baby . He agrees to do that , and they take the baby , but Booker changes his mind and chases them . Leteuece gets Anna through the rift , but part of her pinky gets cut off and stays in Booker 's world , meaning she exists in both World A and World B at the same time . This gives her the ability to open portals between worlds . These rifts can also span across various times ( for example , in one early scene Elizabeth opens a rift to NYC , and the theater marquis shows \" Star Wars \" being played , even though it 's only 1912 in the game ) . Booker sinks into alcoholism and depression after losing his baby , carves her initials ( AD ) into his hand , and gets into more debt . Leteuce again offers to wipe away the debts , if he goes to this city and brings a certain girl to New York . He agrees , and they bring him out to Maine , and pass through a rift at some point without him knowing . He goes into the light house and goes up to Columbia , rescues Elizabeth from her tower , they flee the city , etc . Elizabeth is captured by Songbird and brought back to Comstock 's house . Future version of Elizabeth brings Booker to the future and shows him what happened as a result of not having stopped Songbird from taking her , then sends him back to stop Songbird . Elizabeth opens a tear to Rapture ( from Bioshock 1 ) and Songbird is killed by the water pressure . Then they go up to the lighthouse . Each lighthouse represents a \" World \" created by a choice ( like , Booker 's choice to get baptized or not ) . Each world branches off from many different important choices . Anna realizes that as long as there is a world in which Comstock exists , there will be a world in which she ends up destroying everyone using Columbia .

{"text": "Share price is based on demand.  Assuming the same amount of shares are made available for trade then stocks with a higher demand will have a higher price.  So say a company has 1000 shares in total and that company needs to raise $100. They decide to sell 100 shares for $1 to raise their $100. If there is demand for 100 shares for at least $1 then they achieve their goal. But if the market decides the shares in this company are only worth 50 cents then the company only raises $50. So where do they get the other $50 they needed? Well one option is to sell another 100 shares. The dilution comes about because in the first scenario the company retains ownership of 900 or 90% of the equity. In the second scenario it retains ownership of only 800 shares or 80% of the equity. The benefit to the company and shareholders of a higher price is basically just math. Any multiple of shares times a higher price means there is more value to owning those shares. Therefore they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount.  A lot of starts up offer employees shares as part of their remuneration package because cash flow is typically tight when starting a new business. So if you're trying to attract the best and brightest it's easier to offer them shares if they are worth more than those of company with a similar opportunity down the road. Share price can also act as something of a credit score. In that a higher share price \"may\" reflect a more credit worthy company and therefore \"may\" make it easier for that company to obtain credit.

{"text": "The answer depends on the specific instrument to which you are referring. It is possible to make straight bets that are cash-settled and in which the underlying commodity or instrument will never be bought or sold.  It is also possible to have such a contract be settled in the underlying (if the cash value is appropriate, then the cash settlement can be used to purchase the underlying directly, if necessary).  Physical delivery was predominant until the last few decades.  Most traders, as opposed to hedgers or strategics, are going to prefer cash-settled contracts as opposed to physical delivery. It is possible to make trades with a brokerage firm such that the firm pays if the trader wins the bet.  The firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome (plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market).  The cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite, matching bet (in this way, brokers are following market price, while traders are setting it). Financially, options and contracts can be settled for cash or for the underlying, and they can be made directly with the opposite bettor or with a neutral dealer.", "label": "hc3human"}

Choice : When discussing where to eat most people only give each restaurant vote even if there are 20 Taco bells nearby and only one Juans taco shack . Taco bell and Taco shack get the same number of customers per location . Service : Small businesses often have the owner or a close relative of the owner on site . This is generally less true for franchises . Everything that small business owner has is tied into the business and they give it their all to make customers happy and want to come back . While a manager at a chain restaurant has considerably less investment in insuring customer happiness . Flexibility : A Mcdonalds franchise costs nearly a million dollars to start depending of course on location and some other factors . A local burger joint costs a 20,000 - 100,000 . If the burger joint sees a good location they can move in instantly and set up shop across the street from their old store while Mcdonalds has to check if the franchise rights will allow them to move .

{"text": "Flipping usually refers to real-estate transaction: you buy a property, improve/renovate/rehabilitate it and resell it quickly. The distinction between flipper and investor is similar to the distinction between trader and investor, even though the tax code doesn't explicitly refer to house flipping. Gains on house flipping can be considered as active business gain or passive activity income, which are treated differently: passive income goes on Schedule E and Schedule D, active income goes on Schedule C. The distinction between passive and active is based on the characteristics of the activity (hours you spent on it, among other things). Trading income can similarly be considered as either passive (Schedule D/E treatment) or active (Schedule C treatment). Here's what the IRS has to say about traders: Special rules apply if you are a trader in securities, in the business   of buying and selling securities for your own account. This is   considered a business, even though you do not maintain an inventory   and do not have customers. To be engaged in business as a trader in   securities, you must meet all of the following conditions: The following facts and circumstances should be considered in   determining if your activity is a securities trading business: If the nature of your trading activities does not qualify as a   business, you are considered an investor... Investor, in this context, means passive income treatment (Schedule D/E). However, even if your income is considered active (Schedule C), stock sale proceeds are not subject to the self-employment tax. As you can see, there's no specific definition, but the facts and circumstances matter. You may be considered a trader by the IRS, or you may not. You may want to be considered a trader (for example to be able to make a mark-to-market election), or you may not.

The Commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries each headed by a Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner.\nThere is one member per member state, but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.

The Council of the European Union then nominates the other members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President, and the 27 members as a team are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament. The current Commission is the Von der Leyen Commission, which took office in December 2019, following the European Parliament elections in May of the same year.\nThe governmental powers of the Commission have been such that some, including former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, have suggested changing its name to the \"European Government\", calling the present name of the Commission \"ridiculous\", likening it to a misnomer.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Analog data is continuous : it can take any of a range of values . Once noise is added to an analog signal , it can not be removed , because it 's impossible to tell the noise from the signal . Digital data is discrete : it can take only a finite number of values . This makes it more resistant to noise , because you can take the closest value to the received signal and as long as the noise is below a certain threshold the data can be reconstructed perfectly . Sampling is the process of converting an analog signal to a digital one . At regular intervals , you make a measurement ( called a sample ) of the analog signal . If your sample rate ( the number of samples taken per second ) is greater than twice the highest frequency in the input signal , then the orignal analog signal can be reconstructed perfectly from the samples . For this reason , it is common to remove frequencies to high to be represented correctly , otherwise artifacts known as * aliasing * can occur . To convert a digital signal to analog , you sample it , and then convert each sample to a digital value . This process will introduce some amount of noise ; the amount depends on the bit depth of the sample . The simplest way to perform this conversion is to select the digital value closest to the input signal , but this process can produce undesirable artifacts so more sophisticated methods have been devised- compare [ this image ] ( URL_0 ) , where the closest color has been selected for each pixel , to [ this one ] ( URL_1 ) , using Floyd - Steinburg dithering . To convert digital data to analog , you first output the value of each sample point in turn . The resulting signal has a stepped appearence . You then pass this signal through a filter that removes frequencies higher than twice the sample rate . The result is a signal that is very close to the original analog signal .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "I'm not aware that any US bank has any way to access your credit rating in France (especially as you basically don't have one!). In the US, banks are not the only way to get finance for a home.  In many regions, there are plenty of \"owner financed\" or \"Owner will carry\" homes.  For these, the previous owner will provide a private mortgage for the balance if you have a large (25%+) downpayment.  No strict lending rules, no fancy credit scoring systems, just a large enough downpayment so they know they'll get their money back if they have to foreclose.  For the seller, it's a way to shift a house that is hard to sell plus get a regular income. Often this mortgage is for only 3-10 years, but that gives you the time to establish more credit and then refinance.  Maybe the interest rate is a little higher also, but again it's just until you can refinance to something better (or sell other assets then pay the loan off quick). For new homes, the builders/developers may offer similar finance. For both owner-will-carry and developer finance, a large deposit will trump any credit rating concerns.  There is usually a simplified foreclosure process, so they're not really taking much of a risk, so can afford to be flexible. Make sure the owner mortgage is via a title company, trust company, or escrow company, so that there's a third party involved to ensure each party lives up to their obligations.", "label": "hc3human"}

War time had production shift / expand to Commonwealth nations , so they built their own goods in these plants post war . Empire countries / holdings became independent so did not have to have the favorable trade agreements with England and were not strong armed to take British made goods . The British did not adapt to the new free market and did not improve their goods . As well they still had the pre war attitude of arrogance and not needing to change . In the 1890 's , Germany had found that \" German made \" was a term of derision , because of the amount of poor quality cheap goods that were exported - Like \" made in China \" holds today . So they created groups and associations that manufacturers would need to join and who policed each others quality of goods . Post war destruction of German manufacturing plants and the looting of what was left by the allies meant the Germans started off white sheet , a clean slate . Situating new plants where they would be best situated and with modern buildings and equipment , also applying what was learned during World War Two in wartime production / manufacturing and applying these to manufacturing methods .

You do everything by looking out the window . In the first few lessons , though , you will start learning to use the instruments to check your height , your heading ( the direction you 're flying ) and your speed . You also learn to use the engine instruments - the rpm gauge shows how fast the engine is going , and there are temperature , pressure and fuel gauges . You learn to use the radio - possibly the only radio in the aircraft , too . For flying a simple aircraft in good weather , that 's all you need . Then , as you train to become a jet pilot , you learn to fly more and more complex aircraft in more difficult weather . In bad weather , you will be constantly referring to all six of the flight instruments . Instead of a single radio , you might need two radios for communication , and four or five different radios for navigating . But the basic layout is exactly the same as what you first learnt to fly on . More complex engines have more gauges . If you fly an aircraft with two engines , there 'll be two sets of all of the gauges . But you 've still got the same basic instruments as when you first learnt to fly . Gradually , you move on to more and more complex aircraft , and you need controls for the pressurisation , controls for the electrics and hydraulics , controls for the cabin lighting and the toilets and the in - flight entertainment .

{"text": "You say you have 90% in stocks. I'll assume that you have the other 10% in bonds. For the sake of simplicity, I'll assume that your investments in stocks are in nice, passive indexed mutual funds and ETFs, rather than in individual stocks. A 90% allocation in stocks is considered aggressive. The problem is that if the stock market crashes, you may lose 40% or more of your investment in a single year. As you point out, you are investing for the long term. That's great, it means you can rest easy if the stock market crashes, safe in the hope that you have many years for it to recover. So long as you have the emotional willpower to stick with it. Would you be better off with a 100% allocation in stocks? You'd think so, wouldn't you. After all, the stock market as a whole gives better expected returns than the bond market. But keep in mind, the stock market and the bond market are (somewhat) negatively correlated. That means when the stock market goes down, the bond market often goes up, and vice versa. Investing some of your money in bonds will slightly reduce your expected return but will also reduce your standard deviation and your maximum annual loss. Canadian Couch Potato has an interesting write-up on how to estimate stock and bond returns. It's based on your stocks being invested equally in the Canadian, U.S., and international markets. As you live in the U.S., that likely doesn't directly apply to you; you probably ignore the Canadian stock market, but your returns will be fairly similar. I've reproduced part of that table here: As you can see, your expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks. With a 20 year window, you likely can recover from any crash. If you have the stomach for it, it's the allocation with the highest expected return. Once you get closer to retirement, though, you have less time to wait for the stock market to recover. If you still have 90% or 100% of your investment in stocks and the market crashes by 44%, it might well take you more than 6 years to recover. Canadian Couch Potato has another article, Does a 60/40 Portfolio Still Make Sense? A 60/40 portfolio is a fairly common split for regular investors. Typically considered not too aggressive, not too conservative. The article references an AP article that suggests, in the current financial climate, 60/40 isn't enough. Even they aren't recommending a 90/10 or a 100/0 split, though. Personally, I think 60/40 is too conservative. However, I don't have the stomach for a 100/0 split or even a 90/10 split. Okay, to get back to your question. So long as your time horizon is far enough out, the expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks. Be sure that you can tolerate the risk, though. A 30% or 40% hit to your investments is enough to make anyone jittery. Investing a portion of your money in bonds slightly lowers your expected return but can measurably reduce your risk. As you get closer to retirement and your time horizon narrows, you have less time to recover from a stock market crash and do need to be more conservative. 6 years is probably too short to keep all your money in stocks. Is your stated approach reasonable? Well, only you can answer that. :)", "label": "hc3human"}

You'd have to check with a lawyer or court in your area, but I suspect any photocopy or image, as well as a written or carbon-copy duplicate, would not be good enough proof for a law court, since they could all be easily re-written or Photoshopped. So I don't think there's a real upside anyway. Only an official bank statement saying that the name/people written actually cashed the cheque might be \"good evidence\" (I'm having doubts that the bank's own low quality \"image\" would even qualify, unless it's verified as coming directly from the bank somehow).

{"text": "The Federal Reserve is the central component of the American banking system . When you hear economists talking about \" monetary policy \" they 're talking about the Federal Reserve . On a day to day basis , the Federal Reserve has the most direct impact on how our economy functions , including the speed at which it grows . It does this by manipulating interest rates through three major actions . These actions are : 1 . The Reserve Requirement Rate : The amount of money that a bank has to keep in reserves and is not allowed to loan out . This is meant to be a guard against banks loaning out too much and not having any money to give back to their clients . The Federal Reserve designates a rate that these banks are regulated to comply with . 2 . The Discount Rate : The interest rate at which a bank can borrow from the Federal Reserve to balance its books or loan out to clients . The Federal Reserve would rather have banks borrow from each other than the government , however , so there is a Federal Funds rate that is a lower interest rate whenever banks borrow and lend to each other . 3 . Open Market Operations : These are the actions that have the most impact on the economy . Open Market Operations grow or shrink the money supply based on whether the Federal Reserve is selling Federal Reserve bonds to the banks or buying them . When the Federal Reserve buys their bonds from the banks , they are injecting capital into the banking system and lowering interest rates . When they are selling bonds to the banks , they are decreasing the money supply and raising interest rates . All banks in the United States ( this does not include credit unions ) are legally obligated to comply with the regulations of the Federal Reserve by U.S law . Banks must \" balance their books \" every day or face fines from the Federal Reserve . Since the money supply that banks have comes directly from the Federal Reserve , all banks have similar interest rates to each other . The result is that the banking system is largely controlled by the Federal Reserve . When banks need money they go to the Federal Reserve . Thus , the Federal Reserve can control the speed at which the economy can grow at . Higher interest rates by selling bonds mean slower growth , which means less inflation . This is good for building confidence in markets and preventing an over - expansion of the economy . When a crisis such as a recession hits , interest rates are lowered by the Federal Reserve buying its bonds from the banks . Lower interest rates increases demand in the economy which can spur markets back into growth . Contrary to popular belief , banks are part of a very regulated system . There is not much they can do without the guiding hand of the Federal Reserve , which represents the Federal Government .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Taking the last case first, this works out exactly. (Note the Bank of England interest rate has nothing to do with the calculation.) The standard loan formula for an ordinary annuity can be used (as described by BobbyScon), but the periodic interest rate has to be calculated from an effective APR, not a nominal rate.

{"text": "I agree that you should CONSIDER a shares based dividend income SIPP, however unless you've done self executed trading before, enough to understand and be comfortable with it and know what you're getting into, I would strongly suggest that as you are now near retirement, you have to appreciate that as well as the usual risks associated with markets and their constituent stocks and shares going down as well as up, there is an additional risk that you will achieve sub optimal performance because you are new to the game. I took up self executed trading in 2008 (oh yes, what a great time to learn) and whilst I might have chosen a better time to get into it, and despite being quite successful over all, I have to say it's the hardest thing I've ever done! The biggest reason it'll be hard is emotionally, because this pension pot is all the money you've got to live off until you die right? So, even though you may choose safe quality stocks, when the world economy goes wrong it goes wrong, and your pension pot will still plummet, somewhat at least. Unless you \"beat the market\", something you should not expect to do if you haven't done it before, taking the rather abysmal FTSE100 as a benchmark (all quality stocks, right? LOL) from last Aprils highs to this months lows, and projecting that performance forwards to the end of March, assuming you get reasonable dividends and draw out \u00a31000 per month, your pot could be worth \u00a3164K after one year. Where as with normal / stable / long term market performance (i.e. no horrible devaluation of the market) it could be worth \u00a3198K! Going forwards from those 2 hypothetical positions, assuming total market stability for the rest of your life and the same reasonable dividend payouts, this one year of devaluation at the start of your pensions life is enough to reduce the time your pension pot can afford to pay out \u00a31000 per month from 36 years to 24 years. Even if every year after that devaluation is an extra 1% higher return it could still only improve to 30 years. Normally of course, any stocks and shares investment is a long term investment and long term the income should be good, but pensions usually diversify into less and less risky investments as they get close to maturity, holding a certain amount of cash and bonds as well, so in my view a SIPP with stocks and shares should be AT MOST just a part of your strategy, and if you can't watch your pension pot payout term shrink from 26 years to 24 years hold your nerve, then maybe a SIPP with stocks and shares should be a smaller part! When you're dependent on your SIPP for income a market crash could cause you to make bad decisions and lose even more income. All that said now, even with all the new taxes and loss of tax deductible costs, etc, I think your property idea might not be a bad one. It's just diversification at the end of the day, and that's rarely a bad thing. I really DON'T think you should consider it to be a magic bullet though, it's not impossible to get a 10% yield from a property, but usually you won't. I assume you've never done buy to let before, so I would encourage you to set up a spread sheet and model it carefully. If you are realistic then you should find that you have to find really REALLY exceptional properties to get that sort of return, and you won't find them all the time. When you do your spread sheet, make sure you take into account all the one off buying costs, build a ledger effectively, so that you can plot all your costs, income and on going balance, and then see what payouts your model can afford over a reasonable number of years (say 10). Take the sum of those payouts and compare them against the sum you put in to find the whole thing. You must include budget for periodic minor and less frequent larger renovations (your tenants WON'T respect your property like you would, I promise you), land lord insurance (don't omit it unless you maintain capability to access a decent reserve (at least 10-20K say, I mean it, it's happened to me, it cost me 10K once to fix up a place after the damage and negligence of a tenant, and it definitely could have been worse) but I don't really recommend you insuring yourself like this, and taking on the inherent risk), budget for plumber and electrician call out, or for appropriate schemes which include boiler maintenance, etc (basically more insurance). Also consider estate agent fees, which will be either finders fees and/or 10% management fees if you don't manage them yourself. If you manage it yourself, fine, but consider the possibility that at some point someone might have to do that for you... either temporarily or permanently. Budget for a couple of months of vacancy every couple of years is probably prudent. Don't forget you have to pay utilities and council tax when its vacant. For leaseholds don't forget ground rent. You can get a better return on investment by taking out a mortgage (because you make money out of the underlying ROI and the mortgage APR) (this is usually the only way you can approach 10% yield) but don't forget to include the cost of mortgage fees, valuation fees, legal fees, etc, every 2 years (or however long)... and repeat your model to make sure it is viable when interest rates go up a few percent.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.\nThe term fuzzy logic was introduced with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy set theory by Iranian Azerbaijani mathematician Lotfi Zadeh.  Fuzzy logic had, however,  been studied since the 1920s, as infinite-valued logic\u2014notably by \u0141ukasiewicz and Tarski.\nFuzzy logic is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information. Fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information (hence the term fuzzy). These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.\nFuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from control theory to artificial intelligence.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What do you see as the advantage of doing this? When you buy a house with a mortgage, the bank gets a lien on the house you are buying, i.e. the house you are buying is the collateral. Why would you need additional or different collateral? As to using the house for your down payment, that would require giving the house to the seller, or selling the house and giving the money to the seller. If the house was 100% yours and you don't have any use for it once you buy the second house, that would be a sensible plan. Indeed that's what most people do when they buy a new house: sell the old one and use the money as down payment on the new one. But in this case, what would happen to the co-owner? Are they going to move to the new house with you? The only viable scenario I see here is that you could get a home equity loan on the first house, and then use that money as the down payment on the second house, and thus perhaps avoid having to pay for mortgage insurance. As DanielAnderson says, the bank would probably require the signature of the co-owner in such a case. If you defaulted on the loan, the bank could then seize the house, sell it, and give the co-owner some share of the money. I sincerely doubt the bank would be interested in an arrangement where if you default, they get half interest in the house but are not allowed to sell it without the co-owner's consent. What would a bank do with half a house? Maybe, possibly they could rent it out, but most banks are not in the rental business. So if you defaulted, the co-owner would get kicked out of the house. I don't know who this co-owner is. Sounds like you'd be putting them in a very awkward position.", "label": "hc3human"}

When I say \" incredibly powerful \" we 're talking numbers that are literally astronomical , and which boggle the mind -- the amount of energy being put out by quasars can be billions or even trillions of times the output of our Sun . The first astronomers to detect quasar signals were so shocked by these numbers that they assumed they 'd made mistakes in their calculations . But today the figures are accepted , and astronomers and physicists now have a plausible idea for what might provide such astonishing sources of power . They believe that a quasar is , basically , a supermassive black hole . That 's a black hole which has the mass of hundreds of millions or even billions of times that of our Sun . As with all black holes , other stellar objects will be in orbit around it , and when the orbiting stars , gas and dust start to get closer to the black hole they start orbiting faster , and faster , and faster . As they approach the black hole itself they heat up to temperatures of tens of millions of degrees , and the hotter things are the more energy they radiate .

Going over the list of question tagged IPO would help you with basics. Specifically the below questions; How does a company get money by going public in an IPO? Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? Why would a stock opening price differ from the offering price?  From what I've read so far, it seems that pre-IPO an investment bank essentially buys the companies public shares, and that bank then sells them on the open market. Is the investment bank buying 100% of the newly issued public shares? And then depositing the cash equivalent into the companies bank account? Additionally, as the stock price rises and falls over the lifetime of the company how does that actually impact the companies bank balance? Quite a bit on above is incorrect.

{"text": "White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system is used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).\nWhite-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system\u2013level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements. Where white-box testing is design-driven, that is, driven exclusively by agreed specifications of how each component of software is required to behave (as in DO-178C and ISO 26262 processes), white-box test techniques can accomplish assessment for unimplemented or missing requirements.\nWhite-box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "While the brain itself does n't have pain receptors , many of the tissues surrounding it do such as the skull , blood vessels , eyes , sinus cavity , muscles , etc . When you have a headache , it is generally some sort of pressure on those areas that do have pain receptors . You feel the pulsating feeling because of your heart pumping blood to the area with pressure . With each heartbeat , the blood flowing to the area adds to the pressure , periodically causing you to feel the headache . The sensitivity to different stimuli can occur because each of those senses activates a region in the brain . When a brain region is active , it requires more blood flow ( this can be imaged using functional brain scans ) . If the headache is caused by pressure near those sensory areas on the brain , then additional stimulus to those senses will increase blood flow and thus , increase the pressure to those areas .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Adding on to the neurochemical responses , there 's absolutely a cognitive aspect as well . Neurochemistry still strives to fully account for the way transmitters and cells actually interoperate to produce the \" biological software \" that we perceive as our mind . That said , a large part of depression centers on the way depressive thoughts lead the mind to ruminate in loops . These loops cover a variety of topics that each only cast a mental spotlight on related , sad thoughts . The depressed mind wanders from thought to thought with a sense of urgency , and slowly a person can start to lose touch with happy memories , making the problem worse . For example , when a symbol like \" failure \" comes to mind , it triggers the unconscious brain to make other related thoughts more available to be \" thought of \" next . Let 's say the chief concepts are : self worth , romantic endeavors , regretful experiences , and competitions . Though the last one is related it has a different base emotion ( ambition ? ) , so it 's more distant to the thinker . Like jeopardy categories , if any concept gets selected , it opens its own box of related ideas . A depressed person can get trapped when the boxes keep leading them back through depressing territory . Lastly , social isolation often occurs with very depressed people . The isolation can make it even worse by preventing their mind from being exposed to alternate patterns of thinking . tl;dr The cognitive software we call our mind can build thinking loops around upsetting topics .

Now what you do when you meditate is that you become aware of the moment : You do n't give a fuck about all those annoying thoughts about yesterday or tomorrow or whatever . So basically you do n't think , although thoughts may still go through your head . Of course there are different approaches , sometimes you focus immensely on something ( often the breath ) which will use up all focus and therefore reduce thoughts , or you try to not - focus , where you feel and observe everything in and around you . And there are still even more approaches , for example some have to do with feelings ( try to imagine a person you do n't like and imagine you hug him / like him ) for improving compassion .

In the beginning you just sit there and afterwards you might be disappointed because you 've expected more of it .

The kicker for me was shifting your thought to a plotting a straight line of reasonable expectations on your return. Then you don't worry about how far down you are from your high (or up from your low) but you measure yourself against the expected return and you'll find some real grounding. You're investing for the long term so you're going to see 2-3 bear markets. That isn't the the time to get cold feet and react. Stay put and it will come back. The market gets back to the reasonable expectations very quickly as he confirms in all the bear markets and recessions of any note. He gives guidelines for a passive investing strategy to leverage this mentality and talks about venturing into an active strategy but doesn't go into great depth.

{"text": "Hi Raksha, Scaling is a procedure for cleaning teeth which is followed by polishing to remove stains and any other deposits accumulated in time. Scaling as i am sure as your dentist would have mentioned needs to be done every 6 months. The external stains may go with scaling and polishing but this does not result in whitening.Whitening of teeth is an entirely different procedure in which teeth lighten by 3-4 shades from the normal colour or sometimes even more. this procedure is commonly referred to as bleaching. There are 2 types of whitening procedure. one is done in clinic called inoffice procedure and the other is done by the patient in the house called home whitening. If you desire whitening, please consult your dentist for the same.Regards", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In my view there are two big ways to think about this , ( and one small one ) First , that flat design is a trend . It 's popular and on \" the cutting edge \" of design at the moment , and since many of the hottest apps and websites are beginning to use that style , if you use it as well you take on the appearance of being \" modern \" and \" trendy \" . The small idea is that making things look physical on interfaces require images or processing ( think about asking a computer to render a drop shadow on a textured image ) , so it is more efficient if things are flat and can be shown using code only . However , there is also an idea of \" embracing true digital design \" , or rather , not relying on old physical analogies to accomplish tasks in a digital space . Think about a switch in an application , it turns something on and off . To make sure users easily understand its function , you can design it to look exactly like switches they use in the real world ( example : light switch ) . They 've used those before and are familiar with how they work , so designing them with textures and shadows to look close to the real world counterpart will bring comfort to the user and easily explain the function . Even a more abstract version , one that does n't have textures or look exactly like a switch , would still rely on shadows and certain movements to mimic the physical counterpart . But now , we 've progressed where users are familiar with using digital interfaces . People use multiple devices and multiple interfaces throughout their day , and designers are starting to look at interaction and design anew . On a screen , in a digital space , how would you accomplish that same task ? What would a ' digital first ' switch look like , and even further , how would it interact ? Perhaps a switch is n't even the best interaction , perhaps a gesture or a swipe is ? ( think of any interface in a sci - fi movie like Minority Report , with grand hand gestures on a floating screen ) . In many ways the flattening of design is the decision of designers to not be bound by how things look and function in the physical world , and to think about what a user 's interaction with the digital space will be . That could represent an evolution in design and interaction , which would very much be modern thinking . That explanation may be a little too ambitious , in many ways it 's just taking a physical looking switch and reducing it to lines and boxes . But , there is some interesting depth to this recent ' modern ' take on design and how we 'll start to interact with the digital space .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are several ways that the issuers profit from CFDs. If the broker has trades on both sides (buy and sell) they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover p&l from both sides. Because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else. Here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread. If they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider.  Sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Generally, ETFs work on the basis that there exists a pair of values that can be taken at any moment in time: A Net Asset Value of each share in the fund and a trading market price of each share in the fund.  It may help to picture these in baskets of about 50,000 shares for the creation/redemption process. If the NAV is greater than the market price, then arbitrageurs will buy up shares at the market price and do an \"in-kind\" transaction that will be worth the NAV value that the arbitrageurs could turn around and sell for an immediate profit. If the market price is greater than the NAV, then the arbitrageurs will buy up the underlying securities that can be exchanged \"in-kind\" for shares in the fund that can then be sold on the market for an immediate profit. What is the ETF Creation/Redemption Mechanism? would be a source on this though I imagine there are others. Now, in the case of VXX, there is something to be said for how much trading is being done and what impact this can have.

{"text": "The balance sheet is a deceptively easy item in accounting . What it tells you is three things : 1 ) How big of a pile of stuff do I own ? 2 ) How much money did I borrow to buy my big pile of stuff that I still have to pay back ? 3 ) If I removed everything from my pile of stuff that I still owe money on , how much is left ? This smaller pile of stuff that you have paid in full for and that you do n't owe another cent on is your \" equity \" . It can be broken down to the classic accounting equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities ( Stuff in your pile that the bank can take back because you have n't paid for it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff in the pile that is paid for and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out a mortgage and buy a $ 200,000 house , and promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I own half of a house . That is my equity . The bank owns the other $ 100,000 of the house , and that is my liability . Again , the equation tells us : Total Assets ( The Whole House , 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank 's half of the house 100k ) + Equity ( my half of the house that I plunked down 100k for ) . To answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is how is it important : Let us say that I owned an entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of rat control . I take the cat to the bank , and the bank lends the cat $ 995,000 as a business loan under the agreement that the bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't paid back with interest . The cat takes the bank 's 995k and I throw in 5k of my own money that the cat never has to pay me back for , and he buys 1 million dollars worth of rat control equipment . Now if I went on Craigslist and offered to sell the cat and his 1 million dollars worth of rat control supplies to the highest bidder , my cat might sell for close to 1 million dollars . However , once the potential buyer found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to the bank still , the potential buyer would realize the EQUITY in the cat is only $ 5,000 , and would n't pay much more than that . Now that begs the question , why would I give the feline $ 5,000 that he did n't have to pay me back for ? This relates to the second use of the phrase equity in finance , which is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 to become a partner in his business . Think of this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on things that will make his business better , and that he does n't have to worry about paying me interest on or ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives me 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock of a total 200 shares outstanding . He owns the other 100 , which he assigned to himself when incorporating his business . What 's in it for me ? As owner of 50 % of the EQUITY in the company ( I own 100 of 200 total shares ) , I am entitled to half of the profits ! Now if the cat is very successful and makes $ 200,000 in profits each year after paying interest on his loan to the bank , that is great for me ! Going back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Million Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Principle Still Owed to the Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs outright to me and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed from the bank does n't change . We still have 1 million dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so that 200k is pure profit for us ( me and my cat ) as business owners . Now this $ 200,000 can either be paid to use in the form of dividends , or reinvested in new equipment and services that can help the business grow .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Think about it this way. If the strike price is $200, and cost of the option is $0.05. $200 + $0.05 is $200.05. That does not mean that the price of buying the option is more. Neither is the option writer going to pay you $70 to buy the contract.  When you are buying options, you can only have a limited downside and that is the premium that you pay for it.  In case of the $115 contract, your total loss could be a maximum of $19.3.  In case of the $130 contract, your total loss could be a maximum of $9.3. This is due to the fact that the chances of AAPL going to hit $130 is less than the chance of AAPL hitting $115. Therefore, option writers offer the lower probability contracts at a lower price.  Long story short, you do not pay for the Strike price. You only pay the premium and that premium keeps getting lower with and increase in Strike price(Or decrease if it is a put option).

{"text": "Private investors as mutual funds are a minority of the market.  Institutional investors make up a substantial portion of the long term holdings.  These include pension funds, insurance companies, and even corporations managing their money, as well as individuals rich enough to actively manage their own investments.   From Business Insider, with some aggregation:   Numbers don't add to 100% because of rounding.  Also, I pulled insurance out of household because it's not household managed.  Another source is the Tax Policy Center, which shows that about 50% of corporate stock is owned by individuals (25%) and individually managed retirement accounts (25%).   Another issue is that household can be a bit confusing.  While some of these may be people choosing stocks and investing their money, this also includes Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP) and company founders.  For example, Jeff Bezos owns about 17% of Amazon.com according to Wikipedia.  That would show up under household even though that is not an investment account.  Jeff Bezos is not going to sell his company and buy equity in an index fund.   Anyway, the most generous description puts individuals as controlling about half of all stocks.  Even if they switched all of that to index funds, the other half of stocks are still owned by others.  In particular, about 26% is owned by institutional investors that actively manage their portfolios.   In addition, day traders buy and sell stocks on a daily basis, not appearing in these numbers.  Both active institutional investors and day traders would hop on misvalued stocks, either shorting the overvalued or buying the undervalued.   It doesn't take that much of the market to control prices, so long as it is the active trading market.  The passive market doesn't make frequent trades.  They usually only need to buy or sell as money is invested or withdrawn.  So while they dominate the ownership stake numbers, they are much lower on the trading volume numbers.   TL;DR:  there is more than enough active investment by organizations or individuals who would not switch to index funds to offset those that do.  Unless that changes, this is not a big issue.", "label": "hc3human"}

It is also known as a software development life cycle (SDLC).  The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.\nMost modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile. Other methodologies include waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development, spiral development, rapid application development, and extreme programming.\nA life-cycle \"model\" is sometimes considered a more general term for a category of methodologies and a software development \"process\" a more specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific organization.[citation needed] For example, there are many specific software development processes that fit the spiral life-cycle model.

{"text": "The true answer is it depends because  it is up to the credit card issuer to follow the right path when issuing a replacement credit card. http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/will-replacement-card-hurt-my-score.aspx Typically, issuers will transfer the account history to the new trade line, says Barry Paperno, the consumer operations manager at FICO, the creator of the FICO scoring formula. The new account should have the old open date, so you should retain your payment history, he says. The credit limit and balance should also stay the same. http://blog.credit.com/2014/02/lost-or-stolen-credit-card-hurt-your-credit-scores-76724/ How Issuers Report Replacement Cards We asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies: American Express: The new card has the same open date and \u201cMember Since\u201d year as the previous card. The balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number. All payment history transfers over. Bank of America: All transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal.

{"text": "As others have pointed out, it's all about a fixed, small cost versus the potential of a large cost. If you have insurance, you know you will pay a fixed amount per month. There is a 100% probability that you will have to pay this premium. If you don't have insurance, there is a large chance that you will have no cost in any given month, and a small chance that you will have a large cost. Like my home-owners insurance costs me about $50 per month. If I didn't have insurance and my house burned down, I would be out something like $100,000. What's the chance that my house will burn down this month? Very small. But I'd rather pay $50 and not have to worry about it. On the other hand, I just bought a filing cabinet for $160 and the store offered me an \"extended warranty\" for something like $20 a year. What's the probability that some accident will happen that damages my filing cabinet? Pretty small. Even if it did, I think I could handle shelling out $160. I can imagine my stomach in knots and lying awake at nights worrying about the possibility of losing $100,000 or finding myself homeless. I can't imagine lying awake at nights worrying about losing $160 or being force to stuff my files under the bed. I'll take my chances. When I was young and had even less money than I have now, I bought cars that cost me a thousand dollars or. Even poor as I was, I knew that if the car was totaled I could dig up the cash to buy another. It wasn't worth paying the insurance premium. These days I'm driving a car that cost me $6,000. I have collision and comprehensive insurance, but I think it's debatable. I bought the car with cash to begin with, and if I had to I could scrape up the cash to replace it.

{"text": "Linguist here , and all these anecdotal answers are frustrating me because none of them are giving you an accurate or complete answer . The best examples we have of this situation come from [ feral children ] ( URL_1 ) who have grown up deprived of language contact . Do n't listen to anyone who says that pathological cases make bad examples , because they are our only non - anecdotal examples . Let me make a crucial distinction early on here that this is different from language deprived children who still grew up in a linguistically rich environment , such as deaf children growing up with speaking parents who do not know a sign language . We 'll look at those examples in a moment . Feral children show us that thought does exist without language , however complex thought becomes difficult without a linguistic framework to reference . This has a lot to do with the plasticity of the brain . What that means is that the brain is very flexible and able to restructure itself , however the feral children provide evidence that there is a critical period in this plasticity , a period in which the brain is especially flexible , that turns off once they get older and is lost forever . What we find with these children is that they sound and act developmentally disabled , even though there may not be anything wrong with their brain . Concepts beyond their basic needs are hard for them to express , and unfortunately that also makes it hard for us to tell just how thoroughly they actually understand them . Now regarding the deaf children with speaking parents : What typically happens is they develop what we call [ home - signing ] ( URL_0 ) . This is different from actual sign language because it is not a complete and grammatically bound linguistic system . Think of it like when soldiers use hand signals in the field . It gets a general message but is not as refined as actual language . Once again we find that these people are subject to a critical period , but it seems to be extended because their brain is at least being stimulated in some way . Home - sign children put in a sign language environment will quickly learn the sign language , or even create their own if all of the other children are also home - signers . What this shows us is that the capacity for language is innate , and thus inseparably tied to our ability to think . These children who could not before express complex ideas are suddenly able to do so . * * TL;DR * * The question that these two general examples bring up is : how can we tell what a person is thinking if they lack the ability to express it ? Unfortunately this is one of the big questions linguists and psychologists are currently working on . Think of language as the doorway into the mind , and if that door is locked then we can only guess what 's inside .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Excuse me , but there are way better justifications for the 5th amendment than to protect you from admitting to another crime ( which is the main thing other people are saying ) . It is the prosecution 's responsibility to prove ( by court standards ) that you are guilty . So why should it be okay for you to be forced to help them ? The idea that you are required to help someone else prove your guilt is already a justification for that part of the 5th amendment . Here are some other reasons why it is fundamentally not fair to force someone to testify against themselves : 1 . Part of any criminal case is a popularity contest . At the end of the day a judge and/or jury needs to be convinced of certain facts . We would all hope that the true facts would be the main criteria for judgment , but some amount of charisma can influence a case . Someone who is not a good speaker , or is afraid of the law , could easily say things that make them look guilty when they are n't . Again , we 're talking about forcing someone to testify against themselves . It would be unfair to put someone in that position . 2 . Judges and Jury 's are sadly not unbiased . Maybe you 're innocent but some part of the events that took place would turn the jury against you . Maybe your alibi is that you were at a gay bar and the jury is a bunch of homophobes . Or testifying would require you to reveal that your father is black and the jury is a bunch of racists . Again , since it 's the prosecution 's responsibility to prove your guilt ( to court standards ) , the idea that you should be forced to help them turn the judge or jury against you is inherently unfair . 3 . Probably most importantly is what history taught the people who started this country . Without the 5th amendment you can be forced to testify against yourself . Governments through history have used that to coerce people into admitting to crimes they did n't commit . So even without the other benefits , this would be a HUGE case for that part of the 5th amendment , and why interpreting someone as guilty for pleading it is contrary to its intent entirely . edit : completely forgot # 3 by the time I got to it .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Source, see if you have access to it Convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing.    When an investor purchases equity in a startup, the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation.  For example, if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company, and pay $1m for that stake, this implies that the company is worth $10m. Some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way, because this in turn will affect the terms under which later-stage investors will invest in the company.  Convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made.  The outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears, under terms that are governed by the terms set by the later-stage equity investor.  An equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company. Example:- Suppose an angel investor invests $100,000 using a convertible note.  Later, an equity investor invests $1m and receives 10% of the company's shares.  In the simplest possible case, the initial angel investor's convertible note would convert to 1/10th of the equity investor's claim.  Depending on the exact structure of the convertible note, however, the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor The worst-case scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well, meaning that the debt would be converted into shares, and subsequently went bankrupt. The converted shares would become worthless, but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse. Will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt? This depends on the seniority(priority) of the debt. Debt is serviced according to seniority. The higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced.

But its pointless when TV 's could only display 420p or w / e. Thus the VHS 's for example were \" formatted \" down to 420p etc etc .

So really , the movies in the cinemas in the 80 's actually were around 20 - 30,000 P if not more .. P just = pixels per line .

As your screen gets larger 1080p will look more and more vague and standard definition like and if you make your screen large enough , 1080p will look like blue and red blocks because 1080p is a resolution not an indicator of quality or data .

Staffed departments , like bakery , butcher and deli are around the edges . This is because they require water to do their jobs , and the plumbing is inside the walls . So , that 's where those departments are . This is the same reason why produce is typically along one wall ; many stores use automatic misters to hydrate the produce , which requires plumbing . Beyond that , it 's simply a study about what layout gets the most sales with the lowest amount of staff time for restocking . Items are categorized by aisle to make it easy for both customers and stockers to find where things are supposed to be . But there 's also a lot of thought given to things that need to be restocked often , and you do n't want to have too many of them close to each other on the same aisle , as this makes for some traffic jams when restocking is happening . So , they try to distribute those items on different aisles ( or different ends of the same aisle ) to alleviate that as much as possible .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "When a country is spending more money than it is taking in it can do one of three things , none of the very nice . 1 . It can decide to * * default * * and not pay it 's debt . This is possibly the worst answer since it means no one will trust the country 's debt and their credit rating will drop . Eurozone countries really ca n't do this because one default will hurt all countries on the Euro . 2 . It can * * inflate * * it 's money by printing too much money . This makes debt easier to pay but means that the savings of middle class families will be worth less . Eurozone countries ca n't do this either because all money printing need all the countries to agree and healthy countries like Germany do n't want to lose their savings because Greece and Spain ca n't pay their bills . 3 . It can implement * * austerity * * , dramatic and sudden cuts to spending with sudden increases to taxes . This is painful because it means less medical attention , less unemployment assistance , less old age pension etc . It also slows down the economy because average people have less money to spend because retired people and unemployed people have less money and taxes are higher . The problem is that the slow down in the economy usually means that any savings the government gets is lost because a slower economy means less taxable income , it is a bad and painful way to solve debt but it is the only one a member of the Euro can do by themselves . So austerity is very unpopular , not super effective but it is the only thing that can be done alone . This means these countries still generally need assistance , the bailouts being given to countries like Greece and Spain are to help cover what austerity alone ca n't . But because it is being paid for by healthy countries the bailout usually comes with conditions including austerity . Think how unpopular wall street bailouts were , and that was the US bailing out its own citizens and its own banks . Imagine if we had to bail out Mexico because Mexico is spending too much money on itself . Austerity is the only way Germany and others are willing to give money to preserve the Euro .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Nobody can predict the affects of Brexit but it is wise to consider them. We saw the pound weaken after the vote to leave and it is possible the pound will weaken further after Brexit and this devaluation could be quite dramatic. If that happens it is likely to increase inflation, UK inflation has gone from under 1% around the time of the referendum to 3% today and it could well go higher. https://www.rateinflation.com/inflation-rate/uk-historical-inflation-rate If inflation continues to increase, the Bank of England is likely to put up interest rates, as it has historically done this to hedge against inflation.  We have been living in a world of artificially low interest rates since the global crash of 2008 as the BoE has tried to stimulate recovery with lower rates.  The rates cannot continue at this level if inflation starts to rise. http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2387744/Base-rate-vs-inflation-chart-How-tell-things-really-got-better.html That in turn will put up mortgage rates.  So for example if you have a \u00a3100k mortgage at 3.92% (currently this is a reasonable rate to have) your repayments will be \u00a3523 a month.  If your mortgage rate goes up to say 7% then your repayments are \u00a3707 a month, if it goes up to 10% then it's \u00a3909 a month and so on. There is a mortgage calculator you can use to try playing with different amounts here: https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator My advice would therefore be try to get as small a mortgage as you can and make sure you can afford it quite comfortably, in case rates go up and you need to find a few hundred pounds a month extra. There are other risks from Brexit as well, house prices could fall as people decide not to buy properties due to excessive interest rates!

{"text": "It 's a combination of a whole buffet of biological parameters - from evolutionary strategies , through cell biology and genetic mechanisms ( e.g. telomere regeneration ) , through basal metabolism rate and activity . Entire books are written on the subject , but here 's a glimpse : * * i ) Evolutionary Strategies * * No doubt the most influential ( or , as [ Tinbergen would put it , the ultimate reason ] ( URL_0 ) ) as it fundamentally drives all other mechansms . Evolution is driven almost solely by the wants of individual genes - and genes favour the most efficient long - term methods of propagation that favour immortality . Turns out there are different ways you can do this , depending on varous trade - offs . Some animals find it beneficial to , due to their ecology and other reasons , basically put all their energy into making as many babies as quickly as possible ( live fast , die young ) . As selection pressure is all about passing on genes in a short space of time , there 's no selection pressure on making sure the body of that animal is maintained long - term - they invest in quick egg production or something instead . Any animal which reproduces more , more quickly is going to pass and spread those ' quick ' genes more successfully than any animal which is ' more reproduction , but over more time ' . And so lifespans shorten . Vice - versa too . Due to a number of biological properties , some animals need a long time to produce offspring ( say , gestation in a large baby elephant which can be 22 months ) and so they are under pressure to preserve themselves over time in order to produce as many babies as possible . It 's no use an elephant living a short time as it might only be able to produce one offspring , which could die . An elephant invested in long - term maintenance will have more babies and pass on more genes . It 's all about investment costs and benefits from reproduction , and subsequent selection pressure to maximise reproduction . Okay , so it 's all good saying some animals are selected to last longer than others to maximise successful sex , but how does it actually work ? Proximate causes include : * * ii ) Telomeres * * Telomeres are bits of non - coding DNA that are stuck on at the end of your chromosomes . Every time a chromosome replicates , during cell division , a teeny bit of this telomere is chopped off and lost . If you repeat the process many times , as you periodically replace cells , telomeres get shorter and shorter and eventually disappear , leaving your DNA more prone to damage . Rates of telomere reduction differ between species ( and indeed cells and tissues , but that 's another story ) and some animals are able to regenerate their telomeres with every single division . So , for example , animals like * Hydra * have a telomerase enzyme which regenerates their telomeres and helps keep their cells ' young ' and less liable to DNA damage . This helps extend the lifespan - indeed * Hydra * can be considered to be biologically immortal . Human beings lack this enzyme in most of our cells , and so our cells age , become prone to mutation ( cancer - causing or otherwise ) and we die . * * iii ) Reactive Oxygen Species * * Another cellular mechanism is the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) by the mitochondria . These are leftovers from normal energy production and are particularly dangerous in that they actively damage DNA . Animals produce these at different rates depending on their rate of energy production - which is down to their ecology and how much they might need during any given period . The more energy you need , the more ROS you produce , the more your DNA is damaged ( and you age ) . This is all down to metabolism : * * iv ) Metabolism * * Metabolism , like evolution , plays a more fundamental role and governs the cellular mechanisms . Animals have varying metabolic rates . Mice live a very active lifestyle , need lots of energy and have very quick metabolic rates - and so their cells divide rapidly , they rack up mutation more quickly , and their bodies run down a lot sooner than other animals - so they die relatively young . Whales , on the other hand , have very low metabolic rates - accumulate mutations and the like more slowly - and live much longer ( [ 200 + years in the case of bowhead whales ] ( URL_3 ) ) . Ditto with cold - blooded animals and those that live in very cold climates - such as the arctic deep - sea ( where [ some molluscs ] ( URL_2 ) can hit 400 + years ) . There 's a broad rule related to this called the [ rate - of - living theory ] ( URL_1 ) which posits that by - and - large animals have a billion heart beats in a lifetime , with links to metabolic rate . Mice beat quickly and run out sooner , whales do n't . Going back to your original question , as it turns out , dogs have a higher metabolic rate per unit mass than humans , so they burn through their cells and DNA more quickly , and therefore die sooner . * * TL;DR :* * Depending on your evolutionary niche , you either live fast and die young ( high metabolic rate ) or you live slowly and live long ( low metabolic rate ) . The main cellular mechanism is to do with telomere length ( longer the better ) and oxygen radical production ( fewer the better ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There are many ways to calculate the return, and every way will give you a different results in terms of a percentage-value. One way to always get something meaningful - count the cash. You had 977 (+ 31) and in the end you have 1.370, which means you have earned 363 dollars. But what is your return in terms of percentage? One way to look at it, is by pretending that it is a fund in which you invest 1 dollar. What is the fund worth in the beginning and in the end? The tricky part in your example is, you injected new capital into the equation. Initially you invested 977 dollars which later, in the second period became worth 1.473. You then sold off 200 shares for 950 dollars. Remember your portfolio is still worth 1.473, split between 950 in cash and 523 in Shares. So far so good - still easy to calculate return (1.473 / 977 -1 = 50.8% return). Now you buy share for 981 dollars, but you only had 950 in cash? We now need to consider 2 scenarios. Either you (or someone else) injected 31 dollars into the fund - or you actually had the 31 dollars in the fund to begin with. If you already had the cash in the fund to begin with, your initial investment is 1.008 and not 977 (977 in shares and 31 in cash). In the end the value of the fund is 1.370, which means your return is 1.370 / 1.007 = 36%. Consider if the 31 dollars was paid in to the fund by someone other than you. You will then need to recalculate how much you each own of the fund. Just before the injection, the fund was worth 950 in cash and 387 in stock (310 - 200 = 110 x 3.54) = 1.339 dollars - then 31 dollars are injected, bringing the value of the fund up to 1.370. The ownership of the fund is split with 1.339 / 1.370 = 97.8% of the value for the old capital and 2.2% for the new capital. If the value of the fund was to change from here, you could calculate the return for each investor individually by applying their share of the funds value respective to their investment. Because the value of the fund has not changed since the last period (bullet 3), the return on the original investment is (977 / 1.339 - 1 = 37.2%) and the return on the new capital is (31 / 31 = 0%). If you (and not someone else) injected the 31 dollar into the fund, you will need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period and get the average return for each period to get to a total return.

These people then invest the money in new companies and technologies ( through buying stocks , etc . ) therefore resulting in new innovation and jobs . These people might also spend the money on a more expensive car than they would otherwise been able to afford , resulting in innovation Example : if someone buys a top of the line BMW , then money is being invested in cars that can do high - tech things like auto parking , new safety technologies like airbags that shield the driver 's legs , and things like having sensors around the vehicle . Because money is being invested in these new car technologies , the technologies will get better and less expensive , resulting in a \" trickle down \" to less expensive models of car .

Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and, as of June\u00a02022[update], is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching \"Think different\" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\nApple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1\u00a0trillion in August 2018, then $2\u00a0trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3\u00a0trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "The best way is to start from an analogy to the 2D and 3D world . Take a piece of paper and draw four arrows like this : ^ | < \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 > | v These arrows define two directions ( up - down and left - right ) . Now we want to find a way to move around while having the same distance from the four heads of the arrows . This is impossible to do on paper \u2013 however you move , one or two of the heads will be farther than the others . But in our 3D world we can start from the center of the cross and stay * above * the piece of paper . We have defined a new dimension ( above - below ) , the third one . Let 's imagine that a 2D picture starts leaving the piece of paper and climbs up the third dimension . It will become a flat figure in a 3D world and it will have zero width . It can leave the sheet of paper in different ways : It can leave it all at once , or it can start rotating until only a line of it ( a 1D figure ! ) is still on the paper . Now , we 'd like to add a fourth dimension to our 3D world . So if you have six arrows like [ this ] ( URL_3 ) , you 'd want to find a way to be at the same distance from the six heads . I have trouble visualizing that , but we 'll consider the analogy with the 2D example . There would be a fourth direction we could use to leave our 3D world . We could leave it all at once , disappearing completely from the view of the other people , or we could start rotating in 4D , until only a 2D figure of us lies in this world \u2013 we would look flat to the eyes of the others . What about 4D cubes ? Again , by analogy . We can construct a 3D cube stacking up a lot of squares ( which are 2D cubes in fact ) . But we 'll be stacking them along the third dimension , the one that these 2D cubes do not possess . In the same way , a 4D creature would construct a 4D cube stacking up 3D cubes along the fourth dimension . How does a 4D cube appear to us ? Let 's consider another question : How does a 3D cube appear on a piece of paper ? If you project a rotating cube on the paper ( analogy : you want to see its shadow on the paper ) you will get [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . So , the projection ( the \" shadow \" ) of a rotating 4D cube on our 3D world would be [ this ] ( URL_1 ) . One last mind - blowing thing : Do you remember how you used to construct a 3D cube cutting a figure like this : + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + | | + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + | | | | | + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + | | + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + from a sheet of paper and gluing its edges ? We can do the same thing with 3D cubes to get a 4D cube . [ This ] ( URL_2 ) is the 3D figure you 'd have to start from , and you 'll need to move the cubes into the 4th dimension and glue some of their sides together . We can infer how to construct the 5D space and 5D cubes in the same way , but it 's even less visualizable . We 'd need to stop using intuition and learn the right mathematical tools to deal with objects of any dimensions . The basic idea is simple : we need three coordinates to identify a place in a 3D world ( latitude , longitude and altitude ; or just up - down , left - right , above - below ) , that means only 3 numbers are needed . In a 4D world , we will use four ; in a 157D space , we will need 157 . Every action I 've described before can be translated into operations with groups of 4 numbers , or groups of 157 numbers .

{"text": "[ Searched ] ( URL_0 ) Relevant [ discussion ] ( URL_3 ) Original question by [ DivineDevil ] ( URL_2 ) > ELI5 : Barclays Bank Scandal Top comment courtesy [ Ray745 ] ( URL_1 ) > Barclays is one of many large banks that each day submits an interest rate at which other large banks can borrow money for it , the LIBOR rate ( London InterBank Offered Rate ) . There are separate LIBOR rates for different time periods , so there is an overnight LIBOR , one week , two weeks , one month , three months , and so on . Many , many things are priced off of this LIBOR rate , one thing being interest rate swaps . Simply , what an interest rate swap is is a contract where one party offers to pay a fixed interest rate while the other party pays the LIBOR rate plus or minus a certain amount . So in example , party A pays 5 % to party B , and party B pays LIBOR + 3 % to party A. If LIBOR goes up eventually party A makes money , if LIBOR goes down , eventually party B makes money , it 's essentially a bet on which way LIBOR is going . What Barclays did was set their LIBOR rate either higher or lower than they should have at the request of outside traders . Essentially a trader from another bank who does a lot of business with Barclays would call up or email the guy at Barclays who sets the LIBOR rate and says something like \" Hey man , I have a huge interest rate swap on right now , if you could set the LIBOR rate just a tiny bit lower , it would be a huge help and I 'll owe you one \" . So the guy at Barclays set LIBOR at a rate that it otherwise would not be , which is illegal . This happened many , many times over the last several years , and that is why Barclays got fined $ 200 million . > TL , DR : Barclays illegally set a widely used interest rate at rates it otherwise would not have been set it to at the requests of big , important clients . > I tried explaining this as simply as possible , obviously it is a bit more complicated , if you have any more questions let me know .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Explaining this effect for movies is fairly easy . Its a bit harder for normal vision , but the usual explanation is that the same phenomenon is happening . A movie is a series of still pictures played one after the other at a certain rate . Essentially , a movie camera is just a still camera that takes a lot of pictures very fast . For slow moving objects , when you see the frames played back at speed it looks like the object is moving smoothly . This is because the object does not move very far in each frame , and our eyes and brains can fill in the gaps easily . For fast moving objects , this is not always true . If something is moving quickly , it can move quite far in the time between the individual frames of the movie . For example , lets say that a wheel was spinning at a rate of one revolution per second , and we took a picture of it once every second . In each picture , the wheel would appear to be in the same place , even though it really made a complete turn . If we slow down the wheel a bit but leave the camera the same , things get even more interesting . Now , the wheel will get almost all the way around between each frame . To our brains , it makes a lot more sense that the wheel traveled backwards a small amount than it does that it traveled almost an entire revolution in a small time . Over a lot of frames , our brains decide that the wheel must be spinning backwards .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time. Putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason: Let's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock, and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them, take your profits, and ride off into the sunset.  So you call your broker (or log into your brokerage account) and put them up for sale.  He puts in an order somewhere, the stock is sold, and your account is credited. Seems simple, right?  Well...not so fast. Professionals - I'm keeping this simple, so please don't beat me up for it! The way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as \"market makers\".  These are entities which sit between the markets and you (and your broker), and when you want to buy or sell a stock, most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker.  If you work with a large brokerage firm, sometimes they'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts, but that's another story. It is normal for there to be many, sometimes hundreds, of market makers who are all trading in the same equity.  The bigger the stock, the more market makers it attracts.  They all compete with each other for business, and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it. Given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock (Google, Apple, and Microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks), it is very competitive.  The way the makers compete is on price.  It might surprise you to know that it is the market makers, not the markets, that decide what a stock will buy or sell for. Each market maker sets their own prices for what they'll pay to buy from sellers for, and what they'll sell it to buyers for.  This is called, respectively, the \"bid\" and the \"ask\" prices.  So, if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock.  The prices you see for stocks are what are called the \"best bid and best ask\" prices.  What that means is, you are being shown the highest \"bid\" price (what you can sell your shares for) and the best \"ask\" price (what you can buy those shares for) because that's what is required.  That being said, there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher.  Many times there will be a big clump of market makers all at the same bid/ask, or within fractions of a cent of each other, all competing for business.  Trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can. The point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at.  They adjust those prices based (among other factors) on how much buying and selling volume they're seeing.  If they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they'll start marking down their bid prices.  This keeps them from paying too much for shares they're going to have to find a buyer for eventually, and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell.  Conversely, if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system, they'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains, since they're selling you shares they bought from someone else, presumably at a lower price.  But they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades.  (sneaky, eh?) Depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you're selling, and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment, your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share's price. If the block is large enough then it's possible it will not all sell to one market maker, or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price. This is a pretty complex subject, as you can see, and I've cut a LOT of corners and oversimplified much to keep it comprehensible.  But the short answer to your question is -- it depends. Hope this helps. Good luck!", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "They 're not loopholes . That 's just a propaganda word people use to confuse things . There are basically two different things that people sometimes erroneously call loopholes : There are tax deductions , and then there are standard accounting practices . A tax deduction is anything that you can * spend * money on that * reduces * your taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ 100,000 in a year . You spend a quarter of that , let 's say , on * stuff * , stuff like your mortgage and food and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 at the end of the year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your tax rate is a flat 10 % of your taxable income , and your taxable income is everything you make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of that is $ 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe the government $ 10,000 , out of the $ 75,000 you have on hand . But the government allows you to * deduct * charitable contributions from your taxable income . Meaning anything you give to charity is * subtracted from * your taxable income for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to your local soup kitchen , let 's say . That $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income just $ 50,000 , rather than $ 100,000 . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced your tax bill from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 , which is only 5 % of your gross income . Some people just look at the last sentence \u2014 you only paid 5 % of your gross income in taxes \u2014 and think that 's unfair , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we give tax deductions * hoping people will take advantage of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people to do certain things with their money , things like give to charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are just standard accounting practices . One thing that 's been in the news kind of recently is the question of personal income from hedge fund managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does n't get paid a salary ; instead , he gets a percentage of the profits the hedge fund makes under his management . Makes sense , right ? You 're tying the manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's gain , all his income is taxed at the capital gains tax rate of 15 % , not at the income tax rate of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole , but that 's just propaganda . Accounting for your income that way is what you 're * supposed to do . * It 's not a cheat . It 's how the system is set up . We can talk about whether the system * should be * set up that way or not , but the fact is that * is * how the system is set up , and the hedge fund manager who reports his income as capital gain is following the rules . If he did it any * other * way he 'd be * breaking * the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they 're almost certainly talking about things that are built into the system for good reason and which people do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does * not * imply that people are cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so you can get mad at those dirty cheats \u2026 who are in reality just doing exactly and nothing other than what the tax code tells them they 're supposed to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

The value under the special-use valuation method for real property used in farming or a closely held business if chosen for estate tax   purposes. This method is discussed later. FMV is Fair Market Value - which is the price that a willing buyer would pay for the property with reasonable knowledge of all the facts of the property.  The rest generally apply to farmland or other special-purpose land where the amount of income it generates is not properly reflected in the market value. One or more real estate professionals will run \"comps\" that show you recent sales in the same area for similar houses to get a rough estimate of fair market value.   Does it go off of the tax appraised value? Tax assessment may or may not be accurate depending on tax laws (e.g. limits to tax increases) and consistency with the actual market. Should you, prior to your death, get an independent appraiser to appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the properties value with the will or something? That should not be necessary - another appraisal will likely be done as part of the estate process after death.

{"text": "Imagine that the existing interest rate is 5%. So on a bond with face value of 100, you would be getting a $5 coupon implying a 5% yield.

If someone in the bond market buys your bond after interest price adjustment, in order to make the 10% yield (which means that an investor typically targets at least the risk-free rate on his investments) he needs to buy your bond at $50 so that a $5 coupon can give a 10% yield. The reverse happens when interest rates go down. I hope this somewhat clears the picture.

This is so you can talk to each other . IPs are arranged in blocks , and you can tell some things(like geographic location , or IP ownership ) by looking at the blocks . Some computers make decisions about what kind of services they 'll give based upon your location or who owns your IP . In your case , being in China , maybe a website says \" This is only available for people in the USA \" or whatever . So you go to someone who owns IPs in the USA , and you ask for a virtual private network(VPN ) . He gives you an IP on his network(in the USA ) and you send your traffic from your China IP , to his network in the USA , where he takes the traffic and then sends it out the USA IP he gave you . As far as anyone on the Internet is considered , your traffic is the same as any other traffic coming from his network , and you 'll be treated as such . Another way of looking at it : Say you have a business , with a bunch of computers in the same building . All of your computers have access to certain resources , like printers or servers . No one outside your building does . But now , your boss wants to work from home , but use the same servers and printers . You set him up with a VPN . When he wants to work from home , he connects to the VPN server , which gives him a local IP on the building network . So when he wants to work , his computer takes his traffic , bundles it together , and sends it to the building network . The building network then puts it on the network with his building network IP , and he can access the servers and printers as if he was sitting in the building .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Kant answers 3 big questions : 1- what is reality ? Kant says there 's a real world outside of your body . But the way you experience this world ( using your senses of seeing , hearing , touching etc . ) creates a map , or model , of this outside reality in your mind , which is unique to YOU . Even things like space and time are unique to you . So if you had different senses , like Superman has superhearing , you 'd have a completely different model of reality . 2- what should be ? ( Right and wrong ) This is Kant 's most famous contribution ( categorical imperatives . ) It means when you conclude that something is wrong , it is wrong 100 % of the time , under any circumstances , and for everybody . You ca n't say murder is wrong then justify using it in some situations ( capital punishment , war , etc . ) It does not change nor does it matter where or when . His point is that because your model of reality is unique to you , you can always come up with situations to convince yourself what you 're doing is n't wrong ( \" it 's not stealing if you 're starving . \" ) And there would be no sense of morality if enough people do that . The only way that there can be any morality is that right and wrong are universally established . 3- How should society be governed ? So since right and wrong are universal , societies should be governed by a constitution and by the rule of law . Pure democracy ( rule of majority ) is not the answer , because no matter how many people believe something to be right , wrong is always wrong .", "label": "hc3human"}

You mentioned custodian fees. This can be a sore spot for many investors. However, not all custodians are expensive, you should do your research before choosing the best one. Here is a list of custodians to help with your research Here are some of the more common pros and cons that we see. Pros:  1) You can invest in virtually anything that is considered an investment. This is great if your expertise is in an area that cannot be easily invested in with traditional securities, such as horses, private company stock, tax liens and more. 2) Control- you have greater control over your investments. If you invest in GE, it is likely that you will not have much say in the running of their business. However, if you invest in a rental property, you will have a lot of control over how the investment should operate. 3) Invest in what you know. Peter lynch was fond of saying this phrase. Not everyone wants to invest in the stock market. Many people won't touch it because they are not familiar with it. Self-directed IRAs allow you to invest in assets like real estate that you know well. Cons: 1) many alternative investments are illiquid. This can present a problem if you need to access your capital for withdrawals. 2) Prohibited transactions- This is a new area for many investors who are unfamiliar with how self-directed IRAs work 3) Higher fees- in many cases, the fees associated with self-directed IRA custodians and administrators can be higher. 4) questionable investment sponsors tend to target self-directed IRA owners for fraudulent investments. The SEC put out a good PDF about the risks of fraud with self-directed IRAs. Self Directed IRAs are not the right solution for everyone, but they can help certain investors focus on the areas they know well.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In your day to day life you deal with some things that are ~~quantified~~ quantized and some things that are continuous . For example , you could have 12 marbles , but you ca n't really have 12.5 marbles -- you would just have 12 marbles and some broken glass . By contrast , you can have 1 cup of water , or 1.5 cups , or 1 and 3/4 liters , or what have you -- any of these things is reasonable . When we ( as a species ) started to uncover the nature of matter and came across electrons they were first found as discrete , individual balls of charge with a little mass . We found that you can have 1 electron or 2 electrons , but you ca n't have 1.5 electrons -- it just does n't make sense to talk about fractions of electrons ; they do n't exist . In this sense we started to imagine electrons as little bitty particles . This is emphasized in popular descriptions of the atom , often based on the Bohr Model -- it 's the model that looks like a planet ( nucleus ) with moons ( electrons ) orbiting it . That model works quite nicely and makes lots of accurate predictions about the behavior of atoms , especially with respect to chemistry . However , as we looked deeper we realized that electrons behave like a wave . An example of this is the famous double slit experiment -- if you send a wave towards a wall with two small holes in it then you get a certain interference pattern . [ Here ] ( URL_1 ) is a video from MIT that shows the pattern that you get from this experiment using water , which we know to allow waves ( it starts with single slits and moves to double slit interference later in the video ) . When we fired a stream of electrons at a pair of slits we got an odd result . Rather than the expected lack of interference that particles experience ( imagine throwing a tennis ball through a hole in the fence -- its path is unaltered ) , the electrons actually deflected and gave an interference pattern that suggests that they are actually traveling as a * wave * . The experiment showed that the electrons were interfering with each other . As if that were n't brain - exploding enough , they then repeated the experiment shooting only one electron at a time and came up with the same pattern -- the electron travels through * both * slits , interferes with itself , then finally impacts the surface on which the interference pattern is being observed . For a particle such a description is ludicrous , but for a wave the description is expected . Returning to the structure of the atom , I mentioned the Bohr model earlier but that model is ultimately inaccurate . A more correct model is the electron cloud model -- it has the nucleus in the middle and the electrons \" smeared out \" across the space around it . The shape of the area across which the electron is spread is determined by where the electron can exist as a standing wave ( [ video ] ( URL_0 ) demonstrating standing waves on a slinkey ) . This resonance is a characteristic of a wave , not a particle . Most modern physical models for an electron treat it as a wave , but it is a special wave that is strictly countable / quantifiable . It turns out that the same is true of many other things . For example , light travels as waves in the electric and magnetic field , but light can be strictly counted as a number of photons ; light also exhibits interference patterns in a double slit pattern ( even using only 1 photon at a time ) . In fact , * everything * can be treated as a wave under the right circumstances ( I believe it was Louis de Broglie who first came up with this idea , as well as the wave nature of electrons ) ; however , most every day items are far too massive to exhibit any noticeable wave properties .", "label": "hc3human"}

A short intro : radio uses frequencies , a concept meant to split data sources apart : radio stations , gsm operators . A frequency has a bandwidth ( how much it can carry ) , an absorbtion factor and you can tradeoff speed ( up to the max bandwidth for reliability ) . A submarine signal ( ultra low freq ) can be on / off and can be heard anywhere in the world , but it can only say yes or no . A 5GHz link can be heard around your house , but carries more than 10MBps . There are many more factors at play this this , mostly that rf waves bounce , reflect , and you never know how they reach you ( fi : an earlier reflection can cancel the current signal ) . But some applications , like GSM get their dedicated frequencies . This is good , because the frequencies most likely to cancel you out are those near to you ( this is relative ) . There are also \" encoding \" techniques , called modulation . Usually you vary a fixed frequency by the amount of your signal : if you want to transmit a 440Hz signal on a 96MHz carrier signal , you vary the 96MHz signal in sync with the 440 one : from 96 000 000 - 220 to 96 000 000 + 220 . This is called frequency modulation . This is old tech , by modern standards .

The only globally widespread application of FM still in use is FM radio ( music , news ) mostly because digital replacements sucked and never caught on , while making an am receiver in case of emergencies is dead simple ( coil a wire with a diode / led scrapped out of anything on a tin can ) .

{"text": "But what if I am getting paid salary from a source in India? In other words, it may be that in India a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in US. In that case, even if my cost of living there is much less, so is my salary. There are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be. Of course some would get paid more than average. So you can try and make a logic, if in US say you are being paid more than average, you would be paid more than average elsewhere. Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country, one has the Advantage of positive pedigree bias.  There are also websites that would give the Purchasing Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs. The Real difficulty to find is whether the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in other country. If you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed. If you compare equivalence, then can you adjust.  A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US. It was with Basement and attic, 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom. He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary. However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEO's of top companies. So is living in a 3 room apartment fine? There are multiple such aspects. Drinking a Starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US. In India this would be considered luxury. A like for equivalent comparison is \"One drinks 3-4 mugs of Coffee\" in US, and average Indian drinks \"Tea/Coffee 3-4 mugs\". In India the local Tea / Coffee would be Rs 10 - Rs 20. A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150. The same applies to food. A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100. The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10. A Sub Way would be Rs 150. A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25. I personally am picky about food, so it doesn't matter where I go, I can only eat specific things, which means I spend a huge amount of money if I am outside of India. When I was in US, I couldn't afford a maid, driver or any help. In India I have 2 maids, a cooking maid and a driver. Plus I get plumber, electrician, window cleaner, and all the help without costing me much. Things that I absolutely can't dream in US.

Activation of it in the skin has a cooling affect , it is usually left on , to stop your body from overheating . so when you have capsaicin it overactivates the channel , so your body decides that it is too hot and needs to cool down so as a reaction you sweat .

{"text": "The SCHUFA explicitly says on their website that their scoring system is a secret. However, if your goal is to be credit-worthy for example to get financing for a house or a car or whatever, just pay any loans and your credit card back on time and you'll be fine. There is no need to build a credit history. I just got a mortgage on a new house without any real credit history. I have one credit card which I only use on vacations because some countries don't take my debit card, and I always put money on it before I use it, so I've technically never borrowed money from a bank at all. My banker looked at my SCHUFA with me and we saw that there was nothing in there except for the credit card, which has a 500\u20ac limit and if I maxed it out, the monthly interest would be 6,80\u20ac so he added that 6,80\u20ac to my expenses calculation and that was it. If you're having trouble getting a loan and you don't know why, you can ask the SCHUFA for the data they have on you and you can correct any mistakes they might have made. Sometimes, especially when you have the same full name and birth date as somebody else, the SCHUFA does get things mixed up and you have to sort it out.", "label": "hc3human"}

If a player skirts the line between okay and against da rules : the ref 's technically ca n't call a penalty . But the other team will police that sort of action because it can lead to career ending injuries . That 's why a lot of the fights start ; a policing action by one team on the other to the statement of \" that 's a dick thing , punch time . \" This is especially true when it comes to each team 's goal tender . They have a blue half circle in front of the goal that 's a ' no touchie ' zone but once they scoot out side of it for a better angle on the play ; fair game to get run over . But that 's a dick thing to do and the victim 's team will punish the player who did it . A second reason why is because it energizes a crowd .

This is a smart, kind of a jerky way to do it but its VERY SMART, as long as your property is worth it, raise the rent higher. You must have a very nice, clean, everything working, house. You must be willing to have anything fixed. this is all to make up the high rent. You don't want the rent way out of proportion but just a bit higher. This is because, more than likely, people who are going to pay for a higher rent don't usually leave a mess, (higher class families vs lower class people living alone..) What might also help from the risk of damage is create a fee (also what my renter did) of any painting needed done like finger prints on the wall, nails in the wall, carpet stains, etc when the tenant is ready to move out. I would suggest a required professional carpet cleaning as well when lease is up. My renter was very nice, but very strict and did all these things. He has a few properties that are very nice middle class houses. Your home sounds like it could easily pass for this kind of business depending on where you live. If the tenant leaves before his lease is up you could charge a 1-2 month's rent to be able to find a new tenant. Be proactive on finding a tenant before the lease is up.

After Pearl Harbor and in the early part of the war , Japan had arguably one of the best air forces around , at least in terms of numbers and experience . However , due to a number of mitigating factors , Japan essentially could not replace the losses that accumulated as the War in the Pacific progressed . As you drew into the later part of the campaign , the position had essentially reversed with the American air force now possessing superiority in numbers , training , experience , and resources available . With dwindling supplies ( especially fuel ) and scores of inexperienced pilots ( who ca n't get sufficient training because you 're rationing fuel ) , the principle of the Kamikaze was to maximize the amount of damage a single inexperienced pilot could inflict . In short , their pilots were so poorly trained and equipped , kamikaze was seen as one of the few ways they could inflict any damage on the Americans .", "label": "hc3human"}

Now , imagine a bit of air , that 's started rising for some reason ( maybe the wind has blown it up the side of a hill . ) As the air rises , it gets colder , due to something called Adiabatic Cooling . But imagine that this bit of air finds that , on this particular day , however much colder it gets itself as it climbs , the air around it gets colder even faster . That means that it will always be the warmest bit of air around , and warm air rises . So it rises further , and Adiabatic Cooling causes it to get colder - but as it rises , the air around it gets even cooler than it is , so it rises even more ..... and so on . As it rises , it cools - and cool air can hold less invisible water vapour . So what happens to the water vapour in the air ? It turns into tiny drops of visible water . This is how clouds forms - or at least , it 's how a particular type of cloud forms , the type that gives us the heaviest rain . They are called Cumulous clouds . The thing is , the air is * still * rising , and because of that , it can carry very light things , like little drops of water , with it . As it does so , it gets colder still , and so more water vapour turns into water and sticks to the existing water drops , making them get bigger and bigger . Eventually , they get so big and heavy that the rising air ca n't carry them any more . That 's when they fall to the ground as rain . And what determines the size of raindrops is how heavy a drop of water can be supported inside the cloud . ( Incidentally , in thunder storms , the rain drops , as they fall , get caught up again in rising air lower down inside the cloud . Each drop can fall , get caught and get carried up again many times , resulting in much bigger rain drops , and , in some cases , hail - stones as big as golf balls . )", "label": "hc3human"}

AVS is a web (or phone) service that actually verifies the address with the billing address on file with the issuing bank.  It does not use the credit card stripe.  You can see more information from various sources such as bank merchant help pages like Bank of America's. As far as what is stored on the stripe, it varies some by bank (as there are some \"optional\" areas).  The standards are discussed here. Fields include your account number, name, the expiration date, some card-specific stuff, and then the discretionary section.  I would not expect much in terms of address type information there. So - the answer to your question is that they can't really take much more than your name and CC #, unless you give it to them.  If you give a false zip code, you may have your purchase rejected.  They certainly do keep track of the credit card number, and I would suppose that is the most valuable piece to them; they can see you make purchases across time and know for a fact that it's the same exact person (since it's the same card). Additionally, zip codes for AVS from pay-at-the-pump are supposedly not generally used for marketing (see this article for example).

{"text": "You could buy options. I do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn. There are weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and even longer duration options called leaps. You have decided how long of a time frame. You also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently. Today is hypothetically a Thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on Friday ( the next day) of strike 100.5 and the call option is priced at .55 cents and you buy it. This means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0, the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying, (Say the SPY moved 55 cents up from 100 to 100.55), (100.55) minus the strike (100.5) = 5 cents, so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents ,you lost almost 91% of your money, rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less. The leverage is on a 10x scale typically. That is why timing is so important. Anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future, but if you know ****when**** you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market.

{"text": "In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search, also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.\nA brute-force algorithm that finds the divisors of a natural number n would enumerate all integers from 1 to n, and check whether each of them divides n without remainder. A brute-force approach for the eight queens puzzle would examine all possible arrangements of 8 pieces on the 64-square chessboard and for each arrangement, check whether each (queen) piece can attack any other.\nWhile a brute-force search is simple to implement and will always find a solution if it exists, implementation costs are proportional to the number of candidate solutions\u00a0\u2013 which in many practical problems tends to grow very quickly as the size of the problem increases (\u00a7Combinatorial explosion). Therefore, brute-force search is typically used when the problem size is limited, or when there are problem-specific heuristics that can be used to reduce the set of candidate solutions to a manageable size. The method is also used when the simplicity of implementation is more important than speed.\nThis is the case, for example, in critical applications where any errors in the algorithm would have very serious consequences or when using a computer to prove a mathematical theorem. Brute-force search is also useful as a baseline method when benchmarking other algorithms or metaheuristics. Indeed, brute-force search can be viewed as the simplest metaheuristic. Brute force search should not be confused with backtracking, where large sets of solutions can be discarded without being explicitly enumerated (as in the textbook computer solution to the eight queens problem above). The brute-force method for finding an item in a table\u00a0\u2013 namely, check all entries of the latter, sequentially\u00a0\u2013 is called linear search.", "label": "hc3human"}

The thin , delicate skin around your eyes may be especially susceptible . Sleeplessness can also cause fluids to accumulate around your eyelids , puffing them up so that they cast dark shadows onto the area under your eyes , according to the Mayo Clinic . To understand what causes them , we need to look at the nose . The most common cause of those dark bluish circles under the eyes is congestion around the nose . You see , the veins around the underside of the eyes drain into the veins of the nose . When your nose becomes congested or is blocked up , those veins become restricted and the flow of blood is reduced . This causes the flow of blood under the eyes to slow . The veins under the eyes become engorged causing them to swell larger and appear darker . The most common cause of congestion is allergies and the most common allergens are pet dander , house dust , pollen and foods such as milk wheat , and chocolate . Because nasal congestion is usually caused by an allergy or hay fever , these dark circles are sometimes called allergic shiners . Chronic sinus infections , recurrent colds , and blockage of the nose by large adenoids can all cause the dark circles under the eyes . Dark circles under the eyes are especially noticeable in people with fair complexions or light colored skin . Overall , dark circles under the eyes are not a sign of poor health or troubled sleep .

{"text": "Your brain has certain \" happy \" chemicals that get released everytime something good happens , like when you eat nice food , have sex , win a game , etc . Drugs mimic those chemicals . The brain sees those chemicals and thinks , ' oh well , that 's nice ' . But over a long time , the brain adapts and thinks ' hey , I get those chemicals for free all the time , I do n't even need to produce them myself , they 're expensive anyways ' , so it stops and relies on the drugs to be happy . It learns what to do to get them , and makes you want to get them . Then , when you quit cold turkey , the brain is confused and messed up , because it needs to rebalance itself . ' Where 's the happy stuff ? Get me more happy stuff . aaaw , do I have to do it myself ? Come on ! ' The great strength of the brain is learning , but when it learns to rely on things that destroy it 's chemical balance and potentially it 's life , that 's where it gets dangerous .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The different naming schemes are basically a way for Intel to distinguish how powerful each processor is . An i3 is the slowest , then an i5 , and i7 is the fastest . However , within the ' i ' series , there are now 4 ' generations ' of processors .. each year , Intel refreshes their processor lineup with new versions of the processors , so a 4th - generation i5 will be faster than a 3rd - generation i5 ( and usually newer processors are more efficient , using less electricity and running cooler , as well ) . You can tell which generation a Core - i processor is from by the number after it - 4xxx is 4th - gen , 3xxx is 3rd - gen , etc . ( so i5 - 4670 is a 4th - gen , for example ) . Pretty much any Core - i processor will be faster than a Core2Duo and probably any Core2Quad as well . The best way to compare how fast processors are in relation to each other is to look at benchmarks for specific applications though ( a benchmark is just a measure of how well a specific piece of hardware performs ) . As for how many cores each one has , it depends on which specific processor you 're talking about .. you can easily Google a specific processor to find out how many cores it has . One other thing to note is that a quad - core processor is not necessarily twice as fast as a dual - core processor . All 4 cores usually do n't run at the same speed and at the same time . More cores help more when you 're running more applications at the same time , or running a ' multi - threaded ' application , which is an application that 's specifically programmed to make better use of more cores .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Seems like a lot of answers here are mostly guesses , but some people go the idea right . Reddit does not work like most sites . The \" pages \" you go to are n't really pages . For reddits sorting to work , it has to keep all posts sorted . However , having all posts loaded and sorted would take forever to load and would just be bad website design . In fact it 's not possible . So reddit will paginate it . The way reddit does it , is every time you press next or go to the next page , it takes the i d of the last post you saw , and tells the system \" here is the last post I saw , please calculate the next 25 \" And so that 's what reddit does . It takes the last post you did see , then finds the next 25 ( or whatever your settings are ) The upside of this system is that : 1 . Content is dynamically generated - meaning if you go to page 1 , and in the time it takes you to go to page two , something was posted and got 1000 upvotes right away , you will see it on the next page load 2 . Reddit becomes paginated and easier to load and use . --- However there are downsides too , and these are both explained by the sorting algorithm . Reddits hot system is a mathematical algorithm . It uses votes and time and all sorts of little things . However , it 's not perfect . It 's just a formula that tries to calculate things . The downsides are 1 . Duplicates - it 's common and possible to go to page 2 and see some posts you saw on page 1 2 . \" Running out of reddit \" - this happens as well , when the mathematical algorithm ca n't find anymore posts . Since something is displayed as \" give me the sorted posts after X \" if X does n't have 25 posts that are sorted , it will error out . The system just ca n't sort right , and when you ask for the next 25 , it will just say \" sorry boss , got nothin . \" --- This happens most when you take too long to go to the next page , as time decay in reddit posts can be heavy . edit : Someone said in this thread that the timer of subreddits to show you on the front page has expired , which is very likely to actually be the case here .", "label": "hc3human"}

Your family history for atrial fibrilation doesn't seem to be related to your symptomatology. Has anybody besides you noticed the skin discoloration of your limbs? You are too young for such cardiac disorders. Anyway, a metabolic disorder (like thyroid dysfunction, etc.) can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and a complete check up : - a resting ECG- a chest X ray study - blood lab tests : complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, cortisol plasma levels, etc. A treadmill test and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring may be necessary if suspicions of a cardiac arrhythmia are raised.

{"text": "Good question, very well asked! The key here is that you need to find a solution that works for you two without an overt amount of effort.  So in a sense it is somewhat behavior driven, but it is also technology driven.   My wife and I use spreadsheets for both checking account management and budgeting.  A key time saver is that we have a template sheet that gets copied and pasted, then modified for the current month.  Typically 90% of the stuff is the same and each month requires very little modification.  This is one of my problems with EveryDollar.  I have to enter everything each and every month. We also have separate checking accounts and responsibility for different areas of the family expenses.  Doing this risks that we act as roommates, but we both clearly understand the money in one persons account equally belongs to the other and during hard times had to make up for shortfalls on the part of the other. Also we use cash for groceries, eating out, and other day to day expenses.  So we don't have a great need to track expenses or enter transactions. That is what works for us, and it takes us very little time to manage our money.  The budget meeting normally lasts less than a half hour and that includes goal tracking. We kind of live by the 80/20 principle.  We don't see a value in tracking where every dime went.  We see more value in setting and meeting larger financial goals like contributing X amount to retirement and things of that nature.

{"text": "Personally, I have a little checkbook program that I use to keep track of my spending and balance. Like you -- and I presume like most people -- I have certain recurring bills: the mortgage, insurance payments, car payment, etc. I simply enter these into the checkbook program about a month before the bill is due. Then I can run a transaction list that shows the date, amount, and remaining balance after each transaction. So if I want to know how much money I really have available to spend, I just look for the last transaction before my next payday, and see what the balance will be on that day. Personally, I always keep a certain amount of pad in my account so if I made a mistake and entered an incorrect amount for a check, or forgot to enter one completely, I don't overdraw the account. (I like to keep $1000 in such padding but that's way more than really necessary, it's very rare that I make a mistake of more than $100.) In my case, I don't enter electric bills or heating bills because I don't know the amount until I get the bill, and the amounts fall well within my padding, and for just two bills I can factor them in in my head. BTW I wrote this program myself but I'm sure there are similar products on the market. I used to use a spreadsheet and that worked pretty well. (Mainly I wrote the program because I have a tiny side business that I have to keep tax records for even though it makes almost no money.) You could in principle do it on paper, but the catch to that is that when you write payments on your paper ledger in advance of actually writing the check, you will often be writing down payments out of order, and so it becomes difficult to see what your balance is or was or will be on any given date. But a computer system can easily accept transactions out of order and then sort them and re-do the balance calculations in a fraction of a second.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Generally , time dilation means clocks that are moving differently , or that are in different places , wo n't necessarily tick at the same rate . Since we 're going to be talking about pairs of clocks here , let 's go ahead and imagine one . In our imagination , these clocks are * ideal . * They just work by magic , if you like . They do n't have moving parts , they ca n't run down , they never malfunction , whatever . They 're perfect time - counting devices that tick once every second , no exceptions , no matter what . For sake of having something to call them , we 'll call them Clock A and Clock B. If Clock A is moving relative to Clock B , then Clock A will tick more slowly than Clock B does . How much more slowly is a function of how fast Clock A is moving relative to Clock B. It 's not a linear relationship , though . At \" normal \" speeds \u2014 the speeds human beings move around at \u2014 the difference is so tiny it 's really tough to measure . But at unimaginably high speeds , the difference is significant . If Clock A were moving at about 86 % of the speed of light relative to Clock B , then Clock B would tick twice for every tick of Clock A. If you 're clever , you 've already noticed something weird . If Clock A is moving relative to Clock B , Clock A ticks slower \u2026 but if Clock A is moving relative to Clock B then Clock B is * also * moving relative to Clock A \u2026 and that means Clock B has to tick slower ! How can two clocks tick more slowly than each other ? The answer is they just do . If you work through the math it all becomes clear , but the crux of the thing is that in order to compare how much time has elapsed on the two clocks , you have to bring them together so you can look at them both . This will involve * accelerating * at least one of the two clocks . If you consider Clock A to be the stationary clock and say that Clock B is rocketing past at 86 % of the speed of light , in order to compare them you have to bring Clock B to rest relative to Clock A. This breaks the symmetry of the situation , and will mean that Clock A ended up measuring more elapsed time than Clock B did . Again , explaining this * in detail * requires math , but these are the core ideas . The other kind of time dilation is gravitational . The more gravity a clock \" feels , \" the slower it ticks . So a clock that 's in the basement will tick more slowly that a clock that 's on the roof . Again , the difference at the altitudes humans live at is so tiny as to be really hard to measure \u2014 not impossible ; this has been tested with very precise clocks . But it 's so slight you 'll never notice it as you ride elevators up and down . It turns out these two effects are very closely linked . Remember how I said that you have to accelerate Clock B to bring it together with Clock A and compare them , and that that acceleration breaks symmetry ? That 's exactly the same effect as gravitational time dilation . See , gravitational time dilation is n't really about * gravity * as much as it is about * not falling . * If you 're in a gravitational field , in order to * not fall * you have to * accelerate upward . * When you stand on a diving board , it 's the upward acceleration of the board pushing against you that keeps you from falling . If the board breaks , that upward acceleration goes away , and you fall . It 's the upward acceleration involved in not falling that causes gravitational time dilation , in the same way that accelerating one of two differently moving clocks to bring them together breaks symmetry and results in one clock having measured more elapsed time than the other . Here 's your example : GPS satellites have clocks on them . These clocks send out the radio equivalent of a regular tick . Your phone or whatever computes its position by listening to the ticks of multiple satellites and comparing the time between them . So time \u2014 the regularity of a clock 's ticks \u2014 is a vital part of GPS . GPS satellites are high up , in Earth orbit . That means the clocks on them tick faster than clocks at sea level . But GPS satellites are also moving pretty fast , which means the clocks on them tick more slowly than clocks at sea level . These two effects do n't quite cancel out . The faster ticking caused by altitude is a bigger effect than the slower ticking caused by relative motion , so the net result is that GPS clocks gain about 38 microseconds every day compared to stationary clocks at sea level . ( The altitude makes the clock gain 45 microseconds a day , but the speed makes the clock lose 7 microseconds a day , so the net difference is a gain of 38 microseconds a day . )", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "You're indeed right, this cannot be answered affirmatively. I will try, without going too deep in details, to brush a shallow portrait In its simplest form, a going concern company could be valued by the present value of a growing perpetuity (Cash Flow/(Required return - growth)), assuming compounding perpetual growth. That's a massive assumption for a yet to turn a dime company. That's why comparable transactions are usually used as benchmark. In this case, your PE can be thought as the inverse of a growing perpetuity, and it's size will be determined by the difference between return and growth. So when you're pre-revenue, you're basically trying to value a moonshot with everything to prove, no matter how genius the idea. Considering the high levels of financial risks due to failure, VCs will require biblical levels of returns (50% to 90% is not unheard of). Hence why they usually leave with a good chunk of the company in seed rounds. When you've had a few sales, you got to know your customer and you've tested the markets, your direction gets clearer and your prospects improve. Risks moves down a notch and the next round of financing will be at much lower rates. Your growth rate, still high but nowhere as crazy as before, can be estimated with relatively more precision. Companies turning a recurrent level of profits are the easiest to value (all else being equal). The financial mathematics are more appropriate now, and their value will be derived by current market conditions as well as comparable transactions. With unlimited resources and perfect markets, the value of the company will be the same wether the founder is at the helm or the VCs are in the place. But considering many founders need the VCs' resources to extract the value of their company and markets are imperfect, the value of the company can change significantly depending on the decisions.

{"text": "One of the \" greatest unsolved problems \" in number theory is the twin prime conjecture . \" Twin primes \" are pairs of prime numbers 2 apart , like 3 and 5 , 5 and 7 , or 41 and 43 . But as numbers get bigger prime numbers are more and more rare and also on average more spaced out . That makes sense - there 's 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100 , but only 6 primes between 1,000,000 and 1,000,100 , so of course they are going to be more spaced out on average . Considering that , you might wonder if we will run out of twin primes , and there will only be a limited amount . If you 're looking at really really huge numbers , there are so few prime numbers up there that the chance of the next odd number also being prime is small . But the conjecture ( that means \" we think it might be true but we have n't proved it yet \" ) is that there are actually infinitely many pairs two apart , so no matter how high you go , you can still find bigger pairs of prime numbers only 2 apart . This is awesome , and we really really want to prove this . The result today proved the same thing with 70 million instead of 2 - no matter how high you go , you can still find bigger pairs of prime numbers less than 70 million apart , you will never run out . This might sound like a lot more than 2 , but it 's actually really impressive . Before this paper we did n't have any limit on it , so we could n't rule out the possibility that we would eventually run out of 2 - pairs and 4 - pairs and 6 - pairs and even 1000000 - pairs and [ Graham 's number ] ( URL_0 ) -pairs ! ( Do n't worry about the last one - that number 's just so big you ca n't write it out efficiently without using special notation ) . Now that this has been proven and we finally have an upper limit , mathematicians are going to try to push it down - they could potentially get as low as 16 with the same limit . Reducing the upper limit to 70 million is phenomenal , and it 's almost as mind blowing as with 2 . Think of a really really big number . Now imagine multiplying it by itself that many times ( that 's called \" taking it to the power of itself \" ) . Now take that result to the power of itself that many times . Now repeat that last step that many times . And that one . Now imagine I said \" and that one \" that many times . I could keep going , but I think you get the point - the numbers are HUGE .

{"text": "Bloomberg suggests that two Fidelity funds hold preferred shares of Snapchat Inc.. Preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend, have lower liquidity, and don't have voting rights. Because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market. Whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law; it is completely legal for a company to hold a non-marketable interest in another, even if the company is privately held as Snapchat is. The strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold, however, may restrict ownership either banning non-market holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments. Since IPO is very costly, funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through IPO yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in  start-ups. Since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive, low cost way for start-ups to generate funds to grow. The fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares. The markdown of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market (MTM) financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value. This markdown implies that Fidelity believe that the total NPV of the company's net assets is lower than they had previously calculated. This probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case  of Snapchat. edit: by the way, since there is no market for start-up \"stocks\" pre-IPO my heart sinks a little every time I read the title of this question.

{"text": "In the United States , there are two major processes depending on where you live , I will cover both . * * Homes with sewage systems * * : When you flush a toilet the waste is pushed down the pipes in your house and into the neighborhood sewage pipes . From there it makes its way to a sewage treatment plant , helped along by pumps and gravity if the geography permits . When it arrives at the sewage plant the waste is first sent through a series of filters to catch big things like condoms , paper , and other materials that will cause damage later down the line . These are gathered and usually sent to the local landfill . After the initial screening the waste is sent through a series of treatments with microbes , which are tiny bacteria that eat the waste in the sewage . These microbes turn the bits of waste into more basic compounds . The bacteria 's byproducts sink to the bottom of the pool where the treatment happens and the water that is mostly clear of contaminants is sent to a second filtration step . At this point the water is disinfected by a number of methods , usually UV light ( UV rays , the same ones that cause sunburn kill bacteria ) or ozone ( ozone is a type of oxygen molecule that damages cells ) . Once the water 's bacterial content is low enough to be sent back into the environment without causing harm , it is usually pumped into a nearby water source such as a river , lake , or sometimes into a drainage basin . The sludge that is left in the basins is sent to another tank where it further decomposes and eventually is sent to landfills or is used in fertilizer . * * For homes hooked up to septic tanks * * : When you flush your toilet the waste is sent to a tank nearby the house where it is digested by a special type of bacteria similar to that in the sewage plants . This process is usually not mechanical , the tank itself is usually fairly deep and at one end is an inlet for the waste and at the other is an outlet for the water that is free of sludge . The water is then sent , usually downhill , to what is called a leach field where it is filtered through natural processes . The sludge that builds up in sewage plants is removed regularly , but with septic systems this is difficult and is usually done on an annual basis by a septic management company . If the sludge is not removed then the septic tank can overfill and spill into the yard or backup into the house . This process is becoming more and more rare because of the expense involved in maintenance and the difficulty in having many people using septic systems in the same area . * * What happens to the water when its cleaned :* * There is a growing movement in many regions ( particularly in the American southwest ) to send the \" cleaned \" water from sewage plants into drinking water plants rather than sending it back to rivers and streams . This is due to the lack of fresh water in those regions and the fact that the water that leaves a sewage plant is cleaner than the water that flows through the local water sources to begin with . Other regions ( example would be Cape Coral Florida ) is for the treated water to be sent back to the homes and businesses not as drinking water but as irrigation / industrial use water . This helps in areas that do n't have access to dump fresh water into an ecosystem and for regions that use a large amount of water for non - drinking purposes .", "label": "hc3human"}

Generally an imbalanced transfer is when you have a from or to account specified, but not both.  If I have imbalanced transactions I usually work them from the imbalance \"account\", and work each transaction to have its appropriate tying account, at which point it will no longer be listed under imbalance.", "label": "hc3human"}

Big engine is measured in displacement and it is the size of the combustion chamber - in other words , how big is the container that you will be filling with air / gasoline and sparking to explode . A car with four cylinders the size of a coffee cup can only fit so much explosive power , but a car with eight similar sized cylinders can fit much more . If you increase the size to that of an extra large coffee instead of a small , there is much more air / gas and therefore a bigger explosion . You can increase the size by making the cylinder wider ( bore ) or longer ( stroke ) . Then there are all kinds of little tweaks you can do such as igniting the air / gas mixture sooner or later in the stroke , shaping the head of the cylinder ( the legendary hemi is a hemispherical top ) .

{"text": "An embedded system is a computer system\u2014a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices\u2014that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. \nBecause an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints.  Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. In 2009[update], it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.[needs update]\nModern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).\nSince the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.\nEmbedded systems range in size from portable personal devices such as digital watches and MP3 players to bigger machines like home appliances, industrial assembly lines, robots, transport vehicles, traffic light controllers, and medical imaging systems. Often they constitute subsystems of other machines like avionics in aircraft and astrionics in spacecraft. Large installations like factories, pipelines and electrical grids rely on multiple embedded systems networked together. Generalized through software customization, embedded systems such as programmable logic controllers frequently comprise their functional units.\nEmbedded systems range from those low in complexity, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks, which may reside in equipment racks or across large geographical areas connected via long-distance communications lines.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "We don't have a good answer for how to start investing in poland.  We do have good answers for the more general case, which should also work in Poland.  E.g. Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career? This answer provides a checklist of things to do.  Let's see how you're doing:   Match on work pension plan. You don't mention this.  May not apply in Poland, but ask around in case it does.  Given your income, you should be doing this if it's available.   Emergency savings. You have plenty.  Either six months of spending or six months of income.  Make sure that you maintain this.  Don't let us talk you into putting all your money in better long term investments.   High interest debt. You don't have any.  Keep up the good work.   Avoid PMI on mortgage. As I understand it, you don't have a mortgage.  If you did, you should probably pay it off.  Not sure if PMI is an issue in Poland.   Roth IRA. Not sure if this is an issue in Poland.  A personal retirement account in the US.   Additional 401k. A reminder to max out whatever your work pension plan allows.  The name here is specific to the United States.  You should be doing this in whatever form is available.   After that, I disagree with the options.  I also disagree with the order a bit, but the basic idea is sound:  one time opportunities; emergency savings; eliminate debt; maximize retirement savings.  Check with a tax accountant so as not to make easily avoidable tax mistakes.   You can use some of the additional money for things like real estate or a business.  Try to keep under 20% for each.  But if you don't want to worry about that kind of stuff, it's not that important.  There's a certain amount of effort to maintain either of those options.  If you don't want to put in the effort to do that, it makes sense not to do this.   If you have additional money split the bulk of it between stock and bond index funds.  You want to maintain a mix between about 70/30 and 75/25 stocks to bonds.  The index funds should be based on broad indexes.  They probably should be European wide for the most part, although for stocks you might put 10% or so in a Polish fund and another 15% in a true international fund.   Think over your retirement plans.  Where do you want to live?  In your current apartment?  In a different apartment in the same city?  In one of the places where you inherited property?  Somewhere else entirely?  Also, do you like to vacation in that same place?   Consider buying a place in the appropriate location now (or keeping the one you have if it's one of the inherited properties).  You can always rent it out until then.  Many realtors are willing to handle the details for you.   If the place that you want to retire also works for vacations, consider short term rentals of a place that you buy.  Then you can reserve your vacation times while having rentals pay for maintenance the rest of the year.   As to the stuff that you have now:   Look that over and see if you want any of it.  You also might check if there are any other family members that might be interested.  E.g. cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.  If not, you can probably sell it to a professional company that handles estate sales.  Make sure that they clear out any junk along with the valuable stuff.   Consider keeping furniture for now.  Sometimes it can help sell a property.   You might check if you want to drive either of them.  If not, the same applies, check family first.  Otherwise, someone will buy them, perhaps on consignment (they sell for a commission rather than buying and reselling).   There's no hurry to sell these.  Think over whether you might want them.   Consider if they hold any sentimental value to you or someone else.  If not, sell them.  If there's any difficulty finding a buyer, consider renting them out.  You can also rent them out if you want time to make a decision.  Don't leave them empty too long.  There's maintenance that may need done, e.g. heat to keep water from freezing in the pipes.   That's easy, just invest that.   I wouldn't get in too much of a hurry to donate to charity.  You can always do that later.  And try to donate anonymously if you can.  Donating often leads to spam, where they try to get you to donate more.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There are certain standards that modern checks need to meet. These aren't required by law, but banks today generally insist on them. If you are able to meet these standards and print your own checks at home, you are allowed to do so. One way this is commonly done is with purchased check blanks and check printing software. Office supply stores sell check blanks that fit into standard computer printers. This check paper includes the necessary security features of checks, and using the check printing software, you can print your personal information, including your name & address, your bank's name and address, and your account numbers. The account numbers on the bottom of the checks are called the MICR code, which stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. Normally, these numbers were printed with special magnetic ink, which was used in automated check reading machines. Checks that you purchase from your bank still use magnetic ink; however, modern check readers are optical, and don't require magnetic ink. So you should be able to print checks with your printer using standard ink/toner, and not have a problem. Without purpose-specific check printing software, you could still buy blank check paper from the store, and with a little trial-and-error you could print using Excel.  The biggest challenge with doing this would be printing the MICR code: you would probably need to install an MICR font on your computer and play around with the size and location until you get it where you want it.  Doing a little Googling, I see that there are some check printing Excel templates out there, but I haven't tried any of these, and it is unclear to me whether they actually print the MICR, or whether they assume that you have blank checks with the MICR account number and check numbers already printed. Without purchasing blank check paper, you won't have any of the security features, such as microprinting, watermarks, erasure protection, anti-photocopying background, etc.  As you mentioned, if you are depositing checks via mobile phone app, as some banks now allow, none of these security features are doing any good.  The problem, however, is that you are not writing checks for yourself; you are writing checks to other people, and you have no way of knowing whether or not their banks are going to give them trouble with your checks.  There is enough check fraud out there that lots of bank tellers are very cautious.  I recommend sticking with check paper that has the security features because, if nothing else, it will make your check look more like a real check.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "One reason ( there are several ) is that the status bar gets broken down to subtasks .

Another problem is that programs often depend on other programs , and they do n't know how long the subprograms take . So if the bar presents doing 9 units of work and then letting another program take over , the first 90 % might be accurate but the last 10 % can be a crapshoot .

{"text": "yes and no , you have to understand how ABS works . Generally you have an ABS sensor that detects how fast each wheel is moving . If the wheel is locked it will release brake pressure for a thousandths of a second and you will feel a slight \" kick \" in the brake pedal . The reason this is helpful is because when your wheels lock up , you have lower friction and thus stopping power , than if you had a wheel that was not locked but in constant contact with the road . By preventing them from locking up , ABS , limits the amount of time skidding and maximizes the amount of time spent near maximum breaking power . to answer your question about whether or not it will shorten the braking distance of the car , you have to consider the next best alternative . This is called threshold braking whereby the driver exerts just the right amount of brake pressure that the wheels do n't lock but are at constant max braking . Threshold braking is extremely difficult to master and even harder to figure out on the fly in different road surfaces , especially low traction conditions like ice or snow . So to answer your question , in a predictable road surface , with a skilled driver who knows the car very well , and a slight bit of luck . ABS may not be the best because there are a few thousandths of a second where the wheels ARE locked , thus reducing maximal braking in 99.9 % of other cases , ABS will shorten stopping distance no question .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems.[a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias\u2013variance tradeoff).\nThe theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers \u201cRIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems\u201d and \u201cRIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems\u201d. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.\nRidge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables\u2014by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Data transmission and data reception or, more broadly, data communication or digital communications is the transfer and reception of data in the form of a digital bitstream or a digitized analog signal transmitted over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication using radio spectrum, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.\nAnalog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.\nData transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example, a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream, for example, using pulse-code modulation or more advanced source coding schemes.

What it does is takes over the troubled brokerage firm, books / assets and returns the money faster. Refer to SIPC - What SIPC Covers... What it Does Not and more specifically SIPC - Why We Are Not the FDIC. SIPC is free for ordinary investors. To get the same from elsewhere one has to pay the premium. Edit: The event we are saying is a large brokrage firm, takes all of the Margin Money from Customer Accounts and loses it and also sell off all the stocks actually shown as being held in customer account ... that would be to big. While its not clear as to what exactly will happens, my guess is that the limits per customers will go down as initial payments. Subsequent payments will only be done after recover of funds from the bankrupt firm. What normally happens when a brokrage firm goes down is some of the money from customers account is diverted ... stocks are typically safe and not diverted. Hence the way SIPC works is that it will give the money back to customer faster to individuals. In absence of SIPC individual investors would have had to fight for themselves.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "When property changes hands the sale prices may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of the property, and they may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of other properties. Because of the nature of the transaction: you already have an existing business relationship, the local government is likely to ignore the data point provided by your transaction when determining values of similar properties. They have no idea if there was some other factor used to determine the price. They will also not include in the calculation transactions that are a result of foreclosure becasue the target price is the loan value not the true value.  California and some other jurisdictions do add another wrinkle. You will need to determine if the transaction will trigger a reevaluation of the property value. In some states the existing laws of the state limited the annual growth of the assessment, but that could now be recaptured if the jurisdiction rules that this is a new ownership: California Board of Equalization - Change in Ownership - Frequently Asked Questions How does a change in ownership affect property taxes? Each county assessor's office reviews all recorded deeds for that   county to determine which properties require reappraisal under the   law. The county assessors may also discover changes in ownership   through other means, such as taxpayer self-reporting, field   inspections, review of building permits and newspapers. Once the   county assessor has determined that a change in ownership has   occurred, Proposition 13 requires the county assessor to reassess the   property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership   changed. Since property taxes are based on the assessed value of a property at   the time of acquisition, a current market value that is higher than   the previously assessed Proposition 13 adjusted base year value will   increase the property taxes. Conversely, if the current market value   is lower than the previously assessed Proposition 13 adjusted base   year value, then the property taxes on that property will decrease. Only that portion of the property that changes ownership, however, is   subject to reappraisal. For example, if 50 percent of the property is   transferred, the assessor will reassess only 50 percent of the   property at its current fair market value as of the date of the   transfer, and deduct 50 percent from any existing Proposition 13 base   year value. In most cases, when a person buys a residence, the entire   property undergoes a change in ownership and 100 percent of the   property is reassessed to its current market value.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I can explain it as I understand it , though I 'm sure there are others who are more knowledgable and there will certainly be those who disagree . The ACA sets minimum standards for coverage and ( theoretically ) directs people to providers that meet at least that level of service . It does not require anyone to sign up in the marketplace , and in fact , directs you elsewhere if you have other options ( I was redirected to MassHealth , aka Romneycare ) . The ACA aims to provide insurance options to people who are not covered through their workplaces , and individually - purchased policies are what we 're talking about here . There have been reports of private insurers canceling policies because they either do not meet the minimum standards , or the insurer has deemed them not profitable . The ACA does not shut down insurance polices or companies , but it has no control over what a private business chooses to offer consumers . There have also been reports on NPR of private insurers canceling a policy and informing the consumer that the new policy will now be twice as much . But when the consumer checks out the marketplace they find a more affordable / better coverage plan . Insurance companies are for - profit businesses , and notoriously unburdened by ethics , and they 're not above using scare tactics . Something to consider , I think , about those bare - bones plans that do n't meet the new minimum , is that it was insurance in name only . They covered so little that they were of very little actual use to the consumer . They were n't actually purchasing insurance so much as being fleeced for $ 75 / month . If that plan is discontinued by the provider , and the lowest policy the consumer can find is $ 125 , then yes , their costs did go up , and that can be problematic , but the insurance they have is now actually insurance rather than a useless monthly expense . I 'm a pretty liberal person , but I 'm not a die - hard Obama fan .

{"text": "Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware designed to perform specific functions more efficiently when compared to software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data that can be calculated in software running on a generic CPU can also be calculated in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both.\nTo perform computing tasks more quickly (or better in some other way), generally one can invest time and money in improving the software, improving the hardware, or both. There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\nHardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.[10] The disadvantage however, is that in many open source projects, it requires proprietary libraries that not all vendors are keen to distribute or expose, making it difficult to integrate in such projects.", "label": "hc3human"}

Historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks, since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed, and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile. But between the \"Great Recession\" and the internet, this has become much more widely known, and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork, have a lawyer sanity-check it for your local laws, file the official mortgage lien (not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes), and provide a payments-processing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient. Or whatever subset of those services you need.  I've done this. In my case it cost me a bit under $1000 to set up the paperwork so I could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan, not a gift. The amount in question was large enough, and the interpersonal issues tricky enough, that this was a good deal for us. Obviously, run the numbers. Websearching \"family loan\"  will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and can't do, along with services specializing in these transactions. NOTE: If you are actually selling something, such as your share of a house, this dance may or may not make sense. Again, run the numbers, and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web.

{"text": "tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says \" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . \" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs / live video . I did n't try to explain DCT / Quantization / entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate / coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your \" five year old did n't understand this \" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking / mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is \" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? \" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A personal computer game, also known as a PC game or computer game, is a type of video game played on a personal computer (PC) rather than a video game console or arcade machine. Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video and audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, and now its lack of physical media, make precisely assessing its size difficult. In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.\nHome computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983, leading to the era of the \"bedroom coder\". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass-market traction to console games, before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution on services such as Steam and GOG.com.\nNewzoo reports that the PC gaming sector is the third-largest category (and estimated in decline) across all platforms as of 2016[update], with the console sector second-largest, and mobile / smartphone gaming sector biggest. 2.2 billion video gamers generate US$101.1 billion in revenue, excluding hardware costs. \"Digital game revenues will account for $94.4 billion or 87% of the global market. Mobile is the most lucrative segment, with smartphone and tablet gaming growing 19% year on year to $46.1 billion, claiming 42% of the market.

The APAC region was estimated to generate $46.6 billion in 2016, or 47% of total global video game revenues (note, not only \"PC\" games). China alone accounts for half of APAC's revenues (at $24.4 billion), cementing its place as the largest video game market in the world, ahead of the US's anticipated market size of $23.5 billion.

{"text": "Any defect in the bloodstream is called an embolism - defect meaning anything that is in the bloodstream that is n't blood . When the defect is air , it is called an air embolism . You suppose the first ' question ' in our chain : how does the air get there in the first place . The usual candidates are medical procedures , though major injury to a blood vessel can have the same impact . Obviously , an injection is a medical procedure . Most medical procedures with a few exceptions involve the ' return ' side of the vascular system , ie the veins - which is by design , and has a lot of positive side effects for an AE . The effect of an AE depends on where in the circulatory system it occurs . If , as we 've indicated , the embolism occurs in a vein , it will be transmitted to the heart - specifically the right Atrium . The air will then be passed by the pumping action of the atrium into the right ventricle . This is the first place where a serious problem can occur . If the quantity of air present is enough to displace a ' large volume of blood ' - about 100 mL - then the ventricle may become partially or totally obstructed , which would prevent the movement of blood in the body , and lead to death . If there is * not * enough air to occlude the ventricle , the air will be pumped to the lungs where it has the potential to escape the body through the same process that all other blood gases do . If the AE begins in the arterial part of the vascular system , the problem can be much more serious as it can block the flow of blood to a major organ or system ( eg , the brain or heart ) . The reason this can occur in the arteries but not the veins is that the arteries only ' narrow ' in the direction of the flow of blood , and veins only ' widen . ' An AE in an artery would behave exactly as any other arterial blockage , and would lead to an infarction . Now , the blood is full of dissolved gases all the time ( that 's its primary purpose after all ) - so there is an extent to which it can handle this problem . The blood has a limited capacity to dissolve air within itself , and given time the air in blood will dissolve ( assuming it does not kill the patient first ) . So a ' very small amount ' would likely be either dissolved before anything of significance happened , or be expelled through the lungs . A larger amount could pose a more serious threat , depending on precisely how large the embolism is , and where it took place . This problem is something that is experienced by divers ( associated with decompression sickness ) - but in reverse . Gases that are dissolved in the blood under pressure come out of suspension when the pressure is decreases , causing an air embolus . Interestingly , one of the treatments for an AE is a hyperbaric chamber - basically ' playing back ' the conditions of decompression sickness in reverse .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "As someone who suffers from depression , I understand the feeling you describe . The simple answer is it 's because you have further to fall . Imagine this . You pick a ball up off of level ground . The act of you picking up that ball and holding it in your hand gives it * potential energy * because you 're resisting gravity to keep that ball in the air . The ball is storing the gravitational energy . You drop the ball at your feet and it falls until it hits the ground . Once it stops , it 's at it 's lowest state of energy . Now imagine the same situation but instead of dropping the ball at your feet , you drop it off a cliff . The ball has a lot further to go before it hits the ground . If you want to get that ball , you have to expend more energy to go get it , then fight gravity to bring it back up the cliff . When your depression kicks in again , your baseline mood level is at the bottom of that cliff . It now takes more intense events to affect your mood for the greater because it not only has to bring you to the top of the cliff , but it has to first bring you to the top of that cliff , then above it .

You 're always tired ... exhausted - both physically and mentally , even if you did n't do anything . It kills your appetite or even makes it insatiable .. you ca n't resist that bag of candy or chips . You begin to push away from things that you once enjoyed as if they were ebola . You 're now left with nothing except the dark thoughts that haunt your mind . But it 's not true ... it 's a facade ... it 's your mind playing tricks on you . It 's not real . At some point you have to realize that the only thing that can begin to make you feel better is * you . * You are an incredible person . You have made it this far in life and you 're still going . Not only that , you 're asking the right questions - * why do I feel this way ? * . Good question . * Why ? * Fuck everything in the past ... it 's called the past for a reason because you found a way to push forward , through whatever suck got in your way . You 're now in the * present * - it 's called that because it 's a gift ... it 's a blank check for your future and you 're the one holding the pen . The next question you need to ask yourself is , * How ? * As in , * How do I make myself happy ? * and , * How can I make myself a better person ? * As much as your friends and family care about you and want to see you successful , * you * have to find what motivates you to be successful . * You * need to find something to get your momentum going towards reaching positive goals and keep pushing forward until it hurts ... I had to force myself to be positive to the point where it literally physically hurt because it was just so mentally exhausting . Once you get to that point , things become easier as time goes by . You learn more positive ways to cope with your depression and anxiety . Start with something small - clean your room even if it 's one small thing at a time ... Do a few pushups , perhaps run around the block . Stay hydrated and eat right . Maintain proper hygiene and just treat your body right . If you at least treat your body right , your mind and mood will treat you right . Now here 's the other thing . There 's nothing wrong with seeking help . In fact , it 's important to know when you should . Of course you can * always * seek professional help , there are times when you * need * to seek it such as if you feel thoughts of hurting or killing yourself or someone else . With that in mind , it 's important to go see a doctor if you 're feeling depressed to help face your troubles head on . Here 's something for you : At the end of the day , write down 5 positive things that made you feel happy that day . Even something that put a small smirk on your face ... no matter how silly you think it is . At the end of each week , read the list of the past 7 days . See ? There are things that still made you happy . Reach towards those positive events and make them more plentiful . I know how hard it might seem at the time , but you have to force yourself to make the best of the worst situations ; Find the positive in the negative * until it hurts . * At the end of the day , there 's only one person that matters most in your life and that is you .

{"text": "You can find out the most money they will loan you for a car loan when you approach your current bank/credit union. They should be willing to layout options based on your income, and credit history. You then have to decide if those terms work for you. There are several dangers with getting loan estimates, they may be willing to lend you more than you can actually handle. They think you can afford it, but maybe you can't. They may also have a loan with a longer term, which does bring the monthly cost down, but exposes you to being upside down on the loan. You then use this a a data point when looking at other lenders. The last place you look is the auto dealer. They will be trying to pressure you on both the loan and the price, that is not the time to do doing complex mental calculations. The Suntrust web page was interesting, it included the quote: The lowest rate in each range is for LightStream's unsecured auto loan   product and requires that you have an excellent credit profile. It also induced the example the rate of 2.19% - 4.24%   for a 24 to 36 month loan of $10,000 to $24,999 for a used car purchased from a dealer. Also note that my local credit union has a new/used loan at 1.49%, but you have to be a member. Sunstrust seems to be in the minority. In general a loan for X$ and y months will have a lower rate if it is secured with collateral.  But Suntrust is offering unsecured loans (i.e. no collateral) at a low rate. The big benefit for their product is that you get the cash today. You can get the cash before you know what you want to buy. You get the cash before you have negotiated with the dealer. That makes that step easier. Now will they in the near future ask for proof you bought a car with the money? no idea. If you went to the same web page and wanted a debt consolidation loan the rate for the same $ range and the same months is: 5.49% - 11.24% the quote now changes to: The lowest rate in each range requires that you have an excellent   credit profile. I have no idea what rate they will actually approve you for. It is possible that if you don't have excellent credit the rate rises quickly, but 4.24% for the worst auto loan is better than 5.49% for the best debt consolidation. Excellent Credit Given the unique nature of each individual\u2019s credit situation,   LightStream believes there is no single definition for \"excellent   credit\". However, we find individuals with excellent credit usually   share the following characteristics: Finally, it should be noted again that each individual situation is   different and that we make our credit judgment based on the specific   facts of that situation. Ultimately our determination of excellent   credit is based on whether we conclude that there is a very high   likelihood that our loan will be repaid in a full and timely manner.

The new states attacked a government fort on their territory , which led to Lincoln sending troops , which led to several more states who had been on the fence seeing war as inevitable and also attempting to leave the U.S. ( I say \" attempting \" in that they ultimately did n't succeed ; the Confederacy certainly functioned as a nation for several years . ) The long version involves the centuries of slave trading , the growing divide between the mostly - agricultural South and increasingly - industrial North , and the fundamental argument of whether states or the national government had the final say .

Car buying, especially from a dealer financed, place isn't how I would recommend building your credit back up. EDIT in response to your updates: Build your credit the smart way, by not paying interest charges.  Use your lower limit card, and annually apply for more credit, which you use and pay off each and every month.  Borrowing is not going to help you.  Just because you can afford to make payments, doesn't automatically make payments a wise decision.  You have to examine the value of the loan, not what the payments are.  Shop for a good price, shop for a good rate, then purchase.  The amount you can pay every month should only be a factor than can kill the deal, not allow it. Pay cash for your vehicle until you can qualify for a low cost loan from a credit union or a bank.  It is a waste of money and time to pay a penalty interest rate because you want to build your credit.  Time is what will heal your credit score. If you really must borrow for the purchase, you must secure a loan prior to shopping for a car.  Visit a few credit unions and get pre-qualified.  Once you have a pre-approved loan in place, you can let the deal try and beat your loan for a better deal.  Don't make the mistake of letting the dealer do all the financing first.", "label": "hc3human"}

When I borrow money from a bank , a contract is signed that says . If it 's a mortgage contract , it might say , I 'll pay $ 1000 a month for 30 years . Now , you pay the bank back . But , the bank can sell that contract . And , if they do , you have to pay the new owner of that contract . So , you were paying Bank of America , and they sell it to Wells Fargo , you now have to pay Wells Fargo . Now , when big business borrow money , they ca n't just go to a bank . No one person or bank is going to lend GM $ 1 Billion Dollars . So , GM issues bonds . If GM wants to raise $ 1B , they might sell 1 Million $ 1000 bonds . Now , each bond is a contract , that says , if you buy this bond for $ 1 K , I 'll give you $ 1200 back in 3 years . You and I can buy and sell those bonds to and from other people . Now , even if you do n't buy bonds directly , most of us have a 401 K plan . And , that 401 K is invested in mutual funds . Those mutual funds often buy and sell bonds as part of their investment . So , it 's quite possible that you might owe Wells Fargo $ 300 K for your mortgage , but though your 401 K , you might hold $ 10 K worth of Wells Fargo bonds . Wells Fargo owes you $ 10K. You both owe each other . The same thing happens on a bigger scale with governments . Like companies , they issue bonds , that are bought and sold . We all know the US has a lot of debt ( ~$16 T trillion ) , and we all know that China owns a lot of it , about $ 1.2 trillion . But , what a lot of people do n't know , is that China has a lot of debt too . In fact , China 's national debt is over $ 2 trillion . So , China owes more to other people , than we owe to China . For a 5 year old , it might seem kinda silly for a country to hold debt of another country , when they owe money . But there are reasons for it . In fact , the US holds debt of other countries . The US holds about $ 6 T in foreign debt . Most of that is from the UK , but we actually hold some of China 's debt too , go figure . See , everyone is holding everyone else debt . Now , let 's look at the US debt for a second . We owe about ~$16T. Now , US government held just under $ 5 T of that ( Yes , the federal gov't owes money to itself ... wtf , I know ) , and the public ( people , companies , other countries ) held the remaining ~$11T. Of that $ 11 T , $ 5.3 T was foreign held . If you 're following the numbers , other countries owe the US more ( $ 6 T ) than we other other countries ( $ 5.3 T ) .

{"text": "It is possible to not use checks in the US. I personally use a credit card for almost everything and often have no cash in my wallet at all. I never carry checks with me. If we wanted to, we could pay all of our monthly bills without checks as well, and many people do this. 30 years ago, grocery stores didn't generally accept credit cards, so it was cash or check, though most other kinds of stores and restaurants did. Now, the only stores that I have encountered in years that do not accept credit cards are a local chicken restaurant, and the warehouse-shopping store Costco. (Costco accepts its own credit card, but not Mastercard or Visa.) Still, we do pay the majority of our monthly bills via check, and it would not be shocking to see someone paying for groceries with a check. I can't name the last time I saw someone write a check at a store exactly, but I've never seen any cashier or other patrons wonder what a check-writer was trying to do.

{"text": "You say that one property is 65% of the value of the two properties and the other is 35%.  But how much of that do the two of you actually own?  If you have co-signed mortgages on both properties, then your equity is going to be lower.  If you sold both properties, then your take away would be just half of that equity.  And while the 35% property may be less valuable, if you bought it first, it may actually have more equity.   It's the equity that matters here, not the value of the property.  With a mortgage, the bank is more of an owner than you are until you've paid down most of the loan.   You may find that the bank won't agree to a single-owner refinance.  A co-signed mortgage is a lot easier for them to collect, as they can hold either of you responsible for the entire loan.   If you sell the 65% property, then you can pay off any mortgage on that property and use the equity payout from that to buy out your relative on the 35% property.  If you currently have no mortgage, you'd even have cash back.  This is your fewest strings option.   Let's say that you have no mortgage now.  So this mortgage would be the only mortgage on the property.  It's not so much, as 15:65 is 3:13 or 18.75% of the value of the property.  That's more of a home equity loan than a mortgage.  You should be able to get a good rate.  It might reduce your short term profit, but it should be survivable if you have other income.   If you don't have other income, then seriously consider selling the 65% property and diversifying the payout into something else.  E.g. stocks and bonds.   Perhaps your relative would be willing to float you the loan.  That would save you bank fees and closing costs.  Write up a contract and agree to take assignment of the title at payoff.  You'll need to pay a lawyer to write up the contract (paying a modest amount now to cover the various future possibilities), but that should still be cheaper.   There's a certain amount of trust required on both sides, but this gives you some separation.  And of course it takes your relative out of the day-to-day management entirely.  Perhaps the steady flow of cash would provide what they need.   If your relative is willing to remain that involved, that can work.  Note that they may not want to do this, so don't get too attached to the idea.  Be prepared for a no.  This would be a great option for you, as you pretty much get everything you have now.  They get back the time meeting with you to make decisions, but they also give up control over those decisions.  Some people would not like that tradeoff.   The one time I was involved with a professional managing a property for me, the fee was around 7% of the rent.  If that fits your area, you might reasonably charge 5%.  That gives a discount for family and not being a professional.   There's a relatively easy way to find out what fits your area.  Look around and see what companies offer multiple listings.  Call until you find a couple that will do management for you.  Get quotes for managing your properties.  Now you'll know the amounts.   The big failing though is that this may not describe the issue that your relative has.  If the real problem is that the two of you have different approaches to property management, then making you the only decision maker may be the wrong direction.  This is certainly financially feasible, but it still may not be the right solution for your relationship.   If you get a no on this, I'd recommend moving on to other solutions immediately.  This may simply be too favorable to you.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Basically , in the 1950s things were very ... basic . Conservative values reigned , the biggest fashion was \" normal \" . Some today still think of this as our golden age ( unless you 're a minority or a woman ) , but everything was very inside - the - box type thinking . Buy a house with a white picket fence , get a job at the local company , have 2.5 kids , etc . At the same time , the US was introduced to Eastern Philosophy and psychedelic drugs . These had existed before , but for various reasons they became more widely available . Beat Generation authors learned about and experienced these things and decided to reject the \" normal \" values . Specifically , they wrote books / poetry about explicitly sexual things , about raw human emotions , about abnormal things like homosexuality , drugs , leaving materialism in favor of a spiritual quest , etc . This obviously was not met with praise from the \" normal \" folk , though it was hugely popular with the youth . Eventually a clash happened in the form of a trial over whether Allen Ginsberg 's famous poem Howl could be censored / banned because it was obscene . The beat poet won , and really liberalism won , as it was declared that the poem had redeeming social value ( which is a pretty interesting thing , that the courts basically gave a stamp of legitimacy to a cultural trend ) . As far as stereotypes vs. real , it is hard to say . It was a huge struggle breaking out of the \" normal \" , but it quickly gave way to the hippies and counterculture in the 60s and 70s . People who followed the Beat ideas were mostly authentic , but it would be hard to tease out a \" philosophy \" other than \" we should rebel and form a new philosophy \" . Still , as far as being interesting , it definitely is . Ginsberg ( Howl ) and Jack Kerouac ( On the Road ) are definitely the two main authors to check out , and both works are relatively short . Also Naked Lunch is fairly famous , and similarly , themed . One thing to keep in mind , though , is that along with everything else these guys were purposely rejecting normal narrative style and story structure .

The Elliott wave is an indicator based on psychology of investors. Think about it this way, if you see a huge up trend what are you most likely to do, sell and make profit or continue, this is why there is a shock before it continues. Many people will sell to be safe, especially after hearing the bad news they won't risk it. By learning the Elliott wave you'll be able to make an educated decision on whether or not to stay or leave. Here are websites on the Elliott wave: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:market_analysis:elliott_wave_theory http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/elliott-wave.html The Elliott wave is helpful in any time frame and works well with momentum.

Even if you see a sphere , it 's actually made of a bunch of tiny triangles that are so small that they give the illusion of a smooth curve . - Here is an example of Leon from Resident Evil 4 to help you visualize this fact : URL_0 - Direct3D allows video games to say to the 3D graphics hardware , \" Hey man , here are a bunch of triangles and here are instructions on where to put them , what color they should be , what textures they should have , how to light them up , etc \" - DirectSound allows video games to say to the sound card , \" Hey dude , here is a sound wave I want to you play through the speakers at this volume , with this speed , and I want you to mix it with several other sounds \" - A version of DirectX has shipped with Windows ever since Windows 95 , but they were horrible . - Windows XP shipped with DirectX 9 , which was considered to be the first version of DX that did n't totally suck . - Ever since then , DirectX 10 came with Vista and DirectX 11 with Windows 7 . - Video games are generally tested with very specific subversions of DirectX , Ex . DirectX Version 10.2.2345 - Since they do n't want to take a risk with a version they were n't tested on , they almost always install DirectX on your computer whether they need it or not . - Luckily , Microsoft was smart enough to come up with a versioning system that makes it so they do n't all step on each other 's feet .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A lease is a rental plain and simple.  You borrow money to finance the expected depreciation over the course of the lease term.  This arrangement will almost always cost more over time of your \"ownership.\"  That does not mean that a lease is always a worse \"deal.\"   Cars are almost always a losing proposition; save for the oddball Porsche or Ferrari that is too scarce relative to demand.  You accept ownership of a car and it starts to lose value.  New cars lose value faster than used cars.  Typically, if you were to purchase the car, then sell it after 3 years, the total cost over those three years will work out to less total money than the equivalent 36 month lease.  But, you will have to come up with a lot more money down, or a higher monthly payment, and/or sell the car after 36 months (assuming the pretty standard 36 month lease).  With this in mind, some cars lease better than others because the projected depreciation is more favorable than other brands or models.   Personally, I bought a slightly used car certified pre-owned with a agreeable factory warranty extension.  My next car I may lease.  Late model cars are getting so unbelievably expensive to maintain that more and more I feel like a long term rental has merit.

A more detailed response might be hashed out by someone who can elaborate on any sort of study that 's been done on the subject of addictive gaming , but I tend to believe that any game with an element of \" leveling up \" is what gives it its addicting appeal . The draw in games like WoW is that they do n\u2019t \u201c end \u201d in the sense that you beat a final boss and the credits roll .

{"text": "Of course the actual answer is a lot more complicated than \" on big hard drives \" - as there 's probably many layers of complexity between \" user uploads photo \" and \" photo ends up on a hard disk \" . So what 's likely happening is : * Photo is uploaded * A service at imgur resizes the photo , assigns it a unique name , and collects information related to the photo ( like the user that uploaded it , whether it 's a part of an album , etc ) * The information collected by that service is then stored in a database ( basically , just imagine a really big Excel table ) * The image is saved to a storage device - this can be the really complicated part , and I imagine it 's what you 're trying to figure out so I 'll go deeper .. * Imgur either hosts their own storage , or rents it from what 's now commonly refered to as a ' cloud storage provider ' ( example , [ Amazon S3 ] ( URL_2 ) ) * Regardless of the above , the image you upload ends up on some sort of SAN - a SAN ( Storage Area Network ) is basically a giant cluster of hard drives which can be carved up into chunks of storage and assigned to specific servers . A SAN ( at least , a good one ) is built in such a way that every bit of it has another bit that can take over if the first fails - it stays up if disks die , if hardware dies , if cables are unplugged - it 's built to survive almost any imaginable single failure . And that 's it , your image is uploaded , its information is living in a database , and the file itself is spread across a number of hard disks in a SAN . Now when people go to view that image , another thing happens entirely : * A webserver gets a request for \" xI8u6v.jpg \" and asks a service \" Hey , I need to know about xI8u6v.jpg \" * The service queries the database ( remember , like giant excel table ) that has all the information about \" xI8u6v.jpg \" and tells the webserver \" xI8u6v.jpg is located on this device , and it 's part of the \" Cute kittens LOL \" album created on this date and has this many views ..... etc \" * The webserver puts together a HTML page with the data the service box returned and sends it out to your web browser . And just to add one more bit to this whole shockingly complicated process - imgur likely utilizes a CDN ( Content Delivery Network ) to get all those cute pictures of cats to you even faster - a CDN ( like [ Limelight ] ( URL_1 ) , or [ Akamai ] ( URL_0 ) ) basically maintains mind - bogglingly huge and fast networks of servers and storage at thousands of places all over the globe . Why ? * Because it takes longer to transfer a picture of cats from Seattle to New York than it does from New Jersey to New York . * Because Imgur 's webserver ( and hard drives / SAN ) probably ca n't handle all the requests for cat pictures on its own - and it 's too expensive to build it at such a scale that it could handle the traffic from a bunch of front - page images and redditors on their lunch hour . I mean , open your biggest \" pictures \" folder on your computer , and watch how long it takes to build previews of each photo - now imagine hundreds of thousands , if not MILLIONS of people doing that at the same time and you can imagine how things start getting real slow , real fast . * Not to mention , it 'd be a pain to build a server to handle all the traffic from a hugely popular post when you do n't need to handle all that traffic all the time - most of the time your investment in big hardware would wasted So , the CDN sits between you and Imgur - and when it sees your request for \" xI8u6v.jpg \" says one of two things : * \" Oh shit , I do n't know what that picture is \" - and goes to imgur , downloads the image and remembers it in case someone else nearby wants it * \" Oh some guy near you just asked for that picture , I remember it !

{"text": "A subsidy is a payment made by a group (usually the state) to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise. For example, if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted, for example a GM maize that brings in high yields but can only be processed to High Fructose Corn Syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption, then if demand for both exceeds supply, the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former. If the claims that HFCS contribute to obesity are founded, then it is in the public interest to produce less of it, and more alternative foods. Given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired, this cannot be achieved by decree, but rather money is used as an incentive. In the long term, this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs, so it is a rational economic decision from the state's point of view. In a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest, in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods, and market mechanisms would provide these.", "label": "hc3human"}

Somewhere between 6,000 and about 1 million years depending on who you ask and how you define \" human \" . Creationists obviously like smaller numbers , but even among secular evolutionary theorists , exactly when you start counting primates other than * homo sapiens * \" human \" is subject to some debate . * Homo habilus * is thought to be about 2.3 million years old , but * homo sapiens * proper is probably only like 100,000 to 200,000 years old at most . The problem we 've got is that we have * absolutely no idea * what our early ancestors ' skin color was . That sort of evidence does n't survive in the fossil record . We 've only got even semi - realistic images ( e.g. , paintings ) going back maybe two thousand years , and it 's clear that modern skin tones were already present then , so that 's no help either . Same goes for what little textual evidence we have from before that . This means that we really ca n't give any kind of good estimate based on * historical * evidence , because the evidence simply does n't exist . But let 's set that aside for a moment and talk about what we * do * know , i.e. , * biological * evidence . If a person with the darkest skin imaginable has kids with someone with the lightest skin imaginable , odds are very good that the kids complexion will be in the middle . And if * they * have kids with another fair - skinned person , the grandkids will be fairer than they . Etc . So within as little as two or three generations , a family can go from very dark to fairly far on the light side just by procreating with light - skinned people . Read up about [ quadroons ] ( URL_0 ) , i.e. , people of mixed - race heritage . During the period before the American Civil War , there were many children of former slaves who were visually indistinguishable from white folks that were invited to give public speeches at abolitionist organizations . The organizations hoped that this would help to show that the differences between races really were n't all that big , i.e. , \" Look , it only takes a generation or two to produce people who look just like you do ! \" This suggests that it really does n't take very long at all for skin color to be affected by genetic pairing . Granted , things will probably take longer if you 're starting with a population that has a more - or - less uniform skin color . But even then , two people with relatively similar complexions can have a kid who is darker or lighter than either of them . Given what we do know about how rapidly skin color can change in family trees , the answer is : \" Relatively speaking , probably not very long at all , regardless of how old you think humanity is . \"", "label": "hc3human"}

Can an individual, or more appropriately, what keeps an individual from being able to charge, fine or penalize a Business? If it could be accomplished, but at a high cost, let's assume it's based on principal and not monetary gain. And have a legal entitlement to money back?  No.  You are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around, but there's no legal obligation for him to pay up, unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so. Corporations also cannot simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it; you must have either agreed to pay it in the past, or now agree to pay it in exchange for something. In these cases, the corporations have the power: you have to agree to their rules to play ball.   However, consumers do have a significant power as well, in well-competed markets: the power to do business with someone else.  You don't like the restocking fee?  Buy from Amazon, which offers free shipping on returns.  You don't like paying a no-show fee from the doctor?  Find a doctor without one (or with a more forgiving fee), or with a low enough caseload that you don't have to make appointments early.  Your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them. In some markets, though, consumers don't have a lot of power - for example, cable television (or other utilities). The FCC has a list of Customer Service Standards, which cable companies are required to meet, and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that.

{"text": "In practical terms, it shouldn't.  Market cap changes every day (assuming public trading, of course) or even second-by-second, and focusing on investor sentiment toward your company's stock is not the wisest way to make strategic decisions. That being said, company execs do need to be mindful of unusual swings in their company's share prices because it can sometimes be an indicator of news/information of which they're unaware.  At the same time, you can't just disregard your shareholders, especially the big institutional players who may have large voting blocks with which to replace you if they feel you're not responsive to events.  They are the ones who make strategic decisions based on your company's share price, right? (grin) The issue around swings in market cap is more about public perception than reality, so it is important for companies to have a good public relations strategy ready to go that can address questions/concerns in case of some market event.  After all, consumers who hear that a company's share price has suddenly fallen by, say, 30% might be more hesitant to do business with that company because there's a (perhaps irrational) fear the company's not doing well and may not be around much longer. Investors are, by their very nature, emotional rather than rational.  Any kind of news can cause a stampede toward or away from a stock for no reason that an investment professional could ever explain.  That's why it's impossible to spend any real time focusing on market cap (leave that to your P.R. department to worry about). IF, as a company executive, you focus on doing the right things to make your company successful then any questions/concerns about market cap will resolve themselves.

Every day , he and his co - workers threw out a lot of scrap pieces , called sortings , left over from cutting paper into the right sized sheets . He knew there had to be a use for them and eventually hit on the idea of cutting the sortings to the same size and binding them into small notepads . Since the paper was essentially trash to the mill , they could sell the pads at low prices . The first few batches of pads sold so well that Holley quit his job at the mill and started his own company to collect scraps from the local mills and manufacture and sell his pads . The pads that Holley made probably were n\u2019t yellow , and that is n\u2019t the only color they come in today . The only thing that technically sets the legal pad apart from every other notepad , says the American Pad and Paper Company , is 1.25 - inch , left - side \u201c down lines , \u201d or margins . Holley added these lines in the early 1900s at the request of a loyal customer , a judge who wanted a space to write comments on his notes . Still , when most people think legal pad , they think yellow paper and blue lines . The true origin of the yellow hue is actually a mystery . As far as we know , Holley \u2019s pads were white pads , and dyeing them yellow would have upped his cost and ruined his business plan . There are a few competing hypotheses about how the pads came to be yellow later on , but they have n\u2019t been verified and no one seems to know when the pads first came out in color . One origin story suggests that yellow was chosen because of the color \u2019s \u201c stimulating effects \u201d on the a person \u2019s intellect and contrasted well against black ink without glare , making text easier to read . Another possibility is that Holley or his successors eventually decided to dye the paper to hide the fact that the pads were made from scraps of varying age and quality , and yellow was the cheapest or most readily available dye at the time . \" [ source ] ( URL_0 )", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "This sometimes happens to me. It depends on how liquid the option is. Normally what I see happening is that the order book mutates itself around my order. I interpret this to mean that the order book is primarily market makers. They see a retail investor (me) come in and, since they don't have any interest in this illiquid option, they back off. Some other retail investor (or whatever) steps in with a market order, and we get matched up. I get a fill because I become the market maker for a brief while. On highly liquid options, buy limits at the bid tend to get swallowed because the market makers are working the spread. With very small orders (a contract or two) on very liquid options, I've had luck getting quick fills in the middle of the spread, which I attribute to MM's rebalancing their holdings on the cheap, although sometimes I like to think there's some other anal-retentive like me out there that hates to see such a lopsided book. :) I haven't noticed any particular tendency for this to happen more with puts or calls, or with buy vs sell transactions.

{"text": "Ignoring issues of land mass , the US has almost universally taken a private ownership / market approach to its infrastructure . In many countries \" catching up to the US \" or just everyday politics means there 's a lot of national pride so some / lots of infrastructure is nationalized or heavily subsidized . In other words , its subsidized or state owned thus no need to make a profit . Its not just internet . Lots of countries have nationalized airlines that are quite pleasant to fly on , compared to the US 's cut - throat airline competition which deliver lower costs but generally worse service and policies . This also means less of a tax load for citizens , which has a high priority in US politics . In those other countries you 're being taxed to pay for that national airline , even if you 've never flown . The other downside is that once government budgets have a crunch , these services often get cut , so now the only vendor for some of these services is the government and you have no freedom of choice . Nationalized stuff looks great if your country is rich , but if its ever non - rich then you 're stuck on the old infrastructure for a long time and the level of service people get from public sector workers tends to be low . I think Greece is a good example of this stuff going too far the other way . Or the subsidies stop and now the private - public partnerships end , thus instant price increase for customers . In modern governments , its usually a mix of market based solutions and subsidization of some kind . The US does this too . It hands out tax breaks for fiber roll - outs , gives vouchers for low income families to access the internet , etc . I think the real issue is that in Europe and some Asian countries they lean much more towards the social end of things than the market end of things . So they can float a 1gbps nationwide network much easier than the US can . In the US that proposal would be called ' socialism ' and be killed in congress . There 's also a leapfrong effect here . In many parts of Africa they never had a wired phone line roll - out , but they now have cell phones due to running a few towers is much cheaper than running copper wire to everyone 's home . In a lot of countries who got internet later than the US , they were able to standardize on ADSL2 while the US was stuck on vanilla ADSL , so they got much faster speeds over the same copper . The cost of moving from a freshly rolled out ADSL to a ADSL2 system would be huge , so we had to wait for these telcos to make their profits on their ADSL system before moving on . Verizon moved to fiber ( FIOS ) and AT & T to fiber to the neighborhood ( Uverse ) but only after a good decade selling vanilla DSL . So is the market - based solution worse ? Depends . Broadband is largely affordable and the US tends to have the innovations and nicest toys first . Those other countries buy our Cisco switches , our iPhones , pay for our LTE patents , etc , etc . There 's a big innovation incentive because in a market based solution the risk takers can often get very wealthy if they succeed . In the socialist based systems the risk takers do n't get as wealthy as the government will dictate pricing , nationalize things , force higher taxes , over - regulate , etc . Being rich in the US is great . Being poor in Sweden is great . Vice versa ? Not so great . The problem is that the country that is good at innovating and making things , is n't good at spreading the wealth because those two things conflict in a market economy . Also because reddit is US based we hear a lot of US whining . Just because there are issues in the US does n't mean foreign ISPs are perfect . Cell contracts in Canada are incredibly terrible . Internet pricing in Australia is really bad . Speeds in rural areas of many countries are worse than rural areas of the US . Broadband affordability in poor countries tends to be bad . Access is often blocked from non - free states like China and Russia , former Soviet Republics , the Middle East , etc ( I work for an international organization and often deal with these guys when they ca nt access our sites , ca nt use vpn , ca nt receive certain emails , ca nt use certain search engines or terms , etc ) .

{"text": "* If you are five : The best way to explain what is seen in the video is to think of the superconductor as a magnetic mirror . Once the superconductor is close enough to a magnet it gives off the exact opposite magnetic field that the magnet is creating . This \" locks \" the superconductor in position as any further motion would change how the superconductor \" sees \" the field created by the magnet . * If you are in primary school : Getting a little less simplistic , whatever magnetic field the superconductor experiences , it will exert an exact opposite field to cancel what 's called the magnetic flux ( i.e. the movement of the magnetic field ) through the superconductor . This special ability of superconductors is called the [ Meissner effect ] ( URL_2 ) . A superconductor cancels the magnetic fields within itself by forming tiny electrical currents which basically turns the superconductor into an electromagnet with the exact opposite polarity to the field causing the currents . These currents can only exist in superconductors as normal metals would just turn them into heat due to their electrical resistance . ( Superconductors are so named as they have zero electrical resistance ) * If you are in secondary school : Furthermore , the superconductor is \" locked \" into position as any additional movement would change the magnetic flux and induce additional electrical currents in the superconductor . This keeps the superconductor in position and explains how it can be hung underneath the magnets and does n't just repel them but also pulls . This is only true so long as the external forces ( the weight , a person pushing on it , etc . ) are smaller than the forces being created by the magnetic field . Once you put enough force on the superconductor , you can force it to experience a different field and assume a different locked position . EDIT : The disc is able to move above the track of magnets as , for any specific height , the field is unchanging along the path of magnets . If the magnets had different magnetic field strengths , I believe you would see the disc adjust its height accordingly . But at all times , it would simply be following a line of a single , seemingly unchanging ( relative to the disc ) , magnetic field . * Some side notes : At one point in the video , you see the disc spinning freely . This is because it is being placed directly above one of the poles of the magnet below . If the pole of the magnet is exposed to the superconductor , it will be able to rotate freely around the fixed magnetic pole . This is for the same reason it can move along the path of magnets ; the field the superconducting disc sees remains unchanged as it moves in these two particular circumstances . The disc ca n't continue on the track forever for two reasons . 1 . The superconductor must be kept at very cold temperatures . As it warms up , it will lose its superconducting abilities . 1 . Additionally , the air will cause drag on the disc which will slow it down . If you were to perform the same test in a vacuum the disc would run much longer . In a perfect vacuum , the only heat transfer that could take place would be radiation into / away from the disc . So if you were to put it in a perfectly dark , perfectly sealed vacuum . The disc could theoretically run forever . This is impossible , but you could certainly get close and the disc would run for quite a long time if you did . However , you would n't be able to observe it happening . :p EDIT2 : One final thing , I have no idea why they called it \" quantum locking \" in the video . Today is the first time I 've heard / seen the term used when referring to superconductors . While the abilities of superconductors might possibly be traced back to quantum effects , the Meissner effect and levitation via superconductors are , to my knowledge , not quantum phenomena and probably should n't be labled as such . However , this is n't my field of study , so I may be mistaken . EDIT3 : In another thread , [ lasernut found an excellent video ] ( URL_3 ) demonstrating the different phenomena involved . The [ second video ] ( URL_0 ) shows how each effect comes together to give what you see with the initial demonstration . EDIT4 : A post by [ wbeaty ] ( URL_1 ) in askscience helped explain why this can be considered a quantum effect . The [ flux through the superconductor actually exists in a quantum state ] ( URL_4 ) ( discrete levels of magnitude ) . While the cause of this is macroscopic defects in the superconductor , it 's probably fair to call the effect quantum . Also , several people have pointed out that this will only occur with Type II superconductors ( high temperature ceramics ) because Type I 's ( pure metals ) do not have the number of defects / grain boundaries that are required to allow some of the field to pass through the superconductor . I 've only ever worked with Type II which explains why I was n't familiar with the distinction . Type I 's would therefore only be able to repel the magnet but not be locked into place as shown in the original video .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network  used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare.[11]\nThe name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both \"long-term memory\" and \"short-term memory\". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus \"long short-term memory\".\nA common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In USA, if you take a personal loan, you will probably get rates between 8-19%. It is better that you take a loan in India, as home loan rates are about 10.25%(10.15% is the lowest offered by SBI).  This might not be part of the answer, but it is safer to hold USD than Indian rupees as India is inflating so much that the value of the rupee is always going lower(See 1970 when you could buy 1 dollar for 7 rupees). There might be price fluctuations where the rupee gains against the dollar, but in the long run, I think the dollar has much more value(Just a personal opinion). And since you are taking a home loan, I am assuming it will be somewhere between 10-20 years. So, you would actually save a lot more on the depreciating rupee, than you would pay interest. Yes, if you can get a home loan in USA at around 4%, it would definitely be worth considering, but I doubt they will do that since they would not know the actual value of the property. Coming to answer your question, getting a personal loan for 75k without keeping any security is highly unlikely. What you can do since you have a good credit score, is get a line of credit for 20-25k as a backup, and use that money to pay your EMI only when absolutely required. That way, you build your credit in the United States, and have a backup for around 2 years in India in case you fail to pay up. Moreover, Line of credits charge you interest only on the amount, you use. Cheers!", "label": "hc3human"}

Rather , the first major event that caused Detroit to become what it is today was the race riot of 1967 , in which so much of the city was burned that it resembled a war zone , thousands of businesses were looted , snipers took pot shots at white people on the streets , and President Johnson literally had to send in the army with tanks and live ammunition to restore order . The trend of \" white flight \" immediately hit Detroit harder than anywhere else in the nation , as white ( ex-)residents , and many middle - class blacks , understandably , feared for their lives . The shift in racial composition meant that Detroit elected its first black mayor , Coleman Young , in 1973 , and he would continue in that role until 1994 . Unfortunately , Young was an extremist demagogue who was openly hostile to whites , and what remained of the white population quickly left during his tenure , taking almost the entire Detroit property tax base with them , leaving the city unable to pay for basic services like street cleaning , garbage pickup , the fire department , etc . Young also made the main theme of his mayorality harassing , cutting funding for , limiting the operations of , and attempting to sue or prosecute members of the police force . * With the police cowed into submission and most of the force 's veterans intimidated into quitting , criminals could act with impunity , and Detroit quickly gained a reputation as the most dangerous city in America , and was hit harder by the crack epidemic and related gang violence than pretty much anywhere else .

{"text": "I believe your request was worded poorly . You 're getting answers pertaining to the DNC stance on Jerusalem / Israel , and not the specific \" incident \" in question . The DNC 's party platform did not mention \" God \" , or anything about Jerusalem being the capital of Israel . Apparently folks thought this would rub a lot of independent voters the wrong way , so at the last minute , they attempted to pass a motion on the floor of the convention to include it . No issues yet . That 's how shit gets done . Here 's where things get shady .... L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , recognized former Governor Strickland from Ohio , who requested a vote to suspend the rules . I actually do n't know what this is all about , but I 'm guessing it involves having an impromptu / informal vote on something . ( I 'm sure someone can / will correct me on this . ) No big deal if it 's something that 's going to pass with nearly 100 % approval , but that 's clearly not the case here . Strickland calls for a vote to include something about \" God \" in the party platform , as well as affirming that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel . Sure , these are controversial topics , but that 's not what \" the incident \" was . Villaraigosa asked for those in favor , which resulted in a cheer from those who agreed with the resolution , and when asking for those opposed , received a response , while not as loud as the approving cheers , a significant response . He was reading off of a teleprompter , so he moved on to his next line , \" In the opinion of the ... \" . He stopped once he realized he was saying something was his opinion , when it really was n't . He called for another vote . At this point , attendees realized this was n't a typical fluff - vote on something that was definitely going to pass . When he does another round of voting , both responses were louder , but arguably equal . Clearly not the necessary 2/3 vote to pass . Mayor Villaraigosa had absolutely no idea what to do . He 's clearly lost and looking around for guidance . He 's got a teleprompter , with a script to read , but he knows it 's not correct . He says , \" I guess ... \" , but before going any further , someone starts heading towards him from off stage . Personally , I think he was about to say something along the lines of , \" I guess ... the resolution does not pass . \" Instead , the lady says to him , \" You got ta rule , and then you got ta let them do what they 're gon na do . \" She basically told him to ignore the results of the vote and stick to the script . Villaraigsoa then did a third round of votes , and after another 50/50 split ( you could argue the \" No 's \" were louder ) , he then said , \" In the opinion of the chair , 2/3 's have voted in the affirmative , and the motion is adopted . So what 's the \" incident \" ? The chair of the DNC , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , demonstrated on live television , an absolute failure in democracy . They put something to vote , it did n't pass , but he passed it anyway . He might as well have said , \" Your votes do n't matter . We want this to pass , so it 's passing . \" I doubt his teleprompter even had a script in case the motion did n't pass . It was passing no matter what .

Credit cards that offer 0% on balance transfers are very rare.  Most have a transfer fee of some kind, which acts like an interest rate.  This is a change that probably happened 10 years ago without much fanfare.  From this you can draw a lesson: what changes will come in the future? This site and others a full of \"tales of woe\" where people were playing musical chairs with credit, and when the music stopped, there was no chairs in sight.  Job loss, medical expenses, unexpected taxes, natural disasters can all effect one's ability to make payments on time and happen.  Once payments start being missed or are late, things tend to avalanche from there.  It has happened to me, and loved ones. The pain and suffering is not worth it.  Get out of debt. You claim that you are investing the money instead of paying on the debt, and you are making the delta between your prevailing investment rate 7%.  Did you include the balance transfer fee in your calculations?    First off your investments could lose money.  While 2015 was mostly flat, we have not had a correction in a long time.  Some say we are long overdue.   Secondly, how much money are we really talking about here?  Say there is not a balance transfer fee, you could be guaranteed 7%, and you are floating $10K.  Congratulations in this mythical scenario you just made $700. If $700 changes your life dramatically perhaps it is time for a second job.  This way you can earn that every two weeks (working part time) rather than every year.  Now that will really change your life.  By applying this amount of mental energy to make $700, what opportunities are you missing?   Pay off the debt, you will be much better off in the long run.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "One way to look at a butterfly is to break it into two trades. A butterfly is actually made up of two verticals... One is a debit vertical: buy 490 put and sell the 460 put.  The other is a credit vertical: sell a 460 put and buy a 430 put.  If someone believes Apple will fall to 460, that person could do a few things. There are other strategies but this just compares the three common ones: 1) Buy a put. This is expensive and if the stock only goes to 460 you overpay for it. 2) Buy a put vertical. This is less expensive because you offset the price of your put. 3) Buy a butterfly. This is cheapest of the three because you have the vertical in #2 as well as a credit vertical on top of that to offset your cost.  The reason why someone would use the butterfly is to pay less upfront while capitalizing on a fall to 460. Of the three, this would be the better strategy to use if that happens. But REMEMBER that this only applies if the trader is right and it goes to 460. There is always a trade off for every strategy that the trader must be aware of. If the trader is wrong, and Apple goes to say 400, the put (#1) would make the most money and the butterfly(#3) would lose money while the vertical (#2) would still gain. So that is what you're sacrificing to get the benefits of the butterfly. Also helps to draw a diagram to compare the strategies.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "None of this is correct at all . Please allow me to correct the situation . Let 's imagine you have two independent classes . Let 's call one of them Cat and the other one Worm . As you know , when it rains , cats and worms do different things . A cat will run back inside the house and berate its owner that it 's raining . A worm will surface and enjoy some splashy fun in the rain . The point here is that both a cat and a worm understand the fact that it is raining and react to it in different ways . However , the point is that it is raining , therefore they will both have some reaction despite them being different in themselves . So essentially , the Worm and Cat class both understand the message itsRaining ( ) . The Worm class will have instructions for it to surface and splash about , the Cat class will run back into the house and moan at its hapless hoomin . This is the essence behind polymorphism . Why is it useful ? Well , in many ways ! For example in real world terms , a lot of languages will have a method called .toString ( ) . This is a perfect example of polymorphism . The idea is that it converts some object to a String output for use in a text box or a log file for example . I 'm going to use Java as a reference simply as I feel it 's a great beginner language in many respects . So in Java , the class Object is the superclass to every single class . That is , whenever you write a class in a Java program it automatically includes a call to its superclass . Assuming you are not already inheriting from something , this Superclass is essentially the Object constructor . This is called constructor chaining . So if you have a situation where you class inherits from some class whose direct superclass is Object , then before your class does anything , it will call it 's superclass 's constructor and then , in turn , the constructor of Object . Why is this important to understand ? Well , the actual .toString ( ) method is contained in Object , therefore theoretically every single class in Java understands .toString ( ) . It may well be that it provides different output depending on where your class sits in the hierarchy , but the point is that you can invoke this method anywhere . You can even override it and add in your own special behaviour should you need to . So if your class overrides the toString ( ) method , this is still an example of polymorphism . Even though your class now overrides toString and makes it do something else , the fact is the toString method is understood and produces a reaction . It may well be that you have a class which provides some kind of information to be meaningful . For example , if you called myCat.toString ( ) may be required to simply output a string \" Can haz polymorphic chzbrger ? \" and nothing further . Meanwhile , your overridden toString in Worm , i.e. when you call myWorm.toString ( ) may instead just provide a string which indicates it 's length in mm , such as \" I am 16 mm long ! \" or \" I am 10 mm long ! \" So , to summarize , polymorphism is the ability for two distinct classes to understand the same message but may have complete different outcomes .", "label": "hc3human"}

The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.\nGeneralized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. They proposed an iteratively reweighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters. MLE remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages. Other approaches, including Bayesian regression and least squares fitting to variance stabilized responses, have been developed.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Haha at last something relevant to my work . I work for a company that makes defibs . So a bit of background about hearts . Hearts are basically a bag of blood surrounded by muscle . Muscles are activated by electrical signals . In normal muscles , they are activated by nerves usually coming from the brain , but in the heart the nerves come from a separate controller on the heart itself . So this central controller controls the heartbeats . _ Fibrillation _ is when this central controller goes astray and uselessly quivers the heart . How to fix it ? You can send a huge jolt of electricity through the heart , shocking it to reset back to normal . This is of course called * * De**fibrillation . _ Common misconception # 1 : you can not use defibrillation to restart a heart in * * ALL * * heart attacks or cardiac arrests ! _ Only in ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia . If the heart is completely stopped , using a defib wo n't help . _ Common misconception # 2 : Automatic External Defibrillators ( AEDs ) that you see in malls or public places work like the movies ; when you press the button , it will immediately jolt the patient . _ Modern AEDs are much smarter nowadays , they actually analyse the heartbeat of the patient , and will advise if a jolt is warranted . So if you ever have to use one , do n't panic even more because it did n't deliver the jolt like you expected . Last point : make sure that the skin of the patient is dry before pasting the electrodes on the skin . And of course do n't touch the patient when the jolt is delivered . And to answer your question about repeatedly starting and stopping the heart , possibly not , although I 'm not a doctor . Reason is that electrical shocks might completely stop the heart , which a defib will not be able to start again . Basically comes back to the specificity of conditions where defibs are useful .

At the time of writing this, 1 U.S. Dollar = 64 Indian Rupees. Consider the following economic factors: Both of the above factors are not definitive but are worth considering. You might be thinking- what if I never intend to convert my rupees back to dollars? If it is the case that money converted to rupees would stay that way, that then eliminates the risk of foreign exchange losses mentioned above. However, you must still keep in mind that part of the reason interest rates on fixed deposits is as high in India is because inflation is high. A 9% return must be looked at after adjusting for inflation. Inflation is somewhere between 5%-6% at the time of writing which then reduces your real return to about 4% (pre-tax).", "label": "hc3human"}

Working people pay in to the system all their working lives , and when they retire , they get it all back in monthly benefit payments . But when a working person pays into the system , the government does n\u2019t actually hold on to that money for forty years and then pay it out to that same person , it uses that money to immediately pay out the benefits of people who are now retired but paid into the system in the past . So the payments to current retirees come out of the contributions from current workers . Plainly , in such a system , the money coming in from current workers has to equal or exceed the payments going out to retirees , or the system will go bankrupt . And that \u2019s the threat of underpopulation . Forty years from now when the current workers are retired , there may not be enough people working to cover their benefits at current payment rate .

So for horse X , it 20 % chance they 'll take the prize ; for horse Y , it 's a long shot that 's likely a 2 % chance . Divide each number into one . 1 divided by 20 % = 5 , so the odds on that horse are \" 5 to 1 \" if a perfect payout is desired . And it would be 50 to 1 for horse Y. 3 : Now mark up your payout so you are going to earn something out of it .

{"text": "Imagine that you are thirsty . You are so thirsty that if you do n't have a drink right now , you will die . Here I am , with a cup of water - there 's no other water around for as far as you can see . I demand tons of money for my water - ten bucks for a sip ! But , there 's no other water , and you need a drink , so that water is suddenly a lot more valuable than ten bucks . Basically , what I 've just described is a kind of monopoly on a service or good . There 's only one place to get water , so you have to pay whatever the guy with water is charging , because you * need * water . In America , \" water \" is \" good jobs \" , and colleges are the guys who 're gon na hand you \" good jobs \" . You spend your whole life getting ready to be a grown up , and everyone tells you about how important \" good jobs \" are , and that college is the way to get 'em , so by the time you get out of highschool , it 's been thoroughly beaten into you that you NEED a good job and to get a good job you NEED to go to college , so it does n't really matter what college costs , because you NEED to go . Now that explained half of the problem - the part where people are willing to pay a lot of money for college . But I mean , I 'm willing to pay a lot of money for a Corvette , and nobody 's gon na give me the money for one of those - right ? So why is college different ? Because people made some very short sighted decisions a while back . In America , one of the things we really like about our culture - or at least like to imagine about our culture - is that anybody can get a Good Job someday . So when the way to get Good Jobs stopped being , well , pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and started being \" go to college \" , we had a kind of disconnect . College was so expensive that a lot of people could n't go there , and if they could n't go there , they could n't ever even have a chance at a Good Job - and well , that 's just not very American . Everyone deserves that option ! On the face of it , this makes a lot of sense and sounds really nice . Everyone deserves an education , they say . Everyone deserves the chance to succeed ! So they made it very , very easy for a student to get money . Almost impossible for a student NOT to get money , actually . If you want to go to college you can get insane sums of money to do so ... with a catch : Students waive a lot of the protections that normal debtors have . You ca n't get rid of student debt in bankruptcy and stuff like that - so giving money to students is actually very safe and very profitable , because you almost know you 'll be getting it back . Now we hit the hard part . Imagine that you are the man holding the glass of water . Everyone around you is willing to pay anything to get a glass of water - but until now , \" everything \" has n't been very much . But here comes this other guy , waving around tons of money and shouting \" everyone deserves water ! Everyone deserves to drink as much as they want ! \" and handing out hundred dollar bills . The thing is , there 's the same amount of water , and everyone wants some .... so you charge more for it , of course . They 're still willing to pay ANYTHING and they can get as much as you charge from our brand new friend - they can ask him for as many hundred dollar bills as they want ! So why * would n't * you charge five hundred dollars a glass ? Or five thousand ? Of course , lots of other people have water too , but they 're all realizing the exact same thing .. and then something even shittier happens : People start to go , \" well his water is the most expensive water , so it must be the * best * water ! \" and suddenly the few nice people who were selling their water at reasonable prices are all suspected of having really shitty water . Maybe they peed in it or something . Who knows . But any way you cut it , you 're much better off buying that $ 500 high quality water ! That 's the basics .", "label": "hc3human"}

With an estimated net worth of around $139\u00a0billion as of December 23, 2022, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the second-wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires list.\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa and briefly attended at the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. After two days, he dropped out and with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.\nWith $175.8\u00a0million, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink\u2014a neurotechnology company developing brain\u2013computer interfaces\u2014and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has also proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2022, his acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion was completed. \nMusk has made controversial statements on politics and technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation.

{"text": "/r / asksocial science is a better place for this question . Also it has been answered before here - URL_0 SOME ISSUES AFRICA HAS FACED * * Unfavourable geography to begin with**- Sahara desert isolates Sub Saharan Africa from Europe and Asia . Its a very wide continent unlike Europe which is narrow with many peninsulas . There is more poverty in landlocked areas and less trade * * Colonial History**- European states colonized all of Africa apart from Ethiopia which is the only African nation to not be colonized and Liberia which was set up by the US for returning slaves . During colonization raw materials were taken from Africa and brought to Europe to make manufactured goods . These goods could then be sold around the world including in the colonies itself . Legacy of colonies has created problems . Less national unity as Europeans drew arbitrary borders , placing different ethnic groups in countries , and seperating others over borders . European colonizers would use African elites to rule countries . The people living by the coast or where the Europeans first settled and built a city would usually be chosen as a ruling class . Favouring different ethnic groups has caused problems * * Neocolonialism**- African nations got independance in the 60 's yet not everything changed . Some have called this \" flag independance \" . Basically former colonial states have still continued profitting from African countries . Natural resources are exploited by foreign companies who take a large part of the profit DEVELOPMENT DEBATES There are many theories on why underdeveloped nations are the way they are . At the end of the Second World War , the US wanted poor nations to be developed . They beleived that the War was caused because of bad economic times in the 30 's and at the same time they were fighting with the Soviet Union for the support of 3rd world nations . The US set up the Bretton Woods institutions- IMF and the World Bank to promote development . The theory in the 40 's the US beleived was necessary for development was the * * Modernization Theory * * . This theory looks at how W. Europe , USA , and Japan first developed in the 1800 's and tries to apply the same steps to countries . It beleives that if countries follow simple steps such as making savings , and increasing investment year after year , they will be bound to develop . The modernization theory was implemented in nations and to a large part failed . Environmentalists also point out that there are not enough resources available for everyone to live like Westerners Political scientists debated on why this method was not working . In South America a new theory came along . This was the * * Dependency Theory * * . The dependancy theory argued that Modernization theory could not work because we lived in a different world from that of the 1800 's . It claimed that the reason why poor nations were poor , was because of rich nations who always got the better deal in trading . Trading with the global north would make the south poorer so they should instead try to be more protectionist . Nations of the global south tried to instil the NIEO ( New International Economic Order)- URL_1 through the UN . It wanted to change trade laws so that poor nations would benefit instead of mainly rich nations . While the Modernization theory has been pretty much disproved , the issues of the dependancy were more relevant . The only nations to have become developed from the global south did so with a lot of protectionism to protect their industries ( Korea , Singapore , Taiwan ) . However in the 70 's new developments were happening in the world . The first 2 theories I spoke about were based on Keynesian principles . They beleived that respobsibility for development should come through the state . However in the 70 's and 80 's , Neo - liberal principles became increasingly popular in the West . The * * Neo - liberal Theory * * beleived that development should come through private companies and increased market liberization . It beleived that with less borders , the wealth of nations would increasingly became evened out . The Bretton Woods institutions encouraged Neoliberal policies in the world . It took advantage on the Debt crisis to enforce it on countris . -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Quick explanation of the debt crisis- In the late 60 's and 70 's , Western banks were becoming increasingly rich . They had less barriers with the increase of neo - liberal policies and less government intervention . Banks were also avoiding tax by having headquarters in tax havens such as Switzerland or the Cayman Islands . At the same time OPEC countries ( 3rd world oil producing nations ) were limiting production to increase the price of oil . They made millions of profits and put it into the banks . The banks now had alot of available money so they made alot of loans to 3rd world nations . 3rd world naions took advantage of these loans , as banks had no strings attached unlike money recieved from the superpowers the USA or the USSR . However the bubble burst and the world economy went into recession in the 70 's . 3rd world nations did not make the desired profit on their investments , and they were faced with large debt during a recession . Interest rates were increased aswell -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bretton Woods institutions tried to \" help \" countries by instilling the Structural Adjustment Programs ( SAP ) to pay off the debt . In these programs , if nations instilled neoliberal principles such as cut spending on education and health , lowered their currency and wages to favour exports , privatized their companies etc . they would have to pay a smaller amount . Neoliberal policies have had mixed results . Some nations have seen alot of growth ( East Asia and the BRICS ) , while others have actually gotten poorer ( alot of Africa , parts of Asia and Latin America ) . It has also increased polarization of wealth in the world . However it has also challenged the Dependancy Theory as South nations have emerged while Western nations today are growing at slow rates , some even receeding . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- So as you can see its not straightforward to explain why Africa ( and other LEDC nations ) are less developed . Countries are not in a vacuum but are influenced by world trade and economy and in large cases poor nations have little say in thier economic destinies .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "> How did it start ? Why did it start ? Like other Middle Eastern nations that were part of the Arab Spring , there was an undercurrent of discontent in the Syrian population that finally reached a boiling point . It started with relatively peaceful protests that the Assad regime responded to with violence . That escalated things really quickly and many members of the Syrian military defected to join opposition groups . Commence a civil war . > Who are the main combatants ? You have : * Assad 's regime which is backed by the Syrian military in addition to some other militia and paramilitary groups . * The opposition , comprised primarily of the Free Syrian Army and the Islamic Front . * The Islamic State . * The Kurds , backed by the Peshmerga / YPG . * The Coalition Joint Task Force , comprised of Western nations who are more opposed to the Islamic State then they are allied with any other group . * Russia , Iran and Hezbollah who support the Assad regime . > Why is it so devastating ? Because it 's been a bloody stalemate reminiscent of World War I. Going back to who the combatants are , it 's a total clusterfuck of entangling alliances . The United States supports the Kurds , but the Kurds are at odds with Turkey ( a NATO ally ) and elements of the opposition groups . Russia supports Assad and is opposed to the Islamic State * and * the opposition groups , while the United States is opposed to Assad and the Islamic State but not the opposition groups . The Assad regime has essentially decided it would rather let the opposition groups fight it out with the Islamic State , and many argue that Assad has given indirect support to IS . Meanwhile IS is selling black market oil to Turkey , which the United States does NOT like . So there are many competing interests and there is very little room for any of these groups to compromise with each other . As you can imagine , this puts the Syrian people in a truly unfortunate situation \u2014 no matter who they side with , they 're fucked . Some elements of the opposition have walked back to Assad with their tails between their legs because their choice is effectively between living under Assad or living under the Islamic State . * * It 's a total war . * * Civilians are n't off limits , and acts of barbarity have been committed by actors on all sides . It 's understandable why so many Syrians are so entrenched in whatever side they 're on . Adding to all of the devastation is the emergence of the Islamic State , which has been notoriously ruthless and brutal in its goal to establish a caliphate in the region . Their emergence also turned this into a war over religion , and when religion gets involved ... people tend to become very irrational and stubborn . > Why are its effects seeping over into the Western world ? Two major reasons . One , the Islamic State has been recruiting from Western nations and executing attacks on Western nations . Two , Syria is profoundly important from a geopolitical perspective . It borders Iraq , Lebanon , Jordan , Turkey and Israel and is on the Mediterranean coast , making it an important location for trade and commerce . Russia wants to construct a pipeline that would deliver gas from Iran through Iraq and into Syria . Meanwhile , the Assad regime had rejected the construction of the Qatar - Turkey pipeline , which was supported by American and European interests . Now , to be clear , the pipelines are just one aspect of the war , but they are certainly an important motivation for many of the actors involved . This is all a simplification and I 've left many details out , but that 's the basic overview . Edit : Just want to plug /r / SyrianCivilWar . It is by far one of the greatest resources for keeping up with everything that is going on over there , and it is interesting community where people on all sides are represented .

{"text": "As mentioned before - you're over-thinking the hard-pull issue. But do try to make the preapproval as close to the actual bidding as possible - because it costs money. At least from my experience, you'll get charged the application fee for preapproval, while \"pre-qualification\" is usually free. If you're seriously shopping, I find it hard to believe that you can't find a house within 3 months. If you're already in the process and your offer has been accepted and you opened the escrow - I believe the preapproval will be extended if it expires before closing. I've just had a similar case from the other side, as a buyer, and the seller had a short-sale approval that expired before closing. It was extended to make the deal happen, and that's when the bank is actually loosing money. So don't worry about that.

{"text": "Annoyed with the fanboy comments here so here 's an actual answer : The read / write speeds for one are lower on most MicroSD ( for the purpose of this answer , we 'll assume a standard \u00a3 10/\u00a320 card , rather than the ' extreme ' cards that are upwards of \u00a3 60-\u00a3100 for 64 GB that have comparable speeds ) . Secondly , the quality of the actual flash storage is different . Many MicroSD cards would n't be able to handle the sheer amount of actual data writing involved in effectively running an OS . MicroSD cards are mainly used for occasional writing and more often , lots of reading . This means the storage is n't changed much , which gives the appearance of a great quality and long lasting product . Take it from experience , start writing GBs of data to a MicroSD card over and over and soon enough it 'll fail . It 's why desktop SSD 's are n't just loads of MicroSD cards slotted together . The storage in the iPhone had to be of similar quality to that in a desktop SSD . It has to run a full mobile OS , frequently write data ( pictures , music , videos , text messages etc . ) and still perform at fast speeds with minimal to no loss in overall capacity over a long period of time . It has to have near zero failure as it 'll cause the entire device to fail ( think system file corruption ) . It 's also in constant 24/7/365 use for several years . While it 's well known the actual storage does n't really cost that much as Apple buy so much of it , the fact is that they charge a premium for their devices , and they can also make bigger profit margins by charging more for more internal capacity . An extra \u00a3 80 for doubling the capacity each time ( although that 's now changed slightly with the 6 and 6 + ) . The final thing is this : by controlling the storage as internal only , Apple can control the overall experience further . A MicroSD card with a read / write speed of say 20/20Mbps versus 200/200Mbps would give very different results when copying data or playing back HD films . Apple can guarantee what will and wo n't work , the speeds of syncing data , and also what data can be copied to the device as it 's not removable or readable as an actual storage device ( for the most part when non - jail broken ) . Source : IT Engineer , Apple Certified Tech Co - ordination , former Apple employee , overall Apple / Tech nerd . TL;DR : The flash storage used in a MicroSD card is of a lower quality than that used in an iPhone ( or other smartphones ) . Apple charge a premium because they can .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It 's called the bitrate , and it determines how much data is used each second to describe the song 's sound . * kbps * is * kilobits per second * . 8 kilobits = 1 kilobyte . So a song that 's 320 kbps uses 40 KB of data for every one second of sound . A song that 's 128 kbps would use 16 KB of data to describe the same thing . How can they make the exact same song smaller and smaller ? By cutting parts of it away . The software used to do this is designed cleverly to cut away the most unnoticeable things first -- frequencies humans ca n't hear , for example . But obviously the more you cut away the more you 're losing , and a song at 50 kbps will sound worse than a song at 300 kbps . There are two different types of bitrate used . The first is called constant bitrate , or CBR . This means a bitrate is decided on and kept steady through the entire song . Every second of audio will be 10 or 20 or 50 KB of data . The most common constant bitrates are 56 , 96 , 128 , 160 , 192 , 256 , and 320 . The other type is variable bitrate , or VBR . This means that the software used to create the MP3 ( or other audio file ) looks carefully at the song , and uses a lot of data to describe the very detailed , active parts of the song , and much less data to describe the empty , simple bits of a song . So it might be only 32kbps when there 's a gap of silence , but when the strings and horns kick in , it ramps up to 320kbps . ( You would n't usually see that extreme , but for the sake of example . ) This has become very popular lately . VBR bitrates are denoted by V and a digit . V0 is the highest , the most willing to hand out high - quality sections . V1 is slightly smaller and lower - quality , V2 smaller still , and so on , until V9 , the lowest rate . * * Note :* * there are many different audio formats , and many different encoders , programs used to put audio into those formats . Some go higher than 320 , some have different ways of storing bitrates . I 've only described the LAME MP3 encoder here , because that 's by far the most common type of audio you 'll find online . There is also an ABR setting , which is ' average bitrate ' and is sort of a compromise between VBR and CBR , but it 's complicated enough without descrbing that , and few people use it .", "label": "hc3human"}

Coming from Puerto Rico you might be shocked how expensive it is to live there, and also how infrequently you see the sun. Your question is highly subjective.  One person would need 100K to cover those things you are talking about, while others would need less then 30K.  Also where you live in the Seattle area makes a difference.  Will you be in Redmond or Bothell?  Housing costs vary considerably. One nice thing about that part of the country is can be very inexpensive to vacation.  A fishing license, a packed lunch, and a bit of gas is all that is necessary to really enjoy that part of the country.   Back in the day I used to ski Steven's Pass during the week, and the lift tickets were a 1/3 of the weekend rate.  Having hiking/camping gear and or a bicycle is also a good way to enjoy life. Bottom line I would make a budget, and go from there.  If you intend on retiring in PR, then you would need a lot less then if you choose to remain in Seattle so even that is subjective. Perfect Example, Marysville, which is way out of town so a commute would be a problem.  However, unlike many parts south of Seattle, it is safe and nice.  ~200K for a 1200 sq ft home.  Holy cow.

{"text": "The answer to this question is a bit complicated but can be understood by anyone . First you need a few assumptions : * The speed of light is the same for all reference frames . Another way of saying that is no matter what you are looking at you always measure the speed of light the same . * You are always not moving in your own reference frame . Another way of saying it is , if you are in a car looking out the window it means exactly the same thing to say \" you and the car are moving down the road \" and \" the road is moving below you . \" One more thing . You need to know how clocks work . Since the one thing that is always the same is the speed of light , the simplest clock is a light clock . It is a flashlight / sensor ( FS ) and a mirror ( _ ) FS _ _ The flashlight makes a flash of light . The light bounces off the mirror and then hits the sensor . That is one tick . Each second is just a certain number of ticks . FS || || _ || _ If you hold a clock and look at it you would see the light taking a path straight up and down . Now let 's think what someone else would see if they looked at your clock while you drive down the high way . The flashlight / sensor would n't be in the same place when they made the flash as when it bounced back so to them it would look more like this . car moving this way - > F S \\ / \\ / _ _ \\/ _ _ Notice that instead of going straight up and down the light had to go diagonal . \\ is a longer path than | . Since the speed of light is always the same and the light when a longer distance , it must have taken more time . For the person looking at your light clock each tick takes a longer time . Their own clock records more ticks in a second then yours does . Now this does n't happen to you . You are always at rest in your frame so the light is still bouncing straight up and down for you . You have no reason to think that your clock is running slowly . In fact . If you look out the windows at the other person 's clock you see them standing on the side of the road moving backwards . Their clock runs slowly for exactly the same reason . Time goes slower for people outside of your own frame because light has to travel a longer distance .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It all comes down to how the loan itself is structured and reported - the exact details of how they run the loan paperwork, and how/if they report the activity on the loan to one of the credit bureaus (and which one they report to).  It can go generally one of three ways: A) The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat (it's a \"hard pull\", new account with zero history, and increased debt), but over time this can have a positive effect on both people's credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both people's credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B) The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the co-signor), leaving the other as just a backup. If you aren't paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isn't even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person A's credit. We've had a number of question like this, and this isn't really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest - always verify. C) The loan company just doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, it's strictly up to them. If you don't pay then they can report it as something \"in collections\". This isn't the typical way of doing business for most places, but some businesses still operate this way, including some places that advertise how doing business with them (paying them grossly inflated interest rates) will \"help build your credit\". Most advertising fraud goes unpunished. Note: Under all of the above scenarios, the loan can only effect the credit rating attached to the bureau it is reported to. If the loan is reported to Equifax, it will not help you with a TransUnion or Experian rating at all. Some loans report to multiple credit bureaus, but many don't bother, and credit bureaus don't automatically copy each other. It's important to remember that there isn't so much a thing as a singular \"consumer credit rating\", as there are \"consumer credit ratings\" - 3 of them, for most purposes, and they can vary widely depending on your reported histories. Also, if it is only a short-term loan of 3-6 months then it is unlikely to have a powerful impact on anyone's credit rating. Credit scores are formulas calibrated to care about long-term behavior, where 3 years of perfect credit history is still considered a short period of time and you will be deemed to have a significant risk of default without more data. So don't expect to qualify for a prime-rate mortgage because of a car loan that was paid off in a few months; it might be enough to give you a score if you don't have one, but don't expect much more. As always, please remember that taking out a loan just to improve credit is almost always a terrible idea. Unless you have a very specific reason with a carefully researched and well-vetted plan that means that it's very important you build credit in this specific way, you should generally focus on establishing credit in ways that don't actually cost you any money at all. Look for no fee credit cards that you pay in full each month, even if you have to start with credit-building secured card plans, and switch to cash-value no-fee rewards cards for a 1-3% if you operate your financial life in a way that this doesn't end up manipulating your purchasing decisions to cost you money. Words to the wise: \"Don't let the credit score tail wag the personal financial dog!\"", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "As per color : It 's because black hair is the default color for hair and Africans never had environmental pressures to lose the pigment like Caucasians did . To survive in dark , cloudy Europe , Caucasians needed to lose pigment so that they could absorb more of the sun 's loving rays -- presumably this occurred over thousands of years of mutations , survival of those with the trait , natural selection , and sexual selection . This loss of pigment occurred in both the hair and the skin because the amount of pigment in both is somewhat related . Additionally , different types of pigment changes occurred in hair , but it did not particularly matter what color the hair turned to . As long as the skin lightened , the color of the hair did not matter . Thus , you could have had a genetic line with pale skin and black hair ( with the mutation only being on the skin pigmentation gene , but not the hair pigmentation gene . But , this line would still survive thanks to the light skin ) . Likewise , you could have had a genetic line with pale skin and brown or red hair ( with a mutation on the skin pigmentation genes AND on the hair pigmentation genes . This line would also survive because it had light skin . The mutation providing for red or brown hair was not necessary but not harmful , either ) . Now , you are probably saying--\"Well Asians lived at high latitudes , too ! \" True , but the two groups ate different types of food . The food being consumed by persons in northerly Asia eliminated their need for as much sun exposure . So , the basic answers are ( 1 ) climate and ( 2 ) diet . As to hair texture , I have no idea . I could explain some theories as to west African hair , but I do n't know much about the genetics of white hair .", "label": "hc3human"}

If you believe that silver prices will fall as QE is reduced, you may want to consider an ETF that shorts silver.  As for real estate, there are a number of ways to generate profit within your time frame. These include: Purchase a rental property. If you can find something in the $120,000 range you can take a 20% mortgage, then refinance in 3 - 7 years and pull out the equity.  If you truly do not need the cash to purchase your dream home, look for a rental property that pays all the bills plus a little bit for you and arrange a mortgage of 80%. Let your money earn money. When you are ready you can either keep the property as-is and let it generate income for you, or sell and put more than $100,000 into your dream home. Visit your local mortgage broker and ask if he does third-party or private lending. Ask about the process and if you feel comfortable with him, let him know you'd like to be a lender. He will then find deals and present them to you. You decide if you want to participate or not. Private lenders are sometimes used for bridge financing and the loan amortizations can be short (6 months - 5 years) and the rates can be significantly higher than regular bank mortgages. The caveat is that as a second-position mortgage, if the borrower goes bankrupt, you're not likely to get your principal back.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "For an antibiotic to work , it has to target a specific vital part of the bacteria to destroy it . This is difficult because our cells contain many of the same components as bacteria do , with a few important differences . For example , no harm comes to the human when taking penicillin because penicillin breaks down an imporant part of the bacterial cell wall - peptidoglycan , but does not inhibit any biochemical process that goes on within us because we do not have peptidoglycan . Everytime a strain of bacteria becomes resistant to an antibiotic , researchers are forced to search for a component of the bacteria that is different from humans . This is EXTREMELY complicated and it gets more and more dangerous because eventually there may not be a new discovery to selectively kill bacteria with , unless the science can keep up with discovery . Another example is tetracycline , an antibiotic that binds to a structure called a ribosome to inhibit the bacteria from making essential proteins to function and causes the bacteria to eventually die . We have them too . The reason we do n't suffer when taking the antibiotic is because the drug targets ribosomes that are smaller than ours , which bacteria have ! To make effective antibiotics , researchers have to seek out obscure targets in this manner to kill bacteria and not us . The trickiest would be antibiotics to kill bacteria than can infect the brain . How can you come up with an antibiotic that simultaneously crosses the blood - brain barrier , does nt target the human without terrible side - effects AND kills the specific bacteria ? And if the bacteria gets resistant to THAT , you 'd constantly have to keep adding a unique chemical group on the drug to target the bacteria again . Another problem with this is that eventually the drug molecule will be too big to cross the blood - brain barrier . So there are many factors that go into targeting certain bacterial infections and finding ways to not only make the drug safe for humans and reduce side - effects , but also keeping in mind that this drug will be temporary until the bacteria become resistant again .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "There are several areas of passive fraud by being unclear on what you are doing.  When a citizen buys a house, the mortgage lender wants all the details as to how the buyer rounded up the money.  That is so they can use their own formulas to assess the buyer's creditworthiness and the probability that the buyer will be able to keep up on payments, taxes and maintenance; or have they overextended themselves. The fraud is in the withholding of that info. By way of tricking them into making a favorable decision, when they might not have if they'd had all the facts.  Then there's making this sound all lovey-dovey, good intentions, no strings attached, no expectations. You're lying to yourself.  What you've actually done is put money between yourselves, because you have not laid down FAIR rules to cover every possibility.  You're not willing to plan for failure because you don't want to admit failure is possible, which is vain.  Once you leap into this bell jar, the uncertainty of \"what happens if...\" will intrude itself into everyone's thoughts, slowly corroding your relationship.  It's a recipe for disaster.  That uncertainty puts her in a very uncomfortable position.  She has to labor to make sure the issue doesn't explode, so she's tiptoeing around you to avoid fights.  Every fight, she'll wonder if you'll play the breakup card and threaten to demand the money back.  The money will literally come between you. This is what money does.  Thinking otherwise is a young person's mistake of inexperience.  Don't take my word on it, contact Suze Orman and see what she says. Your lender is also not going to like those poorly defined lovers' promises, because they've seen it all before, and don't want to yet again foreclose on a house that fighting lovers trashed.  (it's like, superhero battles are awesome unless you own the building they trashed.)  This thing can still be done, but to remove this fraud of wishful thinking, you need to scrupulously plan for every possibility, agree to outcomes that are fair and achievable, put it in writing and share it with a neutral third party.  You haven't done it, because it seems like it would be awkward as hell - and it will be! - Or it will test your relationship by forcing direct honesty about a bunch of things you haven't talked about or are afraid to - and it will! - And to be blunt, your relationship may not be able to survive that much honesty.  But if it does, you'll be in much better shape.   The other passive fraud is taxes.  By not defining the characteristics of the payment, you fog up the question of how your contribution will be taxed (if it will be taxed). A proper contract with each other will settle that.  (there's an argument to be made for involving a tax advisor in the design of that contract, so that you can work things to your advantage.)  As an example, defining the payment as \"rent\" is about the worst you could do, as you will not be able to deduct any home expenses, she will need to pay income tax on the rent, but she can cannot take landlord's tax deductions on anything but the fraction of the house which is exclusively in your control; i.e. none.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Basically , the Singularity ( or Technological Singularity ) is a hypothetical scenario in the near / distant future ( no definite dates on when it will happen , or if it ever will ) where computers will become advanced enough to simulate the human brain perfectly . Basically , this would allow you to \" upload \" your mind to a computer . If it were hooked up to a robot , you could even move around and make small talk with people like you used to . Now , you said that this is for a philosophy class , so I 'll focus on that . As you can imagine , the singularity introduces a bunch of philosophical ( among other ) dilemmas . Plenty of philosophers have constructed scenarios with similar lines of thinking , such as Descartes ' [ ' Evil Demon ' ] ( URL_2 ) , now often rendered through the thought problem , [ Brain in a Vat ] ( URL_3 ) . But the singularity brings into question the very nature of what consciousness / thought is , and how it is tied to physical phenomena . After all , what the singularity is essentially trying to do is replicate a biological process with a technological one . People have argued back and forth about whether it 's even possible to simulate the brain with such precision ( though I 'm not a neurologist or electrical engineer , so I ca n't really say for sure ) . But , assuming you could \" perfectly simulate \" the brain in a computer , then your troubles are only beginning . For starters , would you actually ' feel ' the change ? Would you begin to live as the computer , or would you simply die , and an exact copy spring up ? Sure others would n't notice the difference , but some people are treating this like a ticket to immortality , and so they 'd want to be sure that they would take on the life of the computer ( so to speak ) . And further , imagine if you could simulate someone 's brain perfectly , and keep them alive . Would they feel like they were two people , brain and CPU ? Or again , would the two be separate , merely identical ? Now , there are a couple other things that are more technical , but still subjective enough to be philosophy ( kinda ) . First , it brings up the question of whether machines can really be alive , or feel thoughts . For instance , the human brain is n't just binary electrical impulses . There are neurotransmitters like acetylcholine , seratonin , etc . By contrast , computers simply [ read bits , write bits , and erase bits ] ( URL_1 ) . Though , some would argue that this does n't preclude simulation of emotions , and that ultimately anything can be simulated with binary code , it just may take a horrifically long executable program . And finally , there is the question of whether or not our brains can adapt to handle the different sensory inputs of a robot . In other words , our brains , and indeed our entire nervous system , have evolved to take in a certain range of information : taste , temperature , touch , pain , sound , vision , etc . But , if a computer simulation robbed us of some of these inputs , or even all of them , would our brains function the same way ? Even crazier , could we adapt to take in more information than before ? I suppose one interesting source regarding the fusion of biology and technology that 's already happening is with Kevin Warwick , who * * actually has working cybernetic implants in his body . * * [ Here 's a TedX Talk he gave for those interested . ] ( URL_0 ) So , that 's about it . If any electrical engineering / neurology dual majors want to jump in , it 'd be much appreciated . ;) * * EDIT :* * Well , it seems my entire basis for what the singularity is was flawed , and that it 's really about the emergence of a greater - than - human artificial intelligence .

{"text": "I 'll attempt to be concise and simple in my response . Qualification : Senior at the University of Michigan double majoring in Psychology and Biological Sciences . First , let 's talk briefly about the nervous and endocrine system . As information in your surrounding environment is perceived with your senses , it 's transformed into neural signals . Depending on the importance of the information determines whether or not your autonomic nervous system ( automatic part of your nervous system ) activates your body 's fear response . Just because it 's labeled as a fear response does n't necessarily mean you 're afraid . Even happy emotions are products of your body 's nervous system response . The underlying theme here is your body becomes AROUSED . Next , your sympathetic nervous system ( a division of your autonomic nervous system responsible for arousal ) begins preparing your body by signaling other organs to release hormones through your bloodstream . For example , your adrenal glands located directly above your kidneys release epinephrine and norepinephrine . Furthermore , various organs release aid hormones . Your nervous system increases neural firing and dumps extra neurotransmitters in your brain to prepare for the potential stressor . As a result , your heart rate increases , you perspire at greater rates , you salivate less , and above all , blood from internal organs especially your stomach ( digestion becomes less important to your body 's needs ) moves away to aid your muscles . As a result , the lower blood delivery to your stomach is responsible for the subjective feeling of emotion in your stomach . The sense of being \" sick \" to your stomach after sad events , butterflies when you see a cute girl , or feeling nauseous thinking about an upcoming exam are all rooted in the body 's automatic fear response . Keep in mind the response is so sensitive that just thinking about something stressful can trigger it .

You don't need a 1099 from them, and the IRS doesn't care (at least from your perspective) if you got a 1099 or not; in fact, they probably expect you to have some non-1099 income.

Any loss on one side of the box would be offset by a loss on the other side, and vice versa.  However, the IRS clamped down on this, and you will realize the gain on your long position as soon as you go short on the other side.  See http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sellagainstthebox.asp.

{"text": "The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms.\nComplexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.\nA sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body. For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.\nThe term receptive field was first used by Sherrington in 1906 to describe the area of skin from which a scratch reflex could be elicited in a dog. In 1938, Hartline started to apply the term to single neurons, this time from the frog retina.\nThis concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field for a cell in the brain. This process is called convergence.\nReceptive fields have been used in modern artificial deep neural networks that work with local operations.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'll tackle the \" why first \" . So , a computer needs to be able to take input and give you output . Whether that 's deciding what is 2 + 2 or what it should display on screen . Thus , we need a device that translates input to output * automatically * using electricity . I 'll use a MOSFET transistor as an example , as it is arguably the simplest . There is voltage at one end ( power ) and ground at the other ( somewhere for power to go ) , but the current flow is blocked by the magic of \" chemistry \" . There is an input node * next to * the path we just discussed . It is n't on the path , it 's just reeeaally close by , separated by a small space . When you give that node a positive voltage ( input ) , the pathway unlocks , and the current can flow from the high voltage to ground . Now , how do we use this awesome little device ? Well , you can take a little wire of copper and connect it to the pathway from before just a little bit above the ground node , and run it to a dead end at the input node of a different transistor . This means your first transistor 's output will determine the next transistors input . You have now created a digital IF ... THEN condition . \" If this happens , then that happens . \" Instead of connecting the bottom of a transistor to ground , you can connect it to the \" power \" node of a different transistor , such that the 2nd is inactive until you give input to the 1st one . Now you have 2 switches that interact with each other based on two sets of input . Mix and match these combos of transistors and you can build \" logic gates \" . AND , OR , NAND , NOR , XOR , XNOR . These transistor networks give a single output based on the combinations of 2 + input . AND : If Bob and Terry want to get dinner , then you will go with them . But if only 1 of them ( or neither ) wants to go , you wo n't bother . OR : If either , or both , of Bob and Terry want dinner , you will go . You just do n't want to go alone . These logic gates can then be wired together to make more complex things like number adders and decision trees . At that point , you can now control numbers and IF , THEN conditions , so programming is now possible . Hop , skip , jump , and you 're at your smartphone . Hope that 's a coherent overview .

If you actively invest, I recommend the Core & Satellite approach: invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account.  Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns.

For example, the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise (total shares outstanding times price per share) divided by the earnings of the business.

This is nice so that expenses for a month aren't inflated due to a tax payment being made: Now, this is all fairly typical and results in all but the principle part of the mortgage payment being included in expense reports. The trick then is to duplicate the principle portion in a way that it makes its way into your expenses. One way to do this is to create a principle expense account and also a fictional equity account that provides the funds to pay it: Every time you record a mortgage payment, add a transfer from this equity account into the Principle Payments expense account. This will mess things up at some level, since you're inventing an expense that does not truly exist, but if you're using GnuCash more to monitor monthly cash flow, it causes the Income/Expense report to finally make sense.

{"text": "Sell 200 at 142. What does that mean? I haven't seen the movie, so I won't try to put anything in story context.  \"Sell 200 at 142\" means to sell 200 units (usually shares, but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice).   In general, this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have.  Or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell those--this is called a naked short.  In this case, it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract.  With a futures contract, you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price.  You could own an orange grove and plan to turn your oranges into juice.  Or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice.  Or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other, what they're doing here.   In general people make profits by buying low and selling high.  In this case they did so in reverse order.  They took the risk of selling before they had a supply.  Then they covered their position by purchasing the supply.  They profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold.   The reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges, the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit.  So they sell orange juice on the futures market.  Then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market.  And the growers know how much they can get for oranges, so they can pay people to water and pick them.   Without the futures markets, growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves.  This way, they can share risks with each other and financiers.  Combined with insurance, this allows for predictable finances.  Without it, growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Tattoos last forever because the human body thinks it is under attack when someone draws on it . The body \u2019s complex processes that keep our skin free from infection are the same ones that allow ink to live forever in our skin . It should very difficult for anything to stay in the skin : humans shed about 40,000 skin cells per hour , or around 1,000,000 per day . Anything drawn onto the skin would gradually flake or get washed off . But tattoos are done by using machines to punch through the outer layer of skin and into the dermis , which is the deeper layer of skin that does n\u2019t flake off . They do that by pushing small needles over and over , quickly , pushing the ink deep into the fibers of the dermis . Pushing so far into the skin is essentially a wound , and the body reacts as you \u2019d expect it to . The immune system reacts to what it considers to be an attack by sending cells to the wound and start repairing the skin \u2014 that process might sound traumatic , but it \u2019s actually what allows tattoos to stick around for so long . The cells , known as macrophages , travel to the site of the wound and start eating up the ink that has been deposited there . Other cells and parts of the skin , such as fibroblasts , suck up the tattoo ink . But they ca n\u2019t do anything with it , and so stay stuck in that layer , visible through the skin . Some of the ink will go into the upper layer of the skin , and that will then be shed as normal . That \u2019s why the process of getting a tattoo also includes time letting your skin heal , with the body taking two to four weeks to initially heal . The body also keeps fighting the foreign ink throughout its owners \u2019 life .

{"text": "You have a few bad things that happened . Once upon a time detroit was a large industrial city with plenty of work and a strong urban population . This fell apart due to two main factors ... First , due to the rise of globalism , a lot of the industry in Detroit went away as it was outsourced to cheaper locations outside of the US ( and , notably , as US automakers lost much ground to foreign automakers ) . This led to a significant decline in the well paying jobs that built the city . Secondly , a significant population of the city began to move out of the city and into surrounding suburbs . In most locations this is not a big deal as the city annexes surrounding suburbs . In Detroit , due to some complicated legal / political reasons , they could not do this . The upshot is that much of the population moved to surrounding areas where taxes were now paid to the suburb rather than the city , starving the urban areas for tax revenues . Starved of money with massive unemployment and many people on welfare , the city lacked funds to maintain critical infrastructure and even emergency services , which led to an increase in crime and lack of maintenance to basic services . We 're talking things like not being able to keep street lights lit , slow 911 response times , not enough police or firefighters , crumbling streets , etc etc . This further fed the flight of people out of the city to the suburbs , leaving primarily impoverished people ( predominantly black ) who could not afford to move as the main urban population . Population declines led to numerous abandoned properties as people were foreclosed on and fled , with no one to take over the homes . Entire neighborhoods ended up abandoned and crumbling . The city went bankrupt and the state had to take over . edit : here 's a few articles with some good info on the current state of affairs and efforts to dig out . there are also a surprising number of books on the decline of detroit if you 're really interested .

Instead , you think that something bad is about to happen and that the stock is actually about to drop .

The first thing you need to do is find someone who holds shares and ask if you can borrow some of them .

So you 've got you 're \u00a3 100 composed of 100 borrowed stock ( so each stock is worth \u00a3 1 ) and the first thing you need to do is sell them . As a consequence , you now have \u00a3 100 cash in your pocket but you still need to return 100 stocks to the lender + the \u00a3 10 fee . Happily for you though , things start going to plan when word gets round that the lemons your friend 's using are actually mouldy and have been making people sick . Suddenly , the stock price of the stand goes through the floor ( lets say they drop to 50p per share ) and those \u00a3 100 of shares you borrowed are now worth \u00a3 50 . So , what you need to do now is buy 100 stocks ( to return to the lender ) but as the price has fallen , this only costs you \u00a3 50 . That leaves you with holding 100 shares ( which you 'll return ) and \u00a3 50 in your pocket . Granted , you 'll have to pay the lender a tenner as a fee but at the end of the day you 're \u00a3 40 the richer . Well done my little five year old !

{"text": "If a stock is trading for $11 per share just before a $1 per share dividend is declared, then the share price drops to $10 per share immediately following the declaration. If you owned 100 shares (valued at $1100) before the dividend was declared, then you still own 100 shares (now valued at $1000). Generally, if the dividend is paid today, only the owners of shares as of yesterday evening (or the day before maybe) get paid the dividend. If you bought those 100 shares only this morning, the dividend gets paid to the seller (who owned the stock until yesterday evening), not to you. You just \"bought a dividend:\" paying $1100 for 100 shares that are worth only $1000 at the end of the day, whereas if you had just been a little less eager to purchase right now, you could have bought those 100 shares for only $1000. But, looking at the bright side, if you bought the shares earlier than yesterday, you get paid the dividend.  So, assuming that you bought the shares in timely fashion, your holdings just lost value and are worth only $1000.  What you do have is the promise that in a couple of days time, you will be paid $100 as the dividend, thus restoring the asset value back to what it was earlier.  Now, if you had asked your broker to re-invest the dividend back into the same stock, then, assuming that the stock price did not change in the interim due to normal market fluctuations, you would get another 10 shares for that $100 dividend making the value of your investment $1100 again (110 shares at $10 each), exactly what it was before the dividend was paid.

{"text": "Let 's break it down . Realism ( at least here ) refers to the idea that the truth of statement is determined by some objective state in the real world . Put simply , does a thing that we said correspond to the real world in the same way that we said it . For example , let 's say I say there is a red ball on the floor . The way that statement would be true is if there was actually a red ball on the floor . Anti - realism is a retort to that idea which states that the truth of something comes not from how the outside world is , but in our ability to test it . So , if you covered your eyes , you would be unable to test the truth of the statement \" there is a red ball on the floor \" as you would not be able to test the color of the ball without seeing it . Scientific anti - realism is this idea relating to specific areas of science . For example , in the realm of string theory , there is an argument that everything is made up of tiny energy strings . It is arguably the case that this can not be tested , thus it can not be true ( but also not , that it does n't mean that it is false ) . So in short , realism says something is true because the world is actually that way , anti - realism says something is true because we can attempt to prove it using some means ( intuitive logic , experimentation , etc . etc . ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The first red-flag here is that an appraisal was not performed on an as-is basis - and if it could not be done, you should be told why. Getting an appraisal on an after-improvement basis only makes sense if you are proposing to perform such improvements and want that factored in as a basis of the loan. It seems very bizarre to me that a mortgage lender would do this without any explanation at all. The only way this makes sense is if the lender is only offering you a loan with specific underwriting guidelines on house quality (common with for instance VA-loans and how they require the roof be of a certain maximum age - among dozens of other requirements, and many loan products have their own standards). This should have been disclosed to you during the process, but one can certainly never assume anyone will do their job properly - or it may have only mentioned in some small print as part of pounds of paper products you may have been offered or made to sign already. The bank criteria is \"reasonable\" to the extent that generally mortgage companies are allowed to set underwriting criteria about the current condition of the house. It doesn't need to be reasonable to you personally, or any of us - it's to protect lender profits by aiding their risk models. Your plans and preferences don't even factor in to their guidelines. Not all criteria are on a a sliding scale, so it doesn't necessarily matter how well you meet their other standards. You are of course correct that paying for thousands of dollars in improvements on a house you don't own is lunacy, and the fact that this was suggested may on it's own suggest you should cut your losses now and seek out a different lender.  Given the lender being uncooperative, the only reason to stick with it seems to be the sunk cost of the appraisal you've already paid for. I'd suggest you specifically ask them why they did not perform an as-is appraisal, and listen to the answer (if you can get one). You can try to contact the appraiser directly as well with this question, and ask if you can have the appraisal strictly as-is without having a new appraisal. They might be helpful, they might not. As for taking the appraisal with you to a new bank, you might be able to do this - or you might not. It is strictly up to each lender to set criteria for appraisals they accept, but I've certainly known of people re-using an appraisal done sufficiently recently in this way. It's a possibility that you will need to write off the $800 as an \"education expense\", but it's certainly worth trying to see if you can salvage it and take it with you - you'll just have to ask each potential lender, as I've heard it go both ways. It's not a crazy or super-rare request - lenders backing out based on appraisal results should be absolutely normal to anyone in the finance business. To do this, you can just state plainly the situation. You paid for an appraisal and the previous lender fell through, and so you would like to know if they would be able to accept that and provide you with a loan without having to buy a whole new appraisal. This would also be a good time to talk about condition requirements, in that you want a loan on an as-is basic for a house that is inhabitable but needs cosmetic repair, and you plan to do this in cash on your own time after the purchase closes. Some lenders will be happy to do this at below 75%-80% LTV, and some absolutely do not want to make this type of loan because the house isn't in perfect condition and that's just what their lending criteria is right now.  Based on description alone, I don't think you really should need to go into alternate plans like buy cash and then get a home equity loan to get cash out, special rehab packages, etc. So I'd encourage you to try a more straight-forward option of a different lender, as well as trying to get a straight answer on their odd choice of appraisal order that you paid for, before trying anything more exotic or totally changing your purchase/finance plans.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "* * WWI was an incredibly traumatic and devastating experience for Germany . * * 15 % of Germany 's population of eligible males died in a war fought under unimaginably brutal conditions . Civilians endured extreme economic hardship including malnutrition and starvation ( they had to use the fertilizers for explosives . ) When the war ended it ended very suddenly . There was no single clear reason why Germany lost . In fact , for most of the war Germany appeared to be winning . Even when Germany surrendered they were still fighting * inside France . * The end of WWI produced chaos in Germany . The government collapsed . Large numbers of soldiers surrendered without orders . Communist militants attempted armed revolution and right - wing paramilitary gangs formed to fight them in the streets . Communist revolution had recently occurred in Russia . It was a time of extreme instability . Then , to top it all off , * * the victorious Allies imposed a very harsh ' peace settlement ' on Germany . * * Though a fair view would impose no special responsibility for WWI on Germany Britain and * especially * France could not accept this view . After all , France had just spent four awful years fighting on its own soil . Once that fighting between the communists and right - wing guys died down liberal democracy was settled on . This period ( 1919 - 1933 ) is called the * * Weimar Republic . Things did n't go so well . * * The reparations payments the Allies imposed crippled Germany , and eventually you reached the famous hyper - inflation period , when the money was n't worth the paper it was printed on . In this incredible tumult there were several extremist movements that found popularity . The two main ones were the ( Soviet - aligned ) Communists and the Nazis . But first , * * Hitler :* * Into this fucking laundry machine full of shit situation strode a man . A strong man , a genuine war hero , and , candidly , a bad ass . His name was Adolf Hitler , and he * knew * what Germany 's problem was and was n't afraid of telling people . Loudly , often , and repeatedly . While those irrelevant Weimar guys are falling over themselves trying to save their government he was out in the streets giving people a story to understand their war experience . * * That story was this :* * * \" Germany 's army did n't lose the war . Germany 's army was brave and strong . We nearly beat the French , and those damned Allies never really got onto our soil . No , Germany lost the war because there were traitors back home . Remember the Communists who tried a revolution when the war ended ? They were planning it all along , and had sabotaged Germany in the meanwhile . And it was n't just the Communists either , it was also the Jews . \" * Nazis thought most Jews were Communists anyways so there was a fair amount of overlap here . Or Jews were accused of being war profiteers . The Nazis demonised both these groups as the source of Germany 's problems . So now Hitler 's completed the first step : he 's given the people of Germany an explanation for their long nightmare that is very appealing . * * Next he has to give them a vision . * * This vision started with a cult of personality : * \" Hitler is such a great German , such a war hero , a man who has always given everything he has for Germany . \" * Notice please how this contrasts with their rhetoric about traitors . * \" Democracy was imposed by the Allies to keep us weak . Only a strong man like Hitler can bring Germany back to greatness , and only if his government has absolute and total power . The government will then be able to unify the people , purge the country of the traitors responsible for all the problems , and take revenge against all the countries that kicked Germany while we were down . \" * * * This , in a nutshell , is the narrative , rhetoric , and ideology that brought the Nazis to power . * * But wait ! You might say , I remember hearing the Nazis only ever won 33 % of the vote ? How did they get absolute power out of that ? The long answer to that question is complicated and boring . The short answer is that the left - wing was split between peaceful Social Democrats ( discredited among many radical workers by their support of WWI ) and the violent - revolution favoring Communists . Since the Left could n't get together anything the Nazis were able to lead a coalition of other , often more moderate , right wing politicians . Often these guys they teamed up with did n't like the Nazis ; they thought , understandably , that they were fanatical and weird . But hey , they justified , * anything to keep the Communists out of power . * Once the Nazi Party machine had control over the entire government the ball just kept rolling . They quickly acquired ever more absolute powers and these powers in turn gave them new ways of pumping up their propaganda machine . The early victories of the Nazis make this even more powerful . For several years there your average German on the street could say \" Well , Whatever else you might say about our Fuhrer he sure got Germany back on track . Look at all the wars we 're winning !

{"text": "A Graph neural network (GNN) is a class of artificial neural networks for processing data that can be represented as graphs.\nIn the more general subject of \"Geometric Deep Learning\", certain existing neural network architectures can be interpreted as GNNs operating on suitably defined graphs. Convolutional neural networks, in the context of computer vision, can be seen as a GNN applied to graphs structured as grids of pixels. Transformers, in the context of natural language processing, can be seen as GNNs applied to complete graphs whose nodes are words in a sentence.\nThe key design element of GNNs is the use of pairwise message passing, such that graph nodes iteratively update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors. Since their inception, several different GNN architectures have been proposed, which implement different flavors of message passing. As of 2022[update], whether it is possible to define GNN architectures \"going beyond\" message passing, or if every GNN can be built on message passing over suitably defined graphs, is an open research question.\nRelevant application domains for GNNs include social networks,\ncitation networks,[10]\nmolecular biology,[11] chemistry,[12]\nphysics[13] and\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.[14]\nSeveral open source libraries implementing graph neural networks are available, such as PyTorch Geometric[15] (PyTorch), TensorFlow GNN[16] (TensorFlow), and jraph[17] (Google JAX).", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The answer is in your question: derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract.  If the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will, in the first instance be billed by any intermediary (Prime Broker etc.) that facilitated the contract. If they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can \"net off\" any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins. The contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can, but don't need to, report a default (such that this is) to credit agencies (in some jurisdictions they are required to by law). Any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment. If there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved (the party to the trade and any intermediaries) can sue for breach of contract. If they win (which would be expected) the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including, but not limited to, seizure of assets, enforced bankruptcy, and prison terms for any contempts of court rulings. All of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses (as Argentina did in the early 20th century) but in that case it may escalate as far as war. It has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as I know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict. As well as the \"hard\" results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further. Potential employees and funders will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit. The end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees. Most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well. edit: netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party's cash flows, positive and negative, are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances, for example: company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3M + 500k = 3.5M and total incomings are 1.2M + 1.1M + 1.2M = 3.5M so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into company1's account of 0.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It is called \"Credit card installments\" or \"Equal pay installments\", and I am not aware of them being widely used in the USA. While in other countries they are supported by banks directly (right?), in US you may find this option only in some big stores like home improvement stores, car dealerships, cell phone operators (so that you can buy a new phone) etc. Some stores allow 0% financing for, say, 12 months which is not exactly the same as installments but close, if you have discipline to pay $250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end. Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well, and it adds risks of customer default, introduces debt collection possibility etc. That's why it's usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not care in this case, from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $250 every month. In other countries banks support this option directly, I think, taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants. This has not happened in US. There is a company SplitIt which automates installments if stores want to support it but again, it means stores need to agree to it. Here is a simple article describing how credit cards work: https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html In general, if you move to US, you are unlikely to be able to get a regular credit card because you will not have any \"credit history\" which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt. The easiest way to build the history - request \"secured credit card\", which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount. It's like a \"practice credit card\". You use it for 6-12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus, establishing your \"credit score\". After that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card. Credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that. As anything else in US, there are some businesses which help to solve this problem for extra money.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic created by John McCarthy to formalize the common sense assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified. Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the frame problem. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented first-order logic  to allow the minimization of the extension of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the closed-world assumption that what is not known to be true is false.\nThe original problem considered by McCarthy was that of missionaries and cannibals: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank of a river; they have to cross the river using a boat that can only take two, with the additional constraint that cannibals must never outnumber the missionaries on either bank (as otherwise the missionaries would be killed and, presumably, eaten). The problem considered by McCarthy was not that of finding a sequence of steps to reach the goal (the article on the missionaries and cannibals problem contains one such solution), but rather that of excluding conditions that are not explicitly stated. For example, the solution \"go half a mile south and cross the river on the bridge\" is intuitively not valid because the statement of the problem does not mention such a bridge. On the other hand, the existence of this bridge is not excluded by the statement of the problem either. That the bridge does not exist is\na consequence of the implicit assumption that the statement of the problem contains everything that is relevant to its solution. Explicitly stating that a bridge does not exist is not a solution to this problem, as there are many other exceptional conditions that should be excluded (such as the presence of a rope for fastening the cannibals, the presence of a larger boat nearby, etc.)\nCircumscription was later used by McCarthy to formalize the implicit assumption of inertia: things do not change unless otherwise specified.  Circumscription seemed to be useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; this is known as the frame problem. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the Yale shooting problem scenario. Other solutions to the frame problem that correctly formalize the Yale shooting problem exist; some use circumscription but in a different way.", "label": "hc3human"}

Are you sure the PMI will drop off after 2 years? The rules are specific, and for PMI, when prepayments put you at that 78/80% LTV, your bank can require an appraisal, not automatically drop it. Talk to the banks, get confirmation, and depending what they say, keep hacking away at the mortgage.  After this, I suggest jumping on Roth IRAs. You are in the 15% bracket, and the Roth will let you deposit $5500 for each you and your wife. A great way to kickstart a higher level of retirement savings.  After this, I'm not comfortable with the emergency savings level. If you lose your job tomorrow (Funny story, my wife and I lost our's on the same day 3 years ago) and don't have enough savings (Our retirement accounts were good to just retire that day) you can easily run out of money and be late on the mortgage.

In many cases the news is already priced into the stock during the anticipation of the news being released. Other times as soon as the news is released the price will gap up or down in response to the news.  Some times when you think that the news is good, like new record profits have been achieved, but the share price goes down instead of up. This may be due to the expectation of the record profits by analysts to be 20% more than last year, but the company only achieves 10% more than last year. So the news is actually seen as bad because, even though record profits, it hasn't met expectations. The same can happen in the other direction, a company may make a loss and the share price goes up. This may be because it was expected to make a 50% loss but only made a 20% loss due to cost cutting, so this is seen as a good thing and the price can shoot up, especially if it had been beaten down for months. An other example is when the Federal Reserve in the USA put up interest rates earlier this month. Some may have seen this as bad news and expected share prices to fall, but instead prices rallied. This was actually seen as good news, firstly because it had been expected for a long time, and secondly and more importantly because a small rise in interest rates after many years of near zero rates is a sign of the economy finally starting to improve. If the economy is improving, that means more people will have jobs, more people will be spending more money, companies will start to make higher revenues and start to expand, which means higher profits and higher share prices.

{"text": "This BBC article says that nuclear power notes came about when the French energy company EDF purchased British Energy in 2008: The note changes in value with wholesale energy prices and power output levels from British Energy's existing nuclear stations. EDF Energy's website describes these notes under the section titled \"Nuclear Power Notes\": When EDF acquired British Energy in January 2009, Nuclear Power Notes were issued to British Energy shareholders who chose to take them in lieu of 74 pence of cash per British Energy share held. The Nuclear Power Notes are ten year financial instruments (2009 \u2013 2019) which give ex British Energy shareholders a continuing interest in the \u201cEDF Energy Nuclear Generation Fleet\u201d. They are traded on the ICAP Securities & Derivatives Exchange (formerly known as the PLUS Quoted exchange).   Each year a pre-defined calculation is performed to determine whether any cash will be paid to Nuclear Power Note holders. The calculation is dependent on the nuclear output of the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Fleet (\u201cEligible Nuclear Output\u201d) and market power prices (\u201cPower Prices\u201d). This calculation may or may not result in a cash payment each year to Nuclear Power Note holders. The MWh/TWh are figures you see are measures of watt-hours, i.e. energy output. The value of nuclear power notes is tied to this output. Looking at the most recent statement (June 2013), you can see a line that looks like this: Month Ahead Price in respect of July 2013: 47.46 GBP/MWh which is an energy spot price for the output of the nuclear plants. I'm not entirely sure of the relationship between this and the payment to shareholders, but if you look at the 2012 Yearly Payment Calculation Notice on the same page, you'll see this in the first section: (a) the Yearly Payment for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012, (the   Relevant Year ) payable in respect of each CVR on 31 January 2013 shall be zero; The payments were also zero for 2010 and 2011. The 2009 calculation notice, however, states that (a) the Yearly Payment for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009, (the Relevant Year) payable in respect of each CVR on 31 January 2010 shall be 11.497164 pence stated to 6 decimal places I presume that payment would have appeared in whatever account holds these notes, e.g. your brokerage account. Technically, the financial statements above refer to a Contingent Value Rights (CVR) instrument, which is a derivative linked to the Nuclear Power Notes. This site sums it up better than I can: The British Energy CVRs were created by the issue of nuclear power notes (NPNs) to the target\u2019s shareholders who opted to take up this alternative. The NPNs were issued by Barclays Bank plc and were linked to guaranteed contingent value rights instruments that were issued to Barclays by EDF\u2019s acquisition vehicle (Lake Acquisitions) and which were ultimately guaranteed by EDF Energy plc (Lake CVRs). Barclays is required to make yearly payments to noteholders for 10 years, the amount of which is limited to the corresponding amount paid by Lake Acquisitions to Barclays for the Lake CVRs. Basically, there is a chain of payments through these derivatives that eventually links back to nuclear energy output.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Its because there are fewer cultural niches for gender expression . In our culture we have a defined group for lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgender people , and many many subgroups for other sexual expressions . In Thailand , if you are born male and do not conform to sexual norms , you are kathoey , whether you are transgender , homosexual , bisexual or whatever . In western culture we have a clearly defined \" drag queen \" culture , but in Thailand a drag queen and a trans woman are not distinct groups . If you are a cis man ( cis being opposite of trans ) in Thailand and have even the slightest amount of effeminate behavior , the culture expects you to go full - out female with your gender presentation . There is no room for effeminate gay males in Thailand . But there is another side to this coin . In the USA , for example , trans women are encouraged to \" pass \" - meaning they are not detectably trans , and therefore it is easy for trans women in America to become invisible . Trans women face some of the harshest discrimination in the US , and there is more violence towards trans women than any other sexual minority . Hundreds of women in America are killed each year because of their trans status . There is a LOT of pressure to \" pass \" , based on personal safety alone . In Thailand , they have the kathoey niche , where it is much more acceptable to be a trans woman , and therefore they are much more visible . Famous women are often trans in Thailand , and are celebrated as such . I 'd be hard pressed to name even one venerated and famous trans woman in America . So its not that there are more trans women in Thailand , its the combination that their definition of what constitutes a trans woman is very wide , and those women are generally accepted by society as normal and therefore are much more visible than in other , more hostile cultures .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The best answer we can give you , scientifically and even simply , is that we do n't know . This is a smart thing to say if anyone asks you , and you should never feel bad for admitting that the best answer we have is complete uncertainty . * * Here 's why :* * All of the laws and the physical constants that we understand : electromagnetism , strong and weak nuclear forces , and gravity all seemed to form around the time of the big bang . Without these four crucial laws , our universe would n't look anything like it looks now . These laws hold our galaxies together and hold our bodies together just the same . They are the universe 's best \" glue \" . Without these laws , we LITERALLY do n't even have the tools necessary to form an understanding of space and time . ( And that 's what our universe is : 3 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension ) In fact , without the laws we ca n't form a concept of ANYTHING . We ca n't even form ' concepts ' . Nothing works . So we start with the laws and go from there . At the time of the big bang and \" before \" ( if there was any before ) , these laws get much shakier , and by virtue of that fact so does our understanding of exactly what ' happened ' . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * * Example :* * Imagine trying to play a game of dodge - ball , except that the other team is comprised entirely of giraffes and your team - mates are a kitchen sponge , a jellyfish , an office building , and a potted plant . Oh , you 're also floating in the vacuum of space and the dodge - balls are actually sand . Good luck . * * Example 2 :* * Imagine trying to bake some chocolate chip cookies , except that once again you are floating out in space and all you have is a bag of plastic lawn gnomes and a beluga whale . Good luck . If you can play a game of \" dodge - ball \" or bake \" cookies \" with these tools , then you are a very talented individual . Most people would think that you had brought the wrong things together and that you did n't understand the rules of the task you had set out to accomplish . That 's what trying to understand \" cause \" or \" before \" or \" event \" is like when you discuss the Big Bang itself . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Some deists ( those who believe in a god without the institutions of modern religion ) can often rationalize god by saying that \" it \" created the Big Bang , and was therefore the only un - caused cause in the universe ... or the \" prime mover \" . However , this is just as rational as saying the Big - Bang caused itself , or just randomly came into existence . It adds nothing to our discussion to say that god did it because the event occurring from a prime mover is no different from the event occurring on its own .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A huge amount of money in all financial markets is from institutional investors, such as mutual funds, government pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, etc.  For various reasons these funds do all of their trading at the end of the day.  They care primarily that their end-of-day balances are in line with their targets and are easy to audit and far less about \"timing the market\" for the best possible trades. So, if you're looking at a stock that is owned by many institutional investors -- such as a stock (like AAPL) that makes up a significant portion of an index that many funds track -- there will be a huge amount of activity at this time relative to stocks that are less popular among institutions. Even just in its introduction this paper (PDF) gives a fair overview of other reasons why there's a lot of trading at end-of-day in general. (In fact, because of all this closing activity and the reliance on end-of-day prices as signposts for financial calculations, the end-of-day has for decades been the single most fraud-ridden time of the trading day.

Investing in a single stock is quite risky, even more so when your income also depends on that company. Framed another way: which percentage of your portfolio should you put into a single stock?

{"text": "When you write a piece of software , you basically are making a list of instructions for a calculator to perform . You have your operations : You can Add , Subtract , Multiply , Divide , or MOD ( Obtain the remainder of a division ) , two numbers . ( There are also lots of operations that modify the bits inside of these numbers , that are useful for talking to hardware , or optimizing certain operations ) You then have control pieces : A mechanism to LOAD , STORE , GOTO , IF , BRANCH IF 0 , and you can do a lot of complicated things . A machine that can do this basic set of things is known as being Turing Complete . Pretty much anything that can be algorithmically represented or modeled , can be modeled with a Turing Complete machine-- this includes video games . Doing so at a low level is really difficult though- so people made programming languages , which can use simpler terms , and then generate a bunch of the above listed instructions which accomplish the same thing . Computers then need to talk to hardware . In the early days it was just TTYs , basically terminals that you could communicate with via serial . The CPU would have hardware on it that could turn a pin on and off when you LOAD or STORE to a specific address ( Addresses normally will store into memory , but these magical addresses would instead communicate with hardware ) . For instance , your parallel port is located at 0x0378 . Writing a number to this address sets the pins on your parallel port to 0V for a 0 bit , or 12V for a 1 bit in the corresponding number written to that address . Write to another address , and you 're writing to memory , and you can basically just save that data there , and retrieve it later . By interfacing with this graphical hardware , you could make english characters , but there was also a predefined set of all sorts of other characters- ASCII . URL_0 Need a brick wall ? ASCII character 178 would do , need a Lion , 234 looks good enough to me ! Basically though , after a short period of time , people realize that these characters looked nothing like lions , or brick walls-- and decided to start making hardware specifically for doing graphics . The same process underneath applies , the hardware exposes some set of registers for configuring it , and you can then do fancy things using those same LOAD and STORE operations to drop data into video memory . This video memory on modern graphics cards basically is a big blob of pixels that represent all of the pixels on your monitor ranging from left to right . The data you put into this memory controls what color pixel shows on your monitor . People could then make software to draw images into these pixels . Computers still are massively slow , and imagine having to recalculate the value of every one of those pixels 60 times a second ? It 's extremely taxing on the processor . In order to accomplish this , hardware has been created that can abstract the way in which these pixels are produced into a higher level of concepts . This is where 3d graphics processing comes from . Basically now you can talk to the hardware and say , \" Draw me a polygon , rotate it 30 degrees , and apply this 3D transform to it , then dump it into video memory at this location . \" The model behind the scenes storing where the items are located , how much health a character has , the script for the story etc , are really no more sophisticated now than they were when people were using the ASCII lions and brick walls . All that has changed is the ability to render the story using this specific 3D hardware that gives programmers a great deal of control for how to display these things .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "This wo n't actually be for a 5 year old , but a 5 year old should be nowhere near this book nor the movie . The author that wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Ellis , is known for a common theme in all of his books . Simply put , they are about the detachment prevalent in modern society . Specifically the effect that wealth and privilege can have on people . No one has friends only acquaintances . People are only as important as what they can do for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity I 'll only deal with what 's in the movie . In American Psycho the main character is pretending to be a human . He takes everything way too far because he is over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he is with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his whole shower procedure . He is pretending to work . His father owns a competing firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick as an employee simply because of his fathers name . He pretends to have a fiance , who of course is completely fake too , otherwise she would n't survive long around him . He pretends to have sexuality . He has no clue what it is to love someone let alone to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he feels cheated . He can see all around him what humanity is supposed to be and he just is n't \" that \" . He knows that it 's getting worse and worse , and is afraid that he will be caught . He is n't afraid of going to jail or dying , but rather he is afraid of being exposed as a fake person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your specific question regarding the scene where he calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so he calls his lawyer and admits everything he can think of . The lawyer thinks the caller is someone other than Patrick playing a joke . He never takes it seriously because to him Patrick is just some bland rich guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other bland rich guys . Later when Patrick sees the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about it the lawyer , not realizing he is talking TO Patrick , laughs about the ridiculousness of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are common themes in the movie and book . People constantly remark how normal Patrick is , people constantly mistake him and others for someone else . They all look and act alike . In my opinion the movie is about how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer to blend into society because of how uncaring and superficial we all are . If you likes the movie of course read the book . If books are n't your thing then at least watch Less Than Zero and maybe The Rules Of Attraction .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A 401k is an investment vehicle that grows in value over time . Investments made into a 401k are not taxed until the money is withdrawn , so if you make $ 50 K per year and contribute $ 10 K to your 401k , then your taxable income for the year is $ 40K. The catch is that that money is taxed on the backend , when you withdraw . The benefit is that a 401k is intended for retirement , so your income will likely be significantly lower when you 're retired , so you pay much lower taxes ( if any at all ) on the money in the 401k . Make sure that you do n't withdraw money from the account early or else you pay a hefty penalty to the IRS . Many plans do n't even allow early withdraw except in cases of extreme financial hardship , although some do allow loans that are repaid with interest . When should you start yours ? As soon as possible . The longer that that money can sit in the account , the more it will grow . Also , many employers offer a 401k matching program that is essentially free money . At a minimum ( if you can afford it ) you should contribute to point that the the company will match ( my company matches up to 6 % , so when I first started working for them , I contributed 6 % of my income , effectively making my yearly contribution 12 % of my total salary ) . After that , steadily increase it as appropriate . Will the value depreciate if the economy goes in the tanker ? Yes . It 's an investment and its value is subject to the ebbs and flows of the market . You can protect yourself somewhat by wisely choosing a mix of bonds vs. stocks and investing is less volatile mutual funds , but ultimately , it 's still investing . To put you at ease though , the long - term return on the stock market for periods of 25 years or longer is about 9 - 10 % .

When people cut down the Earth 's forests ( deforestation ) , this means less carbon dioxide is taken out of the atmosphere by plants .

Most DLPs employ a large number of computing components to leverage high data-level parallelism, a relatively larger on-chip buffer/memory to leverage the data reuse patterns, and limited data-width operators for error-resilience of deep learning.

{"text": "* * Short / TLDR version :* * Nixon , the Republican POTUS , was involved with corrupt and illegal behaviour ( breaking into the offices of the rival Democratic Party , invasions of privacy and using the IRS to harass political enemies , and other dirty work ) , obstructed justice in trying to cover it up , publicly lied about his involvement in all of that , and then attempted to use his presidential power to dismantle the case against him . He was found out when he was forced to hand over tapes from a then - secret recording system in place all over the White House . He was forced to resign ( to this day the only President ever to have done so ) , but escaped criminal punishment because his successor , Nixon 's VP Gerald Ford , pardoned Nixon . 48 government officials were convicted of various crimes such as perjury , conspiracy , obstruction of justice , illegal campaigning , burglary , and refusing to answer questions . Most got short or suspended sentences , some of the senior figures ( including cabinet level officials ) went to prison for a year or two . That should be more than enough to explain why it was such a big deal . * * Extended version :* * \" Watergate \" is the name of a group of buildings - a hotel , three apartment buildings , and a hotel - office building . Part of the hotel - office building was being used as the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee , the principal organization governing the United States Democratic Party . At the time , the President of the United States was a Republican , Richard Nixon . He had been elected President in the November 1968 election , which meant he faced another election in November 1972 . On June 17 , 1972 , five men were arrested for breaking and entering the Watergate complex , specially the offices of the DNC . The purpose for the break - in has never been conclusively established , but is believed to be to photograph documents and install listening devices and bug phones , as well as to steal any incriminating documents that could be used to harm the President . It was soon discovered that the burglars had ties to the Republican Party , as well as the Committee for the Re - Election of the President , the official organisation of Nixon 's re - election campaign . The Committee attempted to hide its involvement , and Nixon claimed to have ordered an investigation into the matter , when in fact no such investigation occurred . Nixon also attempted to block the FBI investigation into the source of the funds behind the burglary . The FBI realised that Nixon himself was surely involved and that and his wrongdoings far exceeded this single incident . The media and the American public for the most part failed to grasp the full implications of the scandal , and Nixon won the 1972 election by an enormous margin . All was not well for Nixon however . Intense investigative reporting by the media , in particular by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post , began to reveal to the public more of the full scale of Nixon and his associates ' questionable and in many cases illegal conduct . They relied heavily on anonymous informants , chief among which was a figure dubbed \" Deep Throat \" , who was eventually revealed to be the second highest person in the FBI at the time , Associate Director Mark Felt . The arrested burglars began to cooperate with the investigation , and as a result Nixon was forced to fire three of his most important aides ( they linked him to the burglars ) . Nixon continued to deny any involvement in the scandal and downplay the allegations , and remained in office despite waning suppourt from the American public and even his own party . An official Senate investigation was launched . This led to a breakthrough in mid 1973 . A White House assistant revealed that there was a secret recording system in place at various locations of the White House , including in the Cabinet Room and the President 's offices . The Special Prosecutor ( i.e. head ) of the Senate 's investigation , Archibald Cox , subpoenaed ( officially ordered the submission of ) the tapes , but Nixon refused , citing his executive privilege , and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena . Cox refused . In a series of events now known as the Saturday Night Massacre , Nixon ordered Cox 's superior , the Attorney General no less ( the head of the Department of Justice , nominated by the President , and serves as a member of his Cabinet ) , to fire Cox , but he refused and resigned in protest . Nixon repeated his order to the Deputy Attorney General , who also refused and resigned . The next person in line ( the Solicitor General , the person appointed to represent the Government before the Supreme Court ) finally complied with Nixon 's order . Still the issue was not resolved . After the investigation implicated more members of Nixon 's administration , the issue of the tapes ( known as the Watergate tapes ) went to the Supreme Court in July 1974 , which unanimously voted that the President must release them to the Special Prosecutor . Nixon finally complied . The tapes proved that Nixon had attempted to cover the initial incident up from the very beginning , among other \" dirty tricks \" . Nixon 's suppourt in Congress collapsed , and he was forced to resign the Presidency . He still refused to admit to any wrongdoing beyond failing to act \" more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate , particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy . \" The Senate dropped its own investigation , but criminal prosecution was still a possibility on the State and Federal level . Nixon was succeeded by his Vice President , Gerald Ford . If you did n't know , Presidents have the constitutional power to \" grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment \" , i.e. literally give a Get Out of Jail Free card at will . A month after taking office , Ford issued a full and unconditional pardon of Nixon , immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had \" committed or may have committed or taken part in \" as President . In a televised broadcast to the nation , Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country . He said that the situation \" is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part . It could go on and on and on , or someone must write the end to it . I have concluded that only I can do that , and if I can , I must . \" In the ensuing investigations and trials , 69 government officials were charged with various crimes such as perjury , conspiracy , obstruction of justice , illegal campaigning , burglary , and refusing to answer questions . 48 were found guilty , and most served short prison sentences of less than a year . A few of the senior figures went to prison for around one and a half years , including two Attorney Generals , the Head of Committee to Re - elect the President , and Nixon 's Chief of Staff . The pardon was unpopular among the American public , and as a result Ford 's ratings took a fall and never recovered . He was voted out for the Democrat Jimmy Carter at the next election two and a half years later . His 895 - day presidency remains the shortest of all presidents who did not die in office . Nixon proclaimed his innocence until his death in 1994 . He remained quiet about the scandal , and to this day the extent of his crimes is far from clear .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In most cases, if you are a member of the class the law-firm will contact you via postal mail to notify you of the class action and give you an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of participating in any settlement that happens.  More often than not, they take the opt-out approach, meaning that if you don't say you want out of the class it is assumed that you agree with the complaints as defined in the class action and would like to receive your portion of the money if there is a settlement.  If you haven't gotten such a letter and you think you should have, it is a good idea to contact the law firm. How do you find the law firm? Usually some Googling on \"class action\" and the name of the defendant company will get you there. Also, check the legal section of the classifieds of the local newspaper, they sometimes advertise them there.  Typically they aren't hard to find because it is in the law firm's best interest to have everyone sign on to their class action for a number of reasons including: If you have a lot of people who are supposedly aggrieved, it makes the defendant look more likely to be guilty, and more participants can equate to higher settlement amounts (for which the law firm gets a percentage). That is why you see non-stop ads on daytime TV for lawyers marketing class action cases and looking for people who took this drug, or had that hip implant. Once a settlement occurs and you are a member of that class, there are a number of ways you might get your piece including: - A credit to your account. - A check in the mail. - A coupon or some other consideration for your damages (lame) - A promise that they will stop doing the bad thing and maybe some changes (in your favor) on the terms of your account. A final note: Don't get your hopes up. The lawyers are usually the only ones who make any substantial money from these things, not the class members. I've been paid settlements from lots of these things and it is rare for it to be more than $25, but the time the spoils are divided.

Also , Roy Spencer ( he manages the UAH temperature dataset ) posts some of his views on [ his website ] ( URL_2 ) . He tries to briefly state some of his arguments , such as : > you might be surprised to learn that the amount of warming directly caused by the extra CO2 is , by itself , relatively weak . It has been calculated theoretically that , if there are no other changes in the climate system , a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration would cause less than 1 deg C of surface warming ( about 1 deg . F ) . This is NOT a controversial statement \u2026 it is well understood by climate scientists . ( As of 2008 , we were about 40 % to 45 % of the way toward a doubling of atmospheric CO2 . ) You 'll frequently hear a common theme along these lines . Many of the skeptics think that by 2100 , our temperatures will have risen 1 dec C , perhaps 1.5 deg C. But they strongly reject the 3 - 10 deg C warmings that are often mentioned . Their arguments is that feedback knowledge is still too unknown , and they have a belief that feedbacks are not nearly as strong as the \" warmist \" or \" alarmist \" view is . To back up these exaggeration concepts , they 'll also frequently show the UAH dataset , and show how since the 1970s , it 's averaging about .1C rise per decade . If that 's extrapolated out for another century , that 's 1.0 C rise . This is often compared against past predictions , which suggested our temperature now would be worse than it currently is . The most common is [ Hansen 's 1988 prediction in Congress ] ( URL_0 ) . His prediction suggested that temperatures would have risen by about 0.75 - 0.9 C from 1980 to now ( Scenario A or Scenario B if you stretch it ) . But if you look at the satellite data , it shows only about 0.3 C rise . tl;dr . Conservative doubt on global warming expresses itself as believing the most common predictions are too exaggerated . They do believe we will experience warming , and that humanity is probably the cause of most of it . But it the warming wo n't cause disasters .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) or integrated optical circuit is a microchip containing two or more photonic components which form a functioning circuit. This technology detects, generates, transports, and processes light. Photonic integrated circuits utilize photons (or particles of light) as opposed to electrons that are utilized by electronic integrated circuits. The major difference between the two is that a photonic integrated circuit provides functions for information signals imposed on optical wavelengths typically in the visible spectrum or near infrared (850\u20131650\u00a0nm).\nThe most commercially utilized material platform for photonic integrated circuits is indium phosphide (InP), which allows for the integration of various optically active and passive functions on the same chip. Initial examples of photonic integrated circuits were simple 2-section distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, consisting of two independently controlled device sections \u2013 a gain section and a DBR mirror section. Consequently, all modern monolithic tunable lasers, widely tunable lasers, externally modulated lasers and transmitters, integrated receivers, etc. are examples of photonic integrated circuits. As of 2012, devices integrate hundreds of functions onto a single chip.  \nPioneering work in this arena was performed at Bell Laboratories. The most notable academic centers of excellence of photonic integrated circuits in InP are the University of California at Santa Barbara, USA, the Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Twente in the Netherlands.\nA 2005 development showed that silicon can, even though it is an indirect bandgap material, still be used to generate laser light via the Raman nonlinearity. Such lasers are not electrically driven but optically driven and therefore still necessitate a further optical pump laser source.", "label": "hc3human"}

Some of the more accepted ways to open a bank account are: A: Call up an established bank and follow their instructions to open a personal account . Make sure you are calling on a real bank, one that has been around a while. Hints: has permanent locations, in the local phone book, and has shares traded on a national stock exchange.  Call the bank directly, don't use a number given to you by a 3rd party consultant, as it may be a trick... Discuss on the phone and find out if you can open an account by mail or if you need to visit in person.  B: Create a company or branch office in the foreign country, assuming this is for business or investing.   and open an account by appointing someone (like a lawyer or accountant or similar professional) in the foreign country to represent the company to open an account in person.  If you are a US citizen, you will want to ask your CPA/accountant/tax lawyer about the TD F 90-22.1 Foreign Account Bank Report form, and the FATCA Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

When a Soldier is injured or killed during combat operations he / she is put onto a MEDEVAC ( medical evacuation ) vehicle , whether it be a helicopter or some form of ground transportation .

As for the gear , after it is recovered back to a FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) all gear that was worn by a casualty is inspected by people certified to determine whether it is serviceable .

{"text": "Objectivism was Rand 's attempt at a philosophical theory of everything . It er ... did n't work out too well , it tries too hard to dogmatically oppose pretty much any postmodern idea , but to say \" Me . It is all about me . Fuck you \" or \" Objectivism is a philosophy like Rex Kwon Do is a martial art \" is dishonest . A lot of the philosophical systems developed around the same time were obsessed with the subjectivity of human experiences , that because different people see things differently , truth is difficult to ascertain . Objectivism says that a an objective reality exists independent of how individuals perceive the world , and that we can trust our senses to perceive the physical world . Different opinions come from our conclusions being muddled by subjective feelings , and this is where the Objectivist cult - like superiority complex about politics comes from , because Objectivists claim to be uniquely free of delusions . As part of its epistemological outlook ( epistemology = explaining how individuals and societies learn things ) , it rejected the conflict between rationalists and empiricists . Rand believed that empirical observations had to be contextualized and put together by logic . This was n't really anything revolutionary though , as the conflict was resolved outside of the fringes of academia and it had been pretty mainstream in philosophy of science for the past two or three decades with the rise of logical empiricism / positivism in the 30s and 40s . Those philosophical and epistemological outlooks led Rand to the conclusion that the only moral obligations one has is to oneself , and that empathy is one of those delusional feelings that , while not necessarily bad , should n't be forced on other people . That tends to be pretty bad for society , but it 's not . Codified morals * are * socially constructed Big Lies , there are no magically intrinsic moral absolutes , but most other atheist and realist worldviews have come to terms with the fact that they 're a necessity for a functioning society when done right , and we do have some ingrained psychological sense of empathy towards our families and communities anyway . Objectivism also promotes a view of art called romantic realism that places value on the technical skill of the artist and themes that celebrate human accomplishment . It 's one of the places where you can see the tenets of Objectivism breaking down . If feelings are bad and cloud people 's judgement , is n't pride in humanity one of them ? It comes up a lot whenever Rand or other Objectivists talk about the things they do view positively , which they seem to consider innately good despite coming from subjective feelings . All in all , Objectivism is a fairly well - reasoned but dogmatically anti - postmodern philosophical system that 's metaphysically right or at the very least not evil about a lot of things but wrong about an important few that are needed for maintaining civil society ( with a fair amount of hypocrisies , but you 'd be hard pressed to find a totally consistent philosophy anyway ) . Its problem is n't necessarily dogmatic reliance on what Rand says , as some have suggested , but a lack of sophistication most evident in its unchanging stance that feelings are bad even though it hypocritically champions other feelings like pride in humanity , individual dignity , etc as positive things a priori .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "The long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history into this explanation which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts without learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on to the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very clear answers for addressing the faults . His basic plan was that industrialized nations should move to socialism , and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain later why no communist country actually followed his plan . One of Marx and Engels arguments was that prior to industrialization , we produced not much more than we used . Obviously there was trade but for the most part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines come along and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author of Wealth of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a product , you might have 10 who accomplish different portions of the task . This made production go way up . What Marx criticized was the effect of having such a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the good decreases because the supply is so high . This required two things , one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition who , through free market competition , lower prices . The second was that you had to find new markets . Given the world at the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods . So the more markets that opened up the more needed to be produced . Marx believed that workers standard of living decreased as people were moved into the cities to meet the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of owning your own land or home , you lived in worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private land ownership ( understatement , his summation of Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not by the family . If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the local land . Back to industrialization , this is the period of time where we find child labor , a lack of labor laws , unions , or anyone fighting for the workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . The first was the bourgeois ( boor - zhwa ) who had the capital ( the money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name basically means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was the proletariat . These are the workers in the factories and on the farms . Their standard of living is so low that they can only afford to survive . The name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the ones who are actually doing the work and producing the goods , yet they are treated the worst and receive little of the profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers ruled . He argued for labor unions to protect themselves from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to lose their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these conditions \" well then the managers and owners would have to listen . They ca n't do the work on their own , they require a large number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , or strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than it cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx said , was the result of industrialization and the drive for profit it produced . He stated that we stopped producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is increased , demand is decreased , and the price decreases . This is not good news for the worker as this cycle feeds back on itself , and ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

That line roughly corresponds with the end of the \" Rocky Mountain rain shadow \" , which is the zone of North America that has reduced rainfall because the air dried out in its west - to - east trip over the Rocky Mountains . East of that line , the air is wetter in the summer because moisture gets pulled south - to - north from the Gulf of Mexico . What does rain have to do with it ? Well , east of 100W , there 's enough rain to grow corn ( maize ) and soyabeans . Because those crops are so productive per acre , this means that you can have much smaller farms run profitably over a long period of time , so when the area was settled by ( white ) Americans in the first half of the 19th Century , the rural areas were relatively thickly settled . The food they grew was enough to support lots of small towns and midsized cities , both in terms of food and dollars . Later , when people left the farms and moved to cities ( and their suburbs ) , they tended to stay near the places where they grew up . Meanwhile , west of 100W , with less rainfall , the main crop is wheat . It 's still productive , but to really make a go of it , you need more mechanization and irrigation than you do in the east , and the economies of scale are much larger .

While this may be implied, I do think it helps to have an idea of what is causing the buy and sell signals in speculating as I'd rather follow a strategy than try to figure things out completely from scratch that doesn't quite make sense to me. There are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along: Fundamental Analysis:Fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health, its management and competitive advantages, and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up analysis and top down analysis. The term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis. Technical Analysis:In finance, technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. There are tools like \"Stock Screeners\" that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix.  There are various strategies one could use.  Wikipedia under Stock Speculator lists: \"Several different types of stock trading strategies or approaches exist including day trading, trend following, market making, scalping (trading), momentum trading, trading the news, and arbitrage.\"  Thus, I'd advise research what approach are you wanting to use as the \"Make it up as we go along losing real money all the way\" wouldn't be my suggested approach. There is something to be said for there being numerous columnists and newsletter peddlers if you want other ideas but I would suggest having a strategy before putting one's toe in the water.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Physics as we understand them seem to break down once we look on a small enough level . Quantum Mechanics is a field that attempts to comprehend the weirdness on the level of electrons ( real small particles / waves ) . The go - to metaphor for understanding QM is Schrodinger 's Cat ( Schrodinger was a famous quantum mechanics physicist , and this is his thought experiment ): * * * Imagine you put a cat inside of a heavily fortified box . Inside that box , you put a bomb that has an absolutely 50 % chance of exploding in a given amount of time . Now , on our level of physics , we would assume that when you look inside the box , the cat is alive or the cat is dead , with a 50 % probability of each outcome . If you open the box , and the cat is dead , you can assume \" the bomb went off \" . If you open the box , and the cat is alive , you can assume \" the bomb did not go off \" . With QM , however , it 's not so simple . There is a lot of math behind what I 'm about to explain , and it does all check out , but it is incredibly hard for us to understand . So let 's say the given amount of time has passed , and it is time for us to look in the box . * * According to QM , before you look inside the box , the cat is both in an alive state , and in a dead state , and the bomb both did and did not go off * * . It is only when you look inside an see either an alive or dead cat that the cat actually becomes either alive or dead . Prior to looking in , it was both at the same time . * \" What ? ! \" * you say ? * \" That makes no sense ! \" * And you 'd be right . But this is why QM is so confusing , because on our scale of the universe , this type of effect makes no sense . But on the quantum scale , it makes perfect sense . * * * If we try to look at an electron , it 's crazy . An electron 's position is * not defined * by where it was a second ago , it is defined by what 's called a probability cloud . That is to say that an electron has an X% chance of being over here , and a Y% chance of being over there . We ca n't know for certain where it is until we actually look . This is because the electron is in what 's known as a superposition . It is simultaneously existing in * every place * at the same time , but when we look at it ( or ' observe ' ) , it seemingly chooses to be in one particular place . This ' choosing ' of its position is known as collapsing the particle 's wave function ( i.e. its probability of being in a particular place ) . It 's crazy confusing stuff , because logically we assume that it has to be at place A or place B , but it 's at both A and B at the same moment ! Further , somehow our viewing of the electron causes it to choose a position ! What does an observer have to do with * anything * ? That 's QM in a nutshell . I ca n't speak to careers in the field , but I assume most of the physicists at the Large Haldron Collider are QM engineers .

{"text": "FAA licensed flight instructor here ! I get excited when an ELI5 is in my wheel house . The short answer is ... practice . In calm winds , lining up with the runway 's dashed centerline is actually one of the least challenging parts of a landing . It 's basically not too much harder that tracking your car down the middle of the lane . Student pilots ( and experienced pilots ) tend to have much more trouble maintaining a safe and stable speed and \" glidepath \" down to the runway . Where things get tricky is when you have a crosswind . Pilots will line up with the runway in a \" crab angle . \" In this case , the nose of the plane is pointed slightly into the wind and the aircraft track slightly sideways towards the runway . It 's like a boat going across a river . In order to go directly across , you have to point the bow slightly into the current so you do n't drift downstream . You do n't want to land sideways , so just before touchdown the pilot will point the nose straight down the runway with the rudder and then bank the wings slightly into the wind . This is called a \" sideslip \" and it ensure the plane will be pointed straight down the runway while the bank angle of the wings prevents the plane from drifting downwind . The upwind wheel will often touch before the downwind wheel . Here 's more info .... URL_1 Most of the time pilots are landing using visual references out the cockpit window and flying by hand , even passenger jets at major airports . This is called a visual approach . It sounds kinda crude , but air traffic controllers at big airports prefer them because they can usually get more planes lined up for a runway at once , thereby increasing an airport 's capacity . But what if you ca n't see the runway ? Most runways at big airports are equipped with an Instrument Landing System ( ILS ) . Basically , the pilot follows a radio signal through the clouds / fog / rain / snow down to the runway . The goal is to break out of the clouds or get close enough to the runway that you can see it and land on it . A basic ILS approach will get you down to 200 ft and 1/2mi from the runway before you have to go around and land somewhere else . Some airports are equipped with CATIII ILS approaches where you can land at almost zero visibility . URL_0 These days , GPS based approaches are becoming increasingly popular because you can create curved approach paths and the airport does n't have to invest in a ground - based radio signal system . As for autopilot ... it 's very rarely used all the way down to the ground . Normally the pilots will turn it off when they drop the landing gear and fly by hand . Sometimes they might use the autopilot to intercept an ILS but then turn it off once the runway is in sight . Fully automated landings are only done in very low visibility . They require so much extra button pushing to set up that it 's usually easier to hand fly the plane when conditions permit . * I should note that while I 'm a flight instructor , I 'm not an airline pilot and have n't flown any big jets .

{"text": "There's a couple issues to consider: When you sell your primary home, the IRS gives you a $500k exemption (married, filing jointly) on gain.  If you decide not to sell your current house now, and you subsequently fall outside the ownership/use tests, then you may owe taxes on any gains when you sell the house. Rather than being concerned about your net debt, you should be concerned about your monthly debt payments.  Generally speaking, you cannot have debt payments of more than 36% of your monthly income.  If you can secure a renter for your current property, then you may be able to reach this ratio for your next (third) property. Also, only 75% of your expected monthly rental income is considered for calculating your 36% number. (This is not an exhaustive list of risks you expose yourself to). The largest risk is if you or your spouse find yourself without income (e.g. lost job, accident/injury, no renter), then you may be hurting to make your monthly debt payments.   You will need to be confident that you can pay all your debts.  A good rule that I hear is having the ability to pay 6 months worth of debt.  This may not necessarily mean having 6 months worth of cash on hand, but access to that money through personal lines of credit, borrowing against assets, selling stocks/investments, etc. You also want to make sure that your insurance policies fully cover you in the event that a tenant sues you, damages property, etc.  You also don't want to face a situation where you are sued because of discrimination.

{"text": "Meta learning\nis a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. As of 2017 the term had not found a standard interpretation, however the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.\nFlexibility is important because each learning algorithm is based on a set of assumptions about the data, its inductive bias. This means that it will only learn well if the bias matches the learning problem. A learning algorithm may perform very well in one domain, but not on the next. This poses strong restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques, since the relationship between the learning problem (often some kind of database) and the effectiveness of different learning algorithms is not yet understood.\nBy using different kinds of metadata, like properties of the learning problem, algorithm properties (like performance measures), or patterns previously derived from the data, it is possible to learn, select, alter or combine different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given learning problem. Critiques of meta learning approaches bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic, a possibly related problem. A good analogy to meta-learning, and the inspiration for J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber's early work (1987) and Yoshua Bengio et al.'s work (1991), considers that genetic evolution learns the learning procedure encoded in genes and executed in each individual's brain. In an open-ended hierarchical meta learning system using genetic programming, better evolutionary methods can be learned by meta evolution, which itself can be improved by meta meta evolution, etc.\nSee also Ensemble learning.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "The Terminator is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\nCameron stated he devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to Conan the Destroyer (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Aliens (1986). The film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.\nDefying low pre-release expectations, The Terminator topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, The Terminator was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "These systems are so useful , that many governments do n't want to be restricted to something that is controlled by a foreign government . For example , GPS is a military system run by the US Navy . They could , if they wanted to , shut it off or degrade it . The Russians were n't happy with relying on a US military system , given that there is a lot of disagreement between Russia and America , so they built their own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe , the EU government were concerned that they were relying on a foreign military system for a lot of commercial and government work . They were also annoyed that GPS only made a crude signal available for the public and law enforcement , but the military got a much higher precision signal . So , the EU government decided to build their own system ( Galileo ) which would give an improved accuracy free public signal , and a premium signal ( with paid subscription ) which would give the same accuracy as the GPS military signal . It would also be optimized for use in Europe . GPS satellites do n't really orbit over the Arctic region , so GPS reception in places like North Norway or Northern Sweden is not very reliable . The Galileo satellites are intended to go into orbits which go much further North , but the disadvantage is that you need more satellites to cover the increased amount of land . Same sort of thing with IRNSS ( India ) and BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all these systems you broadly the same technology but on slightly different frequencies . This means your receiver needs to have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the different systems . Dual system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been available for a while - they were n't terribly popular initially because the GLONASS system has been very unreliable with satellites dying or malfunctioning and not being replaced . However , the Russians have repaired and updated their GLONASS satellites , and it 's now a good quality modern system , so most latest generation GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS signal as well . One of the advantages of a receiver which supports both systems is that it is possible to get a more accurate position because you can combine the measurements from both systems when the receiver does the final position calculation . The Galileo system is n't complete , in fact , it is n't really functional , as it does n't have enough satellites to work 24/7 . However , many new GPS receivers are \" Galileo ready \" which means that they have the antenna and circuits in place , but the firmware to process the signals has n't been finalized .

{"text": "If you're into math, do this thought experiment: Consider the outcome X of a random walk process (a stock doesn't behave this way, but for understanding the question you asked, this is useful): On the first day, X=some integer X1. On each subsequent day, X goes up or down by 1 with probability 1/2. Let's think of buying a call option on X. A European option with a strike price of S that expires on day N, if held until that day and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y = min(X[N]-S, 0). This has an expected value E[Y] that you could actually calculate. (should be related to the binomial distribution, but my probability & statistics hat isn't working too well today) The market value V[k] of that option on day #k, where 1 < k < N, should be V[k] = E[Y]|X[k], which you can also actually calculate. On day #N, V[N] = Y. (the value is known) An American option, if held until day #k and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y[k] = min(X[k]-S, 0).  For the moment, forget about selling the option on the market. (so, the choices are either exercise it on some day #k, or letting it expire) Let's say it's day k=N-1.  If X[N-1] >= S+1 (in the money), then you have two choices: exercise today, or exercise tomorrow if profitable. The expected value is the same. (Both are equal to X[N-1]-S). So you might as well exercise it and make use of your money elsewhere. If X[N-1] <= S-1 (out of the money), the expected value is 0, whether you exercise today, when you know it's worthless, or if you wait until tomorrow, when the best case is if X[N-1]=S-1 and X[N] goes up to S, so the option is still worthless. But if X[N-1] = S (at the money), here's where it gets interesting. If you exercise today, it's worth 0. If wait until tomorrow, there's a 1/2 chance it's worth 0 (X[N]=S-1), and a 1/2 chance it's worth 1 (X[N]=S+1). Aha! So the expected value is 1/2. Therefore you should wait until tomorrow. Now let's say it's day k=N-2.  Similar situation, but more choices: If X[N-2] >= S+2, you can either sell it today, in which case you know the value = X[N-2]-S, or you can wait until tomorrow, when the expected value is also X[N-2]-S. Again, you might as well exercise it now. If X[N-2] <= S-2, you know the option is worthless. If X[N-2] = S-1, it's worth 0 today, whereas if you wait until tomorrow, it's either worth an expected value of 1/2 if it goes up (X[N-1]=S), or 0 if it goes down, for a net expected value of 1/4, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S, it's worth 0 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up, or 0 if it goes down -> net expected value of 1/2, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S+1, it's worth 1 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up, or 1/2 if it goes down (X[N-1]=S) -> net expected value of 1.25, so you should wait. If it's day k=N-3, and X[N-3] >= S+3 then E[Y] = X[N-3]-S and you should exercise it now; or if X[N-3] <= S-3 then E[Y]=0.  But if X[N-3] = S+2 then there's an expected value E[Y] of (3+1.25)/2 = 2.125 if you wait until tomorrow, vs. exercising it now with a value of 2; if X[N-3] = S+1 then E[Y] = (2+0.5)/2 = 1.25, vs. exercise value of 1; if X[N-3] = S then E[Y] = (1+0.5)/2 = 0.75 vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-1 then E[Y] = (0.5 + 0)/2 = 0.25, vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-2 then E[Y] = (0.25 + 0)/2 = 0.125, vs. exercise value of 0. (In all 5 cases, wait until tomorrow.) You can keep this up; the recursion formula is E[Y]|X[k]=S+d = {(E[Y]|X[k+1]=S+d+1)/2 + (E[Y]|X[k+1]=S+d-1) for N-k > d > -(N-k), when you should wait and see} or {0 for d <= -(N-k), when it doesn't matter and the option is worthless} or {d for d >= N-k, when you should exercise the option now}. The market value of the option on day #k should be the same as the expected value to someone who can either exercise it or wait. It should be possible to show that the expected value of an American option on X is greater than the expected value of a European option on X. The intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money, the option should be exercised early  (or sold), something a European option doesn't allow, whereas if it is nearly at the money, the option should be held, whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money, the option is definitely worthless. As far as real securities go, they're not random walks (or at least, the probabilities are time-varying and more complex), but there should be analogous situations. And if there's ever a high probability a stock will go down, it's time to exercise/sell an in-the-money American option, whereas you can't do that with a European option. edit: ...what do you know: the computation I gave above for the random walk isn't too different conceptually from the Binomial options pricing model.", "label": "hc3human"}

An idea to avoid the whole problem in the first place: Get a copy of your credit report yourself and take a copy with you to meet the landlord. If they want an application fee, ask why they need it making it clear you know the above law. If they say for a credit report offer to give them a copy in lieu of the fee.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Even though this isn't really personal finance related I still feel like there are some misconceptions here that could be addressed. I don't know where you got the phrase \"pass-through\" insurance from.  What you're describing is a self-funded plan.  In a self-funded arrangement an employer contracts a third-party-administrator (TPA), usually one of the big health insurance carriers, to use it's provider network, process and adjudicate claims, etc.  In addition to the TPA there will be some sort of stop-loss insurance coverage on each participant.  Stop-loss coverage usually provides a maximum amount of risk on a given member and on the entire population for a given month and/or year and/or lifetime.  The employer's risk is in between the plan deductible and the stop loss coverage (assuming the stop-loss doesn't have a maximum). Almost all of the claim dollars in a given plan will come from very very few people.  These costs typically arise out of very unforeseen diagnoses not chronic issues.  A cancer patient can easily cost $1,000,000 in a year.  Someone's diabetes maintenance medicine or other chronic maintenance will cost no where near what a botched surgery will in a year. If we take a step back there are really four categories of employer insurance. Small group is tightly regulated.  Usually plan premiums are filed with a state authority, there is no negotiating, your group's underwriting performance has zero impact on your premiums.   Employers have no way of obtaining any medical/claim information on employees. Mid-market is a pooled arrangement.  The overall pool has a total increase, and your particular group performs better or worse than the pool which may impact premiums.  Employers get very minor claims data, things like the few highest claims, or number of claims over a certain threshold, but no employee specific information. Large-group is a mostly unpooled arrangement.  Generally your group receives it's own rating based on its individual underwriting performance.  In general the carrier is offloading some risk to a stop-loss carrier and employer's get a fair amount of insight in to claims, though again, not with employee names. Self-funded is obviously self-contained.  The employer sets up a claims checking account.  The TPA has draft authority on the account.  The employee's typically have no idea the plan is self funded, their ID cards will have the carrier logo, and the carrier deals with them just as it would any other member.  Generally when a company is this size it has a separate benefits committee, those few people will have some level of insight in to claims performance and stop-loss activity.  This committee will have nothing to do with the hiring process. There are some new partially self-funded arrangements, which is just a really low-threshold  (and relatively expensive) stop-loss program, that's becoming somewhat popular in the mid-market group size as employers attempt to reduce medical spend.   I think when you start thinking on a micro, single employee level, you really lose sight of the big picture.  Why would an employer hire this guy who has this disease/chronic problem that costs $50,000 per year?  And logically you can get to the conclusion that with a self-funded plan it literally costs the company the money so the company has an incentive not to hire the person.  I understand the logic of the argument, but at the self funded level the plan is typically costing north of half a million dollars each month.  So a mid-level HR hiring manager 1. isn't aware of specific plan claims or costs and is not part of the benefits executive committee, 2. won't be instructed to screen for health deficiencies because it's against the law, 3. a company generally won't test the water here because $50,000 per year is less than 1% of the company's annual medical expenses, 4. $50,000 is well below the cost to litigate a discrimination law-suit.    Really the flaw in your thought process is that $50,000 in annual medical expense is a lot.  A harsh child-birth can run in the $250,000 range, so these companies never hire women?  Or never hire men who could add a spouse who's in child bearing years?  Or never hire women who might have a female spouse who could be in child bearing years?  A leukemia diagnosis will ratchet up $1,000,000 in a year.  Spend a bit of time in intensive care for $25,000 per day and you're fired?  A few thousand bucks on diabetes meds isn't anything relative to the annual cost of your average self-funded plan. The second flaw is that the hiring managers get insight in to specific claims.  They don't. Third, you don't hand over medical records on your resume anyway. I typed this out in one single draft and have no intention of editing anything.  I just wanted paint a broad picture, I'm sure things can be nit-picked or focused on.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "First up , it 's not having an unusually hard time getting out of recession . These things take a lot of time to correct themselves . Nevertheless , Greece has some especially hard challenges , specifically Europe and Greece . First , Europe . The system should work like this : - when economic activity drops , a government automatically finds its tax base shrinking and its expenditures rising ( due to increased welfare , business assisstance etc . ) - this results in the government increasing its debt . ( Governments must always have debt to maintain liquidity in the credit market , but that 's another story ) - as economic activity drops and unemployment increases , so domestic production also drops . This causes imports to rise . - in turn this puts downward pressure on the value of the currency . Which acts to make imports more expensive . This is the start of the turnaround . - the lower exchange rate assists exporters to be more competitive with other countries . This means exports rise . - as exports rise domestic production goes up and unemployment goes down . - government expenditure drops and tax receipts go up . Also a decent amount of foreign ( high value ) money from exports finds its way to government . - this high value foreign money can be used to rapidly pay off government debt that was issued in the low value domestic money , and has dropped with the exchange rate . - as the debt is reduced , the exchange rate begins to rise and the economy starts to stabilise . However , in Europe the currency ( the Euro ) ca n't devalue unless the whole continent is in equally bad shape ( Which they are not ) . So the key event that triggers a recovery never occurs . As an alternative , Europe puts pressure on members who are in trouble to cut taxes and spending , in the hope that lower taxes increase the money supply , which is supposed to drive domestic demand and create recovery that way . But it often does n't work . That 's because a lot of spending in a downturn i d 's focused on keeping marginal players in the game earning money and paying tax . Cutting spending wipes these people out , reducing the tax base further and damaging the businesses they spend money at . This often means that the benefits of austerity are swallowed up I the extra damage it does . What would work is transferring money from parts of Europe that are doing well and spending it to support the marginal players in markets that are n't doing so well . This is largely how a country like the US stabilises state economies that ca n't trigger recovery by devaluing the currency . The second problem is Greece itself . As a former socialist state , the number of people avoiding tax but collecting welfare ( while working ) is very large , so whatever recovery might be possible , the culture of handouts and tax cheats makes it all that much harder", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Both of these terms do refer to your profit; they're just different ways of evaluating it. First, your definition of capitalization rate is flipped.  As explained here, it should be: On the other hand, as explained here: So cap rate is like a reverse unit cost approach to comparing two investments.  If house A costs $1M and you'll make $50K (profit) from it yearly, and house B costs $1.33M and you'll make $65K (profit) from it yearly, then you can compute cap rates to see that A is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amount-of-money-you-have-stuck-in-this-investment-and-unavailable-for-use-elsewhere. Profit margin, on the other hand, cares more about your ongoing expenses than about your total investment.  If it costs less to maintain property B than it does to maintain property A, then you could have something like: So B is a more efficient investment from the point of view of the fraction of your revenue you actually get to keep each year. Certainly you could think of the property's value as an opportunity cost and factor that into the net profit margin equation to get a more robust estimate of exactly how efficient your investment is.

The layers then act as feature detectors. After this learning step, a DBN can be further trained with supervision to perform classification.\nDBNs can be viewed as a composition of simple, unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or autoencoders, where each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next. An RBM is an undirected, generative energy-based model with a \"visible\" input layer and a hidden layer and connections between but not within layers. This composition leads to a fast, layer-by-layer unsupervised training procedure, where contrastive divergence is applied to each sub-network in turn, starting from the \"lowest\" pair of layers (the lowest visible layer is a training set).\nThe observation that DBNs can be trained greedily, one layer at a time, led to one of the first effective deep learning algorithms.:\u200a6\u200a Overall, there are many attractive implementations and uses of DBNs in real-life applications and scenarios (e.g., electroencephalography, drug discovery).", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Any sensible lender will require a lean lien against your formerly-free-and-clear property, and will likely require an appraisal of the property. The lender is free to reject the deal if the house is in any way not fitting their underwriting requirements; examples of such situations would be if the house is in a flood/emergency zone, in a declining area, an unusual property (and therefore hard to compare to other properties), not in salable condition (so even if they foreclose on it they'd have a questionable ability to get their money back), and so forth. Some lenders won't accept mobile homes (manufactured housing) as collateral, for instance, and also if the lender agrees they may also require insurance on the property to be maintained so they can ensure that a terrible fate doesn't befall both properties at one time (as happens occasionally). On the downside, in my experience (in the US) lenders will often require a lower loan percentage than a comparable cash down deal. An example I encountered was that the lender would happily provide 90% loan-to-value if a cash down payment was provided, but would not go above 75% LTV if real estate was provided instead. These sort of deals are especially common in cases of new construction, where people often own the land outright and want to use it as collateral for the building of a home on that same land, but it's not uncommon in any case (just less common than cash down deals). Depending on where you live and where you want to buy vs where the property you already own is located, I'd suggest just directly talking to where you want to first consider getting a quote for financing. This is not an especially exotic transaction, so the loan officer should be able to direct you if they accept such deals and what their conditions are for such arrangements. On the upside, many lenders still treat the LTV% to calculate their rate quote the same no matter where the \"down payment\" is coming from, with the lower the LTV the lower the interest rate they'll be willing to quote. Some lenders might not, and some might require extra closing fees - you may need to shop around. You might also want to get a comparative quote on getting a direct mortgage on the old property and putting the cash as down payment on the new property, thus keeping the two properties legally separate and giving you some \"walk away\" options that aren't possible otherwise.  I'd advise you to talk with your lenders directly and shop around a few places and see how the two alternatives compare. They might be similar, or one might be a hugely better deal!

These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. \"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" or \"O\", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. \"large\", \"medium\" or \"small\"), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Other classifiers work by comparing observations to previous observations by means of a similarity or distance function.\nAn algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier.  The term \"classifier\" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.\nTerminology across fields is quite varied. In statistics, where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of observations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables, regressors, etc.), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes, which are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable.  In machine learning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory variables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible categories to be predicted are classes.  Other fields may use different terminology: e.g. in community ecology, the term \"classification\" normally refers to cluster analysis.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The simplest microprocessor needs three things : a place to store some data ( memory ) ; a set of instructions to carry out on data ; and a working area in which to carry out the instructions . That 's it . * * data * * Data is always represented as a number . So even letters and instructions are numbers but we store some other data elsewhere that let 's the computer know ( I use this term loosely ) what letter or instruction is represented by a number by keeping them in a table somewhere else . All numbers in a computer are represented in binary . Binary is the series of ones and zeros you 've likely seen before . 01101001 . We do n't need a table to look up what these numbers mean because you can use maths to transfer from one to the other ( separate ELI5 question : how does binary work ) . We use binary because most microprocessors represent ones and zeros using a change in electrical voltage . Plus 5 volts and 0 volts are common but you can use any two voltages provided your equipment can tell the difference between the two . Each electrical voltage reading is called a bit . All of the data in the microprocessor is stored as electrical voltages in groups of 8 bits called a byte . More complex microprocessors deal with longer sets of bytes but for this example we 'll just use 8 bits , 1 byte . * * program in memory * * A program is read into memory and stored there . You can think of the program as a tape with a series of instructions on it and in between all of the instructions is some data . You start at one end of the tape and work to the other end unless an instruction on the tape tells you to jump forward or backwards along the tape . The tape can refer to memory locations . There 's lots of different memory locations in modern processors but all you need to know is that we can address them individually . * * instructions * * The simplest set of instructions would be the standard mathematical operators ( like add , subtract , divide and multiply ) and some instructions to jump to a particular part of the tape after some condition is met . * * example * * We write a program to subtract 1 from 10 until the value reaches 0 . In practice something like this can be used as a counter for another instruction being carried out 10 times . The language I am using here is a reduced assembly language from a computer game called TIS-100 . It 's a great way to learn how a processor works . It might be a bit advanced for your seven year old but if she seems to get the basic concepts it 's worth trying the game with her . I 'm pretty sure I started writing assembly about that age , I was certainly programming by then . ACC is the \" * * working area * * \" we talked about before . This is the tape MOV 10 ACC ( put the value 10 in the working area ) LOOP1 : ( this can be called anything but it 's a name used to jump in the code ) SUB 1 ( subtract 1 from the current value in ACC ) JNZ LOOP1 ( if the current value of ACC is not zero go back to loop otherwise do the next instruction ) * Next instruction * end of the tape . In memory it looks like this:(numbers down the side show moving forward in time ) ACC contents 00 : 00001010 ( number 10 ) 01 : 00001001 ( number 9 ) 02 : 00001000 ( number 8) 03 : 00000111 ( number 7 ) 04 : 00000110 ( number 6 ) 05 : 00000101 ( number 5 ) 06 : 00000100 ( number 4 ) 07 : 00000011 ( number 3 ) 08 : 00000010 ( number 2 ) 09 : 00000001 ( number 1 ) 10 : 00000000 ( number 0 ) And that 's it .

{"text": "Self-determination theory (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation and personality that concerns people's innate growth tendencies and innate psychological needs. It pertains to the motivation behind people's choices in the absence of external influences and distractions. SDT focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.\nIn the 1970s, research on SDT evolved from studies comparing intrinsic and extrinsic motives, and from growing understanding of the dominant role that intrinsic motivation played in individual behavior. It was not until the mid-1980s Edward L. Deci and Richard Ryan wrote a book titled \"Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation in Human Behavior\" that SDT was formally introduced and accepted as a sound empirical theory. Since the 2000s, research into practical applications of SDT has increased significantly.\nThe key research that led to the emergence of SDT included research on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity because it is interesting and satisfying in itself to do so, as opposed to doing an activity for the purpose of obtaining an external goal (extrinsic motivation). A taxonomy of motivations has been described based on the degree to which they are internalized. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external.\nEdward Deci and Richard Ryan later expanded on the early work differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and proposed three main intrinsic needs involved in self-determination.[10] According to Deci and Ryan, three basic psychological needs motivate self-initiated behavior and specify essential nutrients for individual psychological health and well-being. These needs are said to be the universal and innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Mass is basically a measure of how much ' stuff ' an object has . It does n't matter whether it 's on earth or in space or on the moon , an object always has the same amount of ' stuff ' in it so it always has the same mass . That means it does n't matter where you are , your mass in kilograms is the same . Weight is how much force gravity pulls you down with . This matters where you are , your weight on earth is n't the same as your weight in the moon . Your weight in pounds matters where you are . In fact , it can even go up or down in an elevator when it starts or stops moving . Now weight arises from mass . Gravity pulls mass down , which creates weight . While the strength of gravity may change and so will an objects weight , an object with more mass on any planet will always weigh more than one with less mass . In fixed gravity , the weight is directly proportional to mass . Twice the mass is twice the weight . Now on earth , the easiest way to measure both mass and weight is a scale . The scale measures force , so that can easily tell you your weight in pounds ( or Newtons in metric , though rarely used to describe a human ) . But since earth 's gravity is a constant , and your weight depends on your mass , you can just as easily find mass using it and display kilograms ( or the imperial units for mass called slugs ) . Now if you were to take this earth scale to the moon and stand on it , it would still tell you your correct weight in pounds . It would be less than on earth , but it would still be correct . Your mass in kilograms however would be wrong , the scale was calibrated based on a earth gravity to convert a force into a mass . You would have recalibrate the scale to tell you your correct mass on the moon . Now as I said , the imperial system has a unit for mass called a slug . Though to make it more confusing , it sometimes also uses pound - mass as a unit for mass . A pound mass being the mass that has the weight if a pound on earth . A slug is not the same value as a pound - mass though .", "label": "hc3human"}

With used cars you usually don't know how much they have invested in the car, so it's more difficult to know how low they're willing to go. Regardless, I do think it's odd that they would knock 2K off the price if you finance with them, but not if you pay cash. The only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2K in interest over the life of the loan, but they have no way of guaranteeing you won't refi. Therefore, I suspect they are bluffing and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check (or put the cash on the table) for 2K less. However, if they won't budge and will only knock off 2K if you finance, you could finance and pay it off in full a week later.

{"text": "You 're asking two different questions here . I 'll try to deal with them both : > How can someone produce a new programming language for programmers to use ? Someone produces a new programming language simply by dreaming it up . If a programmer wakes up one day and says \" The tools available to me suck . I want something better \" , he can design his own language if he 's so inclined . It 's a hell of a lot of work , as there are a * * lot * * of things most modern programming languages can do and you 've got to cover them all if you want your language to go anywhere . You also need to ask yourself some questions : * Interpreted or Compiled ? Interpreted languages look at the written code and run each instruction as it parses it . Compiled languages take all the code and convert it into [ Assembly ] ( URL_0 ) , which is another language , albeit a very very low - level one . As has already been pointed out on this thread , Java is halfway in between . Compiled languages are usually faster , but also less * portable * - That is to say a program compiled for Windows wo n't work in UNIX . Interpreted language usually work wherever they go . * What environment will it run in ? If you 're writing a language for Windows to run , that 's one thing . If you 're writing it for UNIX to run that 's another . It can also run inside a browser , which comes with other complications , like security , which has to be much tighter than in a locally run application . There are advantages though , since that means your language would n't need to * * do * * as many different things . After you 've decided on that , you 'll need to build either an interpreter or a compiler . An interpreter is a program that reads the written language and executes the instructions in the code line by line . A compiler is a program that reads the written code and converts it into assembly that 's written into a compiled file . For Windows the obvious example is a .EXE file . For UNIX there 's no magic file extention . Instead there 's a flag that 's set in the properties of the file that flags it as executable . > How do Operating Systems for different platforms recognise the new language ? For compiled files it 's easy . OS 's have their rules for what files are executable . You compile your code into the executable file that follows the rules the OS laid down . The * language * used to produce that file is totally irrelevant . Windows does n't care if the .EXE file was originally written in C , C++ , C # , Java , J++ , Delphi , VB , or a half - dozen other languages I have n't thought of off the top of my head . For interpreted languages it 's only slightly more complicated . The OS designates a \" handler \" program that deals with certain types of files . So if you find a .py file , Windows knows to open it with the Python interpreter , because when the Python environment was installed , it * registered itself * as the program to call upon when encountering .py files . Likewise for Perl files , etc ... For UNIX I 'm not sure if there is that function , but you can always explicitly call in the shell the interpreter , so you tell the operating system to run the interpreter , using the filename of your perl or python program as an argument to the program . There might be that \" official handler \" function baked into UNIX , I 'm just not sure . Or maybe it only gets provided by XWindows or other GUI front ends . It 's also important to keep in mind , you do n't ever really see the Operating System . You think you 're dealing with the OS when you 're in a command prompt ( or , in UNIX , the shell ? ) Hell no . You 're dealing with an abstraction that gives you a command - line interface . There are still half a dozen layers between you and the OS . The shit that happens at the OS level is ridiculously esoteric - Taking values located at register 6655321 and moving them to register 6655322 , toggling a bit here or a bit there , looking at the value of one bit and branching to another segment of instructinos based on whether that 's a one or a zero , etc ... What you call the command line or the shell is merely a live interpreter of a limited programming language . For Windows it 's the language of batch files . For UNIX there are several options , like the Bourne shell , the C shell , the Korn shell , and hundreds of others , all with various levels of compatibility with each other . If your script is compatible with one of those shells you can just run it * from that shell * , and boom , it 's recognized . There 's an old rule , that really is n't relevant today in the age of Perl and Python , and other specialized languages like Javascript ( browser - only ) or Ruby ( web - server - only ) , but back in the day , if you wanted to know if you had an * orthogonal and complete * language you had to be able to use that language to write a compiler * for the language * ! So if you invented a language , call it D , ( comes after C ) , and your compiler was complete , you 'd write your * * next * * D compiler entirely in D.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Your impression about banks and bankers is very wrong.  Wall street banks can and often do lose in transactions.  In fact, banks go bankrupt and/or require massive bailouts to survive because they sometimes lose a ton of money.  The business of investment banking often involves bearing risk for customers, which, by definition, means they lose some of the time.  Generally the risks they take on individual transactions are not large enough to bring the whole bank down, but sometimes they are.  Banking is a job like any other, except that it has more risk than most. Anyway, to your point, how do underwriters make money on shares that fall in value before the sale?  On the commission.  The issuing company will normally pay the investment bank a percentage of the funds raised in the offering, regardless of the price.  Of course, it's possible for the bank to still lose money if their contract stipulates a minimum price and they are not able to meet it.  In that case, the bank may lose on that offering, contradicting your preconceived notion. By the way, one other question implicit in your post: Why was the secondary offering considered bad news?  If the CEO and other insiders have private information that indicates that the stock is overvalued, then doing a secondary offering at the inflated price will greatly enrich them.  Because this happens some times, investors are wary about secondary offerings.  This makes companies that would otherwise do a secondary offering shy away from it, even if shares are not overpriced.  Therefore if a company is doing a secondary offering, the market is likely to worry that the stock is overvalued even at a reduced price.", "label": "hc3human"}

Here 's an example : > Tommy was not a bad boy . What this means on the surface is that Tommy was n't a bad boy . But saying he was NOT a BAD boy is very different to saying that he WAS a GOOD boy . Just by saying that he is n't bad , we get the suggestion that he might at some point do something bad , even though he might not be in general a bad boy . In the end , the author 's choice of language has given us completely the opposite impression to the surface meaning of his words . Obviously this is a simple example . In fact , if a writer started a story with the line ' Tommy was not a bad boy ' he 'd probably want us to think that in the course of this story Tommy will do some very questionable things . But in a longer piece , picking out the opposite meanings of words can completely undermine what the writer wants to say . The point of deconstruction is to show that words are so full with meanings that it 's almost impossible to know that when I say ' fast ' and mean quick - moving , you could be thinking the complete opposite .

{"text": "The really like your five version : Your cars engine runs by mixing air and gasoline in a special chamber called a cylinder . And that 's really what it is , a hollow cylinder drilled out inside the main chunk of metal that is the engine . This chunk of metal is called the engine block . The number of cylinders in a given block varies , as well as how they are layed out . So when you hear someone say a V6 they mean the engine has 6 cylinders , and they are in a [ V - shape ] ( URL_0 ) . Inside the cylinder , there is a piston that slides up and down , and a set of valves . The piston fits very tightly in the cylinder and does n't let any air get by it . So , everything that goes into or out of the cylinder has to go through the valves . As the cylinder moves down , it pulls in air and fuel . Then the valves close , and the piston moves up . This squeezes the fuel and air mixture , which is ignited when the piston reaches the top of the cylinder . This burning of the fuel - air mixture pushes the piston back down with a lot of force . Then , once it reaches the bottom , a valve opens and the piston moves up , pushing the burnt fuel and air out of the cylinder . This is called a [ 4 - stroke cycle ] ( URL_1 ) . Now , if you 're still with me , we get to the turbo . When the burnt fuel and air ( exhaust ) comes out of the cylinder , it still has some force behind it . You can make it do stuff . So , the exhaust is sent through a special fan called a turbine . This turbine spins very fast as the exhaust flows through it , 10 - 15 thousand times a minute . Now , this exhaust turbine is connected to a * * second fan * * . This fan blows * * * back into the cylinder * * * . This means that it is forcing more air into the cylinder as the piston drops . And with more air , you can add more fuel . Then , when the valves close and the piston starts upwards again , it is compressing more air and fuel then normal . This gives you more push , or power , out of the cylinder than normal . The amount of extra air in a cylinder is called \" boost \" and is measured in pounds per square inch , or psi . This is the same type of measure for your car or bicycle tires . So , if someone is running a 7psi boost , it is like pre - inflating each cylinder before the start of each engine cycle .

{"text": "In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. \nThe pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.   Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.\nAs an example, ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.  One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.\nThis algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "[ warning : a random french guy on the internet 's opinion ] The euro arrived in the late 90s / early 2000s . This is a rather terrible period for most rich ( and even less rich ) countries of europe : globalization killing our industries , oil prices going higher each day ( except right now ) , and lots of other bad things . As well as in the US , the economic situation has grown more and more depressing . The symptoms are showing stronger and stronger ( particularly since 2005/2006 , but there was some shit going on earlier , in the 80s/90s too ) . Hence , there is a strong correlation between the arrival of the euro and the arrival of the troubles in economy , which leads many people to feel like the euro is responsible for it . ( which , in some cases , may be true , too , but the euro has done nothing for a against world - scale social and politics issues ) Moreover , at least in France , the switch from francs ( the french currency before the euro ) and the euro kind of froze the prices in francs in the minds of people . They still remember : before the switch , a baguette cost 3 francs , a journal 3 francs , etc . ( and tend to idealize those prices sometimes ) In the meanwhile , the prices of common goods in euro have risen up due to the normal inflation . And it has been 15 years since then , so a 30 - 40 % rise in prices should be normal due to inflation . And it should be progressive , too , people mostly do n't notice inflation . But this \" freezing \" of the prices in francs in the mind of people makes them realize that the prices have risen , and they do n't get that it 's normal inflation . Then they go on and whine about the higher inflation the euro has caused while it has indeed toned down inflation in comparison to the situation at the time of the francs . Something that may worsen this is the fact that many not - so - common goods have appeared and are growing cheaper and cheaper . Everything electronic does generally not really follow inflation , computers , smartphones , PMPs , do cost lesser and lesser money , so people are more used to the prices going down where this is just an anomaly . Another factor ( quite ironically ) is the feeling of the loss of control over your money . Before , if France wanted , France could just print some more francs and devaluate its currency to fight economical shocks . Even though people know it , they mostly do n't instinctively relate it to a rise of the prices , so they regret we can not just do that and get past the crisis . They rage about the state not being able to devaluate the currency , while they whine about the euro making prices go up . While there may be some legitimate debates about a negative influence of the Euro on the Euro - zone economy , I feel that the hate for the euro ( and therefore the Eurozone as it 's its main consequence on everyday life ) is mostly a sheer coincidence : times are hard and people need to blame this on someone , since many do not fully understand the real consequences of the birth of the Euro , they blame everything ( and more ! ) on it .

{"text": "Hebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:\nThe theory is often summarized as \"Cells that fire together wire together.\" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to \"take part in firing\" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.\nThe theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Most of the other answers are very bad . This one , I hope , will be clearer and more accurate . It was not long ago that there * was * , in fact , a single world currency ( with the exception of primitive peoples and a few that used silver ) . That currency was gold . Each country could , of course , coin gold into whatever denominations it chose , but the value of these coins was determined essentially by the * weight * of the gold in the coin . No country , obviously , had the ability to print as much gold as it chose . But the gold standard was abandoned , for reasons irrelevant to this topic ( although I must say I believe they were bad reasons ) . It was replaced by what is called * fiat money * : that is , currency that can not be redeemed for any metal or other object , but constitutes final payment in and of itself . All that means is : if you owe someone $ 500 , he can not demand that you pay it in gold or silver or chickens or whatever . Dollars are * legal tender * that he must accept to settle the debt . But fiat money 's value depends on one ( essential ) thing : the amount of it that the issuing government chooses to print . Just imagine that everyone in the country were legally allowed to print as many dollars as he chose . What would happen to their value ? Dollars would become worthless : why would you spend eight hours a day working for them if you could print them instead ? The same thing would happen if the government decided to cancel all taxes and just print as much money as it felt like . There would be so many dollars that the value of each one would be too small to use , and it would get smaller every day . So if we were to adopt a single world currency , and it were to be a fiat currency , there would have to be some single organization in charge of printing the money , to decide how much is printed . But for essentially the same reason that we do not have a single world government , i.e. the lack of agreement between peoples about what policies it would pursue , this would be virtually impossible in the foreseeable future . The Euro 's current problems illustrate what is wrong with trying to create a single world fiat currency . The basic reason why governments like fiat currency is that it allows them to pay debts by printing more money instead of raising taxes ( or borrowing , which is obviously only a short - term solution because you have to pay it back with interest ) . But some countries have more debts than others . In fact , some have so many debts that they would have to raise taxes to ridiculous levels , or else eliminate all other functions of government , in order to pay back the debts . But if they can pay back the debts with printed money , they are able to cheat the creditors without officially defaulting . So Greece , for example , would love to be able to print lots of Euros to pay its debts . But they ca n't ! Only the European Central Bank can print more Euros , and this amount must be voted on by all members of the EU . And countries like Germany certainly do not want the value of their money to drop like a stone by inflating it to pay Greek debts . So they have demanded that these countries with lots of debts either find a way to pay them legitimately or leave the EU . Essentially , then , it is impossible to have a single fiat currency across the entire world unless fiscal policy ( how much the government taxes and spends ) is coordinated , at least to some degree , across the entire world . Since the second is not going to happen , the first is n't , either .", "label": "hc3human"}

How much capital would you need to get started?  Are there things you can do now on a part-time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business?

Then you have a figure. e.g. Assume you need $20,000, and you find a fund that has done 8% over the past 20 years.  Then, you would need to save about $110/month to be ready to go in 10 years, or $273/month to go in about 5 years.  (It's a time value of money calculation.)

Bank of America's virtual cards work like this: The virtual card number is different from your actual card number, so the merchant never sees your real card number. In fact, the merchant cannot even tell that you are using a virtual card. You can set the maximum amount to be charged. You can set the expiration date from 2 to 12 months. Once the merchant has made a charge on that virtual card, only THAT MERCHANT can make any further charges on that same virtual card. It is not possible to discover the real card number from the virtual card number. So the result is that your risk is reduced to the merchant not delivering the order, or charging too much (but not over the limit you set). There is nothing to be stolen since your real info never goes over the internet, and once a merchant has used the virtual card once, no other merchant can use it.

{"text": "William Henry Gates III  (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.\nGates was born and raised in Seattle. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company.[a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda established in 2000.[10] He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[11] In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.[12]\nSince 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to 2013.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6\u00a0billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9\u00a0billion at the time.[16] As of November 2022, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$107 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world.[17]\nLater in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued many business and philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment, bgC3, and TerraPower. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.[18] Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa.[19][20] In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[21]", "label": "hc3human"}

From there information can go into your working memory , which can last anywhere from a few minutes to around 30 minutes based on the information set .

First off , in order for information to even APPROACH encoding , your brain controller , called the central executive , must determine that the information is necessary for you to know , and thus you pay attention . Without the central executive your conscious senses would be BOMBARDED with information overload at all times . Sights , sounds , colors , feelings , that car went by , its going fast , bright lights , ooh pretty colors etc etc . The central executive filters all the information down to what it determines you need to know . This is called selective attention , and once you focus your attention on something it is now eligible for encoding to long term memory . As JackBurke24 mentioned , information has a far greater possibility to be encoded if you can tie it to something you already know . In developmental psych , this is called elaboration and it is a theory of learning . You see a red car , your central executive allocates attention to it and you think \" oh man , johnny has a car JUST like that \" . Later on , if you suddenly needed to remember what you saw that day , your memory will retrieve the information as \" I saw a red car just like johnny owns . \" Another theory of memory revolves around the idea of forced memory , as in , repeating a series of information to force it into your memory . Commonly known as memorization , or rote memory , these types of memories are not very stable and are subject to rapid decay . They are also reliant on what is called cue retrieval . Think of the memory like a ball , but the ball is behind a door . You have a series of keys . Once the right key gets in the lock and the door opens , boom , you have the ball ( the memory ) . There is also semantic memory , as in , a basic understanding of the knowledge of the world . Procedural memory is the memory that revolves around accomplishing a task in a particular order . This can also be referred to as muscle memory and is subject to the same cue retrieval that rote memory is . Episodic memories are tied to particular events . For instance , \" I remember this one time when johnny slipped and fell and broke his arm . Lets see ... this was at Suzy 's 12th birthday ... so I must have been 8 . \" Memory is a fascinating subject and there is always new science regarding it .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Yahoo's \"Adj Close\" data is adjusted for splits, but not for dividends. Despite Yahoo's webpage's footnote saying  *Close price adjusted for dividends and splits. we can see empirically that the \"Adj Close\" is only adjusted for splits. For example, consider Siemens from Jan 27, 2017 to Mar 15, 2017: The Adj Close adjusts for splits: On any particular day, the \"Adj Close\" is equal to the \"Close\" price divided by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day. If there have been no splits after that day, then the \"Adj Close\" equals the \"Close\" price. Since there is a 2-for-1 split on Mar 14, 2017, the Adj Close is half the Close price for all dates from Jan 27, 2017 to Mar 13, 2017. Note that if Siemens were to split again at some time in the future, the Adj Close prices will be readjusted for this future split. For example, if Siemens were to split 3-for-1 tomorrow, then all the Adj Close prices seen above will be divided by 3. The Adj Close is thus showing the price that a share would have traded on that day if the shares had already been split in accordance with all splits up to today. The Adj Close does not adjust for dividends: Notice that Siemens distributed a $1.87 dividend on Feb 02, 2017 and ~$3.74 dividend on Jan 30, 2017. If the Adj Close value were adjusted for these dividends then we should expect the Adj Close should no longer be exactly half of the Close amount. But we can see that there is no such adjustment -- the Adj Close remains (up to rounding) exactly half the Close amount: Note that in theory, the market reacts to the distribution of dividends by reducing the trading price of shares post-dividend. This in turn is reflected in the raw closing price. So in that sense the Adj Close is also automatically adjusted for dividends. But there is no formula for this. The effect is already baked in through the market's closing prices.", "label": "hc3human"}

Oh well , in case anyone 's interested . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Alright . The first thing to understand is that the IBM discovery is pretty cool . It 's not world - changing , though . IBM \u2019s discovery makes for good headlines , but quantum computing is still a long way off . The IBM guys are excited because they \u2019re a step closer to their goal , not because they \u2019ve reached it . They \u2019re trying to make a quantum computer . To understand why that \u2019s cool , you have to know what exactly a quantum computer does ( not a programmer , so excuse any errors ) . Normal computers operate using pieces of information . All information is either a one or a zero to a computer . There is no in - between . If some piece of information is not a zero , then it has to be a one . That \u2019s just the rule . Normal computers use ones and zeros , nothing else . A quantum computer , however , is special . To a quantum computer , a piece of information can be a one , a zero , or anything in between . There are lots and lots of ways the computer can hold the information . That is a totally amazing capability . Because quantum computers can understand more than ones and zeros , they become far more powerful than normal computers . A small quantum computer could hold a huge amount of information . To quote the reference article , a quantum computer \u201c can store more classical \u2018 bit \u2019 information than there are atoms in the Universe . \u201d That \u2019s a lot of information . Quantum computers would make today \u2019s normal computers look like a brick . The jump from normal to quantum would be like going from stones and spears to assault rifles . A lot of scientists want to invent a quantum computer . Whoever builds a working one will be really famous ( and really rich ) . The problem with building a quantum computer is that it \u2019s really hard . When the scientists put multiple parts of the quantum computer together , the parts interfere with each other . Instead of being able to handle tons of different information types , the parts revert back to using ones and zeros . Instead of being an awesome new quantum computer , it \u2019s just a boring normal one . IBM is working on the interference problem ( called decoherence ) . What they did is increase the amount of time before the parts of the quantum computer interfere with each other and break down . Basically , they made it run a little longer before breaking . Quantum computers are n\u2019t too reliable yet because of the interference thing . You do n\u2019t hear about them because they \u2019re not ready yet . However , the good news is that they are slowly getting better . In 1999 , the parts broke apart after 1 nanosecond . For perspective , that \u2019s 0.000000001 seconds . The IBM guys built a slightly better computer that breaks apart after 0.000095 seconds . A machine that breaks down in a fraction of a second does n\u2019t sound too helpful , but what IBM did is still a big deal . They made a quantum computer that lasts 10,000 times longer than the one from 1999 . When you look at it that way , the IBM machine is actually a good step forward . Will we see quantum computers soon ? In a word , no . Do n\u2019t hold your breath waiting . It \u2019s taken us ten years to make a machine that breaks down in 0.000095 seconds . But in future ? Anything \u2019s possible .

{"text": "There are two types of mass , which as far as we know turn out , for reasons unknown , to be exactly the same : - Gravitational mass is the quantity that determines how much gravity something has . According to general relativity , gravity is caused by objects trying to take the shortest possible path through spacetime : if their route through spacetime is bent , their path is altered , and we observe that as gravity . The more massive something is , the more it bends spacetime , and so the more gravity it exerts . Objects with no mass do n't bend spacetime , and so do n't gravitationally attract other objects ( although they can be attracted by objects with mass ) . ( edit - correction : objects with no rest mass still bend spacetime because they have energy ) - Inertial mass is the measure of how resistant an object is to acceleration . Heavier objects require more energy to accelerate to the same speed than a lighter object would . In a vacuum , massless objects travel at the speed of light without any force acting on them ( although it 's possible for objects with mass to travel faster than massless objects in certain mediums ) . There 's no known fundamental reason why these two masses end up being the same thing , as they 're two entirely different concepts . However , the fact that they are the same is one of the fundamental facts which general relativity relies on . Fundamentally , mass ( both gravitational and inertial ) comes from two places . First , via E = mc^2 , you have the mass resulting from the energy that binds the smaller particles together ( e.g , gluons binding quarks together in a proton ) . For constituent particles like protons , neutrons , or atoms , this is the source of the vast majority of mass . Second , you have the mass of a particle resulting from its interaction with the Higgs field . The Higgs field is a field that permeates the entire universe and interacts with particles proportional to their mass : particles with a lot of mass interact with the Higgs field a lot , and particles with no mass do n't interact with it at all . This interaction is mediated by the Higgs Boson .", "label": "hc3human"}

I rebuilt my credit by using fingerhut. small credit limit on a cap 1 credit card 300 dollars unsecured card. personal loan of 1500 dollars to buy a old clunk for a car as I did not want to have five years of car payments. you can also get a secured credit card. and build credit with that. the bank will explain how to build credit using your own money. also you should know a lot of banks like your bankrupt stat. because they no you cant file for several more years. meaning if you don't pay your loan they can garnish you and you cant file bankrupt. you can get a new car loan with good interest rate. by taking 5000 dollars of your 15000 dollars savings down on the new loan. making your new car loan have better payments cheaper and better interest. and get a secured credit card of 2000 to build towards a unsecured credit card. keep all your new credit tabs small and pay on time.i would not use all your nest egg savings. that is not smart. get a lawyer and file. stay in school you will have a fresh start and you learned about upside down loans. don't listen to people trying to tell you bankruptsy is bad. it in a lot of ways gives you the upper hand in a no win debt or debts.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "A \"balance transfer\" is paying one credit card with another.  You probably get offers in the mail to do this all of the time.  As other posters have noted, however, this usually comes with finance fees rather than the rewards that you get for normal purchases because it's written into your credit card agreement as a different class of transaction with different rules. I'm not sure if it's urban legend or true, but I have heard stories that suggest there were some \"loop holes\" in the earliest credit card reward plans that allowed for something like what you want.  I doubt that any plan ever allowed exactly what you've written, but I've heard stories about people buying gift cards from merchants and then using the gift cards to pay their bill.  This loop hole (if it ever existed) is closed now, but it would have allowed for essentially infinite generation of rewards at no cost to the cardholder.  The banks and credit card companies have a lot of years of experience at this sort of thing now, so the threshold for you finding something that works and conforms with the cardholder agreement is pretty small.", "label": "hc3human"}

Q1. The sure shot way of knowing that your company is depositing tax with government is to view your tax credit report. This was set-up in 2004 and gives the details of all credits against your PAN and the tax deducted against your PAN. It shows if the tax was TDS and which employer paid it, or if this was a self assessment, or TCS, etc.  To view this report there are 2 options:  Register directly at http://www.tin-nsdl.com/panregistration.asp.  Follow the one time registration process and keep viewing the tax credits. Note it normally takes 2-3 months to reflect the data.  The other alternative is that quite a few leading banks [Citi, SBI, etc] provide a direct access to this report from their internet banking frontend, provided your PAN is associated to your account. Q2. The only details you need to submit are the Form 16. This would have all the details of when the tax was paid and the BSR number required for reconciling. Q3. TDS is the liability of the employer. However if this has not been deducted or too little was deducted based on incorrect/incomplete information give by you, then its your liability. For example if you change jobs in a year, the tax deducted is always less and you have to pay the difference. Q4.

{"text": "In playing a song , radio stations are making ' public performances ' of a song that is protected by a couple different forms of copyright . The station has to pay performance royalties to a ' performing rights society ' who then pass that money on to the artists , who are members of that society . When you think of a song , it 's actually two things : 1 ) The song or ' composition ' which is to say the lyrics and to some extent the recognisable melody as written by the songwriter(s ) and 2 ) The ' master recording ' which is to say the mixed recording that is available on CD / mp3 / vinyl / etc which is more often than not owned by the record label that released it . The smaller radio stations tend to pay what is called a ' blanket license ' , which is an annual fee calculated using various factors such as their audience listening figures . Larger audiences means larger license fees . This blanket license then allows the radio station to play whatever songs they like that are administered by that collection society . Some radio stations have to report exactly what songs they play each week and how often , and they pay per usage accordingly . Others just have to pay the blanket license fee and are free to play whatever they like . Pretty much every song you could think of that has been released commercially , stretching back to the beginning of recorded music , is protected by a performing rights society . We 've established that the radio station must pay the songwriter a licence fee to their collection society in order to make a public performance of their song . So how does that money then reach the song writer ? This money , the performance royalty , is paid to the collection society , who then share that money equally between all the artists registered to them . Where the societies are paid for the use of a specific track , they 'll pay that money to the songwriters behind that track . The artists themselves make sure that they are personally registered to a collection society and will carefully register all the songs that they have written so that royalties can be fairly allocated . In the cases of songs that have multiple writers , they will all agree contractually the percentage of the song they each own ( naturally , this must total 100 % ) and the royalties for that song are split accordingly . The record companies also earn a bit of money from these public performances too - because it 's their ' master recording ' that the radio stations are playing back . To make this reporting easier , each song is given what is called an International Standard Recording Code , shortened to ISRC . This is a totally unique alpha - numeric identifier for each song , that makes reporting of public performances and sales much much easier than using the Artist and Title . Each country has its own collection society , some countries have several . The larger acts will make sure that they 're members of the larger societies - ASCAP and BMI in the USA , PPL and PRS in the UK - so they get money from performances in as many territories as possible . Many songwriters have their compositions administered by a Music Publisher , who for a fee take care of these registrations and because they are often multinational companies they have links with all societies worldwide and will be able to collect royalties worldwide . These performance royalties can amount to a significant percentage of an artists annual income , particularly if their songs have had significant radio plays . High profile artists like Eminem , Lady Gaga , Beyonce etc will earn six or seven figure sums each year as a result of these royalties , on top of their record sales royalties .", "label": "hc3human"}

If this turns into a pile of mush toward the end , I 'll fix it in the morning , I promise . Helix400 has the best info so far . Thunder - snow is uncommon , but exactly how uncommon varies widely based on geographic location . Here on the south shores of the Great Lakes , it is n't that uncommon with lake - effect snow squalls . It happens around here ( NW PA ) probably 4 or 5 times a year . I 'm going to do my very best to keep this as ELI5 as I can , but call me out if I go too technical . So , lightning is the product of big potential differences , AKA voltage . Potential differences want to equalize . To use a universal analog , you have socks on and scuff your feet across a carpet on a dry day . You 're stealing electrons from the carpet as you move . Eventually , while carrying around this abundance of electrons , you touch something that has a ( relative ) deficit of electrons , like a door knob , and you get a spark as the excess electrons make the jump from you , to this electron - deficient object . The spark actually jumps long before your touch the doorknob . The spark can jump about 1.1 mm for every 1,000 volts of difference between you and the doorknob , and they can be up to 3 cm long for a really good zap . That 's almost 30,000 volts ! The ' snap ' you hear when you get shocked is from that spark . You make baby thunder every time you zap your girlfriend while wearing your favorite Christmas sweater . Lightning is much the same . Thunderstorms move an absolutely incredible volume of air around through convective currents ( hot air rises , cold air sinks ) . These air currents rub against the ground , each other , as well as against moisture in the atmosphere ( in the form of ice , rain , and gaseous water ) , and they trade electrons . With time , a large enough potential difference develops between either two clouds , or the ground and the cloud base , that a spark can jump the gap between the two objects . Lightning . Now , really tall and fast updrafts do lots of different things to give these air currents lots of things to rub against to either steal electrons from , or give electrons to . They can hold more precipitation and dust aloft , they can create much larger clouds , and by moving faster , can also transport these electrons more efficiently . These updrafts work on convection . The surface of the Earth is really good at absorbing the sun 's energy , and by proxy , the air in the lowest 2,000 ' or so of the atmosphere is really easy to warm up on a bright sunny day . The warm air at the surface starts to rise , because it 's warmer than all the air above it . If everything goes smoothly , it will keep rising pretty much until it hits the Tropopause , somewhere between 4 and 10 miles above your head ( depending on your geographic location ) . The hotter the air at the surface , the bigger the temperature difference it will usually encounter as it rises , and so the faster it will rise . This is instability . If the air at the surface is relatively cold , let 's say -3C , the difference in temperature between the surface and aloft is n't very big , so the warm(er ) air from the surface ca n't rise very fast , or very high . A really kick ass Great Plains thunderstorm can top out somewhere very close to 55,000 feet above the ground . More than 10 miles high . Even a really rockin ' snow storm will very rarely be taller than 15,000 ' . This really makes it hard for the air currents in a snow storm to move enough electrons around , and do it long enough , to generate lightning . The most common exception is around really big bodies of water like the Great Lakes . Lake Erie absorbs heat from the sun , but ca n't get rid of it very quickly . If a really really cold pool of air moves out of Canada early in the winter , and sits over the lake , the lake could be up to 30 degrees warmer than the air right above it . A really thin layer of air near the surface of the lake heats up and picks up a ton of moisture from the lake , then starts to rise in to the super cold air above it . If the water fell back to the lake right away , it would land as drizzle or snow / rain mix , as the snow flakes melted right before hitting the water in that warm layer of air . If the wind is right though , that rising air is being pushed over the land as it rises , so when it falls , it ends up over dry land where the temperature at the surface is still below freezing . This is the best case scenario for thunder - snow . You have the fast rising air , lots of water being held up in the air so there 's something to rub against , the clouds can be pretty tall ( 10,000 - 20,000 ' in really butt kicking squalls ) so there is lots of time for the electrons to move around as well . Because the temperature difference is still not as extreme as if the surface was say , 30C , it wo n't be as much lightning as a really good summer thunderstorm , but there will be lightning , and it will be snowing like hell . Thunder - snow is * always * very very * * VERY * * heavy snow , or snow / sleet mix .

{"text": "Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American and naturalized Russian former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy.\nIn 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved, and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, The Washington Post, and other publications. Snowden also made extensive allegations against the GCSB, blowing the whistle of their domestic surveillance of New Zealanders and acts of espionage under John Key's government.\nOn June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of State revoked his passport. Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia. In September 2022, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin,[10] and on 2 December 2022 he swore the oath of allegiance.[11]\nA subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a traitor,[12] a hero,[13] a whistleblower,[14] a dissident,[15] a coward,[16] and a patriot.[17] U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done \"grave damage\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.[18] Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort \"to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\"[19] His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy, something that he has said he intended to do in retrospective interviews.[20]\nIn early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco\u2013based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.[21] He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company.[22] In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills. \"I have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night,\" he told an Israeli audience in November 2018, \"but I live on the internet and every other city in the world.\"[23] On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published.[24] On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v. Moalin that the U.S. intelligence's mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal and possibly unconstitutional.[25]", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "People seem to have already answered the \" how do they work \" , and there are many good resources on the net . But here 's my answer to your first two questions , in my best ELI5 style . Here 's how I like to think about imaginary numbers . Imagine you are a caveman . You live your life gathering carrots , and sometimes its useful for you to be able to say , \" I have three carrots \" or \" I have two . \" Natural numbers , ( i.e. 1,2 and up ) are good for counting things . But then your economy gets more complicated . One day you could n't find carrots , so you decide to borrow them from a friend . How many carrots do you currently have , you ask yourself ? There 's no number you know of that can capture the idea you want . In other words , you have a math problem : if I get three more carrots , I 'll be back to zero . So what do you do ? You invent a number , \" -3 \" , to capture the idea you want , and provide a solution to this question . Now we 're ready for imaginary numbers . Here , you just have another math problem you 'd like to solve . You like taking square roots , but do n't like how you always have to pay attention for when it does n't make sense . So you invent a number , * just like you did before * to give a solution to your mathematical question . Its all the same , numbers are always \" made up . \" Just like you 'll never find \" -3 \" carrots in your pantry , you 'll never find \" i \" books on your shelf . But its useful to have a name for answers to mathematical questions , and the same way we have rules that are interesting for negative numbers , we like to study the properties of imaginary numbers ( and functions ) as well . EDIT : Let me just add that this is something that keeps happening the higher up you go in mathematics . If there is n't a solution to an arithmetic question , its nice to just give the solution a name and treat it like its a number . I 'm on the boundary of the LI5 , so I 'll just stop here and summarize that the math that is the study of numbers finds it much easier ( and more interesting ) when you give names to things rather than just let them \" explode \" ( like square roots of negatives or roots of polynomial equations ) .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In 1911 , a Swiss doctor called Eugen Bleuler introduced the terms \" schizophrenia \" and \" schizophrenic \" . However , before Bleuler , there was another very excellent doctor , called Emil Kraepelin . He called schizophrenia \" Dementia Praecox \" , but Bleuler 's name is better because it suggests the \" splitting of the mind \" . This is a casual description of schizophrenia . An even better one is \" disintegration \" rather than \" splitting \" , as the patient loses mental capability over time . Now that we have a little history under control , lets talk about the symptoms . You may think they include only hallucinations , but this is untrue . In fact , schizophrenia is characterized by several \" symptoms \" , such as delusions , thought disorder , self - neglect , and social withdrawal . Hallucinations are actually incredibly interesting things . They are often defined as \" sensory experiences without stimuli \" , which means that someone going through a hallucination will \" feel \" , \" see \" , or \" hear \" things that are n't actually there . The most common is the auditory hallucination , but this is n't just imagining our thoughts as a voice in our head - most of us do that , and we are not hallucinating . What so clearly distinguishes a hallucination is the patient 's firm belief that the occurrence is really happening to them ; they think the hallucination is entirely real . Delusions are \" firm , fixed ideas that are inconsistent with the patient 's culture \" . The striking thing about delusions is that patients have no doubt about the importance or reality of the delusion - it could range from mundane delusions , such as \" That wall is gold plated \" when it is clearly not , to \" I am painting a portrait for the King of Spain \" , when they neither paint nor know the King of Spain . Thought disorder is also very , very interesting . Patients suffering from thought disorder think that they are making perfect sense , while their sentences may lack actual lexical and/or grammatical form . An example of thought disorder is a patient 's sudden \" realization of meaning \" . A good example of this is associated to colour : A patient with thought disorder may say something along the lines of : \" Our love is green . \" Here , the patient has \" become aware \" of this meaning of green - they do n't * associate * \" green \" with a meaning , they * mean * it . In their mind , \" green \" means and * always has meant * this adjective relating to love . The two \" negative symptoms \" of schizophrenia are depressive subjects . Patients go through something similar to clinical depression , where they \" turn into themselves \" and withdraw from other people - even family and friends . Patients are less engaged , less interested in the world around them . * * So , to recap * * : Schizophrenia is a mental illness , one of the most severe . Over time one loses mental capability as one 's mind \" disintegrates \" . There are five notable symptoms : hallucinations ; delusions ; thought disorder ; self - neglect , and social withdrawal . * Sources used : Psychiatry : A Very Short Introduction ( Tom Burns , OUP ) * * Biology Eighth Edition ( Campbell Reece , Pearson International Edition ) *", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "To understand money , let 's first pose a hypothetical of what society would be like without it . We 'll use a simple agrarian ( farming ) society . On your farm you grow wheat and raise pigs . You 're very good at this , and produce 100 bushels of wheat a year and 5 fat pigs , and you need 20 bushels and 1 pig to feed your family . This leaves you with 80 bushels and 4 pigs to trade . Why would you trade ? Well , you need a plough to help you grow wheat , and the plough needs a horse to pull it . You do n't know how to make a plough , and your horse is getting old . Luckily for you , the blacksmith has both , but you already gave him food when he made you a scythe . He does however want some charcoal to run his forge , and the charcoal maker needs food , so you go over to him and give him some , take his charcoal to the blacksmith and give it to him . This is what is known as a * barter based * economy . It 's all about the exchange of goods . The problem with this system , is that it does n't always work . What if the charcoal maker did n't need wheat , but the fisherman did ? How many people would you have to go through to get your plough ? Due to this , many societies developed some form of currency ( money ) , which has no value in and of itself , but represents the ability to buy something . Instead of trading until you get what you need , you take your food to market , and sell it for 10 clam shells . You can then give the blacksmith 8 of these in exchange for the horse and plough . He can spend them on whatever he wants to , and you get what you need . The clamshell represents a future or past trade . The problem with this system is that if someone finds 10 000 clam shells , all of a sudden the current shells in circulation are worth less . People can lose faith in the system , as the 10 clamshells they got yesterday are now worth much less than they were then . This is called * hyperinflation * , and it often leads to people reverting to barter based systems . To reduce the risk of this , government 's take control of the production of money , and attempt to limit the amount in circulation . The advantage of a money system over a barter system is that it allows for greater specialisation and services . A doctor has a very valuable service some of the time for some people , but is worthless to most people . In a barter system they 'd have to wait for the farmer to get sick before they could get food ( and even then they might be shortchanged ) , in a money based system , they can treat the blacksmith , and use the money from that to pay the farmer or fisherman .", "label": "hc3human"}

How a helicopter maneuvers in the fore and aft , left and right directions is by tilting that disc ( plane of rotating blades ) in the direction you want to travel . Most helicopter rotors have a wide range of motion . With the helicopter on the ground , and the collective neutral ( blades tilted so they are n't providing lift ) you can articulate the disc down to head chopping height pretty easily . This is why you never approach a ' turning ' helicopter without the pilot signalling , so they have positive control of the cyclic in a neutral ( level ) position . Actually , depending on the terrain , you may have to tilt the disc away from loading and unloading passengers so they can safely get in and out . A good gust can tilt the disc in random directions if you are n't actively on the cyclic , which you always should be if your bird is turning .

{"text": "First , you need to understand three things . 1 ) Allies still compete on the global stage . They compete for resources globally , they negotiate treaties in an adversarial manner ( that 's how negotiations work ) and alliances wavier and change . Allies also have competing alliances . Germany v. North Korea ? Sure . Germany v. Spain ? Who knows if they 'll pick the US alliance or the Spanish alliance ? 2 ) The duty of an intelligence agency is to provide the best , most complete and most accurate information possible to policy - makers so that they can make the best choices . 3 ) Governments do n't always say what they mean . Sometimes they mislead to get better negotiations . Often times they 'll say something to their domestic audience that 's completely different from what they 'll say to their international audience ( and often neither will be the true , more secret position of the government ) . How do you know which is the true position when the government is sending different messages to different groups ? You spy ! So , at a very basic level spying on your allies helps you understand what they really mean and believe versus what they 're saying . Knowing how the government actually feels , versus how they say they feel publicly helps you know how to best write and negotiate treaties . ( For example : Merkel is publicly outraged , but she 's really just faking outrage to play well domestically because her people are outraged ( and to score points in an upcoming trade negotiation with the US ) . The German government does n't really give a fuck about our spying because they understand its part of the game and do the same thing with their BND . If we took what Merkel was saying at face value , we would panic . However , our intel reveals that the panic is really manufactured from a government perspective . ) At a more advanced level , allies are not always allies . Sure , Germany will probably work with us against North Korea . But , if we 're in trilateral negotiations with France and Germany , then knowing what 's going on between France and Germany will help the US position itself to get the best deal it can .

{"text": "No . The rate at which a battery can be charged depends on the battery chemistry and construction , not its size . A big limitation is also charging devices . For example there are LiPo cells that can be fully charged in ten minutes or even less . They 're used in R / C applications a lot , for example . The problems are : 1 ) they are expensive 2 ) fast charging puts a lot of strain on the battery and this reduces the lifespan , which is bad for consumer electronics at large 3 ) balancing multiple cells becomes more difficult as you charge faster , 4 ) the logistics of it , i.e. the charger / charging circuitry Battery technology totally exists today that would allow you to fully charge your phone / laptop / tablet in 15 minutes . The issue is that you wo n't find a USB port anywhere that can source 50 amps in order to allow it . Nor will you find a laptop charger that will source 600 Watts because it would be comically large , and the vast majority of people do n't care enough about fast charging to lug one of those around just for that purpose . So the short answer is that the average consumer does not want super fast charging enough to put up with the downfalls and inconveniences . If you look at some stores that sell R / C equipment , you 'll find bigass batteries ( many times larger than anything in a phone / tablet / laptop ) that can be charged in ten minutes . You 'll also find the huge , expensive chargers that will let you charge them , some of which you ca n't run off a standard AC outlet without tripping the breaker . For something like the Tesla I imagine the driving features are cost and safety . One gigantic battery is possible but would be very expensive and unwieldy . You are also limited by your charging system , as usual . To charge the lower end Tesla ( 60 kiloWatt - hours ) in , say , half an hour ( assuming the battery chemistry supported it ) you 'd need to supply it with an average 120 kiloWatts . To put it in more common numbers , the 120V outlets in your home would need to be able to supply 1000 Amps . Household circuit breakers are generally 15 - 30 Amps except for bigger stuff like your stove / water heater / laundry . The circuit breaker that controls ALL of the power going into your house is typically something like 200 Amps . So , you 'd need over 4 times that .

{"text": "Have skimmed it , these are the most important parts as I can tell : The new temperature goal is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For anybody uninformed on what that means , 1.5 us the limit the average global temperature will have risen since pre - industrial times . This is friggin huge and I 'm super excited because the previous goal of 2 was n't all that great . So basically there 's limits on the global temperature rise ( which I 'll call GTR from now cause I 'm lazy ) . The GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before the industrial revolution . The last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C rise in temperature , which before was considered okay at best ( this goal was reached in the 90 's I believe ) . Since then new science and research has come out that tells us that 2 \u00b0 C could be bad . There 's also another thing you should know which is feedback loops : Under the arctic lies huge amounts of trapped methane . If the temperature becomes too high the ice that traps the methane gas melts and the methane enters the atmosphere . Methane is a greenhouse gas and is one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the atmosphere it reinforces global warming and the greenhouse effect further melting ice and further releasing methane until it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and in particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and absorbes heat . Ice is white and reflects it . As long as ice , particularly sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter goes away the the things beneath the ice tend to absorbes that heat and sun and make everything hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is melted and the more Ocean there is to absorb heat which further melts ice ad infinitum until we all die . Now back to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered seriously pushing it for these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse of civilization . At the current rate we 're doing things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is pretty much death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't in the clear but we have a very good chance of living life comfortably on earth , with nearly all of the same luxuries we have today albeit operated differently . Before this agreement the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they 've changed it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is a huge and a really big difference . Aside from that one of the big concerns is that developed countries have created climate change and gotten rich off it and now poor nations such as Pacific island nations and countries like Bangladesh now have to suffer because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says basically that developed nations have to help out financially to developing nations with protection against rising sea levels and other things and to help them convert their infrastructures to green energy while also helping them develop their economies and humanitarian situations . It also sets a goal for developed nations to try and cut all greenhouse emissions they emit . Lastly they will take stock of emissions and temperature rises and environmental impacts of climate change in 2023 and every five years after that . Also nations have to set goals for themselves every 5 years based on what they can accomplish and what they have accomplished . One worrying part is the fact that nations can back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without repercussions . I 'm also not sure how legally binding any of this is or if it even is . It would be awesome if it was but I 'm not sure .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A few things to keep in mind : * Diamonds are rarely cleanly unearthed by workers . The workers break up rock which is carted out of the mine for external industrial processing ( further smashing and washing with chemicals ) . * Uncut diamonds are n't nearly as valuable as cut , polished stones . * Also , uncut diamonds are hard for a non - professional to identify and value . It 's easy to mistake them for totally mundane minerals ( and vice versa ) . This is even more true when you 're working in a mineshaft , with little to no light . So at the outset , it 's very hard to come by and identify loose diamonds . It 's not like Minecraft or Terraria . You do n't have valuable diamonds just lying around for the taking . But lets say Miner Joe comes across a small diamond every now and again , which is small enough to smuggle out of the mine . The issue facing him now is whether it 's worth the risk . * * His potential take :* Joe 's diamond is small , uncut , and ungraded , so it 's not exactly a big - ticket item . Plus he has to sell it in his impoverished home country , so he 's not going to get U.S. retail prices . Not even close . Furthermore , if he 's a diamond miner , his buyer may well know that and probably leverage it against him ( i.e. , the buyer could threaten to turn him in ) . So Joe probably takes another hit on the price or maybe he asks a middle man to sell it for him ( for a cut ) . All told , I 'd wager that Joe gets a few hundred bucks for his diamond . Do n't get me wrong - that 's a sizeable chunk of money . But let 's see what he has to lose ... * * The risks :* There are a number of ways Joe could get caught . He could be seen pocketing the diamond by a supervisor , security personnel , or even a fellow miner ( who is probably rewarded for reporting him ) . He also runs the risk of a random inspection - even an X - Ray - as he leaves the mining camp . If he 's caught , he 'll be fired and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . Given the fact that diamond mining is probably one of the most steady , full - time jobs available to him , and the fact that his country 's justice and penal systems are n't known to be merciful , Joe stands to lose quite a bit . In other words , I think the reward : risk ratio is pretty damn low . I do n't doubt that theft is still a substantial problem , but I think that the opportunity and the benefits for such theft are probably substantially lower than most people think . I 've also read that De Beers and its competitors actually buy up the uncut diamonds sold into the pawn shops and markets in the communities around their mines . I guess that 's the cost of doing business if you 're trying to control the supply . But I 'd also wager that their buying clout can help control prices in this trade .", "label": "hc3human"}

[ The Berlin Conference ] ( URL_0 ) In 1884 , Portugal and Germany organized the Berlin Conference in which all the world superpowers decided to divide up all of Africa as colonies for Europe and the US ( who declined ) . In doing this , the European powers set up puppet governments in these areas as a means to rule over the colonies that they held . How they set it up was by appointing certain tribes to rule over the others and supported them with all the money and military might that Europe had at the time . However , after not too long , the European powers realized that the costs of keeping these colonies were far too high for the colonies to be a positive return on their investments . In realizing this , the powers packed up and left the African nationals to fend for themselves . Obviously , those tribes that were given power by Europe wanted to keep it and those that were being ruled over wanted a share . As such , many of the regions devolved into civil war and eventual rule by warlords . This is how people like Kony and the LRA have the ability to have the power that they do .

{"text": "Instead of only thinking in terms of left and right politics , we can also think in terms of freedom and control . There are left - wing ideas that are based on valuing freedom ( legalization of drugs ) , and left - wing ideas that require controlling people ( high tax + strong social safety net ) . There are right - wing ideas that are based on valuing freedom ( legal gun ownership ) , and right - wing ideas that require controlling people ( tight immigration policy ) . So you can value freedom without necessarily being strongly left or right . Imagine a person who strongly values individual freedom . That person can see their freedom being limited from all sides , by other people who are competing with them for a share of the world 's scarce comforts . Depending on how they see those limits to their freedom , they might be what you 'd call anarchist , or they might be libertarian . The anarchist you 're thinking of , tends to see the business world and the government as a corrupt and amoral interconnected system , that prevents common people from living freely . Anarchism literally means a lack of central control , so the anarchist thinks there should not be a government at all . They might substitute that system for communal decision making , but there are many different ideas for how an anarchic society would be structured . Their distrust of the capitalist game is a relatively left - wing position . The libertarian tends to be similarly skeptical of government , but thinks that capitalism is an expression of people 's freedom to own and trade property . While the capitalist game is not perfect , it is the system that best enables the creation of wealth , they think . So unlike an anarchist , a libertarian will tend to think a government is necessary , because you need a justice system to uphold property rights , and to settle disputes with minimal violence . The government a libertarian wants is as small as possible , serving only to enforce those property rights , and run a national defence force . This perception of absolute property rights , and of capitalism as a beneficial but tolerably imperfect game , matches up with typical right - wing political views . Strictly speaking , anarchism is just * absolutely pro - freedom * , and libertarianism is a less pure kind of pro - freedom that sees government as a necessary evil . So alternatively you could say , anarchism says \" we should n't have a government \" , which is radical . But libertarianism says \" let 's keep just the parts that we * really * ca n't do without \" , which is a more * conservative * way to think .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The previous two answers were correct , in that hard water contains minerals . To be more specific , hard water contains mineral salts - specifically calcium carbonate , and magnesium sulfate ( amongst others ) . Groundwater can pick up these natural occuring mineral salts from soil and rocks . ( Water sourced from wells will often be \" harder \" - than surface water ) . These salts dissolve and dissociate in water . \" Hard \" Water rich in Calcium and Magnesium ions ( Ca^2 + and Mg^2 + ) can cause 2 major problems . 1 . These ions can form percipitates , often causing \" scaling \" on pipes , water heaters , coffee pots , etc . ( it 's the hard white residue , often called \" limescale \" ) 2 . These ions inhibit the ability of soaps and other surfactants to properly \" lather \" . There are a few ways to remove the calcium / magnesium , but the most common is what 's called an \" ion - exchange \" water softener . The way these work is to basically substitue the calcium / magnesium ions in the water for a different ion - sodium ( Na^+ ) Without getting too deep into the chemistry , a softener will usually contain an \" anionic \" ( negatively charged ) polymer ( usually these are plastic beads ) . We add a sodium chloride ( salt ) soluton to the softener unit . The negatively charged polymer wil bind with the positively charged sodium ions . Next , we run the \" hard \" water over these Na^+ ( polymer ) beads . Since calcium and magnesium are more elctropositive ( a ^2 + charge as opposed to a ^1 + charge for sodium ) , the calcium / magnesium will preferentially bind with the polymer and the sodium will replace these ions in the water . Once the polymer has become saturated with calcium and magnesium , it can be \" recharged \" with sodium ions ( this can be done by treatment with sodium in an alkaline solution ) . The waste calcium / magnesium ( in solution ) is disposed of ( usually into a wastewater stream ) and the process can be repeated . So the simple version is : * Hard water contains calcium and magnesium , water softeners replace these minerals with sodium . * EDIT : spelling", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "A slightly different answer : Species evolve qualities that are beneficial for survival , and passing on their genes . That 's the only reason a particular trait gets selected and passed on in a species . Humans developed large front brains ( which make us intelligent ) , because intelligence confers advantages for surviving and passing on our genes . So , humans developed big , smart brains for the same reason that we developed arms , that rhinos developed thick skin , that alligators developed an incredibly slow metabolism , and that owls developed acute vision . All of these traits are very helpful for helping the creature survive and mate . So , our asking \" Why are n't other species as intelligent as us ? \" is very much like an alligator asking \" Why do n't other creatures have as slow metabolisms as we do ? \" or an owl asking \" Why ca n't other creatures see or fly as well as we do ? \" . The answer is that those traits are n't the ones that were helpful for those creatures to survive . Each creature developed the traits it did in order to overcome environmental challenges to survival , and it happens that intelligence was a huge help for primates in trying to survive , but not so much for alligators . Alligators do n't need to be able to make tools or to fly to weather their environmental challenges . What would be more helpful is if they could slow their metabolism to the point that they only need to eat about once a year - and this is the trait they developed . The same goes for us . Intelligence is one of many evolutionary tools developed for survival , but by no means the most efficient one . Bacteria - stupid as they are - are better at surviving than we are .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "The temperance movement sought a constitutional ban , not a legal ban , so as to prevent the ban from being easily repealed . A super - majority of the members of the 65th Congress favored prohibition -- but that was really an oddity . Many in politics opposed prohibition , and anti - prohibitionists might retake a majority at any time . The temperance movement enacted a constitutional ban to ensure that , without a 2/3 majority , Congress could n't repeal the ban on the sale , transport , and manufacture of alcohol . Opponents of prohibition also preferred the constitutional ban -- because it did n't include any provisions for enforcement . They thought they could deliver prohibitionists a moral victory , while still using their power to block good enforcement . Ultimately , they succeeded -- alcohol was banned , but everyone still drank . Of course , this ended out being a huge disaster , but that 's another matter .

{"text": "Yeah, I'll take the challenge...:) How trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income? These are in fact two separate questions, but the answers are related. How trustworthy? As trustworthy as they're clear about their own sources of income. If you cannot find any clue as to why, what for and how they're paying you - you probably should walk away. What's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true. For those of the sites that I know of their sources of income, it is usually advertisements and surveys. To get paid, you have to watch advertisements and/or answer surveys. I know of some sites who are legit, and pay people (not money, but gift cards, airline miles, etc) for participating in surveys. My own HMO (Kaiser in California) in fact pays (small amounts) to members who participate in enough surveys, so its legit. Are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income? Not something you could live off, but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to Starbucks. What do I need to consider tax wise? Usually the amounts are very low, and are not paid in cash. While it is income, I doubt the IRS will chase you if you don't report the $20 Amazon gift card you got from there. It should, strictly speaking, be reported (probably as hobby income) on your tax return. Most people don't bother dealing with such small amounts though. In some cases (like the HMO I mentioned), its basically a rebate of the money paid (you pay your copays, deductibles etc. Since the surveys are only for members, you basically get your money back, not additional income). This is in fact similar to credit card rebates. Is there a best practice for handling the income? If we're talking about significant amounts (more than $20-30 a year), then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses, and report it as any other business income on your taxes, Schedule C. Is there a good test to determine what is and isn't a scam? As I said - if it looks too good to be true - it most likely is. If you're required to provide your personal/financial information without any explanation as to why, what it will be used for, and why and what for you're going to be paid - I'd walk away. Otherwise, you can also check Internet reviews, BBB ratings, FTC information and the relevant state agencies and consumer watchdogs (for example: http://www.scamadviser.com) whether they've heard of that particular site, and what is the information they have on it. A very good sign for a scam is contact information. Do they have a phone number to call to? Is it in your own country? If its not in your own country - definitely go away (for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the UK, but listed address is in Los Angeles, CA. A clear sign of a scam). If they do have a phone number - try it, talk to them, call several times and see how many different people you're going to talk to. If its always the same person - run and hide. Do they have an address? If not - walk away. If they do - look it up. Is it a PMB/POB? A \"virtual\" office? Or do they have a proper office set up, which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office? And of course your guts.

{"text": "So let 's say there are 10 people who want to get elected . It 's a winner take all election , whoever gets the most votes is going to win and gets to make all the decisions . Well , when you go through the votes , its ' going to be clear some of those 10 people are more favored than others . Bob is not very favored , they estimate only about 5 % of people are likely to vote for Bob . If Bob just stays by himself and loses , he ges nothing . Bob mainly wants to make it a rule that everyone gets to eat pizza on friday . He has other stuff he 'd like , but that 's the important one . So Bob , knowing he ca n't win and wanting to make sure everyone gets pizza on friday goes to Tom . Tom is a front runner in the race and does n't particularly care what people eat for dinner on Friday . Bob tells Tom if he promises to make the pizza on fridays rule , he 'll drop out of the race and tell all the people who would have voted for him to vote for Tom instead . Now , this is great for Tom , remember he does n't care who eats what on Fridays , but those votes will help him get elected , so why not ? He agrees , and now Tom and Bob are in a political party . Bob is n't the only one to figure this out . Pretty soon everyone has asked for something from the two most likely to win , because there is no reason for them to continue running on their own when they know they wo n't win . It makes more sense to ally yourself with a more powerful candidate more likely to win in order to gain some influence even if you do n't agree with all their ideas , instead of running on your own , losing , and getting nothing . That 's how the American system works . Now the European systems are all different in different countries but basically instead of a winner take all , it 's weighed to how popular you are . Instead of electing one leader , everyone votes to decide how much say each leader gets . So Tom wins the election with 40 % of the votes . The does n't seem like much , but remember there are 10 people splitting up the votes , so the average would be only 10 % . Now , Bob brings up the pizza on Fridays rule for a vote , and gets 5 % of the vote . Now he can make deals with Tom and others to make sure his rule passes , but he does n't need to join Tom . He can stay his own party and influence votes on many different issues , not just pizza on friday . His 5 % of the vote might be the difference in a contested issue , so he can make deals to exchange his support for support on the stuff he wants . In this case it makes sense for him to stay seperate instead of joining Tom . By not being winner take all and leaving some consolidation for Bob , he 's more likely to stick it out alone .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "In computer science, an online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start.\nIn contrast, an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand. In operations research, the area in which online algorithms are developed is called online optimization.\nAs an example, consider the sorting algorithms selection sort and insertion sort: selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder and places it at the front, which requires access to the entire input; it is thus an offline algorithm. On the other hand, insertion sort considers one input element per iteration and produces a partial solution without considering future elements. Thus insertion sort is an online algorithm.\nNote that the final result of an insertion sort is optimum, i.e., a correctly sorted list. For many problems, online algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms. If the ratio between the performance of an online algorithm and an optimal offline algorithm is bounded, the online algorithm is called competitive.\nNot every offline algorithm has an efficient online counterpart.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I sat through a timeshare pitch to get free tickets for a show in Vegas . First , they \" calculated \" life time costs on hotels , using the following formula : $ 500 for 30 years = $ 15,000 ; next calculate inflation 10 % 30 times so lets multiple 15,000 by 1.1 press enter 30 times and , looks like you all can expect to spend $ 261,741 ( edit miscalculated this the first time ) on hotels over then next 30 years . ( I hope you understand this rate of inflation and \" math \" is insane ) . They also repeatedly asked us to be polite and turn off our phones . Second , we went into a room where we sat with a sales person , planned a bunch of fictional trips , and were offered the timeshare for $ 40,000 then eventually $ 30,000 . We declined and were led to another room . In the second room the \" manager \" was there to whisper in our new sales person 's ear . Now the amazing deal , thanks to the special , was down to $ 20,000 then $ 15,000 . Still declined , and was led into a third room . In the third room , a new sales person , was offering resold timeshares , from previous owners , not from the company . We could get the exact same thing for .... $ 5,000 . At this point I whipped out my phone a googled the place , looking to buy their timeshare on my own . I found them for $ 500 bucks . $ 500 was the real resale price ! And , they gave me grief for being rude and using a phone . Oh dear God I hope google puts all timeshares out of business . I can tell you some poor souls defiantly signed papers in that first room . There was cheering , bell ringings , and a big hug welcoming them into the family they dropped $ 30 - 40 grand for something that could only be resold for $ 500 bucks without a complicated physiological manipulation , the failure of the American school system , and social pressure not to google . Edit : Just to give some more information for those who asked : Me and my S.O. agreed to go to the pitch in exchange for free tickets to Excalibur 's Tournament of Kings ( Medieval Times ) . Without any discounts , it would have cost us $ 120 . We were told it would be an hour pitch and there would be a free lunch . I almost backed out when they led us to a van . They assured me it was on the strip and would only take an hour , and I really wanted to see some jousting , so I relented . They drove us way off the strip , I had no idea where we were but it took us 15 minutes to get there . Then , the \" Fun \" started . We had our own personal sales person who led us around and kept saying things like , \" I want to look into each others ' eyes and promise to take them on at least one vacation a year . \" Our group got led into a room to \" meet \" the managers / organizers , which was a video where some B actors ( who I guess are lucky enough to head a timeshare ) basically saying that if you did n't go on trips together as a family it met you did n't love each other . The video had the exact same feel as the \" Sweetums \" family video on Parks and Rec if you get the reference . The timeshare itself was part of a group , so you could technically stay at places other than the one you owned . There was an over complicated Point / Rewards System that was used to determine when and were you could stay . You would use your points to bid for a timeslot , then you could trade it to stay somewhere else . The longer you went without staying the more points you had . They only explanation they gave to describe the system was that Vegas was the most popular tourist destination in the world so we would have \" all the points we needed . \" After seeing them calculate hotel costs , I chose to disbelieve them .

{"text": "From what I have read from O'Neil to Van Tharp, etc, etc, no one can pick winners more than 75% of the time regardless of the system they use and most traders consider themselves successful if 60% of the trades are winners and 40% are losers.  So I am on the side that the chart is only a reflection of the past and cannot tell you reliably what will happen in the future. It is difficult to realize this but here is a simple way for you to realize it. If you look at a daily chart and let's say it is 9:30 am at the open and you ask a person to look at the technical indicators, look at the fundamentals and decide the direction of the market by drawing the graph, just for the next hour. He will realize in just a few seconds that he will say to him or her self \"How on earth do you expect me to be able to do that?\"  He will realize very quickly that it is impossible to tell the direction of the market and he realizes it would be foolhardy to even try. Because Mickey Mantle hit over 250 every year of his career for the first 15 years it would be a prudent bet to bet that he could do it again over the span of a season, but you would be a fool to try to  guess if the next pitch would be a ball or a strike. You would be correct about 50% of the time and wrong about 50% of the time. You can rely on LARGER PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR OVER YEARS, but short hourly or even minute by minute prediction is foolish. That is why to be a trader you have to keep on trading and if you keep on trading and cut your losses to 1/2 of your wins you will eventually have a wonderful profit.  But you have to limit your risk on any one trade to 1% of your portfolio.  In that way you will be able to trade at least 100 times.  do the math.  trade a hundred times.  lose 5% and the next bet gain 10%.  Keep on doing it. You will have losses sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row and also wins sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row but overall if you keep on trading even the best traders are generally only \"right\" 60% of the time.  So lets do the math. If you took 100 dollars and make 100 trades and the first trade you made 10% and reinvested the total and the second trade you lost 5% of that and continue that win/loss sequence for 100 trades you would have 1284 dollars minus commissions. That is a 1200% return in one hundred trades.  If you do it in a roth IRA you pay no taxes on the short term gains.  It is not difficult to realize that the stock market DOES TREND. And the easiest way to make 10% quickly is to in general trade 3x leveraged funds or stocks that have at least 3 beta from the general index.  Take any trend up and count the number of days the stock is up and it is usually 66-75% and take any down trend and it is down 66-75% of the days.  So if you bet on the the beginning of a day when the stock was up and if you buy the next day about 66-75% of the time the stock will also be up. So the idea is to realize that 1/3 of the time at least you will cut your losses but 2/3 of the time you will be up then next day as well.  So keep holding the position based on the low of the previous day and as the stock rises to your trend line then tighten the stock to the low of the same day or just take your profit and buy something else.  But losing 1/3 times is just part of \"the unpredictable\" nature of the stock market which is causes simply because there are three types of traders all betting at the same time on the same stock.  Day traders who are trading from 1 to 10 times a day, swing traders trading from 1 day to several weeks and buy and hold investors holding out for long term capital gains. They each have different price targets and time horizons and THAT DIFFERENCE is what makes the market move.  ONE PERSON'S SHORT TERM EXIT PRICE AT A PROFIT IS ANOTHER PERSONS LONG TERM ENTRY POINT and because so many are playing at the same time with different time horizons, stop losses and exit targets it is impossible to draw the price action or volume.  But it is possible to cut your losses and ride your winners and if you keep on doing that you have a very fine return indeed.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "My son who is now 21 has never needed me to cosign on a loan for him and I did not need to establish any sort of credit rating for him to establish his own credit.  One thing I would suggest is ditch the bank and use a credit union. I have used one for many years and opened an account there for my son as soon as he got his first job. He was able to get a debit card to start which doesn't build credit score but establishes his account work the credit union. He was able to get his first credit card through the same credit union without falling work the bureaucratic BS that comes with dealing with a large bank. His interest rate may be a bit higher due to his lack of credit score initially but because we taught him about finance it isn't really relevant because he doesn't carry a balance. He has also been able to get a student loan without needing a cosigner so he can attend college.  The idea that one needs to have a credit score established before being an adult is a fallacy. Like my son, I started my credit on my own and have never needed a cosigner whether it was my first credit card at 17 (the credit union probably shouldn't have done that since i wasn't old enough to be legally bound), my first car at 18 or my first home at 22. For both my son and I, knowing how to use credit responsibly was far more valuable than having a credit score early. Before your children are 18 opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder can be problematic because they aren't old enough to be legally liable for the debt. Using them as a cosigner is even more problematic for the same reason. Each financial institution will have their own rules and I certainly don't know them all.

{"text": "Personally, I think you are approaching this from the wrong angle.  You're somewhat correct in assuming that what you're reading is usually some kind of marketing material.  Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world.  Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the US. On average, verified by many studies, individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners.  Say you decide to invest in a mutual fund, dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when you feel the market is low. As an example I'll compare investing $50 per week on Wednesdays, versus 1 share per week on Wednesdays, or the full $850 on the first Wednesday.   I'll use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example (VLCAX).  I realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different, I just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle.  By investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs.  It also keeps your investment easy to budget. Vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds, rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments, which is illustrated in the third column above; and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing. Ultimately, all of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique.  If they all called dollar cost averaging, \"dollar cost averaging\" none of them would appear to be unique.  So they devise neat acronyms but it's all pretty much the same idea.

{"text": "Do you think your 403b will earn more than the mortgage interest rate?  If so, then mortgage seems the way to go. Conservative investment strategies might not earn much more than a 3-4% mortgage, and if you're paying 5-6% it's more likely you'll be earning less than the mortgage. From another point of view, though, I would probably take a loan anyway just from a security standpoint - you have more risk if you put a third of your retirement savings into one purchase directly, whereas if you do a 10-15 year loan, you'll have more of a cushion.  Also, if you don't outlive the mortgage, you'll have had use of more of your retirement income than otherwise - though I do wonder if it puts you at some risk if you have significant medical bills (which might require you to liquidate your 403b but wouldn't require you to sell your house, so paying it off has some upside). Also, as @chili555 notes in comments, you should consider the taxation of your 403(b) income.  If you pull it out in one lump sum, some of it may be taxed at a higher rate than if you pulled it out more slowly over time, which will easily overwhelm any interest rate differences.

In this case, the moment of the initial  $225,000 loan is convenient. At that moment, you get $225,000 You then make 30 payments on the 40% mortgage.  The amount of these payments has to be calculated;  they're paying off a $90,000 mortgage with 30 monthly payments at a monthly rate of 0.5% Finally, you make 30 payments of an amount X, starting one month after the 40% mortgage ends. So far we've just listed the amount and time of all the payments back and forth. A time-line type diagram is a huge help here.

Either the source code for the game is available ( or available with a bit of work ) , or specific modding tools are developed and put out along with the game but the source code is n't available directly . If the source code is available ( like in the case of Minecraft for example ) that means that you can see how everything works within the game and you 're able to tweak things exactly how you want them . This is great because you have nearly complete control , but it does mean mods are not all that stable often , because it 's really easy to create something that does n't work very well .

Allowing this kind of modding is n't really any work for the original developers . If the source code is n't directly available ( like in the fallout games ) then users have to depend on documentation to figure out how the game works , or they just interact with what they want to change . It 's often easier to write effective mods like this , although they are always going to be somewhat limited because they depend on certain connections being available from the game itself through modding tools . Also , it will probably be easier to combine different mods , because mods are handled by the main game which is created to anticipate multiple mods and handle them in an orderly way .

{"text": "A Bellman equation, named after Richard E. Bellman, is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as dynamic programming. It writes the \"value\" of a decision problem at a certain point in time in terms of the payoff from some initial choices and the \"value\" of the remaining decision problem that results from those initial choices.[citation needed] This breaks a dynamic optimization problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems, as Bellman's \u201cprinciple of optimality\" prescribes.  The equation applies to algebraic structures with a total ordering; for algebraic structures with a partial ordering, the generic Bellman's equation can be used.\nThe Bellman equation was first applied to engineering control theory and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in economic theory; though the basic concepts of dynamic programming are prefigured in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior and Abraham Wald's sequential analysis.[citation needed] The term 'Bellman equation' usually refers to the dynamic programming equation associated with discrete-time optimization problems. In continuous-time optimization problems, the analogous equation is a partial differential equation that is called the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation.\nIn discrete time any multi-stage optimization problem can be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The appropriate Bellman equation can be found by introducing new state variables (state augmentation). However, the resulting augmented-state multi-stage optimization problem has a higher dimensional state space than the original multi-stage optimization problem - an issue that can potentially render the augmented problem intractable due to the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. Alternatively, it has been shown that if the cost function of the multi-stage optimization problem satisfies a \"backward separable\" structure, then the appropriate Bellman equation can be found without state augmentation.", "label": "hc3human"}

And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts / Representatives and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you 've abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet tall then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Perhaps an example will help make it more clear. Any given year:  Revenue:  200K, profit 60K You get 40K in profit, plus any salary, he gets 20K Next year you attract the attention of a competitor and they offer and you accept to sell.  You would get 100% of the proceeds. This is kind of a bad deal for him as you could easily play accounting tricks to diminish the company's profits and reduce his pay.  For the given example, you could pay yourself a 60K bonus and reduce the profit to zero and eliminate his compensation.  There should probably be a revenue metric included in his compensation. Edit: It is really nice to hear you have a desire to treat this person fairly.  Honesty in business is necessary for long term success.  I would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates.  For example, lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10.  Your profit would be 6, and with the suggested split he would receive $2, you $4. Instead I would have him receive like 15% of the revenue generated This allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales.  It also allows him to share revenue with his staff.   Alternatively you could also do a split.  Perhaps 7.5% of revenue and 10% of profit.", "label": "hc3human"}

It can be , but it 's not automatically . 4 : The single payer operates both ways . It 's the single point where money ENTERS the system , and it 's the single point money LEAVES the system . OK . So lets pretend we have \" American System \" and a single payer system , call it DoktorCo . In America , you will have 2 - 4 different health insurance companies where you are . Lets say there are 3 of them , and they all have equal amounts of business . So if we spend $ 30,000 , they each get $ 10,000 . We can call them Aetna , Blue Cross , and Cigna ( A , B and C ! ) When you use medical services , your insurance pays . So the doctor sends a bill to A. A then has their people review the paperwork , and then sends money to the doctor . Now I see the same doctor . I 'm with B ... so he has to do DIFFERENT paperwork , and send it to B , who has different people process it . He might also get paid a different amount ... Now Chuck , who uses C , wants to see the doctor . But our doctor does n't accept C ! Chuck has to go see Doc Zed instead . That 's annoying . That 's the most basic version . Compared to DoktorCo . Everyone pays DoktorCo . So they get all $ 30,000 . They only have one set of clerks to handle this ( instead of A B and C having 3 sets ) . Every doctor is paid by them . They always get the same amount . No matter who sees them , they only need to use one set of papers , and only one set of clerks to process it . Everything is always the same for every patient . It 's a lot simpler . --------- The biggest benefit to single payer is efficiency . They need less people to do the same work , so less money is wasted . You do n't duplicate services . You only need one way to make claims , not different ones for every company . A very important savings is that they do n't need to compete . Aetna , for instance , spends a LOT of money on advertising to convince everyone with Blue Cross to pick Aetna instead .

{"text": "In addition to the excellent answers here I might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence.  Lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the S&P 500.   If you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash.  Lets say 98% of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the S&P 500.  You will will miss matching the S&P 500 because you have 2% not invested in some money market account.   If you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track.  I am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that I know these ETFs are used for.

In general , people keep electing the same people as long as they run again . There are two main reasons for it . 1 . Redistricting - Every 10 years when a new census comes out lines have to be redrawn to accurately decide how much representation in congress each state gets . This is often used as an opportunity for the party that is in charge in each state to change the lines so that it favors them . Over time this means that * * most * * districts lean heavily one way or another . This means that if you 're a republican or democrat in the house of representatives , if you run again next term , the guy from the other party probably wo n't be able to beat you . There are laws to limit this effect , although it still happens . Redistricting is n't a factor in the senate . 2 . People like * * their representative * * even if they do n't like congress . While people say they do n't like congress , they still like the guy they voted for . This is partly because of # 1 above but it 's a common situation . This is because even though congress makes decisions a lot of people dislike , their representative will often vote how they prefer . The reason congress does n't agree is mostly because they 'll be replaced next election if they work with the other side . * * So most people are upset with congress , but when they have a chance to change a small part of it , they overwhelmingly will choose to not do so . * * A small majority are upset with the president , but he ca n't run again in 2016 anyway . The US may replace him with a republican ( switching is common after two terms of the other party ) or they might replace him with a different democrat .

{"text": "Before the 80s software was covered by copyrights instead of patents where unless you copied something exactly you were not liable to be sued for stealing someone 's ideas . However large companies wanted more protection of their software and after some court cases including some at the supreme court they changed the rules and started allowing patents of software ideas rather then just a copyright on the specific code . The idea was that it would give inventors and programmers more incentive to come up with new ideas as they would have more legal protections from having their ideas stolen . However because patents can be very vague they ended up issuing patents to lots of things that maybe were not new concepts , such as \" transmitting data over the internet \" . So instead of encouraging innovation it led to companies getting issued patents for simple things everyone did and then sue each other for \" stealing \" ideas . Also some lawyers saw that big software companies would just payout settlements to avoid going to court and decided to just sue every company with big money with the hopes of getting a fat payout to make them go away . So now companies will pay lots of money for the patent rights for stuff that should not have been patented in the first place just so they can say \" if you sue me for patent infringement then I have patents also and will sue you right back ! \" .

{"text": "This is actually an interesting question , and the root of your answer lies far back in history . The short version is that a highway was a road elevated above the surrounding terrain ( literally , the high way ) , and a freeway was the opposite of a toll road ( literally , the free way ) . Back in , say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most people walked from their hut to the fields and back , and perhaps once a season the duke 's tax collector came in a wagon or cart . This meant that most traffic was along footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations increased , and the cart paths began seeing more traffic , 2 big problems arose . First , the ruts got deeper , much deeper . This is a major problem in places with a high water table ( say , coastal areas or swamps ) , or during rainy seasons . Second , these low paths made it hard to see around , facilitating ambushes by bandits . By building up the path , these two problems were alleviated . The path was above the waterline , during rains the water would naturally run off the path , and someone on the path could more easily see bandits lying in wait . A high way was much safer . The downsides of the high way is that you could n't just get on it anywhere with your cart - the sides were too steep . You had to get on or off in specific locations that had lower grade ramps leading to the high way . This is still reflected in how our modern highways work . They have limited access , usually by on / off ramps . Modern highways are ( often ) elevated , limited access roads that can safely handle high volumes of traffic . However , the cost of building this highway has to be borne by someone . Hence , initially , most highways were toll roads ( aka turnpikes , because they had walls of pikes setup on the road , which was turned aside when the toll was paid . Again , literally , turn pike to pass ) . When bright , insightful people in government realized that safer traffic along those highways boosted the economy , and allowed them to collect more taxes , they decided to make the highways they build free , so that they could make more money off the increased traffic . The free way was born . Modern freeways are highways that are paid for by taxes . The meaning of highway and freeway is , literally , in the name . High way and free way .", "label": "hc3human"}

They say the ratio in sound heard with the earplugs in vs the sound without is a certain ratio lower So unless you specify the other value you 're comparing to , like a baseline , just saying dB does n't have much meaning . When just measuring the output of sound , Many specifications use \" over ambient \" . Many use dB spl ( compared to one SPL , which is used as a basic absolute unit of pressure , which can be correlated to perceived loudness , to compare to ) . DB can also be used to refer to the amplification of the device ( what the difference in power or amplitude of the wave going into the device vs going out is ) Another issue is human hearing . Humans hear sounds in certain frequency ranges better than others , so while one sound might be mathematically 2x as powerful as another , we might hear it as 3 or 4 times more powerful or even less powerful , depending on the frequency . A final issue is comparative levels . A TV on volume 5 might sound plenty loud in the dead of night with no one else home , but would be almost inaudible at a swinging party .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I think JB King's answer is interesting from the point of view of \"is this good for me\" but the OP's question boils down to \"why would a company do this?\" The company buys back shares when it thinks it will better position the company financially. A Simple Scenario: If Company A wants to open a new store, for example, they need to buy the land, build the store, stock it, etc, etc and this all costs money.  The company can get a loan, use accrued capital, or raise new capital by issuing new stock.  Each method has benefits and drawbacks. One of the drawbacks of issuing new stock is that it dilutes the existing stock's value.  Previously, total company profits were split between x shares.  Now the profits are shared between x+y shares, where y is the number of new shares issued to raise the capital. This normally drives the price of the stock down, since the expected future dividends per stock have decreased. Now the company has a problem: the next time they go to raise money by issuing stock, they will have to issue MORE shares to get the same value - leading to more dilution.  To break out of this cycle, the company can buy back shares periodically.  When the company feels the the stock is sufficiently undervalued, it buys some back.  Now the profits are shared with a smaller pool, and the stock price goes up, and the next time Company A needs to raise capital, it can issue stock. So it probably has little to do with rewarding shareholders, and more to do with lowering the \"cost of capital\" for the company in the future.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I don't like REITs because they are more closely correlated to the movement of the stock market. They don't really do the job of diversifying a portfolio because of that correlation.  When the stock market dropped in 2008, REITs were hammered as well because the housing bubble burst. Bonds went up, and if you rebalanced (sold the bonds to buy more stock) then you came out much further ahead when the stock market recovered. The point of adding bonds for diversification is that they move in the opposite direction of equities; blunting the major drops (and providing buying opportunities). REITs don't fit that bill. REITs are not undergoing a correction like bonds because the price of real estate is a function of housing supply and buyer demand. Rising interest rates only make it a little harder for buyers to buy, so the effect of rising interest rates on real estate prices is muted. The other effects on real estate prices (more wealth in the economy for buyers) pushes in the opposite direction of the rising interest rates.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is no fundamental, good reason, I think; \"that's just how it's done\" (which is what all the other answers seem to be saying, w/o coming out and admitting it). Just guessing, but I'll bet most of the reason is historical: Before up-to-the-moment quotes were readily available, that was a bit tedious to calculate/update the fund's value, so enacted-laws let it be done just once per day.  (@NL7 quotes the security act of 1940, which certainly has been updated, but also still might contain the results of crufty rationales, like this.) There are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks, though: One share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock: There is a finite supply of Company-X-stock, and people are trading that piece of ownership around, and barter to find an mutually-agreeable-price.  But when you buy into a mutual-fund, the mutual-fund \"suddenly has more shares\" -- it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks (in a ratio equal to its current holdings).  As a consequence: the mutual fund's price isn't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price (like stock); there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund, and that's the weighted total of its underlying stock.  If you wanted to sell your ownership-of-Mutual-Fund-Z to a friend at 2:34pm, there wouldn't be any bartering, you'd just calculate the value based on the stated-value of the underlying stock at that exact moment. So: there's no inherent reason you can't instantaneously price a mutual fund.  BUT people don't really buy/sell funds to each other -- they go to the fund-manager and essentially make a deposit-or-withdraw.  The fund-manager is only required by law to do it once a day (and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often?), so that's all they do. [Disclaimer: I know very little about markets and finance.

{"text": "Why Japan continues to practice whaling : 1 . * * Culture * * - Some Japanese believe that killing one animal ( e.g. a Whale ) is more humane than killing thousands of animals ( e.g. a school of fish or a ton of shrimp ) . This somewhat relates to Shintoism and the concept of everything having a \" spirit , \" but again it 's more cultural than religious . 2 . \" * * Research * * \" - This is a controversial issue , but let me see if I can take an unbiased approach to it . The International Whaling Commission has an exemption for whaling that relates to medical research . So a Japanese organization known as the Institute of Cetacean Research conducts whaling operations under this IWC exemption . However , there is also a law in Japan that states that when a whale is killed no part of the body may be discarded as waste . So the ICR packages the whales ( after they have done their research ) for consumption / sale back in Japan . This is where organizations like Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace argue that Japan is using the clause in the IWC charter to engage in commercial whaling , which should technically be illegal . 3 . * * National Pride * * - Japan has had a long tradition of strong national pride , where they do not appreciate being dictated / told what to do by other countries . There is a fringe within Japan that sees whaling as something that only the Japanese should have a say in , and do not want to be seen as bowing to pressure from western countries . 4 . * * Commercial Value * * - This has n't proven true in 5/6 years , but there is a market for whale meat . Were Japan able to haul in as much whale meat as they had intended , there is enough interest in the value of whale meat to fund the operations needed to hunt it . That being said , the folks from Sea Shepherd have had an enormous economic impact on commercial whaling in Japan .", "label": "hc3human"}

You'd need to check the terms of your mortgage to see what this limit is. You can actually pay off more than this, but would become liable to pay an \"early repayment fee\" or similar, which is usually something like 3-5% of the mortgage amount. Note that this usually means you would need to re-finance the mortgage anyway If you are not on a fixed-term mortgage than, in the UK at least, you are pretty much free to over-pay as much as you would like or refinance the mortgage. If you are in a fixed-term mortgage, it is usually better to simply over-pay by that maximum allowed amount until the fixed period ends, at which point you can re-finance onto a mortgage that allows higher overpayments. This isn't always the case, though, depending on your interest rate, how high the early repayment charge is, and how much you are able to over-pay. At the very least, you're going to need to do some sums! If you do choose to over-pay up to the limit, then you'd want to over-pay as much as you can at the start of the year (ie don't divide the over-payment by 12, pay it all as early as you can) to reduce interest payments. Then once you hit the limit, put the rest into a savings account: once you are out of the fixed term you can then pay the rest as a lump sum when refinancing.", "label": "hc3human"}

It 's easiest to explain if you think about standing on a merry - go - round . All the horses on the merry - go - round make one full rotation in the same amount of time . But the horses farther from the center have a longer distance to travel in that same amount of time . So they 're moving faster than the horses near the center . What if you try to jump from one horse to another ? If you 're on a horse near the center and you jump outwards , you 're jumping from a slower horse to a faster horse . As you jump outwards , you 're moving with the same speed as the slower horse was ( because of inertia ) , but suddenly you 're in a zone of faster horses . The horse you were trying to jump onto is moving faster than you are , so it outpaces you and you fall on the floor behind it . In other words , moving outwards from the center of rotation causes you to drift backwards , from the point of view of the rotating merry - go - round . The opposite happens if you jump from one of the outer horses inwards - you 're moving faster than the horse you 're aiming at , so you drift forwards . The same thing happens on Earth 's surface . The North and South Poles are at the axis of rotation , so they have no lateral speed . But the Equator is moving at over 1000 mph .

So it 's not that they do n't pose a threat , but that any \" objective \" measure of strength would have them as the underdogs . * * Civil War * * - Open conflict between two parties for control of a political community , or to divide a political community .

These are usually fast , and less violent , but can be in the works for years . The biggest difference between a coup and the others on the list is that it represents a particular tactic , rather than a type of war . An insurgency can end with a coup , if the insurgents manage to position themselves to , say , kill the president and take control of the capital city . The key is that it involves removing the leadership and taking over . There are also * * \" palace coups , \" * * where someone inside the regime kills others in the regime and takes over .

The key is , as /u / panzerkampfwagen notes , that there is a change in a system of government relatively fast . But it 's really about framing . A civil war can be a revolution , as can an insurgency , or even a coup .

So let's say I want to establish and document the pattern in case it becomes a future legal issue. When you deposit or cash a check, an image of the front and back is made and the person or company who issued the check will have those images stored as part of their transaction history. (It used to be that the original, physical, cancelled check was returned to the payer, but that was another era.) So write the date received on the back next to the endorsement, endorse the check, and take a photo of the front and back (along with the postmark on the envelope) to document that they are a late payer. This way, if it ever becomes a \"he said she said\" issue you can easily show they have a history of paying late. If the payer looks at their check images they'll see your received date note next to the endorsement. Granted, this is a lot of trouble for a unique situation.

{"text": "Bergdahl is a very contentious figure and continues to be despised among many in the military . Basically , he was unhappy with what he saw as inadequate leadership and negligence by his superior officers . He apparently tried to voice his concerns to higher - ups a number of times , but did not feel he was listened to . It seems that he had the same issues with command as a lot of intelligent and idealistic people would . But , after listening to Serial and hearing interviews with Bergdahl , one ca n't help but notice that he 's slightly ' off ' ; there 's something odd about him . Almost in an Asbergers- like fashion . He just could n't reconcile his childlike fantasies of heroism , honor , valor , etc . with the everyday realities of being on a military base in war - torn Afghanistan . So , one day , for reasons that are n't absolutely clear , he decided to just walk off base and into the desert . The taliban - controlled desert . Bergdahl fancied himself quite the physical specimen : he thought that he was going to get the attention of higher / ups in the military by walking off - base for a while , through the terrain of Afghanistan , and showing up at some other base to a grand reception later on , where his concerns would be heard . At least , that was the plan in Bergdahls mind . In reality , he was quite conspicuous as a milquetoast white boy in the middle of the afghan desert : the Taliban quickly captured him and took him prisoner , overjoyed to have him as a bargaining chip . The military , upon realization that he was gone , deployed a massive - scale rescue operation to retrieve him , as per the philosophy of ' No man left behind ' . This operation affected the course of the war at that time . While looking for him , soldiers found themselves in places they would n't have been and doing things they would n't have been doing if he had n't gone AWOL . And , as happens in war , some soldiers died during these operations . These soldiers ' families and loved ones , as well as other military people , attributed these deaths to Bergdahl 's selfish actions , and thus they see him as being responsible for those deaths . Bergdahl was finally rescued , and there were a lot of mixed feelings about how he should be treated , if he is indeed a traitor or just misguided , and whether his actions lead to the deaths of other Americans . So , a lot of people hate him and think he 's been given a slap on the wrist . Edit : Bergdahl did n't walk off into an actual desert , as has been pointed out . The Paktika province is mountainous and arid , certainly not friendly to outsiders .", "label": "hc3human"}

A nonresident's presence for business in Massachusetts will ordinarily be considered casual, isolated and inconsequential if it meets the requirements of the Ancillary Activity Test (AAT) and Examples. When nonresidents earn or derive income from sources both within Massachusetts and elsewhere, and no exact determination can be made of the amount of Massachusetts source income, an apportionment of income must be made to determine that amount considered Massachusetts gross income. 4th - Apportionment of Income:   Apportionment Methods:   The three most common apportionment methods used to determine Massachusetts source income are as follows:   Gross income is multiplied by a:   So if you go to Massachusetts to work, you have to pay the tax.

If anything, your company might have to pay Oregon taxes on revenue you generate (you are their agent or employee in Oregon).   Does the answer change depending on whether the income is reported at 1099 or W-2? This shouldn't matter legally.  It's possible that it would be easier to see that the work was done in Oregon in one or the other.  I.e. it doesn't make any legal difference but may make a practical difference.

{"text": "Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.\nComputer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\nThe scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, multi-dimensional data from a 3D scanner, or medical scanning devices. The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems.\nSub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image restoration.", "label": "hc3human"}

Glow in the dark objects contain a compound ( phosphors ) that can be excited by light . The compound absorbs the light energy by using it to put its electrons in a higher energy shell . If you imagine the Bohr atomic model with the rings around the center , the electron would be moving away from the center therefore occupying a high energy state . The atoms in the compound then release the energy via moving the electron back to its lower energy state ( closer to the middle of the atom ) and this energy release is given off as light . What color the light is when it 's released depends on what compound is used , and what wavelength / energy value is absorbed / emitted by that compound .

For brokers who charge extra to manually route, this could be a good policy if the exchange chosen has very high rebates.

{"text": "I think your premise is slightly flawed. Every investment can add or reduce risk, depending on how it's used. If your ordering above is intended to represent the probability you will lose your principal, then it's roughly right, with caveats. If you buy a long-term government bond and interest rates increase while you're holding it, its value will decrease on the secondary markets. If you need/want to sell it before maturity, you may not recover your principal, and if you hold it, you will probably be subject to erosion of value due to inflation (inflation and interest rates are correlated). Over the short-term, the stock market can be very volatile, and you can suffer large paper losses. But over the long-term (decades), the stock market has beaten inflation. But this is true in aggregate, so, if you want to decrease equity risk, you need to invest in a very diversified portfolio (index mutual funds) and hold the portfolio for a long time. With a strategy like this, the stock market is not that risky over time. Derivatives, if used for their original purpose, can actually reduce volatility (and therefore risk) by reducing both the upside and downside of your other investments. For example, if you sell covered calls on your equity investments, you get an income stream as long as the underlying equities have a value that stays below the strike price. The cost to you is that you are forced to sell the equity at the strike price if its value increases above that. The person on the other side of that transaction loses the price of the call if the equity price doesn't go up, but gets a benefit if it does. In the commodity markets, Southwest Airlines used derivatives (options to buy at a fixed price in the future) on fuel to hedge against increases in fuel prices for years. This way, they added predictability to their cost structure and were able to beat the competition when fuel prices rose. Even had fuel prices dropped to zero, their exposure was limited to the pre-negotiated price of the fuel, which they'd already planned for. On the other hand, if you start doing things like selling uncovered calls, you expose yourself to potentially infinite losses, since there are no caps on how high the price of a stock can go. So it's not possible to say that derivatives as a class of investment are risky per se, because they can be used to reduce risk. I would take hedge funds, as a class, out of your list. You can't generally invest in those unless you have quite a lot of money, and they use strategies that vary widely, many of which are quite risky.", "label": "hc3human"}

Those 'returns' are not the same as the earnings of individual investors (which will be on the basis of dividends paid by the company [which are often annual, sometimes semi-annual, and sometimes quarterly], and by selling shares purchased previously.

So they created \" secret \" ways of identifying each other , through the use of handshakes and phrases and such . So , you get the job as a recommendation from a family friend who 's also a mason . He walks you in , and on day 1 , bring you in to the guys that run the operation . They tell you \" Friday , give the guy at the door this hand shake , and come in to get your money \" . They would separate their ranks with different hand shakes and passphrases , so your apprentices are n't getting paid the same as your master stone crafters . A lot of people in the same guild would end up living and working together in the same areas , and so the guild would end up using its funds to look after members in the area . Kind of like a selective community service . Over time , its become much easier to get around this proof of identity problem . But , who you know can still carry you pretty far in life . So they 've dropped the part about actually being stone mason workers , and focus more on are you a good person , do you know someone here that can vouch for you being a good person , and are you going to do community service with us . Because of the focus of community service , and a lot of people being Free Mason members during the early US , Masons end up having a pretty strong connection to local church congregations , and tend to be involved in the same kind of community service . As for the symbols , Wikipedia can probably explain with some good detail .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Regarding the opportunity cost comparison, consider the following two scenarios assuming a three-year lease: Option A: Keep your current car for three years In this scenario, you start with a car that's worth $10,000 and end with a car that's worth $7,000 after three years. Option B: Sell your current car, invest proceeds, lease new car Here, you'll start out with $10,000 and invest it.  You'll start with $10,000 in cash from the sale of your old car, and end with $10,000 plus investment gains. You'll have to estimate the return of your investment based on your investing style.   Option C: Use the $10k from proceeds as down payment for new car In this scenario you'll get a reduction in finance charges on your lease, but you'll be out $10,000 at the end. Overall Cost Comparison To compare the total cost to own your current car versus replacing it with a new leased car, first look up the cost of ownership for your current car for the same term as the lease you're considering.  Edmunds offers this research and calls it True Cost to Own.   Specifically, you'll want to include depreciation, fuel, insurance, maintenance and repairs.  If you still owe money you should also factor the remaining payments.  So the formula is: Cost to keep car = Depreciation + Fuel + Insurance + Maintenance + Repairs On the lease side consider taxes and fees, all lease payments, fuel, and maintenance.  Assume repairs will be covered under warranty.  Assume you will put down no money on the lease and you will finance fees, taxes, title, and license when calculating lease payments.  You also need to consider the cost to pay off your current car's loan if applicable.  Then you should subtract the gains you expect from investing for three years the proceeds from the sale of your car. Assume that repairs will be covered under warranty.  The formula to lease looks like: Lease Cost = Fuel + Insurance + Maintenance + Lease payments - (gains from investing $10k) For option C, where you use the $10k from proceeds as down payment for new lease, it will be: Lease Cost = Fuel + Insurance + Maintenance + Lease payments + $10,000 A somewhat intangible factor to consider is that you'll have to pay for body damage to a leased car at the end of the lease, whereas you are obviously free to leave damage unrepaired on your own vehicle.", "label": "hc3human"}

The program is designed as a deep learning system.\nAlphaFold AI software has had two major versions. A team of researchers that used AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) in December 2018. The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. \nA team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020. The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group. It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.\nAlphaFold 2's results at CASP were described as \"astounding\" and \"transformational.\" Some researchers noted that the accuracy is not high enough for a third of its predictions, and that it does not reveal the mechanism or rules of protein folding for the protein folding problem to be considered solved. Nevertheless, there has been widespread respect for the technical achievement.\nOn 15 July 2021 the AlphaFold 2 paper was published at Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes.[10][11][12]", "label": "hc3human"}

If I tell you that a number divided by 12 has a remainder of 7 , you ca n't know for sure that the original number was 31 even though you know exactly what I did to get the answer . That 's because modulo ( getting the remainder of a division problem ) is a one - way function : there 's no way to get the original from the result . Hashes are all one - way functions . But unlike modulo division , the formula is so complex that we do n't know a way to find answers other than guess - and - check , and instead of twelve possible answers , there are something like 13407807929942597099574024998205846127479365820592393377723561443721764030073546976801874298166903427690031858186486050853753882811946569946433649006084096 possible answers , so checking different things to see if they give you the right hash is not feasible unless you have a few centuries .

He was actually trying to chase him down , when he saw his center was in trouble , wheeled his Calvary back towards the battle , and hit the Persian center from the rear . Also , when he crashed into the Persian center , he was actually attacking a majority of the Greek Mercenaries who had been placed in the center before battle commenced , not just the Persian infantry . Once the mercenaries ( and Persians ) realized that Darius was fleeing and the battle was lost , they all began to retreat themselves .

{"text": "* * WHY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect normal people , the SEC has created all sorts of rules and regulations for how companies that invest money on behalf of other people should operate . While this makes the investments safer and less volatile , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing riskier but possibly more profitable investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge funds are companies that make these investments . They are not allowed to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with less than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such as pension funds , banks , insurance companies , college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to get into a good hedge fund , as not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take on , but they are also rated on the rate of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , hedge funds gather large piles of money from very wealthy institutions and invest it on their behalf . The goal is to do two things . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you look at all the stocks on the market , odds are almost all of them went up . A rising tide lifts all boats . This is referred to as beta . Most assets , or portfolios of assets , will move in the direction of general market . Alpha is finding assets that go up even more than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is supposed to be the ability to find assets that will do this . The other goal of hedge funds is to earn absolute returns . What this means is that they make money every year , regardless of what the stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were able to do that , and many of them went out of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by various clients . A hedge fund is normally staffed by veterans of the financial services industry , typically people who have worked for a long time at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . After accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley , or commercial banks with investment banking arms , such as Citigroup or Bank of America , to borrow large sums of money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and make 10 % , you make $ 10 . But if you borrow $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , and you made $ 100 ( less interest ) for your investors off the $ 100 they invested with you . ( The downside of this is that if you lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds though , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear what leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and rumors drive trades ) . The hedge funds like to borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding the need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you 're doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs . Maybe in the process of that , you meet their hedge fund clients , and talk up your business to them to drive demand for your stock , while they hear from the CFO and CEO personally , and make better decisions than the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for investment banks , with investor money , contacts at investment banks , and large piles of borrowed money . What do they invest in ? The short answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most simple funds . They buy some stocks , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Macro - These funds invest in assets that will give them exposure to broad economic forces , which they hope to predict . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - denominated assets . Do you think we 've hit peak oil ? Buy oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became famous for making billions for predicting that England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning that no one knows what their criteria are , as it is a trade secret . Often they write computer programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and go long or short on them . High frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can buy stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a fund that combs through publicly available filings through the Food and Drug Administration , looking for any changes regarding new drugs , to use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , the buy or sell short assets whose price will be affected by future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires another , usually the buyer 's stock goes down , as they are probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock jumps , as someone is about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy the prey . In the movie * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen uses contacts with a law firm to find clients of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort of strategy , and is arrested when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy is John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took this approach . ( I believe Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope is that returns will be less volatile and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a pretty long list of other recognized strategies , many too complicated to worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . The founder is now facing 15 to 19 years in prison . It was an effective strategy , but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point of this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they want , and will be judged solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You 've probably already heard about how many hedge funds make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the management fee . If you invest money with a hedge fund ( or anyone for that matter ) , the first thing they do is take a percentage of your money from you and keep it for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , rent office space , and cover overhead until their real payday arrives at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance fee . At the end of the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , and takes a chunk of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion payday for the people who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "First we have to ask , how are you paying ? There are 3 ways that cover almost all prescription costs : * Out of Pocket - You pay what the label says unless you have a friend behind the counter ! * Drug Manufacturer Rebates - Often doctors and other providers can get rebate cards for brand name medications ( often that do n't have a generic ) that effectively discount the drug or can even make it free ! Especially if it is a critical medication . * Insurance or 3rd Reimbursement - This a big and complicated one ! And it starts with an example story . Originally you could go to the pharmacy and pick up your medication no - charge . Companies quickly found out the people were picking up meds that they did n't * really * need and not using them , essentially wasting the insurances money . Something like , picking up a refill on nausea medication every month even though you only used a few pills from the first bottle . So began the practice of Co - pay . The insurance company * tells the pharmacy * a dollar amount the customer is supposed to be charged based on many factors , so many that most any pharmacy will refuse to quote a price because even their best guess is often wrong . Essentially it is supposed to be a dollar amount to ' encourage ' the patient to only get what they need and to get the ' right ' medication . Some factors * may * include : * The right pharmacy - some big insurances have special contracts with big players like walgreens . * * more pharmacy issues below * * * The insurance plan - Many insurances have a huge numer of plans that all require different levels of reimbursement and co - pay * The brand of Drug - And not just Brand name vs Generic ! Often insurance companies may be owned or have contracts for discounted rates with drug manufacturers . So depending , they might ' prefer ' for you to buy all your generics from one over another . * Has the doctor given you other treatments - Have an ear infection ? Did the doctor try the cheap / basic antibiotic before writing for that high end brand name antibiotic ? A copay of 150 dollars vs 10 for the other will help encourage you to the cheaper option for them , while not explicitly forcing you to . The final charge of the Pharmacy . This is the last and could be the most signifigant factor . Ask around ! Often a pharmacist can advise you . Because this is such a complex process you might find it cheaper to buy some of your medications out of pocket from one generic company rather than paying the copay and using a more expensive generic . Also pharmacies that allow Pharmacists to change price may let you personally negotiate if you are paying out of pocket . ( Big places like Walgreens usually do n't , but some places like Homeland and smaller independent pharmacies do ) The goofiest part is what insurance pays vs the advertised price . Prices are purposely stated high and then the insurance negotiates them lower . Walgreens might quote 250 dollars for a drug , but the insurance actually pays 20 . Unfortunately paying out of pocket they try to charge you the ' sticker price ' , especially at big chains . Going different places they may offer you a cash - out - of - pocket discount because the price does n't reflect what it actually costs . This is usually sort of under the table so to speak , so do n't hesitate to ask the pharmacist and call around , especially to privately owned pharmacies . Most are glad to help , but do n't assume that they can * always * cut your costs in two !", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Wrote an essay about this topic for my 3rd year evolutionary psychology class last semester . Basically , there 's no definitive answer yet but there a couple popular hypotheses for why homosexuality has persisted in males : * * * Female Fecundity Hypothesis * * - states that certain genes , when possessed by males , predispose them towards a homosexual orientation . However , these genes are not eliminated from the gene pool because they drastically increase the reproductive fitness when inherited by a female . ELI5 version - So given certain gene , if male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby making * * * The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis * * Argues that genes that express feminine physical characteristics and personality traits increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version - being a little bit feminine can increase your chances of getting lucky with the opposite gender , but too much feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in the past , males used sexual contact with other males as a way to form / strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient Greece , it was not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual behaviour with younger males while being married to a woman . Also note that it is only within the past couple centuries that the division of sexuality into heterosexual and homosexual identities has occurred .

{"text": "netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows (e.g. debits/credits, payments/receipts, income/expense) by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows, creating one transaction.   For example, if you make two trades in one day with your broker - one to buy a security for $100 and one to sell it for $110 - rather then you sending your broker $100 and them sending you $110, the transactions are \"netted\" - meaning they will send you the \"net\" amount of $10 ($110 inflow - $100 outflow). In a more general sense (\"netting of instructions\") it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the \"net\" effect - e.g. one step forward, two steps back would combine to a \"net\" one step back.  Most likely it will apply to the exchange of money, but it could be applied more broadly. Note that there doesn't have to be both inflows and outflows. You can also \"net\" multiple inflows (or outflows) into one transaction by just adding them all up, but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows.", "label": "hc3human"}

When something falls and hits the ground , a force of sufficient energy to stop the object is applied at the point of contact .

In the case of a person , while the magnitude of the force may be 5 , 10 , or 20X higher , it is spread over a MUCH larger area and so the stress on the floor is actually lower . In addition to this , a person 's foot and body compress and absorb the energy of the impact over a distance , as opposed to a hard weight which does not yield at all . This lowers the amount of energy transferred to the floor , and it 's the reason why cars are designed to crumple in a crash .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I have a colleague who always leases cars first.  He's very well off, has piles of money in savings, owns a home, and the cherry on top, he could just write a check for the car....   He sees the lease as an insurance policy on the first couple of years of the car's life.  If it gets in an accident or he finds something about it he doesn't like, he can give it back to the dealer at the end of the term with no hassle and move on to the next car.  Some people value the fact that a lease is a rental.   If you're leasing a luxury car or something you couldn't otherwise afford, no amount of mental gymnastics will turn this in to a good idea.   Separately, you should never make a down payment on a lease.  If the car is totaled early on, you will not recoupe the money you put down.  The issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different.  If the leased car is totaled, the bank gets its money back from an insurer.  If that payment doesn't cover the value of the car, the GAP insurance will cover it.  In either situation, if there's an excess remaining it will be returned to you.  The issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment.  If you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you couldn't just simply choose to lease a used car; like you could in the case of a purchase.  Additionally, GAP is generally included in a lease whether you want it or not.

There probably are other types , but the basic premise is running a program on an infected machine with a specific purpose . What that purpose is depends entirely on the intentions of the creator . Take stuxnet for example . This was most likely the product of US - Israeli collaboration with the extremely specific purpose of shutting down certain parts of an Irani nuclear powerplant . Since that powerplant had closed circuit electronics ( not connected to internet or other networks ) the virus needed to be implemented manually . The way it worked was quite ingenious . It spread through the internet but only to other computers that were physically closer to its intended target . The goal was to eventually infect a usb - stick that would be connected to the closed circuit of the nuclear power plant , which it did after a 2 year journey on the internet . The damage it caused took 2 years to repair . Anyway , most viruses are written for some form of gain .

{"text": "For any isolated equity market, its beta will less resemble the betas of all other interconnected equity markets.  For interconnected markets, beta is not well-dispersed, especially during a world expansion because richer nations have more wealth thus a dominant influence over smaller nations' equity markets causing a convergence.  If the world is in recession, or a country is in recession, all betas or the recessing country's beta will start to diverge, respectively.  If the world's economies diverge, their equity markets' betas will too.  If a country is having financial difficulty, its beta too will diverge. Beta is correlation against a ratio of variance, so variance or \"volatiliy\" is only half of that equation.  Correlation or \"direction\" is the other half.  The ratio of variance will give the magnitude of beta, and correlation will give the sign or \"direction\". Therefore, interconnected emerging equity markets should have higher beta magnitudes because they are more variant but should generally over time have signs that more closely resemble the rest.  A disconnected emerging equity market will improbably have average betas both by magnitude and direction.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I think the problem is that you've made a math error. This child would not be costing you 300 per month, it will be costing you 1400 per month.  1100 of this is in a donation of salable hours rather than cash, but helpfully you have a number right there as to how much someone is willing to pay for these hours so the math is still doable. So, if you are indeed splitting your expenses fifty-fifty, you should chip 1100 into the pot to match your wife's contribution.  It would make the most sense, I think, to have your part of this contribution cover some of your mutual expenses, and if any is left over, save it up for the day that your child would cost more than that 300 in a month - when you need extra clothes, or have to replace something they destroyed, or want to pay for extra opportunities (camps, educational games, lessons), or a a savings that can be used for major future expenses (higher education, first car, milestone celebrations, safety net when starting out). Of course, if your family is indeed a priority, you might consider making an equal investment in your family - say, half your income (1800) to match half her time going into the building of the family.  After all, the decision to start a family should be an investment of time and value, not just a minimum bid for expenses.  And again, any extra can be spent on mutual expenses, saved up for future costs, or left as your child's \"savings\" for major expenses or safety net. I suppose I should mention that you perhaps could get away with covering half her contribution (550 per month, on the face of it), as that should also \"balance\" out the monthly expenses.  Even this much would be enough to put her back into the green on her covering her own costs.  Of course, in this case you might want to take into account that while she's working 38,5 hours per week now, running a household is, I've heard, more closely equivalent to a 60-hour week, plus or minus being \"on call\" for a further 100 hours a week.  Trying to calculate the absolute minimum payment on your part to match the investment of hours on hers is likely to be a bit more tricky than just matching the salable hours not worked, if you're set on income ratios and splitting costs \"as they are\". Also, you might want to rethink your criteria for sharing income completely or what makes certain divisions of costs \"unfair\". You mention one reason it would be unfair is that you have a \"more stressful job\" - well, your job may well be more stressful than her job now, but it is likely to be less so than raising a child (her new job).  As for investment of time and energy for your education entitling you to a larger amount of pay, again, raising a child is likely to be a larger investment of time, money, and anxiety than your education, but her pay (or even share of the costs) doesn't seem to be balanced in response.

{"text": "My mother managed a rental car business for 40 years and I remember how it used to work . New cars are purchased every year for the rental fleet . Back in the day you would receive one key and the rental company would keep one incase you got locked out of your vehicle . You would call and a rental associate would drive out and open the door for you or if you had lost your keys they would get a new key cut from the spare they kept and bring the new key to you . Often they had key cutters behind the counter or in the maintenance area . When cars were rented going to distant cities , those cars still belonged to the rental company in the city that originally supplied them . This is still true today . Once a week or so , if a rental had not been made that would bring the car back to its point of origin , a group of rental car employees would \" dead head \" all the cars from the city they were going to and pickup all of their cars in that city and bring them home . Keys often became confused in these mass car convoys so companies maintained the extras to cut new keys from at need . When the annual fleet was sold off to a wholesaler there was always a drawer full of keys left behind . I used to own thousands to play with as a child . In modern times , keys are coded to the specific car and have computer chips imbedded inside them . Rental car companies can no longer afford to have employees waiting around for you to get locked out or have other trouble they can drive out and fix . Cars are computer tracked so if they go out of the original city they just stay gone until the end of the year when the wholesaler picks them up from wherever they happen to be at the time . No more mass convoys dead heading cars around . When the cars are sold at the end of the year all of the keys have to go with the vehicle .

{"text": "A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex software and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe.\nComplex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are \"complex\" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions.\nThe term complex systems often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to reductionism, which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.\nAs an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of self-organization and critical phenomena from physics, that of spontaneous order from the social sciences, chaos from mathematics, adaptation from biology, and many others. Complex systems is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines, including statistical physics, information theory, nonlinear dynamics, anthropology, computer science, meteorology, sociology, economics, psychology, and biology.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is a belief among some people that there is a \" gay agenda \" , a movement to intentionally change ( American ) society . Some people think that homosexuality in any form is evil , particularly if you interpret the bible in a certain way that seems to indicate that God himself views homosexuality as a sin . So , to them , just as we should not glorify murder and rape , we should also not accept homosexuality as a common place way of life . People who believe this way see sinister motives in even people just wanting to make marriage between two men legal , abolishing laws banning sex in forms other than the missionary position , and granting them non - discriminatory rights , such as hospital visitation or fair employment and housing - you should n't be denied a job or a home just because you are gay . The gay agenda to them is any movement in society which alters society 's perception of homosexuality away from viewing them as subhuman evil people to normal human beings who just want to live like everyone else . Making them equal , making them normal , and making them accepted is a gay agenda , intended to brainwash the youth into thinking that this lifestyle is acceptable . Hidden within all of that is the premise that homosexuality is a choice . If it were n't then it would be cruel of God to make people that way without a way to change it , and it would make it harder to condemn people to hell if it was n't something that they willingly chose . I can feel morally superior to a woman who has sex outside of marriage and say she 's going to hell for her choice . It would be really difficult to condemn all women as being sinners , saying that they share the same gender as Eve and therefore , no women should be able to get into heaven . The more extremist may have paranoid delusions that go far beyond acceptance and think that there is a secret cabal of homosexuals who do n't want to just live their own lives without homophobic laws and moral condemnation of strangers , but rather that they actually want to make some straight people gay , particularly younger children . If you start from the premise that gay people are evil , condemn them , and shun anyone you know who is gay , then your little world will consist of people who are thoroughly straight while gay people will avoid you , hate you , and hide their sexuality from you . To these extremists , this justifies their thinking that gay people are very rare , only a perverted very small minority that wants to spread their condition , their thinking , their disease to innocent youth . Then , when some teenager comes out as being gay within their small , sheltered inner circle , they conclude it was the work of gays MAKING the child gay . They assume a default position of straight and choosing to be gay is like your child getting a haircut and dying it purple . Their ideal world on earth is where everyone is straight and God - fearing , and so any attempts to normalize homosexuals is seen as purely evil , the work of an agenda that wants to persecute their beliefs . It helps that if they feel like they are being persecuted for their belief that homosexuality is evil , they feel akin to Jesus , and while they are n't being literal martyrs , getting people opposing their beliefs makes them feel like they are metaphorical martyrs for God .", "label": "hc3human"}

Could you just cut it up forever , into ever tinier and tinier pieces ? If we cut up salt , we 're going to get tinier and tinier pieces . But eventually we get down to one piece that is so small ( too small to actually see ) that if we cut it up , it is n't really salt any more . That one piece of salt is what we call a * molecule * , and it is made up of one * atom * each of two different natural substances ... sodium and chlorine ( NaCl ) . Sodium and chlorine by themselves are n't really anything like salt . It 's only when they are combined in that particular way that we get the stuff we call salt . They each have very particular properties when they are on their own , and are quite different than salt . For example , chlorine tends to make a poisonous gas ! And if you throw a big chunk of pure sodium into water , look out ... it will probably explode . But put the two things together and it makes common table salt , which we eat all the time . Weird , huh ? We used to think that atoms were the smallest possible things . It turns out , that 's not quite true . In nature it mostly is , but people have come up with ways to figure out what makes up atoms , and even to separate them . If you could cut up those atoms even further , you 'd get stuff like protons , neutrons , and electrons . Most atoms are made of those three things , but the numbers of each is what gives the different atoms their properties . So we get stuff like gold , or helium , or iron just from the combination of different numbers of protons , neutrons and electrons . * * EDIT * * : How many atoms are in a grain of salt ?

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the party's nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party; Clinton won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College vote, thereby losing the election to Donald Trump.\nRaised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, Clinton co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the Clinton health care plan\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. Clinton advocated for gender equality at the 1995 UN conference on women. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.\nIn 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York and became the first First lady to simultaneously hold elected office, and then the first former First lady to serve in the Senate. She was re-elected in 2006 and chaired the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee from 2003 to 2007. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was impacted in the September 11 attacks. She supported the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State in the first term of the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton established the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya but was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Her use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election.\nClinton made a second presidential run in 2016, winning the Democratic nomination, and ran in the general election with Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College, despite winning the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups.", "label": "hc3human"}

If you have more things than your opponent , then it 's much easier to win . If you can make more threats than your opponent can deal with , then one of them will work - that 's the basis behind tactics . Common ways include a fork ( one piece attacking two , and opponent can only move one out of the way ) , a pin ( if you move the attacked piece out of the way , whatever is behind it still gets attacked ) , and getting something accomplished while making a check ( move a piece that is in threat in a way that checks the opponent before making a capture , rather than after ) . Positional play is a lot more subtle . The idea is that if you can arrange your pieces so that you have better options than your opponent , you can win . Consider your knight in the starting position . You can either move it up two and to the middle of the board , or up two and to the side of the board . If you move it to the middle , it has many more moves it could make , so it 's a better position for the knight to be in .

If the asset appreciation is realized, meaning you've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it, then Derek_6424246 has provided a good route to follow.   However, if the gains are unrealized, meaning only that the current value of the underlying asset(s) have increased or decreased, then you might want to record this under an Income:Unrealized Gains account.  One of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event (realized) or just want to better track your net worth at a given time (unrealized).   For example, I generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest, dividends and contributions, as income from an Income:Unrealized Gains account.  I can still reconcile it with my statements, and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth, but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything.

Cavitation is when small vapor - filled cavities appear inside liquid . The odd thing about them is that apart from vapor of whatever fluid they 're in , the cavities are vacuum , and thus almost immediately after forming , they 'll slam shut with a great deal of force , producing shockwaves in the fluid they 're in which can cause sharp popping noises , and even in some cases can cause light to be emitted . You can do a fun experiment with cavitation ( if you do n't mind destroying a glass bottle ) . Take an empty glass bottle and something rigid , and tap the top of the bottle with it ; the top of the neck with motion towards the base of the bottle . You can put quite a bit of force into it and not damage the bottle . Now , fill the bottle with still water and leave it uncovered for an hour or so to allow all the bubbles to leave , then whack the bottle in the same way . Once you hit a certain force , which is way less than the force required to break the glass , you 'll end up with the entire bottom of the bottle being blown out by cavitation shockwaves . You end up causing the bottle to move faster than the water within can keep up with , which creates vacuum bubbles at the base of the column of water inside the bottle , right above the base of the bottle . These cavitation bubbles will then slam shut , causing incredibly powerful shockwaves which will blow out the base of the bottle .", "label": "hc3human"}

A hobbit , human , or dwarf can not really unlock its true potential , but a being like Gandalf ( not human , although he might look like it ) or a powerful elf such as Galadriel would . Samwise briefly managed to use a portion of the ring 's power when rescuing Frodo from the goblins in Mordor after he was stung and paralyzed , even though Sam did n't wear it . By summoning up his courage and wielding Sting in his rescue , the goblins saw Sam as a tall , armored figure wielding a glimmering blade and in his other hand holding a terrible , menacing power ( the ring on the chain ) . This vision was overpowering to the goblins and they fled in fear , not daring to oppose such a being . This is how \" power \" works in the Tolkien setting . It is n't as simple as throwing lightning around as other fantasy settings would express it . Powerful beings in Middle Earth are capable of seeing things that others can not , or shaping the perception of others so they see or do not see what the wielder desires . This could be used to shape the path of nations , corrupt the king of the Rohan or the steward of Gondor , and motivate the Fellowship . When Gandalf intimidates Frodo when talking about the ring right at the start , he is just revealing how much more powerful he is than Frodo to make the point that if he wanted the ring he could take it . The power given to the Nine is expressed through their transformation into Ring - wraiths . Their scream breaks the will of those who hear it ( allies aside ) , destroying their ability to act . It is more powerful than just breaking moral , it is pure despair ; a soldier who heard such a scream might simply fall to their knees and drop their sword and shield , waiting to be executed by oncoming orcs . They might not even have the hope to flee . The ability of the rings to render their wearer invisible to anyone , even Gandalf , is only a portion of what it could do but is a blatant expression of its supremacy . It shows a power that one could not directly oppose ; the leader of the Nine proves this by shattering Gandalf 's staff ( the symbol of his power ) atop Minas Tirith .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "An academic journal or scholarly journal is a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny, and discussion of research. They nearly-universally require peer-review or other scrutiny  from contemporaries competent and established in their respective fields. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, or book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal, according to Henry Oldenburg (the first editor of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society), is to give researchers a venue to \"impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences.\"\nThe term academic journal applies to scholarly publications in all fields; this article discusses the aspects common to all academic field journals. Scientific journals and journals of the quantitative social sciences vary in form and function from journals of the humanities and qualitative social sciences; their specific aspects are separately discussed.\nThe first academic journal was Journal des s\u00e7avans (January 1665), followed soon after by Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (March 1665), and M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (1666).

Basically , statements which are worded in a way that make you believe that they apply to you . If you were to be given horoscope paragraphs without context ( zodiac sign , month ) then you would assume that the statements are just as accurate . The story you will find on Wikipedia is that a psychologist named Forer once gave a personality test to his students and asked them to rate how well they thought it applied to themselves . He gave them all the exact same paragraph and they rated it highly . The eventual conclusion is that you lend credibility to the horoscope by assuming that the horoscope provider is of a good authority , and it is bolstered by you wanting to believe in the horoscopes .

{"text": "Infrared (IR), sometimes called infrared light, is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. It is therefore invisible to the human eye. IR is generally understood to encompass wavelengths from around 1\u00a0millimeter (300\u00a0GHz) to the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum, around 700\u00a0nanometers (430\u00a0THz).[verification needed] Longer IR wavelengths (30 \u03bcm-100 \u03bcm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation range. Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is at infrared wavelengths. As a form of electromagnetic radiation, IR propagates energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon.\nIt was long known that fires emit invisible heat; in 1681 the pioneering experimenter Edme Mariotte showed that glass, though transparent to sunlight, obstructed radiant heat. In 1800 the astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered that infrared radiation is a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer. Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel's studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth's climate.\nInfrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.\nInfrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, to detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect the overheating of electrical components.\nMilitary and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10\u00a0\u03bcm (micrometers). Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It only applies to D & D and games deriving from that . Other systems have different ways of measuring it . The easiest way to understand it is to completely ditch the names . Lawful , Chaotic , Good and Evil all have a shitload of baggage associated with them . So , use different words . It 's not evil or good , it 's Selfish or Selfless . It 's not Lawful or Chaotic , it 's Disciplined or Impulsive . Neutral , of course , means you are n't described as one or the other , but somewhere in between . You 've got the qualities of both , or partial qualities of each . So a Lawful Good person is one who favors Disciplined approaches to things , and has a Selfless Outlook . They favor organization and structure . It 's not that they 're necessarily opposed to free - form and unorganized things , they just prefer organized ones . A Chaotic Evil person is one who favors a loose fit and looks out for themselves first and foremost . So long as they get theirs , they will leave everyone else to their own devices , and they do n't see the point in a lot of structure or organization for a variety of reasons - it 's too restricting of new ideas or new ways of doing something , organizations always end up with tons of exceptions to their rules anyway , and so on . A Lawful Person is the sort of person who , when confronted with a problem , starts going down a checklist to isolate , identify and eventually eradicate the problem . A Chaotic Person tends to try one thing , then something else , then a third thing and so on , with no real structure to their probing beyond their instincts . Both approaches can be equally valid - the lawful one may fair better in auto repair , but the chaotic one may have a better approach for hunting . A Good person is one who favors assisting the most people possible with the least amount of effort . If they themselves have to take a minor hit , they 're fine with it as long as the net benefit is good ( Something like a multi - billionaire looking to reform tax code as they believe it overly taxes the poor while not taxing the rich enough , for example ) An Evil person is one who does n't necessarily mean anyone else any harm , but they see nothing wrong with noting that a new cashier in the store is about to open the register and getting in the new line ahead of the elderly man with a cart of groceries and a stack of coupons and the mother trying to keep her kids under control . People who might benefit themselves and others by getting out of the store faster . They look to benefit themselves first and foremost , and rarely look to benefit others . A Neutral ( with respect to Good and Evil ) person is one who looks out for themselves ... but never at the expense of others . In the Grocery example , they 'll sit for a moment and wait for the cashier to turn the light on and see if anyone else notices before moving over . In the tax example , they 'll simply keep their mouth shut and wait for someone else to fix the tax code . It 's simply not their problem to care one way or another . In the organized / disorganized respect , it 's someone who understands the need for structure , but also has a healthy respect for just doing whatever . It 's someone who , when confronted with a problem , will try a couple of instinctual responses first and then try the checklist approach . Most people are going to be Neutral Neutral ( often called True Neutral ) as they do n't lean strongly one way or the other . ... Now , the problem is that this system ALSO tries to tackle maniacal overlords who kill babies and eat puppies because it 's evil to do so . It also tries to tackle entities who would willingly lop off their own limbs if it meant someone else would n't go hungry that day .

A Chaotic Evil person can donate to charity on occasion and still be chaotic evil . A Lawful Good person can curse at a girl scout and still be Lawful Good . Calling it a straightjacket leads you to situations where you can make an argument that one person [ fills all nine slots of the alignment chart ] ( URL_0 ) .

Electrical current is just a movement of these electrons . Secondly , you have to know what electrical potential is . Potential is measured across two points and is a measure of the energy difference between these two points . It 's analogous to gravitational potential energy . If you put a wagon on a hill , it 's going to have lots of potential energy relative to the ground , which means that it wants to roll downhill until it reaches the ground . A piece of metal has lots and lots of electrons , and each has a different energy . Some electrons move quickly to the left , some quickly to the right , some slowly to the right , and some slowly to the left . On average , these electrons are stationary . In a metal , you can give an electron any amount of energy you want , and these electrons can flow . In a semiconductor , things are different . Semiconductors have \" two kinds \" of electrons . Some that stay stationary and some that can move around the sample . The two kinds of electrons are separated by a large gap in energy ( called the band gap ) . Pretty much , this means that the electrons in semiconductors can have energies between 1 and 3 as well as 7 and 10 ( for example ) , but nothing in between 3 and 7 . Now ... light ! Light carries energy , and when it hits a semiconductor , it can give an electron enough energy to promote it from the lower energy state ( the valence band ) to the higher energy state ( the conduction band ) . In my example , the photon has to have an energy of at least 4 . Now , the electron is far away from where it originally was , and can freely move around the sample . This creates a potential , and , as somebody else said , you can harness this potential difference to run your electronic devices . Not all semiconductors are solar cells .

{"text": "Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad Pro. The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, accessing sensitive data, providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji, as well as six degrees of freedom (6DOF) head-tracking, eye-tracking, and other features. Initially released in November 2017 with the iPhone X, it has since been updated and introduced to several new iPhone models, and all iPad Pro models.\nThe Face ID hardware consists of a sensor with three modules; a dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user's face, a module called the flood illuminator that shines infrared light at the face, and an infrared camera which takes an infrared picture of the user, reads the resulting pattern and generates a 3D facial map. This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem, and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently. The system can recognize faces with glasses, clothing, makeup, and facial hair, and adapts to changes in appearance over time.\nFace ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy. Apple claims that Face ID is statistically more advanced than Touch ID fingerprint scanning. It exhibits significantly fewer false positives. Still, Face ID has shown issues at separating identical twins. Multiple security features largely limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks, and only one proof-of-concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded. Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States. Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third-party app developers' access to \"rough maps\" of user facial data, despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data.\nOn some devices, Face ID is unable to recognize users wearing face masks. Apple responded to criticism by offering faster fallback to passcode input, and the option for Apple Watch users to confirm whether they intended to unlock their iPhone. In March 2022, Apple released iOS 15.4 which adds mask-compatible Face ID for iPhone 12 and later devices.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The specific \"State Pension\" plan you have linked to is provided by the government of the U.K. to workers resident there. More generally speaking, many countries provide some kind of basic worker's pension (or \"social security\") to residents.  In the United States, it is called (surprise!) \"Social Security\", and in Canada most of us call ours \"Canada Pension Plan\".  Such pensions are typically funded by payroll deductions distinct & separate from income tax deducted at source.  You can learn about the variety of social security programs around the world courtesy of the U.S. Social Security Administration's own survey. What those and many other government or state pensions have in common, and the term or concept that I think you are looking for, is that they are typically defined benefit type of plans.  A defined benefit or DB plan is where there is a promised (or \"defined\") benefit, i.e. a set lump sum amount (such as with a \"cash balance\" type of DB plan) or income per year in retirement (more typical). (Note: Defined benefit plans are not restricted to be offered by governments only. Many companies also offer DB plans to their employees, but DB plans in the private sector are becoming more rare due to the funding risk inherent in making such a long-term promise to employees.) Whereas a defined contribution or DC plan is one where employee and/or employer put money into a retirement account, the balance of which is invested in a selection of funds. Then, at retirement the resulting lump sum amount or annual income amounts (if the resulting balance is annuitized) are based on the performance of the investments selected. That is, with a DC plan, there is no promise of you getting either a set lump sum amount or a set amount of annual income at retirement!  The promise was up front, on how much money they would contribute.  So, the contributions are defined (often according to a matching contribution scheme), yet the resulting benefit itself is not defined (i.e. promised.) Summary: DB plans promise you the money (the benefit) you'll get at retirement. DC plans only promise you the money (the contributions) you get now.", "label": "hc3human"}

The most efficient packing of those molecules , the way they all get as close as possible to the others , is to form a sphere . All planets are round for this reason , as well as many moons ( although not all of the tiny ones ) . Because the Earth rotates , it bulges out a little at the equator through the action of centrifigual force .

{"text": "It is n't allowed per se . The players still get penalized . The severity of the penalty varies league by league ; in minor leagues it is a game misconduct and the player is ejected , in the NHL it is a 5 - minute penalty and the player is ineligible to play for the next 5 minutes . Fighting was banned in both basketball and baseball because they are both ( mostly ) non - contact sports . Football is a contact sport however there is just as much downtime as there is playing time therefor the tension and player temper is a lot lower . With the fast pace of hockey , tension and tempers can boil over . A lot of minor slashes , hits and bumps that would otherwise not be judge to be worth a penalty annoy the opposing player and sometimes they retaliate and a fight ensues . In the past , fighting was used as a deterrent to protect more skilled players . Dave Semenko is probably the most famous for this as his main roll was to protect Wayne Gretzky ; if any opposing player dare touch Gretzky , he 'd have to answer to Semenko . This led to other teams employing fighters as a strategy to take care of other teams tough guys . This was the era of the enforcer . Bob Probert , Tie Domi and many other players had very little role other than to fight the other teams tough guy . One common justification is that winning a fight could \" swing momentum \" in a game and your team would play better . This has not been proven despite study . In the mid 90s the NHL tried to curtail fighting by adding the \" enforcer rule \" . If a player is judged to be the initiator of a fight that player may be penalized an extra 2 minutes and/or receive a 10 - minute misconduct . That cut down on fights as retaliation . In short , the NHL allows fighting because they 've never banned it . The keepers of the game view it as an important part of the sport .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I had this happen to me with parking ticket when I was still in school.  The tickets were issued by the school police and later dismissed (because I had purchased a year-long parking pass).  3 years later I got a letter alleging that I had unpaid parking ticket.  So they lost the record of dismissal.  But they did not lose the record of having issued the ticket.   I am fairly certain this happens because legal entities either lose electronic records and restore data from backups without realizing that some corrupted data remains lost or because they transition to a new system and certain real-world events don't get transferred properly to the new system.  Of course, the people with whom you end up interacting at that point have no idea of any potential technical problems (because they may occur only in some technical one-off cases).  In my case, I was able to show that I had received a judgement of dismissal.  I actually kept the paperwork. The question is what do you do if you lost the records and the state had lost all electronic records of your payments.  Let's assume the collections agency has a record (produced by the state) that you owed the ticket amount, but the state claims that no record exists of you having paid the tickets.  What do you do, then? Carefully compile the list of all possible banks which you could have possibly used.  Then request duplicate statements from all the banks which you have on that list.  Assuming you were a regular consumer and not running a business, this should not amount to more than 100 pages or so.  If you do manage to find the transactions in those bank records, you are in luck.  States, unlike the federal government, are not immune from law suits.  So you can consult a lawyer.   By fraudulently claiming that you defaulted on payments, the state caused you material harm (by lowering your credit rating and increasing your cost of borrowing).  Once you have all the paperwork in hand, you still will have difficult time finding anyone in the state to listen to you.  And even if you do, you will not be compensated for the time and expenses you expanded to obtain these records. If you indeed paid the tickets, then you are being asked to prove your innocence and you are assumed guilty until you do.  Again, a good lawyer should be able to do something with that to get you a proper compensation for this.", "label": "hc3human"}

His peak rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. From 1984 until his retirement in 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for a record 255 months overall for his career, the most in history. Kasparov also holds records for the most consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).\nKasparov became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the Professional Chess Association. In 1997 he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls when he lost to the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicized match. He continued to hold the \"Classical\" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Despite losing the title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world's highest-rated player when he retired from professional chess in 2005.\nSince retiring, he devoted his time to politics and writing. He formed the United Civil Front movement and joined as a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year's Russian presidential race, but after encountering logistical problems in his campaign, for which he blamed \"official obstruction\", he withdrew. In the wake of the Russian mass protests that began in 2011, he announced in 2013 that he had left Russia for the immediate future out of fear of persecution. Following his flight from Russia, he had lived in New York City with his family.[10] In 2014, he obtained Croatian citizenship, and has maintained a residence in Podstrana near Split.[11][12][13]\nKasparov is currently chairman of the Human Rights Foundation and chairs its International Council. In 2017, he founded the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), an American political organization promoting and defending liberal democracy in the U.S. and abroad. He serves as chairman of the group.

It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.\nInverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in science and mathematics because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They have wide application in system identification, optics, radar, acoustics, communication theory, signal processing, medical imaging, computer vision, geophysics, oceanography, astronomy, remote sensing, natural language processing, machine learning, nondestructive testing, slope stability analysis and many other fields.[citation needed]", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The need for a new API came simply from evolution of graphic cards and the graphics programming in general - OpenGL and Direct3D are based on certain \" philosophies \" that were decided at the time of old graphic cards - we now have very different graphic cards and we also learned some mistakes that were made in design of those old APIs - OpenGL and Direct3D indeed do evolve and try to improve and reflect the capabilities of modern graphic cards , but they have to keep the old functionality for backward compatibility and their very basic philosophies can not be changed , so it came time to design a brand new API from scratch with all we have learned so far in mind . And that new API is Vulkan . Vulkan for example supports multicore CPUs ( basically non - existent back then , standard today ) , unlike OpenGL . It also tries to minimize the responsibility of graphic drivers , because drivers often greatly affected the performance of the program and the game developers did n't know which drivers their program would run on , they might have been buggy and it was all very messy - with Vulkan developers will have to write a little more code , but they 'll be able to optimize it very well , which means better and more stable performance for us users . Vulkan also takes mobile devices into account etcetc . What the future will be I can not tell , but a lot of graphic programmers seem very excited about it . I personally did n't study Vulkan very much so far so I can not speak for sure , but I hope it will gradually become the new king of graphic APIs . Anyway the change wo n't be instant , do n't expect to see every game to use Vulkan from now on - as with everything , people are used to OpenGL and Direct3D , a lot of projects is written with them and changing to Vulkan would mean a lot of code rewriting , plus all graphic engines are written with OGL / D3D , and they may still be very well usable for smaller projects as such . Wait two years and we 'll be able to tell if Vulkan is actually good ( but I very much believe it is ) .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "It depends primarily on how the Canadian economy is designed i.e export oriented or import oriented. If you look at this, it shows more or less equal amount of exports and imports. For the specific case of Canada, the exports would become costlier, because of a costlier dollar, but at the same time imports would become cheaper. This is only a generalization, not specific goodswise, which would require a more detailed ananlysis. But investors have a different dilemma. Canadian investors would find  it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in Canada. While foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in Canada and may wait for later or invest somehwre else.  Then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates, if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the Canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of Canada. But what would be the final outcome of the whole rigmarole is little difficult to predict, because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do. But the basic gist is Canadian exporters will be sad and Canadian importers will be happy, but vice versa for foreign investors intending to invest in Canada.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD", "label": "hc3human"}

The former is when the share price is higher than the option strike, the second is when share price is right at strike. I agree this is a highly unlikely scenario, because everyone pricing options knows what everyone else in that stock is doing. Much about an option has everything to do with the remaining time to expiration. Depending on how much more the buyer believes the stock will go up before hitting the expiration date, that could make a big difference in which option they would buy. I agree with the others that if you're seeing this as \"real world\" then there must be something going on behind the scenes that someone else knows and you don't. I would tread with caution in such a situation and do my homework before making any move.

{"text": "The company released its 2nd Quarter Revenue of $1,957,921 a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way. Why? If the company is making money shouldn't the stock go up. During the time between earnings announcements, analysts occasionally publish their assessment of a company, including their estimate of the company's value and future earnings. And as part of an earnings report, companies often include \"guidance\": their prediction for the upcoming quarter (this will frequently be a conservative estimate, so they're more likely to achieve it). Investors make their purchase and sale decisions based on this information. When the earnings report comes out, investors compare these actual returns to analysts' predictions and the company's guidance. If their results are in line with these predictions, the stock price is unlikely to move much, as those results are already incorporated into the stock price. If the company is doing better than predicted, it's usually a good sign, and the price often rises; conversely, if it's doing worse, the price will likely fall. But it's not as simple as this. As others have explained, for long-term investors, stock prices are based on expectations of future activity. If the results of that quarter include some one-time actions that are unlikely to repeat, investors will often discount that portion.", "label": "hc3human"}

Typically, if they attempt to run the card with no money, if one of these is in play, you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account, usually savings, or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds.  If you know the transaction went through, and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions, then you have a few options. If you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account, then you have nothing to worry about. If you do not, most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account, that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least $0.  If this is a charge that occurred in the past, and you have already been charged an overdraft fee, there may still be hope.

{"text": "diamonds are intrinsically worthless this is simply wrong. (1) Diamonds that are sold for anything less than, oh, let's say $5000 at original retail - are indeed utterly, totally, completely worthless. It is simply \"one of the great scams\". Their real \"price\" is maybe \"five bucks\". End of story. There is no secondary market.  Literally - \"end of story\". If you buy a \"diamond\" lol for \"$2000\" to impress your loved one, you can not then \"sell it\" for any amount of money.  It is: worthless. Once again: simple, undeniable fact. the diamond you bought for 2 grand cannot be resold. Ir's worthless. (OK, maybe you can get 100 bucks for it, something like that. Or, you can scam someone clueless, and get 200 bucks.) (2) However actual \"investment\" stones do in fact have a value - if somewhat fragile. Example, a few years ago I sold a stone for 30 thousand. That was a \"real\" price and it was quite liquid - I was within days able to find a buyer. (A dealer - he would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever.) I have never dealt in stones over six figures, but I'm fairly certain those are \"real\" valuable objects: just like paintings by name artists. (However: yes, the line between \"laughable diamonds\" and actual investment stones, is indeed moving ever upwards.) (Note - the \"elephant in the room\" with diamonds is that GE's industrial process for simply making utterly flawless diamonds, starting with carbon, is getting better every decade.) (A second overwheleming point that nobody has mentioned: diamonds get beat-up.  Regarding \"engagement ring diamonds\", a used one is exactly as useless as a used car.  It's crap.  Just as with $200,000 picassos, this concept does not apply to \"actual investment stones\".) Note that many of the comments/arguments on this page are very confused because: people are not distinguishing between the (ROFL) \"engagement ring scam market\" and the rarefied \"investment gem market\". The two things are utterly different. Yes, \"engagement ring diamonds\" are an utter scam, and are simply: \"worthless\".  The fundamental, basic, overwhelming scam in today's business/social universe is: \"engagement diamonds\". Yes, the price is only due to marketing/monopolies etc. Elephant in the room A: GE's technology can - end of story - manufacture diamonds.  (Starting with \"pencil leads\".)  End of story.  It's all over. Elephant in the room B: folks forget that diamonds get beat-up, they are just like used cars. Regarding \"engagement-ring diamonds\", nobody has ever, or will ever, bought a used one. Simple, utterly undeniable fact: regarding \"engagement ring diamonds\". they have: zero value.  You cannot resell them. End of story. If you buy a house, you can resell it. If you buy a car, you can resell it (at a spectacular loss). If you buy a picasso, you can resell it (almost always making a huge profit). If you buy an \"engagement ring diamond\", it is worth: nothing. Zero. Nada. strictly regarding investment stones, which is a distinctly utterly different market.  This market has no connection, in any way, at all, even vaguely, it is utterly unrelated, to \"engagement ring diamonds\".  You can in fact buy and sell these items - very much like say \"art\" or \"mid century antiques\", and make money. This market just has utterly no connection to the whole \"engagement ring diamonds\" scam system. Say you buy wine at the supermarket, for 5 to 100 bucks a bottle. If you think that the \"wine\" thus bought, has a secondary market, or you can invest in it or something: you have lost your mind. In total contrast: Yes, although totally flakey, there is indeed an \"investment wine market\" which is real and reasonable. I for example have made some money in that. (I have a great anecdote even - I had one cellar of wine in burgundy, which could have been sold for, say, 30 grand - but we drank it  :)  ) Again, the (somewhat bizarre) actual market in investment wine, just has to \"buying wine in the supermarket\".  To further the analogy: wine prices in the supermarket / your (ROFL) wine dealer, from 5 to 100 bucks, are just: utterly laughable. Utterly. Laughable. Much as folks sit around, and decide on \"label designs\", they sit around, and decide on \"price points\". There is, utterly, no difference between $5 and $100 grape juice rofl \"wine\". The price difference is simply a marketing decision: at best, you can think of it as a Velbin good. ... exactly the same applies to \"engagement ring diamonds\".", "label": "hc3human"}

We do n't typically associate this with irony anymore , but any sort of parlor scene from a detective story is a good example . Verbal irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature . An intended meaning is dramatically different from an expressed meaning . This is typically indicated by tone , gesture , and circumstance . Paralipsis ( talking about something by saying you 're not talking about it ) is the easiest method of verbal irony to translate from performance to written word . Situational or cosmic irony is when the outcome of a series of events is different from the expected outcome .

But in my body my blood cells hold up signs with the letter B on it . My body knows the letter B. If you got hurt and needed to have extra blood , you could n't have mine .

If you don't want to file jointly, there is nothing compelling about your situation to force it. (Grant you, in most countries, there is a benefit to filing jointly) but here, I would argue it would be difficult to make the case. There are, to the best of my knowledge, no laws barring opposite sex landlord-tenant rental situations.  Furthermore, there are no laws barring romantic relationships amongst landlords and tenants.  Indeed, you would need to prove your relationship in some fashion for it to even be considered. In establishing a date of separation from my soon-to-be-ex-wife, for example, I merely needed to prove that we were not \"presenting ourselves as husband and wife.\"  Once I showed that we didn't sit together at church and that she was attending parties I wasn't, that was sufficient.

{"text": "In the debating sense , using logical arguments basically means that you 're able to provide a reasoned explanation for your point of view which does n't rely on logical fallacies . Some examples of logical fallacies include : * * Strawman * * arguments : When you misrepresent the other person 's argument so that it 's easier to attack , e.g. \" You 're saying that < misrepresentation of what the person said > , but clearly that 's not true because < argument of why misrepresented statement is false > . \" * * Ad Hominem * * arguments : When you attack the individual 's character rather than the argument . E.g. bringing up the fact that the individual has used illegal drugs before , and trying to make it sound like he / she is therefore not credible . * * Loaded Questions * * : When you ask your opponent a question which has a loaded assumption built into it and ca n't reasonably be answered without appearing guilty . E.g. asking someone about their drug problems makes other people ( observers of the debate ) assume the person has a substance abuse problem and it makes it difficult for the person to answer without appearing guilty of being involved in drug problems ( even if they do n't even use drugs ) . * * Slippery Slope * * arguments : An example of this is saying something like \" If we allow gays to get married , it 's going to cause our children to become gay . \" The argument does n't really make sense , the false presumption is that allowing one thing to happen will cause another extreme thing to happen , so the first thing should never be allowed to happen . * * ' False Dichotomy ' or ' Black or White ' or ' Either - or ' * * arguments : Where you present two sides of an argument and claim that everyone must either be on one side of the argument or the other and that no middle - ground exists . E.g. If you support this new national - security legislation you are patriotic , if you do n't support the bill you must be unpatriotic . * * Anecdotal * * arguments : Using personal ( isolated ) stories / experience as the basis for your argument while ( typically ) denying any scientific or statistical evidence that counters your position . * * False Cause * * arguments : Arguing that one thing must cause the other because they are correlated . For example , students with high self - esteem tend to have higher IQs , so you may argue that self - esteem affects your IQ and that by increasing self - esteem we can boost students ' IQs . In practice , this does n't work . Boosting self - esteem just causes students to become over - confident in their abilities and no more intelligent than they were before . In reality , students who get high grades tend to have higher self - esteem and higher IQs than students who have low grades , thus self - esteem seems to be related to IQ , but self - esteem does not cause IQ . There are many more examples of logical fallacies , these are just some of the common ones .", "label": "hc3human"}

I have successfully done exactly what you're proposing earlier this year, transferring most of the value from my employer's group personal pension scheme - also Aviva! - to a much lower-cost SIPP.  The lack of any sign of movement by Aviva to post-RDR \"clean priced\" charge-levels on funds was the final straw for me.  My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner!  Transfer paperwork was initiated from the SIPP end but I was careful to make clear to HR people and Aviva's rep (or whatever group-scheme/employee benefits middleman organization he was from) that I was not exiting the company scheme and expected my employee and matching employer contributions to continue unchanged (and that I'd not be happy if some admin mess up led to me missing a month's contributions). There's a bit more on the affair in a thread here.  Aviva's rep did seem to need a bit of a prod to finally get it to happen.  With hindsight my original hope of an in-specie transfer does seem naive, but the out-of-the-market time was shorter and less scary than anticipated. Just in case you're unaware of it, Monevator's online broker list is an excellent resource to help decide who you might use for a SIPP; cheapest choice depends on level of funds and what you're likely to hold in it and how often you'll trade.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Is your name on the title at all? You may have (slightly) more leverage in that case, but co-signing any loans is not a good idea, even for a friend or relative. As this article notes: Generally, co-signing refers to financing, not ownership. If the   primary accountholder fails to make payments on the loan or the retail   installment sales contract (a type of auto financing dealers sell),   the co-signer is responsible for those payments, or their credit will   suffer. Even if the co-signer makes the payments, they\u2019re still not   the owner if their name isn\u2019t on the title. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) notes: If you co-sign a loan, you are legally obligated to repay the loan in   full. Co-signing a loan does not mean serving as a character reference   for someone else.  When you co-sign, you promise to pay the loan yourself. It means that   you risk having to repay any missed payments immediately. If the   borrower defaults on the loan, the creditor can use the same   collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower   such as demanding that you repay the entire loan yourself, suing you,   and garnishing your wages or bank accounts after a judgment. Your   credit score(s) may be impacted by any late payments or defaults. Co-signing an auto loan does not mean you have any right to the   vehicle, it just means that you have agreed to become obligated to   repay the amount of the loan. So make sure you can afford to pay this   debt if the borrower cannot. Per this article and this loan.com article, options to remove your name from co-signing include: If you're name isn't on the title, you'll have to convince your ex-boyfriend and the bank to have you removed as the co-signer, but from your brief description above, it doesn't seem that your ex is going to be cooperative. Unfortunately, as the co-signer and guarantor of the loan, you're legally responsible for making the payments if he doesn't. Not making the payments could ruin your credit as well. One final option to consider is bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a drastic option, and you'll have to weigh whether the disruption to your credit and financial life will be worth it versus repaying the balance of that auto loan. Per this post: Another not so pretty option is bankruptcy. This is an extreme route,   and in some instances may not even guarantee a name-removal from the   loan. Your best bet is to contact a lawyer or other source of legal help to review your options on how to proceed with this issue.", "label": "hc3human"}

GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.\nModern GPUs are efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In some CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.\nIn the 1970s, the term \"GPU\" originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable processing unit independently working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and output. Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing unit) in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as \"the world's first GPU\".

This is often called a Two-Timeslice BN (2TBN) because it says that at any point in time T, the value of a variable can be calculated from the internal regressors and the immediate prior value (time T-1).  DBNs were developed by Paul Dagum in the early 1990s at Stanford University's Section on Medical Informatics. Dagum developed DBNs to unify and extend traditional linear state-space models such as Kalman filters, linear and normal forecasting models such as ARMA and simple dependency models such as hidden Markov models into a general probabilistic representation and inference mechanism for arbitrary nonlinear and non-normal time-dependent domains.\nToday, DBNs are common in robotics, and have shown potential for a wide range of data mining applications.  For example, they have been used in speech recognition, digital forensics, protein sequencing, and bioinformatics.  DBN is a generalization of hidden Markov models and Kalman filters.\nDBNs are conceptually related to Probabilistic Boolean Networks  and can, similarly, be used to model dynamical systems at steady-state.", "label": "hc3human"}

People that have no linguistic awareness of the target language are absolutely helpless in removing some of these errors , OR those with limited knowledge wo n't bother correcting google translate passages because they see it as an authority . \" But this is what google translate says . \" One good use of google translate is to use it to get a * gist * of the passage you 're reading , but never for writing .

I guess my hate stems from the fact that overreliance on translation software can be a major hindrance in language acquisition , and I generally take a hard stance against it in the classroom .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\nand are read declaratively as logical implications:\nH is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:\nIn the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:\nConsider the following clause as an example:\nbased on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:\ncan be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by \"assigning\" socrates to X.\nThe declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Not really ELI5 - able because it 's a complicated subject but : So , whenever you sell property ( subject to an insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain / loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) .

{"text": "The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis.[a] It is the first installment in The Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, and depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias \"Neo\", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.\nThe Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.\nThe Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value,[10][11] and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time,[12][13][14] and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"[15]\nThe film's success led to two feature film sequels being released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled The Matrix Resurrections, was released on December 22, 2021.", "label": "hc3human"}

When college students leave their hometown and arrive at college , they often know very few people and are not used to taking the initiative in meeting people . Fraternities provide a medium for students to socialise and bond . Since fraternities often have a reputation , students can join to meet likeminded peers who they might not otherwise meet . For example , some fraternities will have a charity focus , others will have people who grew up in a certain area , others will attract goofy guys or sporty guys . Fraternities also provide structured social situations to meet girls ( or sororities for meeting boys ) by holding parties , date nights and other functions . Finally , because the drinking age in America is 21 , most students ca n't go to bars for the first few years of college , so fraternities also function as social hubs in the same way that bars / clubs do once you reach the legal drinking age . Having said that , there are arguably a number of downsides to fraternities . They can perpetuate social stratification because current members of the fraternity pick the incoming members . Members will often only want to invite freshman students who are similar to them , and so the fraternity and sorority scene can appear quite insular . I have heard that people belong in a certain fraternity because they went to X high school , they have family money , or because they are a ' legacy ' ( i.e. their dad / mum was in the fraternity / sorority ) . Also , because only fraternities hold parties ( sororities have nice houses and do n't want them trashed ) , guys in the ' cool ' fraternities hold an imbalance of social power as other students ( particularly girls ) need to befriend them to get invited to the parties ( if they ca n't get into bars ) .

{"text": "In computer science, in particular in knowledge representation and reasoning and metalogic, the area of automated reasoning is dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science and philosophy.\nThe most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions).[citation needed] Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.\nOther important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock's OSCAR system is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.\nTools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and calculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and many less formal ad hoc techniques.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I am a bit confused here as to how a 4K loan will negatively effect your credit score if payments are made on time.  FICO scores are based upon how well you borrow.  If you borrow, pay back on time, your score will not go down.  Perhaps a bit in the short run when you first secure the loan, but that should come back quickly.  In the long run it will help improve your score which seems like it would be more important to you. Having the provider finance your loan will probably not show up on your credit unless you fail to pay and they send to collections. If the score is so important to you, which I think is somewhat unwise, then use a credit card.  With a 750 you should be able to get a pretty good rate, but assume it is 18%.  In less then 9 months you will have it paid off, paying about $293 in interest.  You could consider that a part of the cost of doing business for maintaining a high credit score.  Again not what I would advise, but it might meet your needs. One alternative is go with lending club.  With that kind of score, you are looking at 7% or so.  At $500 a month, you are still looking at just over 8 months and paying about $100 in interest.  Much less money for improving your credit score. Edit based upon the comment: \"My understanding is that using a significant portion of your available credit balance is bad for your credit, even if you pay your bills on time.\" Define bad.  As I said it might go down slightly in the short term.  In three months you will have almost 33% of the loan paid off, which is significantly lower then the original balance.  If you go the credit card route, you may be approved for quite a bit more then the 4000, which may not move the needle at all.  Are you planning on buying a home in the next 90 days?  If not, why does a small short term dip matter?  Will your life really be effected if your score goes down to 720 for three months? Keep in mind this is exactly the kind of behavior that the banks want you to engage in.  If you worship your FICO score, which gives no indication of wealth then you should do exactly what I am suggesting.", "label": "hc3human"}

It will be dragged on by the gravity of the Earth to slow it down and eventually it will stop and then fall back . However , the farther the ball gets from Earth , the weaker the gravity . If you throw the ball fast enough ( faster than you can throw ) gravity will get weaker faster than it can slow down the ball and in that case , the ball will never stop and fall back , it will just get slower and slower and slower forever . The minimum speed to achieve this from some distance from a gravity well is the escape velocity . The stronger the gravity , the faster the escape velocity . We already had evidence for super - dense stars which we would later call neutron stars . The question just became , what would happen if a star was so heavy and so dense that the escape velocity from its surface was greater than the speed of light ?

{"text": "First off, monozok is right, at the end of the day, you should not accept what anyone says to do without your money - take their suggestions as directions to research and decide for yourself.  I also do not think what you have is too little to invest, but that depends on how liquid you need to be.  Often in order to make a small amount of money grow via investments, you have to be willing to take all the investment profits from that principle and reinvest it.  Thus, can you see how your investment ability is governed by the time you plan to spend without that money?  They mantra that I have heard from many people is that the longer you are able to wait, the more 'risk' you can take.  As someone who is about the same age as you (I'm 24) I can't exactly say yet that what I have done is sure fire for the long term, but I suggest you adopt a few principles: 1) Go read \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" by Burton G. Malkiel.  A key point for you might be that you can do better than most of these professional investors for hire simply by putting  more money in a well selected index fund.  For example, Vanguard is a nice online service to buy indexes through, but they may require a minimum.  2) Since you are young, if you go into any firm, bank, or \"financial planner,\" they will just think you are naive and try to get you to buy whatever is best for them (one of their mutual funds, money market accounts, annuities, some flashy cd).   Don't.  You can do better on your own and while it might be tempting because these options look more secure or well managed, most of the time you will barely make above inflation, and you will not have learned very much. 3) One exciting thin you should start learning now is about algorithmic trading because it is cool and super efficient. quantopian.com is a good platform for this.  It is a fun community and it is also free. 4) One of the best ways I have found to watch the stock market is actually through a stock game app on my phone that has realtime stock price feed.

Ultimately, you can't just put up your hand and say, \"that's my tax domicile so I'm exempt from all your taxes.\"  There is no umbrella US regulation on this topic, the states determine who they consider to be residents and how those residents are to be taxed.

{"text": "These cars are generally considered out of date and are less prone to be victims of car theft while being reasonably safe. Make sure you pick a model with a good reliability reputation, see what comes up at your local junk yard (the common old models have survived long enough to not end up there until now). Servicing your car takes some effort and some initial investments, but learning how to fix simple problems by yourself will save you a lot of money in the long run. Start by learning how to locate some simple faults. Diagnosing issues is a very costly process if done professionally, but some you may be able to find by yourself. All cars sold in USA from 1996 are required to have this connection below the steering rack. As a consequence most cars manufactured 1995 will have this connector world wide. If you connect your OBD2 adapter to this port your car will be able to tell you what's wrong through an app on your phone and you will be able to clear fault codes by yourself to make sure the problem really is solved. This is what you mechanic should use when servicing your car. While a new print can be expensive you can find used manuals getting thrown out of service centers or at yard sales. These will include service notes and sometimes had-written notes to help you out. The majority of parts on scrapped cars are still in working condition and may not ever see significant wear and tear. If you put some time into removing the part yourself you will have a good idea of how difficult it is to replace the part on your car and outsource the work to a professional if needed. This of course assumes you bring good parts. The main income should come from the work performed on your car, not the markup of spare parts. Generally speaking specialized mechanics working with one or few brands of cars are preferable as these will not only be familiar with your car but are also more likely to get original spare parts (not \"pirate\" parts made to be compatible at a cheaper price). This will make sure the part works as intended and not cause wear and tear of other parts. For example you'd much rather replace a broken fuse instead of cleaning up the aftermath of fried electronics. Turn off the AC when it's not needed. There should be a button labeled \"ECON\" or similar which will disable the AC compressor while keeping the rest of the systems running. The compressor is usually driven by a belt from the crankshaft and will eat up some of the power your engine produces. Just remember that while it saves gas, uncomfortable driving conditions may shorten your patience and reduces your attention. Accelerate up to speed quickly. Contrary to popular belief, this saves more gas than accelerating slowly because the time your engine is under increased load is shorter combined with higher efficiency at medium engine speeds. Allow your speed to decline on uphills, you will regain that speed once the road levels out. Unless you're in heavy traffic driving a bit slower shouldn't harm the flow. Don't let go of the gas pedal, just avoid compensating as much. Your target should be to not lose more than 20% of your speed over the entire ascent and have a constant deceleration or you will start interfering with traffic. Make sure your car is healthy. As obvious as it may sound, worn out parts may harm your mileage. Increased friction in bearings due to broken protective covers or reduced pressure from a broken exhaust are just examples if things that will ruin the efficiency of you driveline. By themselves they may not do much but they add up into both gas consumption and reliability issues. Really do read your owners manual. Nobody knows your car better than the people who built it. What's best for my car may not be best for your car and the best way to make sure your car is working as intended is to take an afternoon with your manual and a cup of your favorite beverage. Afterwards you will know how all the features of your car works. \"Take care of your car and it takes care of you\" is the principle I'm working with. A car you're happy with will make you more calm behind the wheel and leads to higher quality of your driving decisions.

{"text": "Source for the following : I used to be a Senate staffer . The United States government budgets money on an annual basis for a period of time called the \" fiscal year . \" The government 's fiscal year runs from October 1 - September 30 . Every year before the fiscal year ends , Congress must pass appropriations bills funding all the agencies of the federal government in order to authorize them to spend money . If agencies do n't have authorization to spend money , it is illegal for them to carry out any non - essential activities that require spending money , which is pretty much everything . ( An aside : you can see all the different appropriations bills and their progress here . URL_1 ) On the one hand , this is a good process in theory . Every year Congress has to look at the programs in place and decide whether they 're still worth funding at the old levels or whether something has changed and they should adjust funding levels . On the other hand , it runs into practical problems . The government has grown a lot since this process was put into place and there 's a lot more obstruction now than there was then , so most years this does n't actually happen on time . In order to deal with these delays , Congress tends to pass Continuing Resolutions ( CR ) to give itself some more time to work out the budgets of federal agencies it has not funded yet . A CR just says that whatever you had last year you get again this year , up to a certain date . So if last year your agency got $ 12 and this year we pass a 3 month CR , your agency will get $ 3 which it can spend over the next 3 months . So that sets up the debate right now , which is not actually over whether or not to fund the government . No appropriations bills have passed , and Republicans and Democrats broadly agree that we should continue to fund the government for a few months while they work out their differences on appropriations bills . The debate is about Obamacare . Republicans believe this is one of their last chances to repeal the law before it goes into effect . ( The other one is the debt ceiling , which you 've probably also heard about . They are related but distinct issues . ) As a result , some Republicans are refusing to vote to fund the government unless Obamacare is repealed / defunded . They believe that once the government is shut down , people will call on the Obama Administration to give in to Republican demands and start the government back up . Democrats and the Administration are unwilling to peel back their biggest achievement over the last five years to appease Republicans . I should note that I 'm on the Administration 's side on this one . I think I 've given a balanced view of what 's going on while keeping this on an ELI5 level . If anyone takes issue with the way I 've presented this , please say so and I 'll edit this post or respond to your criticism . * * Edit : TL;DR Government funding for many programs must be renewed annually by October 1 . Some Republicans insist on provisions that defund or undermine Obamacare in any funding bill . Democrats refuse to pass a bill with these provisions . * * * * Edit : FAQs :* * * How does this affect me right now ? * The best overview of government services that are going to get immediately suspended that I 've seen is from a post at [ Wonkblog ] ( URL_0 ) . Some Some key points : > Housing : The Department of Housing and Urban Development will not be able to provide local housing authorities with additional money for housing vouchers . The nation 's 3,300 public housing authorities will not receive payments , although most of these agencies , however , have funds to provide rental assistance through October . > > Regulatory agencies : The Environmental Protection Agency will close down almost entirely during a shutdown , save for operations around Superfund cites . The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will also shut down . A few financial regulators , however , like the Securities and Exchange Commission , will remain open . > > ( Small parts of ) Social Security : The Social Security Administration will keep on enough employees to make sure the checks keep going out . But the agency wo n't have enough staff to do things like help recipients replace their benefit cards or schedule new hearings for disability cases . > > Veterans : Some key benefits will continue and the VA hospitals will remained open . But many services will be disrupted . The Veterans Benefits Administration will be unable to process education and rehabilitation benefits . The Board of Veterans ' Appeals will be unable to hold hearings . * Does Congress keep getting paid ? * Members of Congress do continue to get paid because it 's unconstitutional to change their pay in the middle of a Congressional session . This is so they ca n't raise their own pay without giving the American people a chance to punish them for doing so . The way it 's written , though , it covers decreases in wages as well so that 's the way it is . Staff are treated like all other federal government employees - they are not paid until the government is funded again . In the past , when the government was funded again , federal employees have been given back pay retroactively . * Are state / local government services effected ? * This is a mixed bag . Anything funded purely through state and local funds should be unaffected unless money needs to be moved around to make up for a shortfall elsewhere . However , many state and local services are funded in part by the federal government , so you could see disruptions to a lot of services . Edit : I 've been gilded !

{"text": "One of the thing about numbers ( any numbers , not just prime numbers ) for the purpose of cryptography is that while it 's very easy to multiply two numbers together to get a third number , it 's an awful lot harder to start with the third number and work out what the original two were . As a very simple example not involving prime numbers , if I asked you to multiply 10 x 10 you could give me the answer in an instant . However if I gave you the number \" 100 \" and said \" which two numbers did I multiply to get 100 \" you could n't necessarily tell me the correct answer straight away . It might have been 10 x 10 , but it could have been 20 x 5 , or 25 x 4 , or even 100 x 1 . An important property of prime numbers is that when you multiply them together to get another number , the * only * numbers that you can divide the third number by is the original prime numbers . So 3 is prime , 7 is prime , and 3 x 7 = 21 -- the only numbers which you can divide 21 by are in fact 3 and 7 . This always works with any two prime numbers you choose . So , to finally answer your question ! Imagine your computer has two prime numbers . Both of these are very , very large numbers -- dozens of digits long if you were to write them out in decimal . Now multiply them together , this is something that computers are very good at . This gives you a third , extremely long number . Now , anyone who knows the initial two prime numbers can get the third number , but if you have the third number there is no known way to determine what the original prime numbers were , other than trying every possible number . This is the basis of cryptographic techniques using prime numbers -- because there is an algorithm ( i.e. a mathematical procedure ) which is easy to do in one direction but very time - consuming to do in reverse , that algorithm can be used to produce secret codes and encrypt data .", "label": "hc3human"}

My savings account provides me with an annual return of 4% as interest. Firstly inflation, interest increases the numeric value of your bank balance but inflation reduces what that means in real terms. From a quick google it looks like inflation in india is currently arround 6% so your savings account is losing 2% in real terms. On the other hand you would expect a stable company to maintain a similar value in real terms. So the dividend can be seen as real terms income. Secondly investors generally hope that their companies will not merely be stable but grow in value over time. Whether that hope is rational is another question.  Why not just invest in options instead for higher potential profits? It's possible to make a lot of money this way. It's also possible to lose a lot of money this way.

{"text": "Yield is the term used to describe how much income the bond will generate if the bond was purchased at a particular moment in time. If I pay $100 for a one year, $100 par value bond that pays 5% interest then the bond yields 5% since I will receive $5 from a $100 investment if I held the bond to maturity. If I pay $90 for the same one year bond then the bond yields 17% since I will receive $15 from a $90 investment if I held the bond to maturity. There are many factors that affect what yield creditors will accept: It is the last bullet that ultimately determines yield.  The other factors feed into the creditor\u2019s desire to hold money today versus receiving money in the future.  I desire money in my hand more than a promise to receive money in the future.  In order to entice me to lend my money someone must offer me an incentive.  Thus, they must offer me more money in the future in order for me to part with money I have. A yield curve is a snapshot of the yields for different loan durations.  The x-axis is the amount of time left on the bond while the y-axis is the yield.  The most cited yield curve is the US treasury curve which displays the yields for loans to the US government.  The yield curve changes while bonds are being traded thus it is always a snapshot of a particular moment in time. Short term loans typically have less yield than longer term loans since there is less uncertainty about the near future. Yield curves will flatten or slightly invert when creditors desire to keep their money instead of loaning it out.  This can occur because of a sudden disruption in the market that causes uncertainty about the future which leads to an increase in the demand for cash on hand. The US government yield curve should be looked at with some reservation however since there is a very large creditor to the US government that has the ability to loan the government an unlimited amount of funds.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Ending up with nothing is an unlikely situation unless you invest 100% in a company stock and the company goes under. In order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments. The best advice would be to take a list of all options that your employer allows and talk with a financial advisor. Here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer: Definitions from wikipedia: A target-date fund \u2013 also known as a lifecycle, dynamic-risk or age-based fund \u2013 is a collective investment scheme, usually a mutual fund, designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. An index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme (usually a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market... An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.[1] An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features. The capital stock (or stock) of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of its owners. Which one can you lose everything in? You can lose everything in stocks by the company going under. In Index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse. The chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies. The S&P 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the U.S.  A Pacific-Europe index such as MSCI EAFE Index is made up of 907 companies. The chances of losing everything in an ETF are also slim. The ETF that follows the S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies. An Pacific-Europe ETF such as MSCI EAFE ETF is made up of 871 companies. Target date funds are also slim to lose everything. Target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age. What would I recommend? I would recommend the Index funds and/or ETFs that have the lowest fee that make up the following strategy for your age: Why Not Target Date Funds or Stocks? Target date funds have high fees. Later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio. At that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections. Stocks are too risky for you with your current knowledge. If your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your Index funds or ETFs.", "label": "hc3human"}

Even more recently , we learned that those atoms were made of protons / neutrons / electrons . Even more recently , we learned ( but are still not totally sure ) that protons and neutrons are made of quarks . Currently , particle physics is based on a theory called \" the standard model \" , which is more or less a list of a few dozen extremely tiny particles which are assumed to be the actual fundamental building blocks of reality ( as in , they are not themselves composed of smaller objects stuck together ) . Various physical properties ( like mass , charge , etc ) of those particles govern how they work . This works very nicely , and seems to fit very well with a lot of experimentally observed results . However , there 's still some things that are n't explained . In particular , the currently accepted model of physics has a hard time explaining how relativity ( which makes sense at extremely large scales ) and quantum mechanics ( which makes sense at extremely small scales ) are supposed to interact with each other . * * String theory is basically the idea that all of those supposedly fundamental particles are actually just tiny massless one - dimensional \" strings \" that vibrate in much the same way that a violin string vibrates , and the frequency of the vibration governs how the string behaves . In addition , string theory operates on the assumption that there are more than just 3 spatial dimensions , and the strings vibrate through all of them ; not just the obviously visible three . * * Now , hidden spatial dimensions probably demands it 's own ELI5 , as this sounds like nonsense . The idea is that the other dimensions are really really small and \" curled up \" , so we ca n't see them . To get a feel for this , imagine a piece of paper that 's the size of Texas . It 's clearly visible , and clearly 3 - dimensional . Now curl it up into a tube . Still obviously 3 - dimensional . But now start backing away . As you get further and further away , the tube starts looking more and more like a line . Eventually it will appear so thin to you that it might as well actually be a 1 - dimensional line , for all you know . Where did the extra two dimensions go ? They did n't go anywhere , they 're just too small for you to see them . Anyway , yeah . That 's string theory . It sounds bizarre , and it IS bizarre , but the math behind it appears to check out , as far as we can tell so far . Now , why tiny vibrating strings ? Why extra spatial dimensions ? I honestly do n't have a clue , since I 'm not a physicist , but even if I did know , THAT would be the part you ca n't really ELI5 .

To be can be an active verb , an inactive linking verb , or an auxiliary verb , depending on its form and context .

{"text": "E) Spend a small amount of that money on getting advice from a paid financial planner. (Not a broker or someone offering you \"free\" advice; their recommendations may be biased toward what makes them the most money).  A good financial planner will talk to you about your plans and expectations both short and long term, and about your risk tolerance (would a drop in value panic you even if you know it's likely to recover and average out in the long run, that sort of thing), and about how much time and effort you want to put into actively managing your portfolio. From those answers, they will generate an initial proposed plan, which will be tested against simulations of the stock market to make sure it holds up. Typically they'll do about 100 passes over the plan to get a sense of its probable risk versus growth-potential versus volatility, and tweak the plan until the normal volatility is within the range you've said you're comfortable with while trying to produce the best return with the least risk. This may not be a perfect plan for you -- but at the very least it will be an excellent starting point until you decide (if you ever do decide) that you've learned enough about investing that you want to do something different with the money. It's likely to be better advice than you'll get here simply because they can and will take the time to understand your specific needs rather than offering generalities because we're trying to write something that applies to many people, all of whom have different goals and time horizons and financial intestinal fortitude. As far as a house goes: Making the mistake of thinking of a house as an investment is a large part of the mindset that caused the Great Recession. Property can be an investment (or a business) or it can be something you're living in; never make the mistake of putting it in both categories at once. The time to buy a house is when you want a house, find a house you like in a neighborhood you like, expect not to move out of it for at least five years, can afford to put at least 20% down payment, and can afford the ongoing costs. Owning your home is not more grown-up, or necessarily financially advantageous even with the tax break, or in any other way required until and unless you will enjoy owning your home. (I bought at age 50ish, because I wanted a place around the corner from some of my best friends, because I wanted better noise isolation from my neighbors, because I wanted a garden, because I wanted to do some things that almost any landlord would object to, and because I'm handy enough that I can do a lot of the routine maintenance myself and enjoy doing it -- buy a house, get a free set of hobbies if you're into that. And part of the reason I could afford this house, and the changes that I've made to it, was that renting had allowed me to put more money into investments. My only regret is that I didn't realise how dumb it was not to max out my 401(k) match  until I'd been with the company for a decade ... that's free money I left on the table.)", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "An  electronic health record (EHR) is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically stored health information in a digital format. These records can be shared across different health care settings. Records are shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges. EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.\nFor several decades, electronic health records (EHRs) have been touted as key to increasing of quality care. Electronic health records are used for other reasons than charting for patients; today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs. EHR combines all patients demographics into a large pool, and uses this information to assist with the creation of \"new treatments or innovation in healthcare delivery\" which overall improves the goals in healthcare. Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system's health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients. EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients.\nEHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time. It eliminates the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is up-to-date, accurate and legible. It also allows open communication between the patient and the provider, while providing \"privacy and security.\" It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date and decreases risk of lost paperwork and is cost efficient. Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical records) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient. Population-based studies of medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs.", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.\nCentral subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).\nAlthough it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\nAs a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation. A great discovery of twentieth-century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.", "label": "hc3human"}

Many tax advantageous vehicles exist for the purpose of saving for college education such as 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds. Tax and penalty free distributions from a portfolio of stocks is possible if the distributions are for qualified education expenses and the account is in the form of a Roth IRA.  A house is collateral for a home equity line of credit.  A combination of unfortunate events could cause someone to default on the loan and loose their residence. Also, the tax advantages of 529 plans, and Roth IRAs are not applicable to purchase a motor boat.  With respect, some people like to leave the home equity loan untapped for other uses. More Details: 529 plans are not taxed by on the Federal level when the withdraws are used for college.  In many states, contributions to state sponsored 529 plans are deductible on the state level.  These are not self directed so you can't trade stocks/bonds in a 529 plan, however, certain plans allow you to lock in the rate you pay for credit at today's prices. If you want a self directed (ability to trade stocks/bonds) vehicle with tax free disbursements for qualified education, consider a Roth IRA. There are yearly contribution limits, and penalty if the proceeds are not used for qualified educational expenses. Also I believe interest revenue from Series EE and I bonds is tax free if the bond is used for education. There are special conditions and situations to 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds, the purpose of this answer was to expand upon the tax advantageous vehicles for higher education.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Tsunami waves like all ocean waves occur because two molecules ca n't be in the same place at the same time . This is a basic fact of fluid dynamics . So when waves ' move ' the water is mostly staying in the same place because it moves very little . But it bumps up against the water molecules around it giving up their energy and stopping as they 've given it up . But whatever molecules they just bumped into now have the energy and so they move a short distance , bump into something , give it up and stop etc . It 's like those desktop toys with the metal balls clanking back and forth . The balls themselves do n't move , or they move very little . They mostly act as a conductor of energy . So a tsunami originating in Japan travels as an energy wave ' through ' the water . The water itself does n't move so Japanese water stays in Japan even if the tsunami is moving towards Hawaii . This is also the reason why at sea a tsunami is not even really noticeable . The energy is spread out immensely from top to bottom , so you have a huge mass of water bouncing around but the wave is only centimeters high . It still has energy because of how much water is in play though . As the wave approaches shallower depths , the energy stops being spread out among large masses of water , and starts being concentrated , by the decreasing depth , and the wave starts growing taller and taller . This focusing of the energy also causes the waves to slow down in speed , and increase in height . In the open ocean a tsunami energy wave travels incredibly fast , like jet speed fast . As it comes up onto shore though it 's much slower , but much taller , and at that point water is moving not just acting as a conductor . The slow waves at the coast , with fast waves coming in behind it , causes a surge , pushing large amounts of water near the shore so not only do the waves get tall , but the local sea level also rises .

{"text": "For political reasons, almost all governments (including the US) spend more money than they get from taxes etc.  There are a number of things a government can do to cover the difference: Most governments opt for selling bonds.  The \"National Debt\" of a country can be thought of as being the sum of all the \"Bonds\" that are still paying interest, and that the Government hasn't Redeemed. It can all go horribly wrong.  If the Government gets into a situation where it cannot pay the interest, or it cannot Redeem the Bonds it has promised to, then it may have to break its promise (\"Default\" on its payments).  This makes the owners of the Bonds unhappy and means potential buyers of future Bond sales are less likely to want to buy the Governments new Bonds - effectively meaning the Government has to promise to pay more interest in the future.  Recent examples of this include Argentina; and may include Greece soon. The US is in the fortunate position that not many people believe it will Default.  Therefore the new Bonds it sells (which it does on a regular basis) are still in demand, even though its interest payments, and promises to Redeem Bonds are huge.", "label": "hc3human"}

So if the top of metal is warm it spreads the energy down , to the part of the metal with less energy . Water for example , loves to take alot of energy and keep it , but does n't like to spread the energy around . So it is very easy for parts of water to be very very hot , and evaporate . So when it takes energy it keeps the energy . Now lets look at your question . Lets say the water on the towel has 20 energy points , and the air outside has around 40 energy , because water likes to take energy it will steal it from the air .

{"text": "Jerry Alan Fodor (/\u02c8fo\u028ad\u0259r/; April 22, 1935 \u2013 November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science. His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had \"an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960.\" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or \"organs\", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the \"central processing\" part of the mind, which has a more global and less \"domain specific\" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73\u201375\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.", "label": "hc3human"}

Particle physicists have been using their giant accelerators to dissect the parts and processes of the universe . The quest has , in recent years , been aided by astronomers and astrophysicists , who figuratively peer into giant telescopes to scan the heavens for residue sparks and ashes of a cataclysmic explosion that they are convinced took place 15 billion years ago , which they call the Big Bang . > Both groups have been progressing toward a simple , coherent , all - encompassing model that will explain everything : the structure of matter and energy , the behavior of forces in environments that range from the earliest moments of the infant universe with its exorbitant temperature and density to the relatively cold and empty world we know today .

You need to hire database people to write the database and maintain it , you need to hire programmers to write programs to turn this data into purchasing orders , you need some way to make this data accessible to managers who might be able to do something locally with it . This applies to places outside of grocery stores , too , obviously . You can see things in social media , you can track Google search trends , you can monitor vehicle traffic . All of these are problems of collecting massive amounts of data and finding some way to make sense of that data . EDIT : Speeling .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Thunder is caused by lightning discharging . Generally , lightning requires wet air to conduct the electrical potential from high up in the sky to the ground . Dry air is n't very good at conducting electricity . During the winter , when it 's very cold , the air can not hold that much water . Most of the water will condense and fall as snow . Since the air is very dry , it is less likely to successfully conduct the electricity from the sky to the ground , so lightning is quire rare . Since lightning is rare , so is thunder . However , \" thundersnow \" is a possibility and has happened before . Again , it 's just uncommon .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "It was explained to me sort of like this in hospital : It 's like dropping ink into water , if you get there quick enough , the cancer is just in one place , and you can scoop it out . But when the cancer spreads , that ink diffuses through the water , and it 's virtually impossible to get every trace of it out . Your only option at that point is to attack the whole thing and hope you can kill it all . It 's not a perfect analogy , obviously , and even those that get there quick enough to have the tumor simply be removed will possibly need chemo / radiation to kill cells around the effected area , but it helped me to understand how if you have colon cancer that has spread to the liver , or lungs , or both , that just ' removing the cancer ' is near impossible .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is probably a better way, but you can do the following: (1) Right click on the right pointing arrow next to the \"1-20 of xx rows\" message at the bottom right of the table, and select \"Copy link location\" (2) Paste that into the location (3) At the end of the pasted text there is a \"&output=json\", delete that and everything after it. (4) hit enter What you get is a page that displays the set of securities returned by and in a very similar display to the \"stock screener\" without the UI elements to change your selections.
