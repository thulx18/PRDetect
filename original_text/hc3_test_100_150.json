{"text": "In general, high interest rates lead to higher bond yields. When the interest rate on new bonds is higher than the interest rate on existing bonds, investors are more likely to sell their existing bonds and buy the new ones, which pushes down the price of the existing bonds and increases their yield. This is because investors want to receive a higher return on their investment, and the yield on a bond is directly related to its price. When the price of a bond decreases, its yield increases, and vice versa.It's important to note that the relationship between interest rates and bond yields is not always straightforward, as other factors can also influence bond prices and yields. For example, changes in the supply and demand for bonds, as well as economic and political developments, can all affect bond yields.", "label": "machine"}

In at least some countries(New Zealand), the default action on all insufficient funds transactions is to refuse the transaction. Credit cards are the only common exception. Every bank operating in NZ that I know of acts this way. Sometimes there is a fee for bouncing a transaction, sometimes not, that depends on the bank. Any other option must be explicitly arranged in writing with the bank. Personally, coming from a country where declining transactions is the default, I'd be shocked and angry to be stuck with an automatic transfer from another account.

It's like a quadruple whammy.  New car brings sticker shock.  Financing is paying to use someone else's money.  Buying a car period is buying into the commuter lifestyle.

The idea is to create a society where everyone is equal and there is no social hierarchy or class distinctions. However, in practice, communism has often been difficult to implement successfully. In China, the government has tried to use communism to help reduce poverty and increase equality, but there are still many people who are poor and struggling to get by. This is partly because it can be difficult to fairly distribute resources and wealth when the government is in control of everything. Additionally, there are other factors that can contribute to poverty, such as natural disasters, health problems, and lack of education. So even in a country that is trying to promote equality, there may still be some people who are less fortunate than others.", "label": "machine"}
