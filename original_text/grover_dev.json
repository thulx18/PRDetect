{"text": "Written by Elizabeth Williamson and Kenneth P. Vogel\nThe bad blood started early.\nAdvertising\nIn 2008, Neera Tanden, then a top aide on Hillary Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, accompanied Clinton to what was expected to be an easy interview at the Center for American Progress, the influential think tank founded by top Clinton aides. But Faiz Shakir, chief editor of the think tank\u2019s ThinkProgress website, asked Clinton a question about the Iraq War, an issue dogging her candidacy because she had supported it.\nTanden responded by circling back to Shakir after the interview and, according to a person in the room, punching him in the chest.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t slug him; I pushed him,\u201d Tanden corrected in a recent interview, still angry that Shakir had \u201cdone that to me.\u201d\nAdvertising\nTanden now leads the Center for American Progress, Shakir runs Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, and the enmity between the two camps burst into the open last weekend. Sanders, angry about a video produced by ThinkProgress that ridicules his new status as one of the millionaires he has vilified on the campaign trail, sent a scorching letter to the think tank\u2019s board, accusing Tanden of \u201cmaligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.\u201d\nThe blowup is another reflection of the ideological divisions among Democrats, this time between a legacy Clinton organization and a liberal wing trying to move the party to the left to harness the energy of millennials. Sanders\u2019 team remains convinced that the Democratic establishment worked behind the scenes to deprive him of the party\u2019s nomination 2016; his campaign has cast the think tank as beholden to corporate interests set on thwarting him in 2020.\nTanden rejected that characterization and asserted in an email to Shakir that the center shares \u201cthe goals of unity.\u201d Jodi Enda, editor-in-chief of ThinkProgress, said her website is editorially independent and that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a favored candidate, and we don\u2019t have a candidate who we disfavor.\u201d\nStill, Tanden\u2019s mother, Maya Tanden, says that her daughter \u201ccan be very aggressive.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to let anyone rule over her,\u201d she said, \u201cand she has loyalty to Hillary because Hillary is the one who made her.\u201d\n\u201cThose Bernie brothers are attacking her all the time, but she lets them have it, too,\u201d Maya Tanden said. \u201cShe says Sanders got a pass\u201d in 2016, \u201cbut he\u2019s not getting a pass this time.\u201d\nThe Center for American Progress and its sister political arm, with a $60 million combined annual budget and 320 staff members, have played an outsize role in the Democratic Party for nearly two decades. Founded in 2003 by top advisers to Bill and Hillary Clinton, the organization seeks to rebrand itself as a brain trust for the anti-Trump resistance.\nIts donor rolls overlap substantially with those of the Clintons\u2019 campaigns and foundation. The think tank has taken in millions from interests often criticized by liberals, including Wall Street financiers, big banks, Silicon Valley titans, foreign governments, defense contractors and the health care industry.\nIndividual donors can ask to remain anonymous. Money to the think tank from the personal foundation of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg surged to $665,000 in 2018 from $15,000 in 2017, while Facebook fended off scrutiny for mishandling users\u2019 personal data, fueling violence and providing a platform for Russian election interference.\nLast year, the center got $1 million from the family foundation of Jonathan Lavine, a managing partner at Bain Capital, and at least $1 million from the tech industry\u2019s Silicon Valley Community Foundation. It also received $225,000 from the private foundation of a Walmart heir, Sam Walton.\nNeera Tanden, whose salary was $397,000 in 2018, was an unpaid adviser to Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign while running the think tank, and was considered a candidate for a top White House job had Clinton won the presidency. Tanden says she has founded six new policy-intensive groups as president of the think tank and increased the center\u2019s annual budget by 25 percent.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she does \u2014 she shows up at rich people\u2019s places because she needs funds from them,\u201d Tanden\u2019s mother said. \u201cThat place runs on Neera Tanden.\u201d\nFrom 2016 through last year, the center accepted nearly $2.5 million from the United Arab Emirates to fund its National Security and International Policy initiative, according to previously unreported internal budget documents. From the start, the think tank\u2019s decision to solicit money from the United Arab Emirates, an ally of Saudi Arabia with a problematic human rights record, fanned internal dissent. A Center for American Progress spokeswoman said Monday night that the think tank decided in December to stop taking money from the country.\nTensions boiled over in October, after Saudi-born Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the order of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, according to an assessment by the CIA. Before the CIA\u2019s conclusion became public \u2014 but while the crown prince was widely suspected of ordering the killing \u2014 the think tank had pursued plans for a joint panel on \u201cthe U.S.-Saudi relationship in light of recent events,\u201d and had invited the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the crown prince\u2019s brother, according to an internal email sent by an official at the think tank to executives.\nBut the Saudi ambassador fled the country, and the plan dissolved. Internal criticism of the Emirati donations leaked into the media, prompting an in-house investigation that led to the firing of two staff members. One of them, Ken Gude, a longtime executive of the think tank, is working with a lawyer on a wrongful dismissal lawsuit.\nIn November 2015, after Tanden invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to a question-and-answer session at the center, a dozen staff members stood during an all-staff meeting and read a statement of protest. \u201cOur goal is to promote humanity and shut down oppression and genocide and terrorism. Bringing in another head of state with a record of oppression would further push our mission away,\u201d it read in part.\nIn an email Tanden sent on the day of the Netanyahu visit, stolen and released by WikiLeaks, she told the think tank\u2019s founder, John D. Podesta, that the \u201cfar left hates me\u201d for hosting Netanyahu, but the invitation \u201cmay have sealed the deal with a new board member.\u201d Tanden was wooing Lavine, a pro-Israel philanthropist.\nThe next month, Tanden wrote a jubilant email to Podesta, telling him Lavine was joining the board. \u201cSo Netanyahu was worth it,\u201d she added, with a smiley face emoji. Lavine no longer sits on the think tank\u2019s board, but his foundation remains a big donor.\n\u201cThe Netanyahu event was arranged with the public and private support of the Obama administration, and the notion that it was done at the behest of any donor is preposterous,\u201d a center spokeswoman said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult as a think tank to know exactly how to handle things,\u201d like the Netanyahu pressure, said Judd Legum, who was the founding editor of ThinkProgress, which is an arm of the think tank\u2019s political sister group. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to only have people come in who agree with you,\u201d he said, but \u201cthere were people who felt it wasn\u2019t tough enough on Netanyahu, and I understood where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d\nNo other think-tank president rivals Tanden for 24/7 bellicosity on Twitter. She has told James Zogby, a pro-Sanders pollster, that \u201can army will rise up against this BS\u201d; threatened Starbucks\u2019 chief executive, Howard Schultz, with a boycott if he runs for president; and traded insults for two years with Jill Stein, the 2016 Green Party presidential candidate viewed by Tanden as a spoiler.\nOne recent night Tanden feuded on Twitter with liberals over whether Clinton condemned far-right hatemongers strongly enough more than two years ago. The online bickering raged for an hour, drawing trolls from both factions, when the woman originally targeted by Tanden\u2019s tweets delivered a wake-up call: \u201cNeera, you\u2019re responding to a graduate student on Twitter at 1:40 a.m.\u201d\nTom Daschle, a lobbyist and former senator who is chairman of the think tank\u2019s board, said he has full confidence in Tanden, who he said brings credibility, stature and \u201cenormous experience both managerially and around the issues.\u2019\u2019 He added that \u201cthere are people that are not as supportive of Neera\u2019s leadership, and that\u2019s natural.\u201d\nTanden, who rallied weeping staffers in the aftermath of Clinton\u2019s loss, has expertise on domestic policy dates to the early 1990s. As an Obama administration official she worked to pass the Affordable Care Act and during the Trump administration called the think tank to the ramparts during Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal it.\nUnder Tanden\u2019s leadership the center launched a lobbying and social media campaign to save the health care act, including building a web portal that relayed the stories of nearly 3,000 people whose coverage was in danger. Now, as many Democratic presidential candidates drift left toward \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plans like Sanders\u2019, the think tank is pushing its own plan, which, unlike Sanders\u2019 plan, reserves a role for private insurance companies.\nLast week, the think tank held an off-record briefing and made follow-up contacts with reporters, picking apart the details of Sanders\u2019 plan. In a fundraising email to supporters Sunday night, Sanders said the briefing was an effort \u201cto stop Medicare for All and our progressive agenda,\u201d by the think tank.\nLegum said that \u201cfrom the beginning the problem was there are all these little factions on the left, each caring about their own issues and their own agenda. And CAP was supposed to be a big umbrella.\u201d\nNow, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re in another period where\u2019s there\u2019s new energy, new perspectives, and people who are once again skeptical of CAP.\u201d\nTanden acknowledged tensions with what she called \u201cmillennial agitators\u201d in her party, but blamed Trump, who made \u201ccrazy, radical ideas seem more normal,\u201d she said in the interview.\u2019\nMaya Tanden, Tanden\u2019s mother, said her daughter is \u201csick of\u201d the nonstop fundraising and political squabbling at the think tank. \u201cShe said \u2018another two years and I\u2019m gone, I don\u2019t care what I do.\u2019\u201d\nNeera Tanden said she has no such plans.\nAdvertising\n\u201cWhen Trump won I was one of the better prepared people to deal with his victory. I righted this ship to be an effective response to him,\u201d she said. \u201cA place to come up with the ideas that would formulate the next generation of ideas.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "FILE PHOTO: Members of Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Khalifa Haftar, get ready before heading out of Benghazi to reinforce the troops advancing to Tripoli, in Benghazi, Libya April 13, 2019. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori/File Photo\nBy Ulf Laessing and Ahmed Elumami\nTRIPOLI (Reuters) - Qatar called on Tuesday for a blocking of foreign arms supplies to eastern Libyan forces commander Khalifa Haftar, whose push to seize the capital Tripoli is causing rifts around the Gulf and Europe.\nNearly two weeks into its assault, the veteran general's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) is stuck in the city's southern outskirts battling armed groups loyal to the internationally-recognised Tripoli government.\nYet Tripoli's roughly 2.5 million people maintained a semblance of normality - even as artillery booms echoed across the city.\n\"We are still carrying on, thank God. What else can we do?\" said Mohamed Taha, 23, in a street where students still packed a nearby school. Cafes and shops also remained open and busy.\nForeign powers are worried but unable to present a united front over the latest flare-up in the cycle of anarchy gripping Libya since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.\nThe conflict has brought a growing humanitarian toll - 174 people, 756 injured and almost 20,000 displaced according to latest United Nations tallies - and sunk for now an international peace plan.\nIt threatens to disrupt oil flows, foment migration across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and allow jihadists to exploit the chaos.\nQatar said an existing U.N. arms embargo on Libya should be strictly enforced, to prevent Haftar, 75, from receiving arms.\nBenghazi-based Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, who view him as an anchor to restore stability and combat Islamist militants.\nThose three nations cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of support for militants and Iran.\nQatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Italian daily La Repubblica a postponed U.N. peace forum should be rescheduled and Haftar's army made to withdraw.\nThe arms embargo must be implemented \"to prevent those countries that have been providing ammunitions and state-of-the-art weapons from continuing to do so,\" he said.\nPast U.N. reports say the UAE and Egypt have both supplied Haftar with arms and aircraft, giving him air superiority among Libya's multiple factions. East Libyan authorities say Qatar and Turkey back rival, Islamist-leaning factions in western Libya.\nU.N. MAY DEMAND CEASEFIRE\nThe Gulf diplomatic divisions echo those in Europe, where former colonial ruler Italy and France have sparred over Libya.\nParis has given Haftar support in the past, viewing him as the best bet to end the chaos since a NATO-backed rebellion to end Gaddafi's murderous four-decade rule.\nItaly, with considerable oil interests in the OPEC member, supports the Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and was furious with French reluctance to back a recent European Union resolution urging Haftar to halt his advance.\nNevertheless, Serraj has managed to keep the LNA at bay, thanks largely to armed groups who have rushed to aid them from other western Libyan factions.\n\"The war ends with the withdrawal of these (LNA) forces and return from where they came,\" Serraj said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe U.N. Security Council is considering a British-drafted resolution that would demand a ceasefire and urge all nations with influence over the warring parties to ensure compliance.\nThe 15-member council has expressed concern but been unable so far to issue a more formal statement, diplomats said, as Russia objected to a reference to the LNA while Washington said it could not agree a text that did not mention Haftar's forces.\nThough Haftar presents himself as a champion against what he calls terrorism, opponents cast him as a would-be dictator in the mould of Gaddafi. About 70 people protested against him at the central Algiers Square in Tripoli on Tuesday.\n(Reporting by Valentina Za in Milian, Ahmed Elumami in Tripoli, Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Michelle Nichols in New York ; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Over four years ago, BJP\u2019s Pritam Munde set a national record with her victory margin at a bypoll necessitated by the demise of her father Gopinath Munde. As another election approaches, the NCP, which did not field a candidate for the bypoll, is running a belligerent campaign ensuring that the contest for the Beed Lok Sabha seat will not be a cakewalk for the Mundes this time. The constituency will vote on April 18.\nAdvertising\nThe eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation began earlier in the year with a series of local NCP leaders joining the BJP in Beed. As recently as last week, former Maharashtra minister and a top NCP leader in Beed, Jaidutt Kshirsagar, visited Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Kshirsagar, sidelined within the NCP for some time, reportedly held a meeting along with his family members \u2014 also active in politics in Beed \u2014 with the Thackerays, setting off speculation about the family\u2019s plans ahead of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly polls later this year.\nClick here for more election news\nAs if in response, the NCP promptly announced that Shiv Sangram MLC Vinayak Mete, who currently supports the BJP government in Maharashtra, will support the NCP in Beed. Mete, who enjoys the status of a minister of state in the state government as chairman of a committee formed to oversee construction of a memorial to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Arabian Sea off Mumbai, declared to much confusion that he is still with the BJP, but would oppose the Munde family in Beed.\nAs an NDA constituent, the Shiv Sangram may be a bit player, but it has been at the forefront of emotive issues around the Marathas, and can channel some of the community\u2019s disappointment with the state government against Pritam.\nAdvertising\nFor a district that is among Maharashtra\u2019s poorest, ravaged by cyclical drought and lack of development, the political discourse is focused on personalities and conflicts among them, including family feuds \u2013 sisters Pritam and state minister Pankaja Munde, their cousin and leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Dhananjay Munde. While Mete is reportedly miffed at missing out on a ministership, former NCP leader Suresh Dhas, who lost to Gopinath Munde in 2014, is now with the BJP.\n\u201cNobody talks about real issues any more. There is a serious fodder crisis for those dependent on livestock for their livelihood, the water crisis is acute. And Marathas are very angry with the government for there is a sense that we were cheated on the issue of reservation. It appears that the law will not stand in courts. But the conversation around the elections in Beed is only about dynasties, defections, disloyalty,\u201d said Amol Jadhav, a Maratha and owner of 20 acres in Kaij taluka, who also writes on the region\u2019s political affairs.\nMarathas and Vanjaris are the largest voter groups in the constituency, each numbering about 5 lakh voters. The Mundes, who belong to the Vanjari community, are expected to sweep that segment. The votes of the Marathas, as well as of the Dalits and Muslims, are likely to be split down the middle.\n\u201cThe farmer community is with me,\u201d NCP candidate Bajrang Sonawane said at a recent public meeting. Sonawane is Beed\u2019s district president for the NCP, a Zilla Parishad member, and a farmer. He talks at every meeting and rally about the other major issue that has remained long-neglected in the constituency, that of a railway line to Beed from Parli.\nSonawane does not fail to mention the railway line, stressing that the powerful Munde family has failed to bring railway connectivity to Beed city, and that the long-delayed Ahmedngar-Beed-Parli line will be commissioned in two years if he is elected. Pritam and Pankaja have formulated a punctilious campaign plan and are spending long days on the road in a district where afternoon temperatures are currently in the 42-43 degrees Celsius range.\nMeanwhile, as emotive pleas hold sway in the campaign, for the 19 lakh voters of the district, water remains the most critical issue. In Chaklamba village in Georai taluka, farmers held a relay hunger strike for over a week in March to push for their demand \u2014 a simple sub-canal that can bring water for their crops.\n\u201cThis year, there is no rabi crop anywhere in the 110 villages of Chaklamba, Dhonrai and Bodhegaon circles here,\u201d said Machhindra Gawde, a district coordinator of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, which was leading the relay fast. The 16 villages in Chaklamba circle are currently supplied water entirely by tankers, and residents report every anticipated outcome of the drought from migration to erosion of assets. The village also witnessed 10 farmer suicides in the last five to six years.\nThat narrative is lost in the NCP-BJP face-off in Beed, doubly significant for both parties for the coming Assembly elections. In the 2009 state elections, barring Parli, which was won by Pankaja, the remaining five segments in Beed were picked up by the NCP.\nIn 2014, barring Beed Assembly segment that was won by Jaydutt Kshirsagar who was then with the NCP, the remaining five were won by BJP. In Beed, the slugfest between two dynasts will outlast this election.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Steve Dinneen\nReviewing Apple\u2019s new iPad Air is tricky. For most people, this is the iPad to buy, the one that will fulfil all your tablet needs, with plenty of room to spare. And with this much power under the hood, it will fulfill all your tablet needs for years to come. It is, objectively, a brilliant device: capable and sleek and, with prices starting at \u00a3479, even relatively affordable.\nAnd yet it\u2019s easiest to define the iPad Air by what it lacks. There\u2019s no FaceID, which users of Apple\u2019s newer phones or the superlative iPad Pro (starting price \u00a3769) have become accustomed to. It only has two speakers, resulting in a noticeable drop-off in audio quality compared to the Pro. The rear-facing camera is serviceable, but not not a patch on those found in Apple\u2019s top-end devices. It\u2019s compatible with the Apple Pencil for taking notes and sketching, but not the sexy new one with the flat edge and the magnetic charging \u2013 instead it uses the original one you have to stuff in the Lightning port to charge, making your iPad look like a lollipop or a fly-swatter.\nIt even feels a little dated, with the same curved and beveled design that turned heads back in 2013 but now blends coyly into the background.\nAll of which is a shame, because the iPad Air\u2019s steps forward are significant and tangible. Foremost among them is a greatly improved display, with full lamination and an anti-reflective coating to reduce glare. It\u2019s brighter than ever, with a wide colour gamut, making it great for watching video on the go. The display is now the same size as the (smaller) iPad Pro at 10.5 inches, compared to 9.7 for the base iPad \u2013 a small but noticeable increase.\nAnd while the design is hardly cutting edge, it feels great in the hand: light at just 1lb (456g), pleasingly silky to the touch and made to the impeccable production values we\u2019ve come to expect from Apple. It\u2019s super-fast, with the same A12 Bionic chip found in Apple\u2019s high-end smartphones, meaning you\u2019ll probably never really push it to its limits.\nIt\u2019s also a big step up in terms of storage, with 64GB (\u00a3479) and 264GB (\u00a3629) options, compared to the base iPad with 32GB (\u00a3319) or 128GB (\u00a3409). If you use your tablet for more than emails, web-browsing and streaming, that extra storage alone justifies the price.\nAnother selling point is the compatibility with Apple\u2019s excellent Smart Keyboard, which snaps on to the side of the device, giving you the ability to type longer passages without bashing your fingers against unforgiving, unresponsive glass.\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that this will set you back an extra \u00a3159; coupled with the larger storage and the Apple Pencil (\u00a389), suddenly you\u2019re paying \u00a3877, which no longer seems like such a bargain (make that \u00a3997 if you throw in cellular internet, too).\nBut this is Apple, and the option to spend as much as your wallet can bear is certainly nothing new.\nIf you\u2019re buying your first tablet, this would be ideal. If you\u2019re upgrading from a few generations ago, this is the iPad for you. If you\u2019re on the fence, I\u2019d wait a year, by which time you\u2019re likely to see the equivalent tablet with faceID and compatibility with the second generation Apple Pencil.

North East Support and Action for Youth (NESAY) began the Fair Feed project in 2017 with the RE Ross Trust and the Central Hume Primary Care Partnership. Project worker Melissa Van Bergen said using a Fair Feed card, youth could provide $3 and receive a meal valued up to $15. \"At the end of the month NESAY refunds the difference,\" she said. \"We try to make sure it's subtle and that the young people feel comfortable and welcomed in the cafe.\" In its first year, 143 meals were provided across six cafes. Related: Owen Godenzi, general Manager of 3NE and EDGE FM, learned about the program at the end of 2017. \"It's great for them to be able to sit down to have a meal like everyone else,\" he said. \"We wanted to see it be developed in Benalla as well. \"Geoff and Helen Handbury were previous owners of ACE Radio and they have a foundation to help out communities throughout Victoria; through the foundation we've been able to donate funds to NESAY.\" NESAY is now in talks with local groups and cafes about what the program would look like in Benalla, drawing from what they've learned from the Wangaratta program. Chief executive Leah Waring said it gave youth a more inclusive option compared to frozen meals or seeking help from a food relief provider. In other news: \"We found if we gave them the card with a list of cafes, they won't use it as much,\" she said. \"The success has been that their worker or a family member goes with them, they have a meal in the cafe together, and the cards get used. \"For some of the young people involved with Fair Feed, it was the first time they'd eaten a cafe in town. News of the program's expansion is even more welcome today, on Youth Homelessness Matters Day. \"When you're talking about youth homelessness, people don't know it's necessarily here because it's not as visible as what it is in the CBD of Melbourne,\" Ms Waring said. \"There is a whole lot of data that shows youth homelessness hasn't reduced in 10 years. \"Fair Feed enables the community to do something to show they care about young people in the town - over the years, we haven't enabled that as well as we could have. \"It's about providing safety, security and food in your belly, but also community inclusion.\" In 2018, NESAY supported 579 young people and their families across the local government areas of Wangaratta, Alpine, Benalla, and Mansfield, and parts of Indigo and Moira.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/ellen.ebsary/742a27b3-1dbd-4971-b6e6-fadbdf73642a.jpg/r432_508_4859_3009_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The questions kept coming at Kyle Guy as he tried to make his way through a clogged court to join his Virginia teammates celebrating the program\u2019s first national championship.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the words, man,\u201d Guy said to one person as he kept side-stepping and inching his way forward through the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need them, really. He had his perfect ending already standing amid the confetti with a piece of clipped-down net stuffed into hat. A year after a humiliating tournament exit against 16-seed UMBC \u2014 followed by death threats and his open discussion of battles with anxiety \u2014 Guy was the Final Four\u2019s most outstanding player for a Virginia team that finally had the title many said it couldn\u2019t win with its conservative offense and pace of play.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t set in yet,\u201d Guy said in the locker room. \u201cI\u2019ll start crying when it does.\u201d\nGuy scored 24 points in Monday night\u2019s 85-77 overtime win against Texas Tech, a match of defensive-minded teams that instead spent much of the game trading big shot after big shot. Guy finished 8 of 15 from the field and 4 of 9 from 3-point range, providing a start-to-finish dose of scoring while teammate De\u2019Andre Hunter took the lead after a quiet first half to finish with a game-high 27 points.\nThe 6-foot-2 junior from Indianapolis never let some shaky NCAA Tournament showings scare him away from taking \u2014 and making \u2014 the shots the Cavaliers so desperately needed.\n\u201cI\u2019m a confident player and my teammates, they feed me a lot of confidence,\u201d Guy said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot whether it\u2019s falling or not. I don\u2019t really ever feel out of rhythm.\u201d\nHe had looked that way in the first three tournament games, making 8 of 38 shots (21.1 and 3 of 26 from behind the arc (11.5%). But he had come up with huge moments in the Cavaliers\u2019 last three games, starting with 25 points and 10 rebounds in the overtime win against Purdue in the Elite Eight.\nHe had 15 points in the national semifinals against Auburn, including a critical late 3-pointer with the Cavaliers trailing by two-possessions followed by an even more pressure-packed moment when he was fouled on a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left.\nWith more than 70,000 people watching his every gesture and expression, he calmly sank all three to give Virginia the 63-62 win and a second straight tournament escape.\nThis time, he was sharp from the start against the Red Raiders, scoring 10 in each half before going 4 for 4 at the line in the extra period as the Cavaliers finally broke free in a tense game.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he does: he shoots the crap out of the ball,\u201d said teammate Ty Jerome, who penetrated to zip a one-handed pass to the far corner to set up one of Guy\u2019s second-half 3s. \u201cIf Kyle\u2019s open for a split second, I\u2019ve got to put that ball right in his pocket.\u201d\nHe also played all 45 minutes, the only player for either team to do so.\n\u201cHe can play all night,\u201d teammate Kihei Clark said. \u201cHe really moves on offense. He never really gets get tired. And then to play defense on them just shows you the kind of player he is. We have a bunch of great players, but when Kyle is making shots, it fuels us on defense.\u201d\nAnd Guy certainly was ready to savor the moment when it came. With Braxton Key at the line with 7.8 seconds left for clinching free throws, Guy stood with Jerome and Hunter out close to midcourt, the trio with their arms around each other at midcourt to share the building excitement.\nThis was the moment Guy had dreamed of for the past year that had followed that still-incomprehensible loss to UMBC \u2014 the first time a No. 1 seed had lost to a No. 16 in tournament history. Guy had been open in social media posts in the week that followed about the fallout from that game, from death threats towards the players to openly discussing that he had been taking medication for anxiety attacks.\nHe had kept that UMBC loss right in front of him, too, in the form of a Twitter avatar photo of him staring at the court with his hands on his knees as the Retrievers celebrated that unprecedented win. (And yes, he\u2019s going to change that photo now).\nIt was just one way the UMBC question had dogged Guy and the Cavaliers. They patiently answered every time, though the questions became more frequent once the Cavaliers finally got to the NCAA Tournament again. And coach Tony Bennett has told his team that everyone would watch to see how they responded.\nBy Monday night, Guy and the Cavaliers had the final word.\n\u201cI\u2019m all ears: they can say what they want,\u201d Guy said. \u201cI\u2019m a national champion. You can\u2019t take that away from me.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Share\nT-Mobile, which recently decided to take on the cable companies on their home turf by offering an unlimited wireless LTE home internet service, doesn\u2019t want us to forget that it still has designs on cable\u2019s original bread and butter: TV.\nThough its plan to launch a \u201cdisruptive new TV service in 2018,\u201d has clearly failed to materialize, it\u2019s not because T-Mobile is tossing in the towel. In fact, it recently inked a deal with Viacom that will see Viacom\u2019s TV channels, like Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, and Paramount, on the first version of that TV service \u2014 a mobile TV package that it still expects to launch later in 2019. Under the new deal, T-Mobile can stream live, linear feeds of Viacom\u2019s channels in addition to on-demand versions of the shows.\nThe in-home version is still in the works, though its launch date remains murky. It will make use of 5G technology to replace cable, according to TechCrunch, which might give it a very different footprint than its in-home internet service. What hasn\u2019t changed is T-Mobile\u2018s acquisition of cable provider Layer3 TV acting as the platform on which it will build both mobile and in-home TV businesses. With its own IP network, it can send high-definition video to homes at levels of bandwidth similar to Netflix. Layer3 TV is currently only available in five U.S. cities and provides more than 275 channels, including ESPN, NBC, AMC, and other popular channels at higher video quality than similar services. The TV provider also mixes video content from streaming services and social media with broadcast and cable channels.\nOur only indication of how its TV service will operate remains a video featuring T-Mobile\u2019s inimitable CEO, John Legere. The service\u2019s user interface in the video shows a carousel of channels and services such as Netflix, AMC, and Hulu, which people can swipe through. Options such as DVR are available above the viewing options. While watching video content, you can swipe through channels overlaid on the screen with information on which of your friends are watching that particular program.\nIn the video, T-Mobile says it will use \u201cmachine learning to understand your likes and tastes.\u201d TV programs are pictured with a thumbs-up button next to them, presumably allowing you to \u201clike\u201d a program. Cooking competition show Chopped is recommended to a viewer in the video because they liked the Food Network. Everything in the video is a demo of possible services, so all of this could be different by the time T-Mobile actually launches it.\nLegere released a video announcing T-Mobile\u2019s foray into TV and took aim at today\u2019s cable TV model: \u201cRequiring a landline just to get a better price on cable? It\u2019s complete bullshit,\u201d Legere asserted.\nThe new TV service is part of T-Mobile\u2019s strategy that included giving free Netflix subscriptions to those with T-Mobile family plans. No price has been announced for either version of T-Mobile\u2019s new TV service, but you\u2019d have to expect T-Mobile will be aiming to make it more affordable than cable.\nUpdated on April 3, 2019: Added details regarding the Viacom deal.\n", "label": "human"}

SEPTA investigators say the signals and railroad arms were functioning properly but drivers thought they were stuck and drove around them.\nWhat to Know A woman died from her injuries after a SEPTA train collided with her SUV during the Monday morning commute.\nSurveillance video obtained by NBC10 shows the deadly crash.\nInvestigators say the woman tried to drive around the railroad arms, unaware that a train was passing through.\nA woman died from her injuries after a SEPTA train collided with her SUV during the Monday morning commute.\nThe SEPTA train made impact with the driver side of the SUV at Union Avenue in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, shortly after 9 a.m. The train then appeared to drag the SUV along the tracks before coming to a stop with the SUV still against the front of the commuter train.\nThe unidentified woman was taken to the hospital where she was pronounced dead Tuesday. None of the 300 passengers on the train were seriously hurt.\nAll service on the Media/Elwyn Line was suspended until trains began running again around noon, SEPTA said.\nSEPTA Train Slams Into SUV in Delco\nSEPTA suspended its Media/Elwyn Line Monday morning after a train slammed into an SUV on the tracks. (Published Monday, April 8, 2019)\nSEPTA brought in buses to get passengers on the train to their destinations.\nThe intersection where the crash took place has rail crossing markers, arm bars and light-up signs. Investigators say the railroad arms were triggered by a train heading towards Media. The drivers who were stopped thought the arms were stuck in the down position after the initial train passed.\nSurveillance video obtained by NBC10 shows the first two vehicles driving around the railroad arms. Yet just as the third vehicle tries to follow, it's struck when it enters the path of a second train heading inbound less than two minutes later.\nThe train pushed the vehicle down the tracks more than 500 feet from the point of initial impact, investigators said. Louis Billa told NBC10 he heard the crash.\n\"We hear a screeching sound and it sounded like someone blowing up,\" Billa said. \"The next thing we know, tires bursting and blowing and turn around and look and there's a train, car going straight down the track in front of the train.\"\nBilla is spotted on surveillance running towards the vehicle after the crash.\n\"I seen the car mangled up and the lady's head sitting right there over in the seat,\" he said.\nBilla told NBC10 he often sees drivers trying to go around the railroad signs.\n\"People don't obey the law or the railroad signs,\" he said. \"If they are in a rush they are going to go around the railroad signs and try and beat that train.\"\nAll safety measures at the crossing were working properly, according to Jim Fox of SEPTA.\n\"The gates and flashers were working appropriately,\" Fox said. \"For whatever reason the drivers decided to take that chance to drive around the gates. You are only asking for trouble if you do that.\"\nOfficials continue to investigate. The SUV was towed from the scene.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The first day of Star Wars Celebration brought the reveal of the merchandise that Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge will have on sale at the First Order Cargo and Resistance Supply shops within the theme park expansion. Now another wave of Star Wars Galaxy\u2019s Edge merchandise has been revealed from three other shops nestled in the Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu.\nThe new Star Wars Galaxy\u2019s Edge merchandise reveal includes plenty of playthings from Toydarian Toymaker, a roster of cuddly and creepy animals from the Creature Stall, and some outstanding gear for cosplayers from Black Spire Outfitters. We\u2019ve got a closer look at the latest items that were on display at the Galaxy\u2019s Edge booth at Star Wars Celebration below.\nToydarian Toymaker\nSince Galaxy\u2019s Edge is making it seem like Batuu is a real place in the Star Wars universe, how is the park selling toys? Well, even though we saw that there are some figures sold in the First Order Cargo and Resistance Supply shops that don\u2019t exactly fit that bill, the Toydarian Toymaker shop actually puts more effort into make their toys feel like they\u2019re from the world of Star Wars.\nAs you can see, there are some wooden action figures that feel handcrafted. They have a homemade feel to them that have the same kind of style as Rey\u2019s own X-wing pilot doll that you can briefly see in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Plus, there are also basic, wooden versions of the ships, ranging from the Millennium Falcon to the Jawa Sandcrawler. Plus, there are little spinning puzzles with characters split into three parts.\nThe same can be said for the plush toys of characters as well. While I\u2019m wondering how they can justify the existence of these characters as toys in the Star Wars universe, the easy answer could be that the stories of some of their heroics (or in some cases villainy) have reached the furthest parts of the galaxy, and maybe some people have turned them into legends in the form of toys.\nIn addition to playing with their favorite characters, kids also love to make noise. That\u2019s why Toydarian Toymaker will also have instruments from the Star Wars universe. On display were a couple pieces played by the Figrin D\u2019an and the Modal Nodes in the Mos Eisley Cantina from A New Hope, as well as Droopy McCool from the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi, as well as a drum, that is likely meant to be from the Ewok village or something like that.\nOr if you\u2019re more into the game side of things, there\u2019s a wooden Dejarik board. It\u2019s a far cry from the high tech holographic version from the Millennium Falcon, but it\u2019s still pretty cool. Plus, if you turn it over, it\u2019s a simple checkers board.\nOther games range from the complicated card game Sabaac that could end up losing you a ship, some chance cubes that might get you into a dangerous podracing bet, and a matching game for the kids who want to get better at recognizing the legends of the Star Wars universe.\nPuzzles are also front and center at Toydarian Toymaker, including a 3D wood model of a Krayt dragon skeleton, as well as a Jedi Holocron puzzle cube, which appears to be the Star Wars universe version of a Rubik\u2019s cube. Is there something inside when you solve it? That would be amazing.\nAnd finally, this little crank music box was on display. And since it has the Imperial insignia on it, as well as the face of Darth Vader, a Stormtrooper helmet and several TIE Fighters, we\u2019re betting that it plays the Imperial March in the style of a classic music box.\nCreature Stall\nIf the characters of Star Wars aren\u2019t quite as entrancing as the creatures, then you\u2019ll want to head over to the Creature Stall to pick up some of the most famous (and lesser known) aliens. They come in various materials and sizes, some looking more like their movie counterparts than others.\nThe wampa looks like he\u2019s seen better hair days, and the mynock could use a wider wingspan. But that tauntaun is adorable, as well as the porg. Then there\u2019s the creepier critters like the rathtar from The Force Awakens or the worrt from Return of the Jedi. But the real treasure here is the Salacious Crumb toy, which can sit on your shoulder and be operated like a puppet. Of course, that\u2019s not really the Salacious Crumb, but just two different kinds of average Kowakian monkey-lizards.\nBlack Spire Outfitters\nFinally, at what will likely be one of the more expensive shops in Galaxy\u2019s Edge, you\u2019ll be able get your hands on some appropriate clothing to wear on Batuu. Surely people are going to comment on your weird jeans and baseball hats, because no one wears that stuff in a galaxy far, far away. So you\u2019ll want some threads that help you blend in.\nAs you can see, there are ensembles for the light and dark side, although the outfit on the left feels like it could go either way. Actually, the one on the right isn\u2019t necessarily for the dark side entirely either, because Luke Skywalker wore something vaguely similar in Return of the Jedi. So both could go either way.\nBut Disney parks aren\u2019t meant only for adults. That\u2019s why kids will be able to gear up like a Jedi or Sith too. There\u2019s children-sized clothing options that aren\u2019t just cheap Halloween costumes, but legit cosplay wardrobes. Above you can see an ensemble that\u2019s Kylo Ren-esque, as well as one that\u2019s clearly a little Rey. And there\u2019s also a full Jedi cloak and clothing situation there, as well as what might be an alternative sort of Rey outfit with black pants. You\u2019ll also notice that each of them has their own lightsaber, which will be a big part of the merchandise experience in a whole different way.\n***\nThere\u2019s still more merchandise left to be revealed in the remaining days of Star Wars Celebration, so stay tuned to see even more goods that you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on at the park.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "AN education authority facing a funding crisis has dismissed claims that the closure of numerous small schools has been part of a secret money-saving scheme.\nAs North Yorkshire County Council\u2019s executive approved steps to close the 360-year-old Arkengarthdale Primary School in the Yorkshire Dales after pupil numbers fell to five, its members said they were dismayed by the loss of another small, rural school.\nWhile there were more than 170 primary schools in the county in 2004 with fewer than 100 pupils, the council now oversees about 110 small schools.\nAlongside the closure of the 12-pupil school at Horton-in-Ribblesdale in July 2017, other school gates have been closed for the final time in Drax, Rathmell, Ingleby Arncliffe, Skipton Ings, Swainby and Potto and Burnt Yates, while a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the future of West Burton School.\nThe closures have been greeted with alarm by community leaders, particularly in national parks, where the presence of a school is seen as key to retaining families in the community.\nThe authority\u2019s leader, Councillor Carl Les told the executive the authority had been accused of trying to claw back money by closing small schools. He said small schools continued to be very good places for learning as long as they had more than about 20 pupils.\nCllr Les said: \u201cIt is a very sad day when we have to approve a consultation about a school closure. We don\u2019t do this lightly, but the numbers of children at Arkengarthdale have fallen to such a level that the school is no longer viable and it certainly isn\u2019t providing a quality education.\u201d\nTo help maintain smaller schools, the authority sets aside some schools block funding for a Falling Rolls Fund to support good or outstanding schools with falling rolls, where planning data shows surplus places will be needed within three years.\nCllr Les said the authority was pressing the Government for a core fund that gets put into a school to allow it to operate irrespective of the pupil numbers.\nHe said: \u201cThe county council does not have a programme of closure, it actually costs us money when a school is closed so we are certainly not doing it for financial reasons. We only consider the closure of a school at the request of the governing body.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Most of us would probably describe the internet as a vast network of websites, social networks, and videos that users can virtually access with computers and mobile devices. While this would undoubtedly describe the ways most of us interact with the internet, it fails to encompass its vast array of connections and reach. The internet is much more than a collection of billions of web addresses; it is the digital network connecting each website to billions of connected devices.\nWhat is the Internet of Things?\nThe internet has expanded to now connect a number of devices beyond our familiar computers, tablets, and smartphones. Collectively, these connected devices make up the Internet of Things (IoT), a network of billions of appliances and gadgets that collect, receive, and transmit data. These devices can be used to automate, control, monitor, or track a wide range of formerly \"dumb\" devices -- things that once did not communicate to other devices or connect to the internet -- such as:\nAutomobiles\nLights\nMedical devices (e.g., advanced hearing aids, heart monitors, etc.)\nRefrigerators\nSecurity systems\nSmart speakers\nTelevisions\nThermostats\nTransportation infrastructure devices (e.g., electronic toll collections, smart traffic controls, etc.)\nWearables\nAnd more\nWhat are smart devices?\nThese appliances, when capable of communicating with users, other devices, or the internet, are often referred to as \"smart devices.\" The adjective \"smart\" generally means the device is part of the IoT and, as such, is generally capable of more than what the appliance is traditionally known for doing.\nFor instance, a smart TV means the television can browse the internet, download apps, or be controlled by other devices. A smart doorbell might send a push notification to your smartphone when rung. A smart refrigerator can order food that is running low.\nPopular smart-home devices\nSeveral of today's largest companies are now making smart-home speakers that can control the rest of the home's smart devices from one central location. For instance, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) sold a \"record-breaking number\" of devices powered by Alexa, its AI platform in the 2018 holiday season quarter, with the Echo Dot, its voice-controlled speaker, being the highest-selling unit globally. The Alexa platform now has 50,000 skills, ranging from streaming music, citing facts, playing games, and of course, ordering products from Amazon.\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Home devices also sold millions of units in 2018 and can work with more than 5,000 different smart-home devices across 150 different brands. (Even The Motley Fool works with Google Home!) Alphabet brags that the device was used to make 16 million recipes during the 2018 holiday season.\nApple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) HomePod, powered by Siri, has not enjoyed nearly the same popularity as the Google Home or Echo Dot devices, probably owing to its much higher price point. That said, Apple continues to believe there is a market for a smart-home speaker that prioritizes privacy and sound quality above all else.\nHow big is the IoT?\nThere are many contrasting projections concerning the growth of the installed device base of the IoT over the coming years. IHS Markit, a global information provider, estimates that the total number of IoT devices will surge from 27 billion in 2017 to 125 billion by 2030. Cisco estimates that it will be much higher by then, believing that 500 billion devices will be connected to the internet in 2030. Global consulting firm Bain believes spending on the IoT will grow to $520 billion in 2021, more than double the $235 billion that was spent in 2017.\nWhen it comes to investing, the better approach is often to be generally right than precisely wrong. In other words, the important takeaway from these statistics isn't the exact number of devices that will be connected in a certain year or the precise spending that companies will invest in this industry. Rather, the relevant fact is that the IoT is still growing by leaps and bounds, with a long runway still ahead of it.\nThe biggest pros and cons of investing in the IoT\nOne of the biggest tailwinds for the IoT is the coming of 5G wireless networks. 5G, the fifth generation of wireless networks, will bring:\nFaster network speeds -- some experts claim up to 100 times as fast as 4G networks.\nLower latency (the delay between sending and receiving a signal).\nGreater data capabilities, meaning more data will be able to be carried across mobile signals at once.\nBy increasing wireless networks' speed and reliability, 5G will enable a whole host of applications, including autonomous vehicles, mobile payments, and virtual reality. This will literally increase the real-world number and use of IoT devices.\nThe greatest risk facing the IoT is that while it is big and growing, its future growth rate remains a projection. Nothing is certain to come to pass. 5G networks might launch slower than anticipated. Fully autonomous vehicles might prove to be decades away. Virtual reality may never see mass adoption among consumers. Industries may never find uses or ways to analyze the troves of data IoT can give them.\nETFs, the easy way to invest in the Internet of Things\nWith all of the money pouring into the IoT in the years ahead, it's only natural for investors to wonder how to capitalize on this huge trend. While we'll discuss individual stocks shortly, there is another, easier way to attempt to profit: The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR). An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a basket of equities that are grouped together under one trading entity.\nMany, as in this case, are grouped together under common sectors and themes. The Global X IoT ETF contains large holdings in a wide range of diverse companies, including:\nIn other words, buying this ETF can instantly diversify investors across industries, yet still be centered on the common theme of the IoT. Investing in ETFs can also be a smart way to mitigate risk through diversification as well as take advantage of macro trends without the heavy time investment that studying individual stocks involves. While this ETF could very well beat the S&P 500 index in the years ahead, I believe there are still better ways for investors to profit from the Internet of Things.\nThe best IoT stocks for 2019\nIoT Company Why It's a Great IoT Investment Alphabet The search giant has already sold millions of its Google Home smart-home speakers. Amazon.com Amazon has used its AI-powered Alexa platform to equip its hardware devices, including the popular Echo Dot, with more than 50,000 skills. Apple While its HomePod has yet to take off, its wearables division, led by the Apple Watch, is gaining in functionality and popularity. DexCom The medical-device company makes glucose-monitoring devices for diabetics. GrubHub NYSE:GRUB) As mobile devices grow, food-delivery transactions will only grow more painless. This best-in-class food-delivery platform should be poised to benefit. Honeywell International This manufacturing giant is beginning to make several industrial devices with IoT capabilities. Mastercard NYSE:MA) This payments network should benefit from the explosion of mobile payments as transactions that were once negotiated in cash are done electronically. Skyworks Solutions This company's analog semiconductor chips are essential for devices connecting to wireless networks. Verizon Communications NYSE:VZ) This telecom powerhouse might be the first to deploy 5G wireless networks around the U.S. Visa NYSE:V) The card network will directly benefit from the explosion of digital payments routinely conducted by IoT devices.\nLet's take a closer look at some of these companies to see why they make such good investments today.\nDexCom: Continuous monitoring for diabetics\nDexCom is a health-care device company that designs and develops continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for diabetics. A small sensor, placed just under the skin, measures glucose levels every five minutes. An adhesive patch holds the sensor in place throughout the day. A small transmitter then sends the readings to a compatible mobile device, usually an Android or iOS smartphone.\nDexCom's CGM solutions are shown to reduce users' A1C scores (a blood test that shows your average glucose levels over the past three months), reduce hypoglycemia, and provide active monitoring at night, making them an extremely attractive value proposition for diabetics.\nThe company expects to grow revenue by 15% annually through 2023, a reflection of its huge total addressable market and the number of patients it has yet to reach. Over the same period, it expects to grow its operating margin from negative 3% to 15% through a variety of cost controls and the winding down of research projects.\nGrubHub: The food-delivery app\nGrubHub is the country's largest digital platform for placing restaurant take-out and delivery orders. As the devices that connect to the internet increase in number, mobile platforms for ordering delivery should only grow more ubiquitous. In addition to being a huge mobile platform, GrubHub is also one of the best ways to invest in the growing food-delivery boom. The company finished 2018 with 17.7 million active diners, the number of unique diner accounts that have placed an order on the company's platform in the past year. During that same time, there were also 467,500 daily average grubs, or DAGs, which the company calculates by taking the number of total orders and dividing it by the number of days in the measured period. Both figures were up approximately 20% from 2017 totals.\nGrubHub is constantly working to improve its mobile interface so hungry diners can find exactly what they're looking for in a quick and seamless process. In a 2018 conference call, founder and CEO Matthew Maloney stated:\nContinuous improvement of our diner-facing product remains a priority and a source of growth for us. Recently, we reengineered our mobile experience implementing a new, cleaner tile layout for restaurant search as well as improvements to navigation and a more photo-forward approach to discovery.\nGrubHub is also providing mobile support for many of its partners, including Yum! Brands' Taco Bell and KFC chains. In late 2017, the company partnered with the two iconic fast-food brands to become their exclusive digital online and mobile ordering platform. When asked if GrubHub would be integrating its platform with the restaurants' mobile apps as well, Maloney responded:\n[W]e're powering their white label for everything. All transactions and their websites ... We are not only supporting their restaurants on our marketplaces and across our affiliate network, but we are also supporting them on all of their white label properties. We're providing order management, including pickup and delivery for KFC and Taco Bell ... It's a very close, unique partnership in the space because we're extremely aligned and both parties are agnostic to what channel the order comes in on.\nIt doesn't take a crystal ball to see that more restaurants, especially smaller chains and stand-alone locations would want to outsource their mobile offerings to GrubHub as well. While the company faces competition from the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats, GrubHub seems to be one of the few winners that will emerge from the pack for mobile ordering of food delivery and takeout.\nMastercard and Visa: The credit-card networks\nMastercard and Visa sport similar business models, essentially collecting tiny fees for every transaction facilitated over their respective networks. While they obviously compete with each other and other credit-card networks for market share, their primary rival remains cash. Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga estimates that about 80% of the world's transactions are still facilitated with currency.\nAs such, trends like e-commerce have been a boon for Mastercard and Visa. Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu explained at a recent analyst conference that online purchases have been a huge boon for credit-card companies:\nE-commerce is growing five times as fast as face-to-face transactions. And in an e-commerce transaction, the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face-to-face transaction. So something growing five times as fast where your propensity to be used is twice what it might have been. That's phenomenal.\nNot only does mobile commerce continue this trend, it accelerates it. The more devices connected to the internet, the easier it will be to make electronic payments where cash was previously used. This can be done through apps, such as those hosted by Domino's and GrubHub, or even via sensors on your vehicle's gas tank that will automatically pay for the gas as you pump. As more devices come online, transactions that traditionally had to be negotiated using cash -- think parking meters, toll-booth collections, etc. -- will now be facilitated with digital payments.\nSkyworks Solutions: Connecting the Internet of Things (IoT)\nFor those not familiar with the company, Skyworks Solutions designs analog semiconductors, a key component for any connected device to wireless networks such as LTE or Wi-Fi. Most of Skyworks' revenue comes from smartphones, and its biggest customer by far is Apple.\nAs the advent of 5G approaches, more devices will be connected than ever before. For payments purposes, this includes things from smartwatches that wearers can use to make purchases at stores to cars that will automatically pay the pump once the nozzle is inserted in the vehicle's gas tank. All of these devices will need to connect to a network to make the payment, and the more of these connected devices there are, the more the world will need Skyworks' chips.\nIn a 2019 conference call, CEO Liam Griffin specifically called out several industrial and consumer applications as catalysts for IoT device growth once 5G network coverage spreads:\nWith expanded 5G network capacity on the horizon, we expect 75 billion devices will be connected by 2025. That's three times today's installed base. Leveraging our leadership across all major wireless standards, including ... 4G LTE and 5G, we are well-positioned to capture a disproportionate share of this growth, particularly with the advent of autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, Industrial IoT, and frictionless commerce.\nSkyworks has shown a clear ability to profitably grow as smartphone architecture grows in complexity and connected devices in numbers. In the 2018 fiscal year, Skyworks' non-GAAP EPS was $7.22, more than triple its 2013 total of $2.20. That's greater than 27% annual growth over a six-year time frame.\nVerizon: The 5G wireless network leader\nThe faster network speeds that the next generation of wireless coverage offers are essential to the growth of the IoT. While other networks have begun to close the U.S. wireless coverage gap between their own infrastructure and Verizon's, I believe Verizon will deploy 5G coverage in more major domestic markets sooner than the rest. As the 5G race between the telecom carriers really heats up, I believe Verizon's quality will, once again, clearly surpass its competitors'.\nThere are several reasons I think Verizon occupies the inside lane in this race. For starters, Verizon was the first to launch a commercial 5G service. In late 2018, Verizon launched 5G Home, a 5G-internet service for residences in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento. This will give Verizon a head start over its rivals as it figures out the best way to install and maintain this type of service. In a recent conference call, CFO Matt Ellis explained, \"And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs, the technology works. Our customers are getting the experience they expected.\"\nIn tests leading up to the 5G Home launch, Verizon engineers were pleasantly surprised by the real-world capabilities of the network. For instance, in an interview with Motley Fool contributor Nicholas Rossolillo, Verizon Vice President of Network Engineering Mike Haberman stated, \"Some of the examples we use were it got higher up buildings, up to the 19th floor of buildings, when we didn't think it would reach that high. We were seeing locations 2,000 feet from the cell site and still having good speeds.\"\nVerizon also has higher aspirations for its 5G networks than just faster smartphone speeds, such as its smart-city initiatives, where the company is working with specific municipalities to use the technology to solve different pain points around the city.\nWhat might make Verizon a particularly interesting stock for some investors is that it sports a dividend yield that is consistently over 4%. For income investors looking to invest in the growing mobile payments trend, Verizon might be their best bet.\nIoT: A trend from which all investors can profit\nSince the inception of the internet, mankind's tendency to use technology to make the world a smaller, more connected place has only accelerated. I do not think this race to connect to the world around us will slow down, much less cease, any time soon. The IoT represents one of the best ways to invest in this trend.\nAs you can see, there are a number of great companies to choose from that have exposure to this sector, ranging from the tech companies making the smart devices, to the makers of the components, to the providers of the services that will be offered through these devices.\nThese companies also encompass the different styles of investing. For income investors, there are stocks such as Apple and Verizon that pay growing and hefty dividend yields. Value investors might be interested in beaten-up semiconductor stocks or undervalued telecom carriers that stand to benefit from IoT's growth. Growth investors will probably be attracted to the big tech and payments companies. No matter your style of investing, I am confident this trend can help all investors profit and beat the market in the years ahead.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "LONDON (REUTERS) - One-two victories by Mercedes in the first three races of the season does not mean Formula One is set for a repeat of 1992, when then-dominant Williams did the same and ran away with the title, according to Ross Brawn.\nFormula One's managing director for motorsport said on Tuesday (April 16) that the situation was very different now compared with the last time a team started the campaign with three one-twos in a row.\n\"Despite the statistics being racked up by Mercedes, I don't believe that 2019 will follow the same script as 1992,\" said Mr Brawn in a review of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.\n\"The three consecutive one-two finishes scored by Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas are definitely down to a team that is operating to perfection at the moment, with a top-notch technical package.\n\"But it's also fair to say it is up against stronger opposition than was Williams back in '92.\"\nBritain's Nigel Mansell won the first five races of that season on his way to the title, with Williams' run of one-twos interrupted in Spain when Michael Schumacher finished second for Benetton, with Ferrari's Jean Alesi in third place.\nWilliams then won the next race one-two and did it again in France and Britain.\nMansell ended up winning nine of the 16 races, with Riccardo Patrese taking only one, and scored more than twice as many points as Schumacher, his closest non-Williams rival.\nBritain's five-times world champion Hamilton has won two of three races for Mercedes this year, with team-mate Bottas taking the opener in Australia.\nFerrari should have won in Bahrain, however, with Charles Leclerc on pole position and fastest until a late power unit problem while leading.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "By Charles Ellinas\nAn international workshop organised by a European think-tank in Nicosia on 3-4 April provided a regional perspective on East Med gas. The participants represented most countries in the region, as well as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greece and Turkey. The subjects discussed included the latest developments in natural gas, the geopolitical risks of gas exploration and production, environmental impact, security risks, climate change, transparency and corruption. These discussions form the basis of this article.\nThe East Med is a region of clashing interests, but also networks of cooperation, providing a gateway from the Middle East \u2013 including Egypt and Israel \u2013 to Europe. The US, having scaled-down its direct presence, is cultivating alliances with Israel, Greece and Cyprus to safeguard its interests in the region.\nIs energy the glue that will unify the region or is it a source of competition? New natural gas discoveries are attracting attention to the region, but are also a source of conflict. Turkey\u2019s more nationalistic interests have put it at odds not only with Cyprus, but also with Israel and Egypt and are straining its relationship with Greece. They are also threatening security in the East Med.\nMeanwhile, northern Cyprus is becoming increasingly \u2018turkicised\u2019. In addition to water, soon there will also be electricity interconnection. As time passes, this problem is becoming increasingly intractable.\nAlignment between Egypt, Greece, Cyprus and Israel, and possibly Jordan, is developing around energy, but it is also driven by political and security considerations.\nGas developments\nThe major news in February was the discovery by ExxonMobil of Glafkos gas-field in block 10. Estimated reserves of the three discovered gas-fields, with a 90% probability, are: Glafkos 4 trillion cubic feet (tcf), Calypso 3tcf and Aphrodite 3.1tcf. With additional drilling being planned by Eni, Total and ExxonMobil in 2020, these gas reserves are likely to increase.\nSuccess with ExxonMobil\u2019s further drilling in promising block 10 next year has the potential to lead to an LNG plant at Vasilikos and exports, thus transforming Cyprus\u2019 fortunes \u2013\u2013 provided total discoveries approach 12-15tcf and global gas prices justify commercial viability.\nNoble\u2019s renegotiation of the Production Sharing Contract for Aphrodite with Cyprus\u2019 government is close to agreement, paving the way for Aphrodite gas sales to Shell\u2019s Idku LNG plant in Egypt. If these succeed, which looks likely, first exports will be in 5 years. The inter-governmental agreement between Cyprus and Egypt for the required pipeline is already in place. But given low gas prices challenges remain. If the sale goes ahead profits will be marginal.\nThere is a need for realism. Gas discovered so far in the East Med amounts to just about 2% of global gas reserves.\nEven with the potential to discover more, East Med gas will not change the international map of energy supplies. East Med gas is expensive to develop. It can become an important player only if it can compete on price. As a result, priority should be given to regional exploitation.\nGlobal energy markets\nThe world has an abundance of fossil fuels and with the relentless penetration of renewable energy the competition to secure markets is intense.\nThe EU has strengthened its climate targets to 2030 \u2013 promoting renewable sources at the expense of fossil fuels. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to peak around 2030.\nThese changes will have a dramatic impact on the use of fossil fuels after 2030 \u2013 already leading to a glut of energy resources, with the result that prices remain low.\nOil prices have found a new range with Brent crude at $60-$65/barrel. Gas prices are converging to an average of $6.50-$7.50/mmbtu in southeast Asia and $5.50-$6.50/mmbtu in Europe.\nShould these remain in the longer term, which is very likely, they will pose greater challenges to East Med gas exports. It needs to be competitive and where sales are possible, profit margins will be low.\nInvestment in major gas projects will also require reduction of regional geopolitical risks.\nIsrael, Jordan, Egypt gas exports\nA view was expressed that Israeli gas exports to Egypt are driven by security considerations. This is not just a commercial deal \u2013 it was likened to a barter deal, with security being a key element. The recent news of a decision by the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) to approve a compromise with the Egyptian gas company which entails an 85% reduction of the arbitration award in favour of IEC, in order to facilitate the gas exports to Egypt, tends to support this view. But the eventual outcome of such deals is further strengthening of the Israel-Egypt relationship.\nIn Jordan, even though the contract to supply Israeli gas to NEPCO is fully in place, it lacked transparency, with a strong suspicion that the agreed terms and prices are disadvantageous to Jordan. There is now huge public and political outcry and resistance building against this deal. Lack of transparency often leads to regional deals being viewed with suspicion.\nHowever, the problems most of the East Med countries are facing with Turkey\u2019s aggressive stance in the East Med is another major factor bringing them together.\nBoth Israel and Egypt need Greece and Cyprus as gateways to Europe \u2013 in order to promote their interests there. A view was expressed that the relationship developing between Israel, Greece and Cyprus is not an alliance, but an arrangement of convenience. Israel does not need Greece or Cyprus \u2013 it could drop them when it suits its interests.\nTurkey is serious about intervening in Cyprus to protect its continental shelf claims and what it sees as its interests. These new political arrangements, including the recent support by the US, will not deter Turkey. It was ready for naval action when it confronted Eni\u2019s drilling vessel last year and it is ready to take any action it considers necessary now.\nSolution of the Cyprus problem could change the situation dramatically, but optimism is thin on the ground, with resumption of the negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots at present looking a distant prospect.\nTransparency and corruption\nLack of transparency and corruption in the energy sector pose serious challenges in the East Med. Civil Society efforts in Lebanon \u2013 where it is very active \u2013 were instrumental in the passing of laws by the Lebanese Parliament to deal with these. It agreed to a transparent contracting process, disclosure of tenders and bidding results, and disclosure of the contracts with the oil companies.\nUsing these laws, it is now possible to access information on new deals and revenues from the hydrocarbon sector.\nThe drive now is to revise the sub-contracting process. This was identified as the area where most susceptible to corruption. The effort is to address these issues by ensuring proper oversight, fair economic opportunity, transparency and open procurement, including any facilitation fees. All subcontracts, goods and services, should be disclosed, including beneficial ownership \u2013 with all subcontractor ownership details published. Civil Society in Lebanon is active in ensuring that this happens, with increasing success.\nSimilar efforts are expended in ensuring transparent environmental and safety impact assessments, with full disclosure and full public consultation.\nBut it was agreed that such laws are as good as the readiness of the authorities to apply them. In most countries of the region the laws exist, but they are not being applied or are being selectively applied. As a result, corruption still thrives.\nCyprus can certainly benefit from such processes. Transparency is lacking and public consultation is more or less non-existent. A good example is the preparation of Cyprus 2030 Energy Plan \u2013 no public consultation has taken place despite its importance to the future of energy and on the economy of Cyprus.\nDr Charles Ellinas, @CharlesEllinas\nSenior Fellow\nGlobal Energy Center\nAtlantic Council\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino met Kuwait\u2019s emir on Sunday, state media said, amid reports the Gulf state is in talks to host matches to support Qatar during the 2022 World Cup. Kuwaiti ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and the head of the country\u2019s sports federation met with Infantino on a low-profile visit that began Saturday, the official KUNA news agency said. Infantino also met with the speaker of Kuwait\u2019s National Assembly, Marzuk al-Ghanem, and officials of the national football federation, KUNA said. While no details of the visit were made public, local media has reported that Infantino\u2019s hope is to convince Kuwait to host some matches if the 2022 Qatar World Cup is expanded.\nFIFA has decided to increase the number of teams in the World Cup from 32 to 48 come 2026 in the United States, Canada and Mexico \u2013 but last month voted in favour of the increase being implemented starting in Qatar, which would likely require that neighbouring countries host some games. A final decision on the Qatar proposal, strongly supported by Infantino, is expected at a FIFA meeting in Paris in June. The increase in the number of teams would automatically raise the number of both games and fans, presenting new logistical challenges to Qatar.\nFurther complicating the matter is the Gulf diplomatic crisis, a nearly two-year-old diplomatic freeze between Qatar and its rivals, led by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut all ties with Doha in June 2017, accusing Qatar of supporting Iran and Islamist groups. Qatar denies the charges and says Saudi and its allies aim to incite government change in the emirate, the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquified natural gas. Gulf states Kuwait and Oman have not taken sides in the crisis. Oman announced last week it was \u201cnot ready\u201d to host matches in the 2022 cup.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "0\nYou can\u2019t just watch Game of Thrones. It\u2019s the kind of show that needs discussing \u2013 at length \u2013 with coworkers, friends and people you stand in line with at the supermarket checkout. GoT, which is now in its eighth and final season, is a show we\u2019ve come to obsess over, and that includes those behind-the-scenes stories as well.\nAs we head into Season 8, we\u2019ve pulled together some fun facts and trivia surrounding the show and its stars. How many of these stories do you remember from over the years? Which ones are you learning about for the first time? (And be sure to check back in the weeks ahead as we\u2019ll be updating this list throughout the show\u2019s final run.)\n1) Game of Thrones producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss were into pranking the cast during those early seasons, but one of their most creative ones involved Alfie Allen. The pair sent the Theon Greyjoy actor phony script pages suggesting he was going to be killed by Bran yet remain on the show. While Allen was on vacation, they continued the faux storyline charade a little longer, calling him up and asking him, \u201c\u2018How would you feel about being a zombie who has absolutely no dialogue whatsoever?\u2019 I was like, \u2018It\u2019s your show guys, cool.\u2019 \u2018How would you feel about being a naked zombie who has no dialogue whatsoever?\u2019 I was just like, \u2018This is a wind-up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Allen recounted to HitFix in 2014\n2) Speaking of pranks, we\u2019re still not sure if Peter Dinklage was joking last fall when he told Jimmy Kimmel, \u201cI like to pretend I\u2019m dead,\u201d when the late night host asked if he got involved in that type of cast and producer mischief. \u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d Dinklage said with a straight face. Whether this story is true or false, the way he tells it is delightful.\n3) Here\u2019s an oldie, but a goodie. Actress Emilia Clarke added a little bit extra to her Daenerys Targaryen audition in front of a host of executives in LA after producers David and Dan (who\u2019d previously seen her in London) brought her out \u2013 a performance of the funky chicken. \u201cI went in and I did the scenes and then I was like, \u2018Well can I, can I, can I do anything else? Is there anything else you want me to do?\u2019 And David Benioff was like, \u2018You could do a dance, LOL.\u2019 Like, as a joke. And I took him so seriously. \u2026 And it\u2019s the only move I know, just the funky chicken,\u201d she said, while sitting down with Jay Duplass for Variety\u2019s Actors on Actors.\n4) Sean Bean and Mark Addy played longtime Westeros friends Ned Stark and King Robert Baratheon in Season 1 of GoT, but they too had their own history. The pair had a drama school connection. \u201cWe were at drama school at the same time \u2014 same drama school, same time, different years, so we sort of go back, oh, longer than most of us can remember,\u201d Addy told Access in 2011.\n5) Filming on Game of Thrones isn\u2019t always as cold as it looks! In 2013, John Bradley told Collider a Belfast summer isn\u2019t kind on the Night\u2019s Watch. \u201cSometimes it can be boiling hot, and in those costumes, it\u2019s really uncomfortable. I know that me and Kit used to get a lot in Season 1, \u2018You guys are freezing cold?\u2019 We\u2019re not freezing cold.\u201d But, if it looks blazing hot, it probably is. Sean Bean revealed in 2011, he had to wear ice packs under his Ned Stark doublet while filming fight sequences in Malta. It was \u201cnearly 100 degrees and we were all covered in leather in fur, so we had ice packs on. It was good fun,\u201d he said at the time.\n6) Lady, the direwolf, met a sad fate on the show, but the dog who played her found a happy home with Sophie Turner and her family. \u201cGrowing up I always wanted a dog, but my parents never wanted one. We kind of fell in love with my character\u2019s direwolf, Lady, on set,\u201d Sophie told the Coventry Telegraph in 2013. \u201cWe knew Lady died and they wanted to re-home her. My mum persuaded them to let us adopt her,\u201d she added of dog Zunni.\n7) In George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire book series, Davos Seaworth lost the top half of the fingers on his left hand as punishment for smuggling. But, because Liam Cunningham, who plays the character, is a leftie, they had to make the switch to editing out the digits on his right hand in the show.\n8) Who run the world? Khaleesis! Nathalie Emmanuel, who plays Missandei, revealed to Access \u2014 ahead of Season 3 \u2014 that she and Emilia Clarke turned to Queen Bey for a little extra inspiration in scenes. \u201cWe were just basically applying Beyonc\u00e9 songs to the scenes that we were doing, as like the soundtrack of the scene. \u2026 We\u2019d be like, \u2018Right, what Beyonc\u00e9 song is going to this scene\u2019\u201d she said, noting \u201cRun the World\u201d was a popular choice.\n9) Rose Leslie got a touching parting gift when she exited GoT in Season 4. After shooting her final scene \u2013 which happened to be the same one fans saw onscreen (of Ygritte dying in Jon Snow\u2019s arm) \u2013 the actress received her character\u2019s bow, which the producers added sentimental touches to. \u201cThey had changed the handle from the actual bow where my left hand grips it to a white leather strap, and then they had sewed on a silver clasp on one side and on that clasp was engraved \u2018Kissed by fire,'\u201d she told ScreenerTV. \u201cAnd then on the other side was the emblem of a red rose. It was very thoughtful and I was incredibly touched, and it made me cry even more.\n10) And speaking of Rose Leslie, Kit Harington pranked his former co-star (now wife) on April Fool\u2019s Day one year by putting a fake (and dead-looking) Jon Snow GoT head in the fridge. And he recorded her reaction, sharing the video on the U.K.\u2019s \u201cJonathan Ross Show.\u201d\n11) Remember Tyrion Lannister\u2019s speech in his jail cell in Season 4? It didn\u2019t originally include Tyrion\u2019s brother, Jaime Lannister, Nikolaj Coster Waldau told the latest issue of Delta\u2019s inflight magazine Sky. \u201cI felt, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if [the speech] was actually to Jaime?\u2019 And they agreed,\u201d he recounted (noting producers had \u201cprobably already thought of it,\u201d though)\\\n12) Lady Olenna \u2013 Diana Rigg \u2013 was lethal when it came to behind-the-scenes word games. \u201cDon\u2019t play Scrabble or Words with Friends with Diana Rigg, she\u2019ll beat you every time,\u201d Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell) told People back in 2017.\n13) Before becoming Outlander\u2018s king of men \u2014 Jamie Fraser \u2014 Sam Heughan auditioned for GoT. \u201cI auditioned for Game of Thrones seven times! Loads of times,\u201d he told Vulture in 2014. \u201cI auditioned for Renly, Loras, some of the members of the Night\u2019s Watch. And I\u2019d always get so close! I\u2019d be like, \u2018Guys, just give me a sword!\u2019 [Laughs.] Everyone was going in for those parts.\u201d\n14) Ed Sheeran\u2019s Season 7 cameo as a Lannister soldier really was a surprise for Maisie Williams (but she had an inkling something was going on). \u201cIn the script he was written as \u2018Ed\u2019 and he had an amazing voice, so I was thinking like, surely they should just put Ed Sheeran there,\u201d she told Absolute Radio backstage at the Q Awards in 2017. \u201cI got to set and people weren\u2019t really telling me what was going on, but I knew something was fishy. So when I saw Ed come into the makeup truck, I was very, very pleased.\u201d\n15) A couple of GoT cast members have appeared on The Simpsons. Carice Van Houten voiced a love interest of Bart\u2019s in 2015. \u201cIt was sort of a big dream of mine,\u201d she told The Scotsman in a 2017 interview. \u201cWhen I was young and went to LA and people asked about my goal, where I wanted to be in 10 years, I\u2019d say I want to be a voice on The Simpsons. So when that actually happened, I was like wow! I felt so flattered you cannot believe it. Of all the roles I\u2019ve had, it was probably the coolest.\u201d\n16) Lena Headey really, really, really hated her last Cersei Lannister wig. \u201cAh, yes, The Turnip, as I\u2019ve taken to calling her,\u201d she told Vulture in an interview shared on the website in February, noting her extreme dislike of the fake coif. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to be rid of her. End of that. Did not bring that one home with me.\u201d\n17) Conleth Hill, who plays Lord Varys, invited his childhood hero \u2014 Debbie Harry of Blondie \u2014 to the Game of Thrones Season 8 premiere at Radio City Music Hall after he found out he had extra tickets. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, ask Debbie Harry if she wants to come,\u201d he recounted on \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers.\u201d And she came, adding a little photo proof on her Twitter account.\nWant even more Game of Thrones?

{"text": "THE EDITOR, Sir:\nAnn Marie Vaz\u2019s historic win in East Portland\u2019s by-election last week (April 4, 2019) sent a powerful message about the political pulse and consciousness of today\u2019s electorate. As a young person who has been politically insouciant for quite some time, largely due to the divisive, corrupt, and nepotistic character of politics in this country, I must confess that I waited with bated breath for the denouement of a much anticipated by-election that would eventually register a higher voter turnout than that of 2016\u2019s general election.\nI was particularly impressed by the campaign run by the Jamaica Labour Party\u2019s (JLP) Ann Marie Vaz for a number of reasons. For starters, Mrs Vaz, a self-professed \u201cpeople-tician\u201d, made concerted efforts to consistently engage and connect with the people of East Portland in a way that appeared to be truly authentic. Reports indicate that she went door-to-door, scoured every nook and cranny of the constituency, and was genuinely interested in listening to the concerns of the people she wished to serve.\nThen there was the fact of her solid track record of consistent work in the constituency (particularly in regard to education and infrastructural development), to which a number of residents have said they could attest, long before a by-election was ever contemplated there.\nThis spoke volumes for me as well as quite a number of persons she engaged with on social media about the sincerity of her stated intention to chart a course for the development and prosperity of the constituency.\nFocus on the issues\nBut what was most impressive about Mrs Vaz was her laser-like focus on the issues that mattered as well as the grace and equanimity she displayed throughout her campaign even in the face of strong pushback from some quarters.\nQuite admirably, she kept her eyes firmly fixed on the prize and never once dignified the disparaging and petulant comments of her opponent with a response. She was indeed a class act in every important respect.\nIf nothing else, the outcome of the East Portland by-election, and, certainly, that of the 2016 general election, signifies a disruption of the political status quo and an incremental \u2014 though no less significant \u2014 break from the past. Thankfully, people no longer seem to be voting solely based on blind loyalty to any particular political party, owing to family or community tradition. They now seem to be thinking for themselves.\nNow more than ever before, people seem to be intent on seeing politicians walk the walk (beyond the campaign trail) and more willing to take them to task should they fail or refuse to do so. This disruption of the political status quo is a long overdue, but extremely welcomed, development, and it makes me very hopeful about Jamaica\u2019s political future.\nAMANDA QUEST\nquestamanda@hotmail.com\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The United Conservative Party is reconsidering two of its education platform planks calling for an increased emphasis on standardized testing after voters voiced concerns.\nUCP spokesman Matt Solberg said Thursday afternoon the party has paused its promise to make high school diploma exams worth 50 per cent of a student\u2019s final mark in academic Grade 12 classes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard concerns on this, and so we\u2019re putting that on hold,\u201d Solberg said. \u201cWe will gather more feedback before determining how to proceed.\u201d\nThe exams had been worth half of students\u2019 final grades since diploma exams were introduced in the province in 1983. In 2015, under pressure from school trustees and the Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association, the former Progressive Conservative government reduced the weight of diploma exams to 30 per cent of a student\u2019s final grade, with the teacher-awarded mark making up the other 70 per cent.\nA 2012 consultation session Alberta Education held with high school students found teens liked the consistent standards set by diploma exams, and appreciated the preparation for post-secondary education. However, they said the weighting of the exam was disproportionately high and caused stress and anxiety that they could fail the course if they had one bad day.\nLia Daniels, a University of Alberta associate professor in educational psychology, said the pressure that accompanies a heavily weighted final exam can be detrimental even to some of the top students, who go into the exams knowing scholarships could be riding on their performance that day.\nAlthough some might argue diploma exams prepare students for higher-stakes final exams in university, Daniels said she can\u2019t think of a course in her faculty where the final exam was worth more than 40 per cent.\n\u201cI think a pause is a good thing,\u201d she said of the UCP\u2019s change of heart. \u201cI think it\u2019s a complicated matter.\u201d\nGrade 3 PATs also in question\nThe UCP may also revise its plans to reintroduce provincial achievement tests (PATs) to eight-year-olds and nine-year-olds in Grade 3. The party\u2019s platform, released last weekend, pledged to \u201cbring back the Grade 3 provincial achievement test.\u201d\nCandidates have heard concerns about that proposal, too, Solberg said.\n\u201cWe are committed to a PAT-style of assessment in Grade 3, but we also recognize the concerns that we\u2019ve heard about the pressure this would put on children at that age,\u201d he said.\n1/11 Important Update on the United Conservative Education Platform: In my months and months of doorknocking, it has been my greatest honor to listen to the concerns and hopes of our voters in Lethbridge-West. #ableg #abvote \u2014 Karri Flatla (@karriflatla) April 4, 2019\nIn 2014, the former PC government replaced the end-of-year PATs in Grade 3 with student learning assessments (SLAs), which are administered near the beginning of the school year, and help teachers identify areas of strength and struggle.

REUTERS/Mark Goodnow\nBy Evan Duggan\nVANCOUVER (Reuters) - Zoella Zayce displays no photos of her family in her basement apartment in Vancouver, thousands of miles from where she left them in Brunei. The 19-year-old refugee claimant is a transgender woman, something she never told the family she describes as conservative.\nBack home, family and friends sometimes asked if she was gay. It was an alarming question in the Southeast Asian country, which this month introduced new Islamic laws to punish homosexuality, adultery and rape with the death penalty, including stoning.\nThe laws, elements of which were first adopted in 2014, have been rolled out in the country of 400,000, stirring international outrage.\n\"I just didn't feel safe with my family,\" said Zayce, who knew from childhood that she was transgender.

{"text": "This may be especially good news right now, since stocks may be due for a pullback.\nThe trend in the degree to which the world\u2019s stock markets move in sync with each other has fallen to the lowest level in 20 years.\nBy Jeffrey Kleintop\nStocks are off to a strong start this year, but the bulls aren't running in a herd. Bull markets can be found in the stocks of countries around the world, but their movements are less correlated with each other than they have been in the past 20 years. The change brings the return of an important diversification benefit for holders of globally diversified portfolios.\nZigs and Zags\nTraditionally, the logic behind including international stocks in a portfolio was not just for their potential returns, but also for the benefit of risk-reducing diversification. The thinking is that when one market would zig, another would zag, resulting in a smoother path to financial goals.\nSadly, for much of the 2000s, global diversification had all but faded away as stocks around the world increasingly moved in sync with each other. In our view, there were a couple of key reasons for this:\nGlobal stocks were collectively impacted by the U.S.-focused technology and housing bubbles.\nThe increasingly integrated global economy boosted international sales to exceed domestic sales for the global companies in the MSCI All Country World Index.\nThese factors contributed to higher correlations across stock markets: when one market would zig, the others would zig too.\nReturn to normal?\nFortunately for investors, diversification has made a comeback. Measured statistically, the trend in correlation between stock markets of the Group of 20 nations (plus Spain, which is a quasi-member), that together make up 80% of world GDP, peaked in 2011 and has since fallen to levels not seen in 20 years, as you can see in the chart below.\nTrend in global stock market correlation slides to 20-year lows\nDaily one-year rolling correlation of one-month percent change in MSCI indexes for countries in G20 and Spain.\nSource: Charles Schwab, Macrobond, MSCI data as of 4/12/2019.\nThis decline in correlation has taken place despite broad economic growth in these economies and in the trade among them. On the chart above, it almost appears to be a return to \"normal\" for correlation, as the trend illustrated by the standard deviation has moved back to the average level that prevailed for more than 25 years through the 1970s, 1980s, and for much of the 1990s prior to the bubbles in tech and housing.\nPotential pullback\nIf sustained, this lower correlation - and the risk-reducing benefits of diversification it suggests as markets move more independently of each other - is particularly good news right now. Stocks may be due for a pullback given recent warning signs such as inversion of the yield curve.\nWill the decline in correlation to a 20-year low persist or might global stock markets all slide together? We only have to look back to last year for some evidence that correlations may remain relatively low. Stock markets around the world suffered varying degrees of losses last year, including a sharp bear market decline late in the year. Yet, correlations rose only to the top of the downward-sloping range rather than all the way back to prior highs of 2011. This offers some confidence that even during bear markets correlations may remain lower than in the 2000s.\nThe driver of lower correlations among countries seems to be lower correlations among sectors that drive the stock markets of different countries. For example, energy stocks have had a wild ride in recent years, while tech stocks have been relatively steadily climbers. Financial stocks have been volatile and tied to the movements in the yield curve. As long as these divergent drivers keep sector correlations from rising, country correlations should also remain relatively low.\nMain risk\nIn our view, the main risk to the trend of lower correlations is a global event that causes all sectors and countries' stock markets to move down together. The global economic, financial and market system now seems better prepared to manage the shocks of the past - such as the 2000-02 \"Tech Wreck\" and the 2008-09 global financial crisis - were they to repeat in the future. But there are other increased vulnerabilities that could cause a shock to turn into another crisis and result in a return to high correlations, including:\nHigh debt levels\nPolitical fragmentation\nDependence on international sales\nLittle fiscal or monetary policy ammunition\nThe rise of passive investments\nFor insights on all of these see our recent article: \"Where Will The Next Crisis Come From?\" While plausible, these vulnerabilities developing into a crisis are not part of our base case, at least for the coming year or two.\nBig benefit\nThe return to the lower average correlation across stock markets not seen in 20 years has the potential to offer globally diversified investors the benefit of less volatility without hampering returns on the path to financial goals - in essence, decreasing risk without decreasing return.\n", "label": "human"}

I found out my due date; my body began changing and I started dreaming: Will it be a boy or a girl? What will we name him or her?\nNews: Prior to the Instagram post about her potential miscarriage, Hilaria and Alec Baldwin had not revealed they were expecting another child together\n'Then, sometime before 10 weeks, I went in for an ultrasound. I know my technician so well \u2014 I\u2019ve had four children under her care \u2014 but at this appointment she was silent. Every hopeful pregnant woman dreads this silence. She listened to the heartbeat again and again, taking new measurements, not really saying anything. I\u2019m sure it was simply minutes, but it felt like an eternity.\n'And I just knew: Oh no, something is wrong. The heartbeat was too slow for a healthy pregnancy, so she told me to come back in a week for another scan to see whether things improved.\n'I heard the che-goom, che-goom, che-goom of the heartbeat, hopeful that it sounded faster than last time. \u201cI can\u2019t lie to you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not. The embryo does not seem to be growing.\"'\nLater, after going to the doctor again, she confirmed what she had sensed.\n'There was no heartbeat today at my scan\u2026 so it\u2019s over\u2026but I have some pretty strong and amazing heartbeats right here,' Hilaria wrote.\n'I am surrounded by such love and I feel so fortunate. Thank you all for listening, for your support, and for sharing your own personal stories. We are stronger together\u2026'\nUpdates: Hilaria, 35, had posted selfies from what is thought to have been a D&C appointment on April 10\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "By Jill Colvin and Colleen Long\nPresident Donald Trump said on Friday that he is strongly considering releasing \"illegal immigrants\" into Democratic strongholds to punish congressional foes for inaction on the border - just hours after White House and Homeland Security officials insisted the idea had been rejected as fast as it had been proposed.\nPhoto: AP / Jacquelyn Martin\n\"Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,\" Trump tweeted. He added that, \"The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy - so this should make them very happy!\"\nDue to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019\nThe reversal, which appeared to catch officials at the Department of Homeland Security off guard, came as critics were blasting Mr Trump for the supposedly-rejected idea, accusing him of turning migrants into pawns to go after his political opponents. It comes as Mr Trump has grown increasingly exasperated by a surge of Central American migrant families crossing the southern border and is looking for new ways to pressure congressional Democrats to change laws that he insists are making the problem worse.\nIndeed, last week Mr Trump urged his soon-to-be acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to seal the southern border. He told Mr McAleenan he would pardon him if he were to find himself in trouble for blocking legal asylum-seekers, according to two people familiar with the conversation who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private exchange.\nIt was not clear whether the president was joking, and a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement: \"At no time has the president indicated, asked, directed or pressured the acting secretary to do anything illegal.\"\nThe reported conversation came during the president's trip last week to Calexico, California, a day after he announced he was delaying his threat to close the border because Mexico appeared to be stepping up its enforcement efforts.\nBefore Mr Trump's tweets on Friday, both the Department of Homeland Security and a White House official had insisted in nearly identical statements that the sanctuary-cities plan had been floated but then flatly rejected.\nBut not, apparently, by the president, who emphatically revived the idea.\nAsked about it by reporters, he said he was \"strongly looking at\" releasing migrant families into those communities.\n\"They're always saying they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms,\" he said.\nThere were no indications, however, that officials were taking any steps to move forward with the idea or considered the president's words anything more than bluster.\nTwo versions of 'sanctuary cities' plan discussed\n\"Sanctuary cities\" are places where local authorities do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, denying information or resources that would help ICE round up for deportation people living in the country illegally.\nThey include New York City and San Francisco, home city of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who on Friday called the idea \"unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face as a country, as a people, to address who we are - a nation of immigrants.\"\nRepresentative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the House Homeland Security committee, said it \"serves as a reminder that the Trump administration's reckless immigration agenda is not about keeping the country safe, but about partisan politics and wantonly inflicting cruelty.\"\nThe idea of pressing immigration authorities to embrace the plan was discussed in November and then again in February as the Trump administration struggled with a surge of migrants at the border, according to three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline private conversations. Homeland Security and ICE lawyers quickly rejected the proposal, according to the people, on the grounds that it was complicated, too expensive and a misuse of funds, two of the people said.\nThe plan, which was first reported by The Washington Post, is one of a litany of ideas being tossed around by an increasingly anxious White House in recent months.\nOfficials say they are running out of options, and have proposed and recycled numerous ideas that have never come to fruition. Mr Trump in recent weeks, for instance, has discussed the idea of renewing his administration's controversial family separation policy - even as he's publicly declared he won't do that - and has threatened to completely seal the border despite opposition from many in his administration.\nThere have been at least two versions of the sanctuary city plan discussed: One to move people who have already been detained to places with Democratic opponents of the president, the other to transport migrants apprehended at the border directly to San Francisco, New York City, Chicago and other spots.\nICE struggles to handle immigrants processed by Border Patrol\nICE arrests people in the US illegally and also manages migrants who present themselves at border crossings and ask for asylum.\nThe surge of migrant families at the border has been taxing the system, and ICE says it no longer has the resourced to handle immigrants processed by the Border Patrol. As a result, more than 125,000 people have been released as they await court hearings - a practice Mr Trump has derided as \"catch and release.\"\nWith immigrant processing and holding centres overwhelmed, the administration has already been busing people hundreds of miles inland and releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities such as Albuquerque, San Antonio and Phoenix.\nTransporting large groups of immigrants to distant cities would be even more expensive for an agency already strapped for cash. Flights chartered by ICE cost about $US7785 per flight hour, according to the agency, and require multiple staffers, including an in-flight medical professional. The agency also uses commercial flights but requires that migrants to pay for those.\nAt the same time, many \"sanctuary\" communities would likely welcome the immigrants in question. Some of these cities have robust networks of non-profit legal groups that could help them strengthen their legal cases to stay.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said this week it had started scouting vacant properties that could be turned into facilities for holding migrant children in several cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, and San Antonio.\nThose facilities would be licensed by each state and likely take several months to be approved and opened, separating them from the rapidly expanding emergency shelter at Homestead, Florida, and the now-closed tent facility at Tornillo, Texas.\nThe Defense Department has also been reviewing a number of military bases to find a location that can house up to 5000 unaccompanied migrant children as the US braces for a surge of people crossing the US-Mexico border this spring.\nUnder the Trump administration, ICE has significantly stepped up arrests, including of people who have no US criminal records. In response, some cities have banished ICE from jails where agents could easily pick up immigration violators. Police in New York, Baltimore and Seattle rarely, if ever, disclose information about when suspected criminals in the US illegally will be released from custody.\nDemocrats have said they will tackle immigration bills, possibly as soon as they return from their spring recess, and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has indicated an interest.\n- AP\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As if the crippling sanctions on its oil industry by a United States administration that now has its sights set firmly on bringing down the administration of President Nicholas Maduro in Venezuela were not enough, the recent widespread power shutdowns across large parts of the country have had a crippling effect on many of the country\u2019s oil wells and rigs, slashing its oil output and in effect further compromising the lifeline which its oil earnings represent against the backdrop of the already debilitating oil sanctions imposed on the Maduro administration by the United States.

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO\u2013The game of baseball is changing before our eyes.\nNo team exemplifies that better than the Tampa Bay Rays. Perhaps no franchise struggled to accept that more than the San Francisco Giants.\nBut as baseball evolves and the sports embraces modern analytics, technology and strategies, there\u2019s still a place for tradition. In a 6-4 win over the Rays on Saturday, the Giants were able to prove that for at least one day, their approach can still work.\nAs the Giants improved to 3-6 and earned their first home win of the year, manager Bruce Bochy\u2019s club proved that not all 2019 rallies are built on the strength of sluggers.\nOf course, Brandon Belt\u2019s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth helped the Giants achieve their desired result, but there were plenty of other things we learned in a game that was played in front of just 31,828 fans, the lowest paid attendance at Oracle Park since September 1, 2010.\nHere are three of the biggest.\n1. Jeff Samardzija meets the \u201copener\u201d\nThe Tampa Bay Rays are challenging conventional methods by employing a new-age pitching strategy.\nThe San Francisco Giants are challenging Jeff Samardzija by asking him to rethink an approach to starts he\u2019s used in his last eight seasons.\nSamardzija is on board with the changes the Giants have asked him to implement, but he does not agree with the way the Rays have attempted to influence the sport.\nAfter dealing with shoulder inflammation that limited him to 10 starts last year, Samardzija is no longer setting 200 innings as a goal for the season. The Giants want Samardzija to prioritize the quality of his innings over the quantity of them, so instead of saving his off-speed pitches for later in the game and relying on his fastball early on, the right-hander is growing accustomed to throwing any pitch at any time.\nSamardzija lasted just 4 2/3 innings Saturday as the Rays tagged him for four hits and two runs in the top of the fifth, but he\u2019s clearly embraced his new strategy. Of the 74 pitches Samardzija threw Saturday, 31 were sliders and 13 were cutters while only nine were four-seam fastballs. Those numbers are atypical for Samardzija, but the strategy the Rays brought to Saturday\u2019s game is still largely atypical for baseball.\n\u201cWe worked on (the slider) a lot in between starts and found a grip and just started executing it pretty well,\u201d Samardzija said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m throwing that slider in good spots, it\u2019s usually a good day and for the most part it was.\u201d\nTampa Bay opened the game with relief pitcher Ryne Stanek on the mound and Stanek retired all six batters he faced on 32 pitches. When it was his turn to bat in the top of the third, Stanek was removed for pinch hitter Christian Arroyo because he had reached his pitch count.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done good things over there,\u201d Samardzija said. \u201cThe first kid was pretty good. I would have let him keep going.\u201d\nThe Rays planned to navigate through the rest of the game using a few long relievers who can pitch multiple innings at at time, but San Francisco\u2019s offense pushed two across in the third against Jalen Beeks and scored four in the fifth against Ryan Yarbrough.\nThe Giants expressed curiosity and even a bit of uncertainty about how the Rays would use the alternative pitching method known as the \u201copener,\u201d strategy in a National League ballpark, but the offense set a season-high with six runs and showed signs of promise after a brutal start to the season.\n2. Rule 5 picks enjoy career \u201cfirsts\u201d\nNo matter how many times Connor Joe envisioned his big league career starting, he never could have pictured it unfolding quite like this.\nIn early December, he was an infield prospect in the Dodgers organization. By the middle of spring training, he was battling for a roster spot with the Cincinnati Reds. On Opening Day, he was the starting left fielder for the San Francisco Giants.\nLife comes at you fast. That\u2019s especially true for Joe, whose life is moving at warp speed. After a late spring trade sent the Rule 5 draft choice to the Giants, he barely had time to unpack his bags in San Francisco before making his big league debut in his hometown of San Diego.\n\u201cIt was a whirlwind,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI got traded to the Giants and had five days left in camp. I knew I had to make the team so that was a grind.\u201d\nBecause Joe was on the move so much, it\u2019s no surprise he had trouble settling into his new surroundings. On Saturday, he finally had the chance. In the midst of a four-run fifth inning, Joe blooped his first career hit in front of Rays left fielder Tommy Pham.\n\u201cI knew it had a chance,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou never know with the shifts that they\u2019re playing, but I saw it fall, saw it hit the grass and I realized it was my first big league hit.\u201d\nThe single broke an 0-for-13 stretch and moments later, Joe found himself racing around the infield dirt at Oracle Park and scoring on a Steven Duggar double down the right field line. On the same day Joe finally scored his first run, fellow Rule 5 draft choice Travis Bergen recorded his first major league win.\nBergen entered in the top of the fifth with two on and two out and retired pinch hitter Avisail Garcia, who had a chance to add to the Rays\u2019 one-run advantage. Thanks to the Giants\u2019 four-run frame in the bottom half of the inning, Bergen was in position to pick up the win in the club\u2019s first home victory of the season.\n\u201cI kind of snaked it in there by just going in to face one guy,\u201d Bergen said. \u201cI knew that once we scored a couple of runs and held on, it would be a win for me. That was pretty cool.\u201d\nAfter being drafted out of the Toronto Blue Jays organization in December, Bergen pitched his way onto the 25-man roster with a dominant run during spring training.\n3. A streak finally ends\nThe numbers are staggering.\nThrough eight games this season, the Giants had yet to score before the fourth inning of a game.\nFor a team destined to finish at or near the bottom of the league in home runs, \u201ctraffic on the bases,\u201d is fundamental to the lineup\u2019s success. Until Saturday, the base paths in the early innings were as clear as a country back road.\nThe Giants didn\u2019t record a hit in either the first or the second against Stanek, but a push bunt by Kevin Pillar forced Beeks to pitch out of the stretch in the bottom of the third.\nPillar\u2019s speed put pressure on Beeks, who walked Joe Panik and surrendered a sacrifice fly to Steven Duggar. Belt delivered an RBI single and suddenly, a 1-0 deficit turned into a 2-1 lead.\n\u201cWe had been a little sluggish the first few innings this season so to get out there and jump on the board early, it definitely helped,\u201d Belt said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that was, why we weren\u2019t doing that earlier in the game but it happened to day and we\u2019re going to go with it.\u201d\nBefore Saturday\u2019s game, the Giants had managed just six runs off of starting pitchers, three of which came against Dodgers right-hander Ross Stripling. They failed to score against Stanek, but taking the lead by the bottom of the third was an important milestone to reach.\nThe early-inning struggles, however, are still a concern. In nine games, the Giants are 1-for-28 in the first inning and 3-for-30 in the second. With two hits on Sunday, the Giants now have six in the third inning, but they have yet to give their starting pitchers any sort of cushion to work with.\nPlaying from behind will make it difficult for the Giants to win many games, but Saturday\u2019s third inning at least provided some hope for a club that knows a breakthrough is needed.\n\u201cThe left-handers had pretty nice at-bats against their lefties,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be in there against left-handers so the more they see, the more comfortable they\u2019re going to get. It\u2019s good to see them have success.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Three straight master classes against the top of the featherweight division. Four straight wins in title bouts. Thirteen consecutive wins overall.\nYes, the resume of UFC featherweight champion Max Holloway gets more impressive with each bulletpoint. But with plenty of positive outcomes and post-fight bonus awards, Holloway\u2019s favorite fight is an unexpected one \u2013 one he lost, in the first round, by submission, to the guy he fights again this Saturday at UFC 236 in Atlanta for the interim lightweight title.\n\u201cThat was my first time in the show, in the big lights,\u201d Holloway said of facing Dustin Poirier at UFC 143 in Las Vegas on Feb. 4, 2012. \u201cI was having fun out there. Everybody says, \u2018But you lost.\u2019 Yeah, but imagine if I won that fight.\u201d\nHolloway means that in a positive and grateful way, showing the experience of a fighter now with 19 fights in the UFC as opposed to the zero he had before that bout.\n\u201cMy life would have been very, very crazy. I would have been one of those guys who gets shot up to the top real fast,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cIf I won, I would have got pushed into another big, high-profile fight and who knows. If I so happened to get past that one, what would have happened? There\u2019s a lot of guys that get this big push and get big too early, too fast. So I\u2019m thankful for that fight. It made me sit down and rethink my fighting.\u201d\nHolloway won his next three, then lost his next two. At 7-3 overall, and 3-3 in the UFC, Holloway feared what many young fighters fear: being cut from the UFC roster and having to start over on smaller stages and work their way back to the top.\nNext came a short-notice fight with Will Chope, a second-round TKO of Chope, a knockout of the night bonus and the beginning of a five-year rise to the top of the featherweight division and near the top of the pound-for-pound list of the best MMA fighters.\nSubscribe to Newsday\u2019s sports newsletter Receive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.

That's why it's written as \"UFC 236: Holloway vs. Poirier 2.\" But to compare Holloway and Poirier as fighters now with them seven years ago is silly. Neither fighter was old enough to rent a car on their own, let alone be evolved MMA fighters. They had a total of 16 pro fights, with only four of them in the UFC, and all four of those were by Poirier.\n\u201cHe was a kid, I was a kid,\" Holloway said. \"This sport is amazing. Me and him hit some lows in this sport and now we\u2019re at the highest level in what people call the most stacked division and we\u2019re fighting for gold.\u201d\nThis fight is for the interim lightweight title, a division Holloway has yet to compete in during his UFC career and one Poirier has gone back and forth in, along with featherweight. Always considered one of the top fighters in whichever weight class he was competing in, Poirier (24-5, 1 no contest) has long sought a title fight. After three straight finishes and post-fight bonuses -- with wins over Anthony Pettis, Justin Gaethje and Eddie Alvarez -- Poirier finally gets his chance.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a killer,\u201d Holloway said of Poirier. \u201cThose are the fights that excite me. These guys that are supposed to be killers. I go in there, I do my thing, and they don\u2019t look like killers. He\u2019s one of the top dogs for sure, I got nothing but respect for him.\u201d\nIf Holloway wins on Saturday, he'll become the sixth UFC fighter to win titles in multiple weight classes and the fourth to do so simultaneously. Either way, Holloway (20-3) will remain the featherweight champion. That offers Holloway zero comfort or consolation should Poirier be the victor.\n\u201cIf I lose, I\u2019m still a loser,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cOK, I didn\u2019t lose my title, but I still lost. Do you still carry yourself as the champ after that? I\u2019m going to carry myself as the champion, but in my mind, I\u2019m going to be like, \u2018No, I lost.\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s just my mindset. Some people might be comforted with that, \u2018I could fall back.\u2019 There\u2019s no falling back. Every single fight I approach like it\u2019s my last fight. It\u2019s like a samurai getting ready for his last battle. I eat a good meal, I eat what I want to eat for my last meal and I\u2019m OK with life after that. I\u2019m going to leave it all out there and anything happens, anything happens.\u201d\nWhich division Holloway may fight in next was something he deemed not worth worrying about right now. There are more important \u2013 and immediate \u2013 issues at play for the young man from Waianae, Hawaii.\n\u201cI got Dustin. I\u2019m focusing on him first,\u201d Holloway, 27, said. \u201cWhen a king leaves his throne open, somebody tries to come and invade.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "But motherhood remains disruptive for many women\u2019s work lives. American women earn almost 20% less per hour than their male peers, in part because women disproportionately take responsibility for raising children. Mothers often experience employment interruptions or reductions in work hours.\nWhen it comes to understanding mothers\u2019 long-term employment patterns, researchers know less. How common is it for mothers to persist working full-time throughout their child-rearing years? Which mothers are most likely to be absent from the labor market over the long term? What do employment patterns look like for mothers who fall in between these two extremes?\nIn a study published in February, we set out to answer such questions. Our research shows that American mothers combine work and family in diverse ways, depending upon their preferences for work, their ability to maintain employment and their need to provide financially for their families.\nWhat employment patterns do mothers follow?\nUsing national survey data, we looked at common employment patterns for over 3,000 American mothers currently in their mid-50s to early 60s. For these older women, we examined their prime child-rearing years, from the birth of their first child to when that child turned 18.\nMotherhood frequently disrupts employment. A year before the birth of their first child, about half of the women in our sample were employed full-time. By the time of the birth, only 20% were. Disruptions are not limited to new mothers: It takes over a decade for mothers\u2019 full-time employment rate to return to 50%.\nUsing statistical methods, we identified five common patterns of maternal employment over the first 18 years after a first birth. At one extreme, nearly two-fifths of mothers followed a pattern of steady full-time employment. At the other extreme, one-fifth of mothers were almost completely disconnected from employment.\n", "label": "human"}

It's now restructuring the business to concentrate on the industrials sector and pursue new projects and cost-cutting steps for its refrigeration and liquids businesses.\nThe company's performance has been sluggish over the past few years, and guidance from management that turned out to be overly optimistic amplified disappointment with the stock. However, Dover still has a solid core business that can benefit from some efficiency improvements -- and it looks like it might not have to deliver super-high-end performance to be a winner for shareholders. Shares look cheap, trading at roughly 17 times the year's expected earnings and 23 times its 2018 free cash flow (FCF). The company has historically generated strong cash flow, and it's in good shape to keep the business humming along and cash flowing back to shareholders.\nLowe's\nYield Years of Uninterrupted Payout Growth Payout Growth Over the Last Ten Years Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio 1.7% 56 464.7% 31.1%\nThe case has often been made that Home Depot is a better play in the home-improvement retail space than Lowe's. Recent performance has borne that position out, and it may still be true, but Home Depot isn't a Dividend King -- and Lowe's deserves attention as a worthwhile long-term income play based on its own merits.\nLowe's has been delivering rapid dividend growth over the past decade -- posting far and away the fastest payout expansion among the five Dividend Kings profiled in this article. The cost of covering the stock's forward distribution still comes in at less than a third of the company's trailing free cash flow, giving the home-improvement retailer plenty of leeway to continue increasing its payouts.\nThe company has managed to rapidly increase its FCF over the past five years, and the business looks like it could continue to gain ground amid efficiency initiatives and a push to increase its online retail and services offerings. Lowe's stock looks nonprohibitively valued, trading at roughly 18.5 times this year's expected earnings.\nFederal Realty Investment Trust\nYield Years of Uninterrupted Payout Growth Payout Growth Over the Last Ten Years Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio 3% 51 54.6% 201.5%\nMark Twain is reported to have coined the saying, \"Buy land, they're not making it anymore.\" If that wisdom resonates with you and you're looking for Dividend Kings that can help put it into action, Federal Realty Investment Trust will be on your short list. The company is a real estate investment trust (REIT), a classification that means it generates sales and earnings through properties that it rents -- and that it's subject to a different set of operating and accounting rules than most other stocks on the market.\nREITs are actually required to return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends, so investors don't have to worry about the company cutting the dividend unless it absolutely has to. And Federal Realty Investment Trust appears to be in good shape to keep growing its payout.\nThe rise of e-commerce does put some pressure on brick-and-mortar retail property rentals, but Federal Realty's holdings are largely concentrated in high-end, in-demand markets that will likely continue to be able to support commercial centers. The company's high free cash flow and earnings payout ratios also stem from the fact that it's required to count standardized depreciations against its earnings -- even when the assets in question aren't actually losing value.\nGenuine Parts\nYield Years of Uninterrupted Payout Growth Payout Growth Over the Last Ten Years Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio 2.7% 62 90.6% 49.2%\nGenuine Parts has managed to leverage its strength in the automotive and industrial equipment space to deliver more than six decades of consecutive annual payout growth. That's no small feat, and while transportation and industrial machinery can be expected to go through big changes with the rise of robotics and expanded device connectivity, the company is in good shape to keep chugging along and raising its payout.\nEven with the rise of autonomous vehicles and the potential disruption that could bring for the overall auto industry, vehicles will still need parts for repairs and after-market enhancement. The company has shown that it can weather the cyclical turns for the auto industry as well as broader economic downturns, and the business continues to look sturdy.\nGenuine Parts' stock trades at roughly 19 times this year's expected earnings and looks like a dependable income play for long-term investors.\nJohnson & Johnson\nYield Years of Uninterrupted Payout Growth Payout Growth Over the Last Ten Years Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio 2.6% 56 83.7% 53%\nJohnson & Johnson was founded in New Brunswick, N.J., in 1886. The company's first products were medical wraps and bandages, and it went on to develop into one of the world's largest healthcare businesses. Most shoppers are probably familiar with Johnson & Johnson's consumer brands, but the roughly $360 billion company has built a diversified business that generates most of its revenue from pharmaceuticals and has a medical devices and diagnostics unit as well.\nWhile J&J has a reputation for being a dependable blue-chip stock, shares have seen some significant swings over the past year as the company has faced pressure from a lawsuit alleging it knew that its talc-based powder products had been contaminated with asbestos. Competition from biosimilars and generic alternatives is also putting some pressure on the company's pharmaceuticals segment.\nJ&J's consumer brands might face some pressure going forward, but the company's pharmaceuticals business is still pretty strong, and it looks like it's well positioned to maintain leadership positions across different segments of the healthcare industry and keep cash flowing back to shareholders.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "By Amit Khanna\nWith several platforms, from traditional newspaper, radio, mobile phone to social media, almost the entire adult population of the world has access to news instantly. India is no different in the always on networked world. What has changed is, unlike say a few decades ago, almost the entire media is partisan today.\nIt\u2019s not that all news was always objective but most purveyors of mass communication of information did balance their socio-political bias with simple reportage of people and events.\nIn fact almost a century ago the high priest of modern journalism Walter Lippman put this dilemma well: \u201cThe news of the day as it reaches the newspaper office is an incredible medley of fact, propaganda, rumour, suspicion, clues, hopes, and fears, and the task of selecting and ordering that news is one of the truly sacred and priestly offices in a democracy.\n\u201cFor the newspaper is in all literalness the bible of democracy, the book out of what a people determines its conduct. It is the only serious book most people read. It is the only book they read every day. Once you know the party and social affiliation of a newspaper, you can predict with considerable certainty the perspective in which the news will be displayed.\u201d\nMarshal McLuhan, another media theorist, is even more brutal: \u201cAll news is fake. It\u2019s pseudo-event created by the medium that is employed. There is no honest reporting of any medium, it is all fake necessarily, created by the medium in question.\u201d\nBoth these gentleman could be writing about news media in today\u2019s India.\nThe genesis of partisan media goes far beyond personal bias. The first to use media as a tool of molding public opinion were the followers of Karl Marx. Much before Hitler and other fascists thought of controlling media on ideological lines the communists (and socialists) harnessed it to their advantage.\nIn Britain and America this polarization had begun even earlier thus creating two party polity in both countries. In a world beset with poverty, colonialism, industrialization and of course wars, the Left movement created a constituency of writers, thinkers, artistes and intellectuals since early 20th century in spite of the tyranny of many left-wing dictators like Lenin, Stalin and Mao.\nThe Right on the other hand was condemned to carry the baggage of despots like Hitler and the colonialists. With their intellectual heft the Left dominated academia, while the rise of free markets economies like US, Western Europe and Japan led to faster growth and development. Media and creativity largely hitched its wagon to the Left and the Right unfairly reduced to being synonymous with big bad businesses has unfairly redefined words like liberal and secular to their convenience.\nNon-alignment was a Fabian fantasy of fence setters (Nehru\u2019s was one of its proponents) which was nothing more than a motley collection of the newly independent nations. The North-South divide is one of the myths of this clash of ideologies.\nIndian artistes, writers and journalist too leaned towards the Left in Post Independent India. This was the beginning of partisan media in India.\nEven in the 50s most political parties had their own newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately by appropriating words like \u2018liberal\u2019 and secular (incidentally both never part of the Communist manifesto.\nWhen Mrs. Gandhi made a fundamental change in the constitution inserting \u201csocialist, secular\u201d something the founding fathers had never done \u2014 the first seeds of divergence were sown. Fault lines in our social fabric started emerging by the 1990s.\nWith rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the decline of CPI-M (CPI never mattered) there was a shift in the axis of Indian polity and, society and culture. However, the Left liberal (another oxymoron) cling onto intellectual power well into the new century helped by political patronage of Left of Centre Congress and allies. By 2004 elections arrived, media had clearly got divided on ideological lines, though still dominated by Left leaning journalists. Interestingly the liberals claim that a binary has been created by Right wingers. It may be so but then the others too, have created their own binary. Either you are with them or you are a sellout. Independence be damned either way.\nTV news and online news sites have only accentuated polarization. The way every channel in India manipulates news through selective reportage, biased questions and using data which suits their slant. So, if the channel is anti-government, it will pick up known anti-BJP commentators, panelists and anchor intervention and if its pro-government, the process reverses.\nAlmost every publication, TV channel and online news service is partisan. There is literally nowhere to seek news and information which is unbiased. Social media only redistributes messages but has become the whipping boy for self-serving media who conveniently calls what doesn\u2019t not suit them as \u201cfake new\u201d.\nI am not defending or condoning any particular ideology here. My only objection is feeling free to express your opinion but don\u2019t call yourself independent or liberal just because you dislike a particular ideology or party. By all means criticize and condemn it but do not assume a holier than thou attitude.\nHowever, under pressures of the \u201cbreaking news\u201d syndrome and reportage based on leaks from political parties, corporates and other interest groups most of today\u2019s media specially in democracies is slanted and loaded with bias. Partisan media is here to stay.\nA study on media bias, by Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo, talking about the US media, says \u201can unbiased media outlet would cite material equally from sources favoured by legislators in each party and from each ideological perspective\u201d. They found that most media outlets disproportionately cited sources favoured by Democratic and more liberal members. Their measure of media bias allowed them to compare media outlets with members of Congress on the same ideological dimension and the result was startling-lack of independence in media.\nBut another study by them using another methodology did not produce stable results. All outlets they studied appeared to be more moderate or conservative in later years.\nMedia scholar Brendan Nyhan on the other hand observed: \u201cTechnocratic centrist to liberal organizations like Brookings and the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities tend to have more credentialed experts with peer-reviewed publications than their conservative counterparts\u201d.\nMatt Grossman summing up both reports said: \u201cConservatives tend to doubt the ability of academic experts to maintain neutrality for the same reason that they are skeptical of the media; academics are also disproportionately Democrats and liberals. So the media bias debate reflects a broader conflict over whether technocratic expertise can be seen as neutral.\u201d\nI have pointed out earlier that social media chatter on politics is limited to less than 1% of the population. Most of the mud slinging is confined to a couple of thousand inveterate Facebookers and tweeters.\nIn no other countries planted messages of different ideologies keep going around WhatsApp that it is almost farcical. If someone does offer an independent analysis, he/she is trolled by either sides. No one politician, media person or activist is willing to accept that one can be agnostic to ideology. Its either you are with us or your anti-people/anti-democracy/anti-secular/anti-justice/anti-national.\nUnfortunately, just because institutions have people supporting a particular ideology (when was it not so) they are supposed to be destroyed. If a court judgement is not to your liking then the judge(es) are corrupt or influenced. If 60 or 600 bureaucrats/artistes/writer oppose a party they represent civil society but if 600 or 6,000 support another then they a bunch of puppets. This is what I oppose.\nBy all means support or criticize or support what you believe in but don\u2019t write off others. The axis of political and economic thought has moved right of centre after decades. Obviously, the apple cart has been upset. But that\u2019s life.\nA small minority of people can never discount what a larger section of people wants. Our Constitution has mandated a first past the post system of election. You can\u2019t claim the percentage of votes polled by the winner in not the majority. This is how 18 elections have been held so far.\nMedia, thinkers and intellectuals should not make it a partisan debate because life is impartial.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As the Portland Timbers won game after game last fall to extend their magical run in the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs, construction crews were forced to stand by, waiting for the club to play its final home game before moving forward with construction at Providence Park.\nThe club\u2019s $85 million stadium expansion project, which is set to add 4,000 seats to Providence Park, was always expected to happen over two offseasons, with foundational work taking place after the 2017 season and the bulk of construction coming after the 2018 campaign.\nBut Portland\u2019s deep run in the 2018 playoffs inevitably extended the timeline for the project. The club had initially expected to play just six or seven games on the road to start 2019 before reopening Providence Park in May. Instead, the Timbers have faced a massive challenge with an MLS-record 12 consecutive games on the road to open this season.\n\u201cWe tried to minimize the impact,\u201d Timbers owner Merritt Paulson said of the expansion project. \u201cGoing on the deep playoff run that we had last year pushed us another at least a couple weeks, not that we didn\u2019t envision a deep playoff run. That is always something that I hope for and expect, but there\u2019s no question it pushed the home opener further out.\u201d\nPlaying 12 consecutive games on the road was always going to be incredibly difficult for the Timbers. MLS clubs enjoy a huge home-field advantage. Last year, home teams earned an average of 1.83 points per game, while road teams earned an average of just 0.96 points per game. Ten teams in MLS have yet to win on the road this year.\nBut despite the challenging schedule, Portland (0-5-1, 1 point) never expected to have a start this poor. The Timbers have lost five games in a row and currently sit in last place in MLS.\n\u201cWe knew these 12 games away from home were going to be tough,\u201d Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said after the club lost to the LA Galaxy on March 31. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for the guys because you never have the chance to at least come back home, get a good game at home, and then go back out. It\u2019s weekend after weekend playing away, but we have to deal with it.\u201d\nMLS clubs are certainly capable of stepping up on the road. Minnesota United earned nine points in five consecutive road games to open 2019, while the Montreal Impact picked up eight points in six consecutive road games to start the season.\nStill, it is a lot easier for a team to rebound from a bad spell at home. Last year, the Timbers failed to win during five road games in a row to open the season, but picked up a victory in their home opener in April before going on a 15-game unbeaten run.\nPortland has historically been one of the best home teams in MLS. The Timbers posted an 11-2-4 record at home last season. Even when Portland failed to win on the road in 2016, the club still missed the playoffs by only two points, due to its tremendous home form.\n\u201cI think it could be an advantage to start on the road if the team performs,\u201d Paulson said. \"Our expectation was that we would be getting results on the road. That said, there\u2019s nine other teams in MLS who haven\u2019t won on the road this year. ... The great thing about having home games is you can reset yourself, especially in a parity league and in a sport that\u2019s very much impacted by momentum and rhythm.\u201d\nThe Timbers could have opted to schedule several home games at different venues earlier this year to avoid the lengthy road stretch. D.C. United\u2019s Audi Field didn\u2019t open until July last year, but the club still played two home games earlier in the season at the nearby Maryland SoccerPlex, posting a win and a draw in those outings.\nBut Paulson said he felt it made more sense for the Timbers to simply wait until June 1 to play at home. Portland wouldn\u2019t have been able to play at the University of Portland\u2019s Merlo Field because the stadium seats roughly 5,000 and the Timbers have around 15,000 season tickets holders, Paulson said. The club could have also tried to secure a larger venue at the University of Oregon or Oregon State University, but Paulson didn\u2019t think that was the best option since the colleges are between an hour and a half to two hours outside of Portland.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather do it right and do it at home,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cFrankly, my mentality was that we get a minimum of 12 points from the 12 games on the road, average a point per game, which is still possible, but, admittedly, more difficult, given the results to date.\u201d\nDespite a poor run of form, the Timbers still have time to turn things around.\nSporting Kansas City started the 2011 season by tallying just six points in 10 consecutive road games, but recovered to finish first in the East. D.C. United earned just 11 points in their first 14 games last season before finally playing at Audi Field in July, but rebounded late in the year with a home-heavy schedule and the acquisition of superstar Wayne Rooney to finish fourth in the East.\nThe Timbers are also actively looking to make improvements to their roster within the next month, which could give the club a spark as it tries to rebound from the disappointing start. The Primary Transfer Window closes on May 7.\n\u201cOur expectation and hope is that we will be adding a significant player before the close of this window,\u201d Paulson said.\nIf previous seasons are any indication, things could change quickly for the Timbers once they finally return home. Portland will play 11 of its final 12 games at Providence Park. But the club certainly shouldn\u2019t bank on a late season winning streak. Portland still has six more games on the road before its home opener, and the Timbers need to make the most of those matches if the club hopes to be within striking distance of playoff position by the time it returns home.\nPortland did take a step forward last weekend, putting in a solid performance in a controversial 2-1 loss to FC Dallas. Referee Marcos DeOliveira failed to award the Timbers penalty kicks late in the game, despite two controversial plays in the box. Replays showed that both plays likely should have resulted in penalty kicks for the Timbers. Despite the result, Portland still put in a performance it can build on.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to continue to be awful on the road, but I also think the optics of this year are worse than the reality, especially when we beat Dallas this weekend and had three points taken away from us,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cThey had a fluke deflection resulting in a goal and had a penalty given to them that was no more a penalty than the two penalties that we earned.\u201d\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @jamiebgoldberg\nVisit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Very few people have a written will, but everyone needs one!\nHow do I make a will?\nLawyer Brenda Majune, says that there is no standard form of writing a will in Kenya.\nA will is valid as long as the person making the will is above 18 years old and sane, and does so without coercion or undue influence.\nThe will also needs to be properly signed by the writer (if it is in writing) and witnessed by two or more adults of sound mind, who also sign it. The maker of the will details the properties and the beneficiaries whom they bequeath.\nMust I leave something behind for my children?\nWhile children, regardless of age and gender, have a right to inherit, the law does not compel any parent to leave an inheritance for them. It is therefore not uncommon to hear that despite their massive wealth, parents have disinherited their children for one reason or another, explains Ms Majune.\nHowever, the disinherited child can petition the court to consider giving them a portion, which, at the sole discretion of the court, sometimes may go against the wishes of the deceased.\nAre my daughters less entitled to inherit my property?\nThe Law of Succession Act does not discriminate on the gender of the children that are allowed to inherit. Conflict, however, arises in traditions that disinherit girls. But courts have come in to resolve this conflict and laid down jurisprudence to guide this misconception, disregarding all traditions considered discriminative.\nIsn\u2019t my next of kin information just as good as a formal will?\nIn most business transactions in Kenya, individuals are required to name their next of kin. However, it does not mean that the money automatically passes to the person named as the next of kin if the account holder dies. If the person dies having made a valid will and passed the money to that next of kin, then the money is inherited legally. However, if there is no will that directs that the money be transferred to the next of kin, it is not automatically passed to them, and is therefore distributed according to the law. Ms Majune says indicating the next of kin is merely for the purposes of contacts in the event that the person transacting cannot be reached and has nothing to do with inheritance.\nWhat are the current trends regarding wills?\n", "label": "human"}

The developer said it\u2019s not giving up, however, and plans to modify its proposal.\nThe zoning board\u2019s thumbs-down came after both the zoning board and the Syracuse Planning Commission wrote letters to the developer saying they think the project would be too big for the neighborhood.\n\u201cThe proposal involves substantial demolition of primarily small-scale buildings and their replacement with a single building having a much larger mass and scale,\u201d the zoning board wrote.\n\u201cThe proposal\u2019s 283 dwelling units and parking garage, with virtually complete lot coverage, would create a concentration of high density inconsistent with the low- to medium-density of the existing neighborhood,\" the Planning Commission said. \u201cAdditionally, the proposed building\u2019s mass, scale, materials and detailing would stand in stark contrast to the salient characteristics of the subject neighborhood.\u201d\n$62M apartment building proposed in Syracuse University area; tax breaks sought The 283-unit building would be built across the street from a large new student housing project but new building would not focus on students.\nHousing Visions, a nonprofit builder of affordable housing, has also expressed concerns about the project, saying it \u201cappears to be at a density that is very intense\" for the size of the lot.\nHousing Visions also said it was worried the project would lead to a rise in rents in the neighborhood.\n\u201cAs a fellow developer, we are not against development, but we do believe significant improvements can be made to the proposal that will benefit the neighborhood rather than detract from the success that Housing Visions has worked to create in the neighborhood over the past 29 years,\u201d President and CEO Benjamin Lockwood wrote.\nA speaker at a public hearing held by the zoning board on Thursday opposed the development, too.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would fit in any residential neighborhood in the city of Syracuse,\u201d said Ken Garno, a facilitator for Tomorrow\u2019s Neighborhoods Today, a city-wide neighborhood group. \u201cTo me, it belongs downtown, based on its appearance.\u201d\nNorthside Genesee Associates is a limited liability company created by Michaels Development, of Marlton, New Jersey, the same company that built the 505 on Walnut, a 126-unit student housing development that opened in 2018 directly across the street from the proposed new apartments.\nEleven multifamily homes and an apartment building would be demolished to make way for the new building.\nRick Moriarty Eleven multifamily homes and an apartment building would be demolished to make way for a proposed $62 million, 283-unit apartment building in the 1200 and 1300 blocks of East Genesee Street in Syracuse. (Rick Moriarty | rmoriarty@syracuse.com)\nAccording to the developer\u2019s proposal, the project would be a mix of two-level townhomes and one- to five-bedroom apartments (with the majority containing two bedrooms or less). All would be contained in a single building.\nIn addition, the building would have an internal courtyard and multilevel parking with 283 spaces (one for each apartment), with access on Ashworth Place. The top of the garage would contain a spa.\nParts of the building would be four stories tall and parts six stories tall.\nIn a written response to the criticism, the developer said the East Genesee Street corridor between South Crouse Avenue and South Beech Street contained a number of apartment block buildings ranging in height from two to six stories, including the six-story 505 on Walnut.\n\u201cWhile the proposed project has a continuous footprint, the architecture is segmented into separate and specific areas to provide architectural interest with varying mass and elevations to emulate the appearance of multiple buildings similar to the older mansions and other apartment buildings within the corridor,\u201d the developer said.\nAttorney Kevin McAuliffe, who is representing the developer, said he believes the city boards are primarily concerned that the new apartments will be filled with students and think the area has enough student housing.\nIn its proposal, the developer said it would seek to rent the apartments to young professionals, medical professionals, medical school graduates and university staff, rather than students. However, renderings submitted to the city show a building that bears a strong resemblance to the student housing across the street.\nSee inside new luxury student apartments in Syracuse (photos) The 505 On Walnut even has its own doggie park.\nMcAuliffe said the developer plans to modify the design in hopes of getting the zoning board to reconsider its denial of variances for set-back and development density requirements.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to resubmit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up with new drawings to make it clear it\u2019s not student housing.\u201d\nThe planning and zoning boards\u2019 letters were sent to the Syracuse Industrial Development Agency, which is considering an application from the developer for a mortgage tax exemption worth $330,393, an exemption valued at $2 million from sales taxes on construction materials and a 15-year payment-in-lieu-of-tax agreement that would provide discounts on property taxes. (The agency has not yet calculated the value of the property tax exemptions.)\nThe industrial development agency voted March 19 to declare that the project would have no significant environmental impact, clearing the way for the planning and zoning boards to vote on the project. The development agency has not yet voted on the developer\u2019s application for tax breaks.\nRick Moriarty covers business news and consumer issues.

{"text": "By Adam Nossiter and Aurelien Breeden\nPARIS \u2013 Notre Dame Cathedral, the symbol of the beauty and history of Paris, was scarred by an extensive fire Monday evening that caused its delicate spire to collapse, bruised the Parisian skies with smoke and further disheartened a city already back on its heels after weeks of violent protests.\nThe spectacle of flames leaping from the cathedral\u2019s wooden roof \u2013 its spire glowing red then turning into a virtual cinder \u2013 stunned thousands of onlookers who gathered along the banks of the Seine and packed into the plaza of the nearby Hotel de Ville, gasping and covering their mouths in horror and wiping away tears.\n\u201cIt is like losing a member of one\u2019s own family,\u201d said Pierre Guillaume Bonnet, a 45-year-old marketing director. \u201cFor me there are so many memories tied up in it.\u201d\nAround 500 firefighters battled the blaze for nearly five hours. By 11 p.m. Paris time, the structure had been \u201csaved and preserved as a whole,\u201d the fire chief, Jean-Claude Gallet, said. The two magnificent towers soaring above the skyline had been spared, he said, but two-thirds of the roof was destroyed.\n\u201cThe worst has been avoided even though the battle is not completely won,\u201d President Emmanuel Macron said in a brief and solemn speech at Notre-Dame on Monday night, vowing that the cathedral would be rebuilt.\n\u201cThis is the place where we have lived all of our great moments, the epicenter of our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the cathedral of all the French.\u201d\nThe cause of the fire was not immediately known, officials said. But it appeared to have begun in the interior network of wooden beams, many dating back to the Middle Ages and nicknamed \u201cthe forest,\u201d said the cathedral\u2019s rector, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet.\nNo one was killed, officials said, but a firefighter was seriously injured.\n[See photos of the fire at the landmark Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris]\nThe fire broke out about 6:30 p.m., upending Macron\u2019s plans to deliver an important policy speech about trying to heal the country from months of demonstrations by the yellow vest protest movement that had already defaced major landmarks in the capital and disfigured some of its wealthiest streets.\nThe tragedy seemed to underscore the challenges heaped before his administration, which has struggled to reconcile the formidable weight of France\u2019s ideals and storied past with the necessity for change to meet the demands of the 21st century.\nA jewel of medieval Gothic architecture built in the 12th and 13th centuries, Notre Dame is a landmark not only for Paris, where it squats firmly yet gracefully at its very center, but for all the world. The cathedral is visited by about 30,000 people a day and around 13 million people a year.\nFor centuries France\u2019s kings and queens were married and buried there. Napoleon was crowned emperor in Notre-Dame in 1804, and the joyous thanksgiving ceremony after the Liberation of Paris in 1944 took place there, led by Charles de Gaulle.\nWorld leaders congregated at the cathedral in a memorial service for de Gaulle in 1970, and then again for President Francois Mitterrand in 1996.\nOn Monday evening, as the last rush of tourists were trying to get in for the day, the doors of Notre Dame were abruptly shut without explanation, witnesses said.\nWithin moments, tiny bits of white smoke started rising from the spire \u2013 which, at 295 feet, was the highest part of the cathedral.\nBillowing out, the smoke started turning gray, then black, making it clear that a fire was growing inside the cathedral, which is currently covered in scaffolding. Soon, orange flames began punching out of the spire, quickly increasing in intensity.\nFrench police rushed in and started blowing whistles, telling everyone to move back, witnesses said. By then, the flames were towering, spilling out of multiple parts of the cathedral. Tourists and residents alike came to a standstill, pulling out their phones to call their loved ones. Older Parisians began to cry, lamenting how their national treasure was quickly being lost.\nThousands stood on the banks of the Seine river and watched in shock as the fire tore through the cathedral\u2019s wooden roof and brought down the spire. Video filmed by onlookers and shared on social media showed smoke and flames billowing from the top of the cathedral.\nJean-Louis Martin, 56, a native of Dijon in eastern France who works at the university in Geneva, gasped as the flames leapt up. \u201cIt hurts me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no words. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d\nThe crowd gasped and cried in horror when the spire fell. \u201cParis is beheaded,\u201d said Pierre-Eric Trimovillas, 32.\nVincent Dunn, a fire consultant and former New York City fire chief, said that fire-hose streams could not reach the top of such a cathedral, and that reaching the top on foot was often an arduous climb over winding steps.\n\u201cThese cathedrals and houses of worship are built to burn,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t houses of worship, they\u2019d be condemned.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office said it had opened an investigation.\nChauvet said firefighters were able to save some of the cathedral\u2019s artworks but did not say how much was damaged inside the building. A linen fabric associated with Saint Louis, the Holy Crown of thorns and the cathedral\u2019s treasury were saved.\nGallet, the fire chief, said firefighters were still rescuing artworks in the building, hours after the fire had started. The main risk, he said, was the smoke within the cathedral, and the fall of materials, including melting lead.\nThe cathedral had been undergoing extensive renovation work. Last week, 16 copper statues representing the Twelve Apostles and four evangelists were lifted with a crane so that the spire could be renovated.\nThe cathedral had been in dire need of a thorough and expensive restoration, Andre Finot, the cathedral spokesman, told The New York Times in 2017.\nBroken gargoyles and fallen balustrades had been replaced by plastic pipes and wooden planks. Flying buttresses had been darkened by pollution and eroded by rainwater. Pinnacles had been propped up by beams and held together with straps. In some places, limestone crumbled at a finger\u2019s touch.\nGlenn Corbett, an associate professor of fire science at John Jay College in New York, said construction work and renovations had long been a dangerous combination.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a history of churches and synagogues and other houses of worship falling victim to construction fires,\u201d he said, adding that one of the reasons for the peril was the proximity of open flames on torches, sparks from welders and other hazards on scaffolding to other flammable materials.\nIn recent years, the Friends of Notre-Dame, a foundation based in the United States, estimated that the structure needed nearly $40 million for urgent repairs. The French state, which owns the cathedral, already devotes up to 2 million euros (about $2.4 million) a year in upkeep.\nThe fire came during Holy Week, six days before Easter Sunday. For Roman Catholics, the cathedral has been a spiritual pilgrimage site for generations. France has a deep Catholic history, and nearly two-thirds of its population is Catholic, even though fewer and fewer attend Mass.\n\u201cIt\u2019s apocalyptic,\u201d said Eleanor Batreau, 45, who organizes pilgrimages to Lourdes and sometimes works at Notre Dame. \u201cIt reminds me of Dresden burning. I\u2019m a Catholic, and Notre Dame is a symbol of Mary.\u201d\nThe risk of the fire is not just to the cathedral itself, but also to the gargoyles that cover its walls and to the stained glass, particularly its \u201crose\u201d windows.\nThe largest of its bells, which dates to 1681, managed to survive the French Revolution and has been rung at some of the most important events in French history, including both world wars.\nYet the fire is likely to be just the latest, if most dramatic, insult to a landmark that has endured decades of neglect and damage, some at the hands of French revolutionaries, through its more than 850-year history.\nVictor Hugo\u2019s 1831 novel, \u201cNotre-Dame of Paris,\u201d noted even then that \u201cone cannot but regret, cannot but feel indignant at the innumerable degradations and mutilations inflicted on the venerable pile, both by the action of time and the hand of man.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

Dancing and fighting are acts that require the same muscles, the same incredible amount of motor skill, balance, strength and agility. The big difference is intent, which can be all the difference in the world.\nARIES (March 21-April 19). If you\u2019re going to forget something about an interaction, forget the bad parts. That won\u2019t be the natural thing to do, but it will be the move that will make you happier and more effective.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20). Don\u2019t mix up mistakes and crimes. Give yourself and others the wide margins for error that everyone needs when learning something new. This awkward phase will be over soon enough.\nGEMINI (May 21-June 21). It\u2019s a strange thing to ask yourself to consider your emotions from a less emotional perspective, but some amount of detachment will benefit you as you sort through recent happenings and decide how you\u2019d like to react.\nCANCER (June 22-July 22). Getting out, active and moving in the world will be so crucial to your mood and progress. You\u2019ll need the influence of other people, as well as some fresh air and sunshine, to be your best self.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Swap nostalgic stories with people you\u2019ve known awhile \u2014 it cements the bond, brings good cheer and lends a healthy perspective of time to everyone\u2019s mindset.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). The goal is no longer seeming doable, but this is not a sign that you should drop the goal. Change up your action steps. A different approach will yield different results.\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). You\u2019re not thinking about your own interests as you go into today\u2019s venture, ready to do whatever you can to make things better for everyone else. It just works out that by helping the others, you wind up helping yourself.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Remind yourself of your own happy history. You\u2019ve much to be proud of. It\u2019s one of those days when the active efforts you take to bring yourself up will work well to keep your heart buoyant and your mood resilient.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). Tune in to what\u2019s going on inside you. When you can find peace in your own heart, there is nothing to worry or fear about any other place on the Earth.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Decision paralysis is caused by having too many options to choose from. But when you really analyze your choices today, there are far fewer that make real sense for you. In fact, there are but two.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). You don\u2019t absolutely have to complete each and every daily task in order to feel happier, but it helps! Things left undone weigh disproportionately on your mind, and handling them gives you a lift.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Negotiations ensue.

She hinted that I should have given her an actual card. I did get her a gift, which I gave her the next time we got together, but without a card. Well, one thing led to another, and we got into an argument and she brought up that she thinks it\u2019s obnoxious the way I generally use text messages instead of handwritten or spoken correspondence. For instance, I didn\u2019t send holiday cards. I just texted them. And on New Year\u2019s, I texted instead of calling. But I think it\u2019s better to communicate in whatever way is easiest! I\u2019m a Gemini. What do you think, Holiday?\u201d\nPerhaps your point of view is on trend, as text is a more acceptable form of communication than it used to be, for many types of messages. But Libras can be very traditional and are sensitive to levels of formality and the respect they convey. The thought and presentation that goes into your communication is extremely important to your Libra friend. Texting is a casual medium that doesn\u2019t convey the same significance and warmth as a card. Your Libra friend sees text as a way to set up your next communication (with the details of date, time and location) and not as the communication itself.\nCELEBRITY PROFILES: Alec Baldwin talked about his youthful ambition of being the president of the United States, before he knew he would someday win awards for impersonating an American president on television.

{"text": "Palm Springs: Bubblegum pop coquette on the outside, saucy master of celebrity on the inside, there is perhaps no current star better at re-fashioning her own trials into larger-than-life success than Ariana Grande.\nWhile suffering a highly publicized burst of personal and professional upheaval -- the deadly 2017 Manchester bombing at one of her concerts, the suicide of her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller, the demise of her whirlwind engagement to comedian Pete Davidson -- Grande has proven poised in the face of tragedy and a deft manipulator of her own image, all while catapulting to global stardom.\nGrande\u00b4s adept use of social media to slam her naysayers, drum up support from her \"Arianator\" fans and flirt with the gossip machine has created the perception that only she is in the driver\u00b4s seat.\nAfter a resounding year of hits that saw industry tracker Billboard name the 25-year-old teen idol its 2018 woman of the year, Grande is set to headline a number of major festivals as part of her global tour, including this weekend\u00b4s influential Coachella lineup.\nShe\u00b4s just the fourth solo woman to headline the premier festival in the California desert -- and the youngest artist ever to nab the coveted spot.\nThe feat comes after Grande shattered a number of US chart records and released two albums in six months, feeding the streaming beast with earworms while carving out her own version of the modern female pop star.\n- Feminist manifesto -\nA Floridian by birth, the petite Italian-American Grande moved to New York as a teen for a spot on Broadway before finding fame on US kids network Nickelodeon.\nShe forayed into pop music shortly thereafter, releasing her debut studio album to commercial success in 2013.\nA fan of miniskirts rarely seen without her signature ponytail snaking down past her hips, Grande had all the makings of a teen pop droid -- batting her eyelashes and pouting her lips while wielding her impressive four-octave range to deliver saccharine lyrics.\nBut in recent years the superstar has co-opted that traditional ingenue image, adding a heavy dose of sex appeal and a biting demand for control.\nIn 2015 she issued a feminist manifesto attacking the public appetite for news on her personal life and those of other women.\nAnd while last year\u00b4s \"Sweetener\" album -- released in the midst of Grande\u00b4s turmoil -- felt like an optimistic catharsis, her rapid follow-up \"Thank U, Next\" saw the star baring but owning her vulnerabilities, declaring this the year of Ariana.\n- Sexual empowerment -\nYet Grande\u00b4s celebration of feminine power while simultaneously flaunting her sexuality and pinning her art to her tumultuous love life has drawn criticism that she is propping up the very double standards she seeks to destroy.\n\"In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement and when women are trying (and succeeding) at rising above our worth being tethered to our sexuality, this is the last thing we need,\" wrote Erin Parker for the pop culture magazine Nylon.\nJacqueline Warwick, a scholar of music and gender studies at Canada\u00b4s Dalhousie University, agreed that Grande\u00b4s feminist bent can \"feel a little hollow,\" saying the star is \"playing into these very conventional ways of looking at women\u00b4s bodies -- and that seems certainly very well worn.\"\nBut Warwick said Grande also \"is articulating desire and speaking very frankly and candidly about her sexual pleasure -- that\u00b4s certainly refreshing and possibly empowering.\"\n\"It\u00b4s not easy for young women artists to be taken seriously and be successful in a pop medium without doing the things that she\u00b4s doing,\" the academic told AFP.\n- Maintain the buzz -\nIn recent days Grande -- often celebrated for supporting LGBT rights -- was also accused of \"queerbaiting,\" teasing gay fans by suggesting in her new collaboration track \"Monopoly\" that she is bisexual.\n\"I think she\u00b4s certainly figured out that people are interested in her sex life -- that it\u00b4s not a bad thing to keep people interested by dropping hints,\" Warwick said.\nCreating such buzz maintains a steady base keen for Grande\u00b4s next bop, which she\u00b4s taken to releasing whenever inspiration strikes.\nShe has voiced irritation with the commodified packaging of pop stars, championing the free release model more associated with hip hop artists.\n\"My dream has always been to ... put out music in the way that a rapper does,\" Grande told Billboard recently.\n\"It\u00b4s just like, \u00b4Bruh, I just want to ... talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do.\u00b4\"\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "An Israeli teen who fell 600 feet to his death in Yosemite National Park in September was dangling from a steep ledge and posing for a picture when he suddenly lost his grip before several horrified tourists, according to a new report.\nTomer Frankfurter, 18, of Jerusalem, was visiting a family friend in Fresno, California, for several weeks last fall before he planned to return home and start his service with the Israeli army. But Frankfurter and his friend got separated after arriving at the nearly 1,200-square-mile park, leading him to join another group of tourists from Israel, Germany and other countries to trek along the strenuous, 5.4-mile Mist Trail above the 594-foot Nevada Fall, the San Jose Mercury News reports.\nAfter eating lunch at what\u2019s billed on Yosemite\u2019s website as a \u201cthunderous waterfall,\u201d Frankfurter and his newfound companions were getting ready to leave Nevada Fall when he had a last-minute idea: He wanted a daring picture of himself.\nSo Frankfurter tossed off his orange backpack and gave his phone to a young woman in the group before starting to climb over the cliff\u2019s edge. He ignored several hikers, who told him to stop, and within seconds, he was hanging hundreds of feet above steep, rocky terrain below.\nThe woman tasked to capture Frankfurter\u2019s risky maneuver, meanwhile, took several photos, according to details of the fatal Sept. 4 accident obtained by the newspaper via a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\u201cI need help,\u201d Frankfurter suddenly said, causing several in the group to grab his arms and wrists.\nThe other hikers, strangers just a short time ago, were now straining to pull Frankfurter back onto the trail, but the teen\u2019s arms were slick with sweat, and the teen slipped away to his death in an accident that \u201che was entirely in control of until the point of the fall,\u201d according to a report written by a Yosemite park ranger.\n\u201cThe witnesses that attempted to render aid were heroic in their actions,\u201d the ranger wrote. \u201cBut once Frankfurter descended to hang from the edge of the cliff face, there was nothing they could have done to prevent his fall with the equipment available.\u201d\nFrankfurter told the group that he wanted to replicate a popular photo on social media platforms, especially Instagram, of hikers hanging from a rock outcropping in Brazil called Telegraph Rock near Rio de Janeiro. That rock, however, is just feet above a nearby trail, unlike the formidable Nevada Fall in Yosemite.\n\u201cI thought he was joking,\u201d one witness told investigators of Frankfurter. \u201cI turned around because I couldn\u2019t watch, but he was hanging off the rock. Then he started to struggle.\u201d\nAnother witness said they heard someone scream, \u201cCome quickly, everyone hurry!\u201d\n\u201cHelp! We need help,\u201d another person in the group screamed as three others tried unsuccessfully to pull Frankfurter to safety. \u201cBut he just couldn\u2019t hang on anymore.\u201d\nFrankfurter died instantly on impact near the Merced River below, according to the report. He\u2019s one of at least 1,004 people who have died at the park since 1851, including more than 300 who died in falls, according to Michael Ghiglieri, co-author of \u201cOff the Wall: Death in Yosemite.\u201d\nGhiglieri said Frankfurter\u2019s death appears to be part of a \u201cselfie epidemic\u201d now plaguing travelers, especially the younger crowd.\n\u201cToday people are trying to prove that they did something,\u201d Ghiglieri told the newspaper. \u201cIn the old days people went out to have an experience. Now they go out to record that they had that experience.\u201d\nGhiglieri said most people recognize that risking their lives for a photo just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\u201cSome people \u2014 and it\u2019s almost always guys \u2014 recognize it\u2019s dangerous, but they don\u2019t internalize it as dangerous,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThey perceive it like a Hollywood movie set. It\u2019s a disconnect.\u201d\nGhiglieri called on national parks to consider updating safety guidelines, perhaps with warnings that selfies aren\u2019t worth a potentially fatal fall. But that\u2019s not currently in the works, according to Yosemite officials.\n\u201cWe post signs in some areas, at top of Mist Trail, for example, warning people to stay away from the edge,\u201d Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman told the San Jose Mercury News. \u201cAnd, of course, we have safety messages in our park newspaper and on the website. However, we don\u2019t have anything specific about taking photos on the edges of cliffs.\u201d\nShort of daunting warning signs, Ghiglieri said strangers should use common sense the next time they get a request to become an amateur photographer from a daring hiker or adventurist.\n\u201cIn a common-sense way, many of these accidents could not happen with that assistance,\u201d Ghiglieri said.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "0\nFuture Man will be coming to an end after its upcoming third and final season. Hulu has renewed the sci-fi comedy series for one more go-around, but this will be the end of the road for the critically praised show. Created by Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, the series premiered in 2017 with a pilot directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The premise was simple yet solid: a lazy young janitor and frequent gamer is visited by two warriors from the future who tell him he\u2019s the only one who can stop an impending apocalyptic event. Josh Hutcherson plays said janitor, while Eliza Coupe and Derek Wilson play the time-traveling warriors.\nI\u2019ve been a pretty big fan of the show since its first season. It\u2019s not afraid to get weird, and the writers have a lot of fun with the sci-fi premise, jumping back and forth between timelines while anchoring the series with a core friendship between the trio of main characters.\nHowever, the show has unfortunately had trouble standing out amongst the glut of #PeakTV. Despite its binge-worthy nature and R-rated comedy, for whatever reason Future Man hasn\u2019t hit as big as some other shows. Though I have a feeling it\u2019s one people will discover years from now and wonder why they never watched while it was on.\nRegardless, I\u2019m happy that Hulu is giving the series a chance to wrap up its story. Future Man Season 3 will consist of only eight episodes (as opposed to 13 for the first two seasons), but the show\u2019s Season 2 finale left off on a pretty meaty cliffhanger that once again upended the premise and setting. I\u2019m looking forward to finding out how it all ends.\nFor those unfamiliar with the show\u2019s insane antics, watch the trailer for Season 1 below.

In her speech, she discussed the racism American Muslims have faced post-9/11 and said that CAIR was founded after the attacks \"because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\" (Omar was mistaken as to the date of the organization's founding\u2014CAIR was actually formed in 1994.)\nWE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM \u2014 Donald J.

{"text": "Photo for illustrative purposes only Image Credit: Pixabay\nAlso in this package Should we give up eating red meat?\nLondon: Eating even the moderate amounts of red and processed meat sanctioned by British government guidelines increases the likelihood of developing bowel cancer, according to the largest UK study of the risks ever conducted.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) suggests anyone who eats more than 90g of red or processed meat per day should try to cut down to 70g or less, because of the known link with bowel cancer. The NHS describes 90g of red meat as \u201cequivalent to around three thinly cut slices of beef, lamb or pork, where each slice is about the size of half a piece of sliced bread\u201d.\nProcessed meat includes sausages, bacon and ham. A cooked breakfast with two \u201ctypical British\u201d sausages and two rashers of bacon would clock up 130g, the NHS advises.\nMeat is important for iron ... The main message for the public is that it reinforces the government advice that we shouldn\u2019t eat large amounts of red and processed meat. - Professor Tim Key | Study author\nA five-year study of half a million men and women who have signed up to the UK Biobank research project found those who were more or less keeping to the guidelines, eating on average 76g of red or processed meat per day, had a 20 per cent increased risk of bowel cancer compared with those who averaged 21g a day.\nThe risk increased by 20 per cent with each extra slice of ham or rasher of bacon (roughly 25g) the study participants ate, and by 19 per cent with each thick slice of roast beef or the edible part of a lamb cutlet (about 50g).\nThe study also found heavier drinkers of alcohol had an increased risk - up by 24 per cent among those who drank the most alcohol compared with those who drank the least. Eating fibre in the form of breakfast cereals and bread had a protective effect, however. In January, a study commissioned by the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported fibre also protects against heart disease.\n70 grams is maximum daily intake of red meat recommended by Britain\u2019s DHSC\nCancer Research UK\u2019s expert in diet and cancer, Prof Tim Key, who co-authored the study and is also deputy director at the University of Oxford\u2019s cancer epidemiology unit, said the research had an extra adjustment to check whether participants had accurately reported what they eat. Diet studies are problematic because those who take part often either forget what they have eaten or fail to tell the truth.\nAll the Biobank participants were asked about their diet when they joined up. In this study, they were also asked to complete an additional questionnaire every three or four months, detailing exactly what they had eaten in the previous 24 hours.\nThe researchers found those who ate the most and least red and processed meat tended to exaggerate their consumption or lack thereof. That led to a steeper increase in risk than in studies relied on by the WHO when it produced the guidance incorporated into that of the DHSC.\nExperts found little difference between red and processed meat and say both are cancer culprits.\n\u201cWe are not claiming that therefore the government recommendation is wrong and should be changed,\u201d Key said. The paper, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, would have to be seen in the context of many others, he said.\nKey also said meat had nutritional benefits. \u201cMeat is important for iron. We would want to consider other aspects of health if we were going to change the recommendation. The main message for the public is that it reinforces the government advice that we shouldn\u2019t eat large amounts of red and processed meat,\u201d he said.\nAlcohol, on the other hand, increased bowel cancer risk and did not have nutritional benefits, he said. \u201cAlcohol is an optional thing that we don\u2019t have to consume,\u201d Key added.\nDr Gunter Kuhnle, an associate professor in nutrition and health at Reading University, said the analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel cancer was very thorough and confirmed previous findings about the risks.\n\u201cThe results of this study also question the recent focus on nitrite as the main culprit for colorectal cancer: the authors found very small differences between red and processed meat in this study, even though only processed meat contains nitrite,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA reduction or removal of nitrite from meat products would therefore have only little impact on cancer risk. An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit.\u201d\nDr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK\u2019s head of health information, said: \u201cThe government guidelines on red and processed meat are general health advice and this study is a reminder that the more you can cut down beyond this, the more you can lower your chances of developing bowel cancer.\u201d\nPoint of view: Diet is the key\nBy Dr Arun Karanwal | Specialist Medical Oncologist at the Prime Hospital, Dubai\nOver the years there have been several studies indicating a direct correlation of red meat to colorectal cancers. Although It has not been established that red meat itself contains carcinogens, but the chemical additives used in processing the meat do have cancer-causing compounds. Heavy consumption of red meat does trigger indigestion and constipation which are triggers for bowel cancer. The odds of cancer double in people consuming large portions of red meat compared to vegetarians or those who avoid red meat.\nDr Arun Karanwal Image Credit: Supplied\nWhile it may not be possible to eliminate red meat or alter one\u2019s lifestyle moderation holds the key.\n", "label": "human"}

Falcon & Winter Soldier is expected for year one.\nThe Disney+ plans come as the MCU is poised for a shake-up as it says goodbye to some of its key players with the April 26 bow of Avenger: Endgame. It also follows Netflix canceling its Marvel shows as the competing Disney+ streaming service nears its launch. The Netflix shows \u2014 such as Daredevil and Luke Cage \u2014 did not feature talent from the MCU's big-screen adventures, and though they were technically part of the MCU, they never felt like they truly affected the events of the films. Feige's comments on Thursday solidified the notion that the Disney+ shows will be marketed as essential viewing for MCU fans, rather than as the ancillary material the Netflix shows were often viewed as.\n\"These shows will be on the same level of quality that you've come to expect [from Marvel Studios films],\" said Feige.\nIn addition to new streaming series, Disney+ will also be home to Marvel's films. Captain Marvel will be available on day one, as will films such as Iron Man, Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Within the first year, projects such as Avengers: Endgame, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and The Wasp will also be available.\nDisney+ is set to launch Nov. 12 and will be priced at $6.99 a month, or $69.99 for a year.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "By Tayo Ogunbiyi\nTHOUGH the tragic building collapse at Ita Faji, Lagos Island, no longer features in news reports, its fallouts have continued to resonate. In the aftermath of the sad event and in line with international best practices, the Lagos State government swiftly embarked on a systematic process of demolishing defective buildings across Lagos Island. This is basically as a precautionary measure to forestall future occurrence of such gruesome episode. Naturally, in the process, some people were displaced and there was an urgent need to resettle them.\nIt is, therefore, out of the quest to relocate them that the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, Resettlement Centre, Igando, in Alimosho Local Government Area, became a sure option. The camp has facilities to provide relief for affected victims, including those living with disabilities. It has five hostels with 22 rooms each, four double bunk beds and is capable of accommodating eight persons per room. The centre also has a kitchen facility, a dining hall, a general hall to be used for recreational activities, a three-ward medical facility, a set of 10 toilets and bathrooms for each hostel, sets of three bedroom flats for members of staff, facilities for persons living with disabilities, security post, power-generating set, among others.\nPresently, the camp has come to life with over 300 displaced persons, including children, teenagers and adults. At first, reports had it that many of them were quite apprehensive of moving to the camp because they were not too convinced of its suitability. But upon getting to the camp, the earlier callers had to send words to others about the comfort of the camp as well as other mouth watering welfare package on ground.\nAt the camp, the displaced persons are fed three square meals daily. Also, they have recreational facilities that keep them busy and excited while a medical team is on ground to ascertain the health status of the people and equally offer relevant medical assistance as might be needed. The Igando General Hospital is handling referrals from the camp. Similarly, government provided three buses to convey children to and from their schools while their parents were equally ferried daily to their respective offices. This has really helped in terms of reducing their emotional and physical stress. The whole essence is to ensure that the effect of loss on the victims is mitigated to the barest minimum. Meanwhile, the camp is to be opened for three months, after which government would review the need for an extension.\nHistorically, emergency management and preparedness has been a reactive science. In recent history, disaster awareness through the 24/7-news cycle has intensified the concept of emergency management integration into our daily lives. Through continued awareness and dedicated mitigation advancements, the effects of future disasters can be limited.\nIn Lagos State, emergency management is a significant part of government\u2019s overall strategy for achieving a smart city. The state has today invested heavily on emergency and disaster preparedness and response because its growing population is highly vulnerable to emergency situations like inferno, building collapse, road accident, floods, suicide and others.\nThe consequences of disasters could be in terms of loss of lives and property and in the long term can include serious setbacks to the state development plans. Hence, plans are needed, not only for responding to the impacts of disaster, but also to maintain business continuity while managing the crisis, and to guide recovery and reconstruction effectively. To a large extent, a solid, well-planned emergency response system that routinely includes the educated participation of the community is the most important preparation for a disaster.\nThe Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, was established vide LASEMA Law 16 of 2008 for emergency and disaster management in the State in pursuance to Decree 12 of 1999 as amended by Act No. 50 of 1999 which established the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA. The Agency is statutorily empowered to respond to fire fighting (co-ordinate with fire services), flood control, collapsed building, evacuation, search and rescue operations, environmental pollution, crowd control/cordon off of affected areas, public enlightenment on safety issues, perform general life saving activities, including provision of relief materials, and to clear and remove objects that constitute the carcass or remains of incidents.\nToday, due to continuous funding and proper management, the Agency has grown in leaps and bound. Unarguably, Lagos has been exceptional in term of investment and achievements in emergency responses and this claim are evidence-based. LASEMA is now optimally responding to the challenges of disaster management with improved emergency preparedness and responses. When people get trapped in vehicles during accidents and emergency responders are on ground at the emergency scene, the absence of equipment that would enable them to break into the affected vehicle to rescue the victims usually renders the whole rescue operation meaningless.\nThis explains why the state government has not just decentralised the operations of LASEMA, but each response unit has been equipped with a new ultra-modern equipment (trucks, power bikes, heavy-duty vehicles and fire trucks, mobile intensive care ambulances and light rescue equipment, and 14 new BMW power bikes for on-spot reconnaissance assessments of emergency incidents) and to boost the sea, air and land capacities of the state emergency responders.\nIn furtherance to the need to provide proper extrication equipment for timely rescue of trapped victims in any form of life-threatening emergencies, LASEMA in February, 2018, procured light rescue equipment, which included hydraulic rescue equipment with power unit attached with spreader, rescue ram, cutters combi tools and concrete cutters distributed to all the dispatch centres.\nThe agency has also extended its response to emergencies beyond Lagos. In most cases, accidents along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway stretch into Lagos, thereby affecting residents who work in Lagos but live in border towns, including Magboro, Arepo, Kara, Ibafo, Mowe, among others. To further strengthen emergency management, about 70 adhoc staff of the agency was recently absorbed into the state civil service. Equally, a special allowance is paid to staff of the agency in order to get the best out of them.\nWithout a doubt, it is safe to affirm that Lagos State is poised to take emergency management to new heights. It must, however, be stressed that the citizenry need to embrace safety culture and practice in its entire ramification. This way, the rate of man-made emergency occurrences would be extremely reduced.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "newsletters, editors-pick-list, Early Learning, Child development, Australian Early Development Census, education\nONE-in-five Wagga children are facing development struggles in their first year of school, according to new data. To combat the problem, Wagga's KU Koala Preschool director Dibs Cowley said access to quality early learning services was key. She said the early years of a child's life was a significant period because rapid brain development takes place. Despite development challenges, Wagga has improved in the areas of emotional maturity and social competence. The latest Australian Early Development Census data has revealed there are fewer developmentally vulnerable children in the domain of emotion maturity, from 8.4 per cent in 2015 to 5.2 per cent in 2018. This looked into aggressive, anxious and impulsive behaviours, ability to concentrate and willingness to help others. There was also a decrease in the area of social competency from 9.2 per cent in 2015 to 7 per cent in 2018. It measured a child's ability to get along with peers and take responsibility of their actions. However, there has been no significant changes in the areas of physical health and wellbeing, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge. Mrs Cowley said the best advice for parents was to send their children to high-quality early learning centres to set them up for success. \"In this setting, children gain confidence and develop the necessary skills. They have the chance to interact with peers and educators in this learning environment,\" she said. \"Outside this environment, parents can support their children by building their social confidence. Taking them to the park helps them learn life skills through play.\" The percentage of children attending playgroup, day care or kindergarten in Wagga has increased since 2015. Mrs Cowley said this was positive sign because the early learning services benefited children greatly. However, she said it was important these services are affordable to ensure disadvantaged children have equal opportunities. \"They have the opportunity to build trusting relationships with educators and engage with peers. They are learning life skills, sharing ideas, knowledge and opinions which build their confidence through successes,\" she said. \"\u200bIt is important we make services affordable while encouraging many families to access these services.\" The suburb of Ashmont has presented the highest figures with 36.6 per cent of children developmentally vulnerable on one or more domains and 26.8 per cent on two or more.

{"text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Phil Mickelson flashed the faraway look of a man approaching a half-century of life, clearly pondering where the time went.\n\u201cIt goes by fast,\u201d he reminisced, glancing toward the rolling hills and towering pines beyond the Augusta National clubhouse.\nThen, just like that, Lefty snapped out of it.\nHe\u2019s got his sights on a fourth green jacket.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got another major in me,\u201d Mickelson said confidently. \u201cAt least one, maybe two. I would love to get one right here.\u201d\nThe 100th round of his Masters career wasn\u2019t all that memorable, a middling 1-over 73 Friday in which he was forced to scramble mightily to overcome a wayward driver.\nBut it was enough to keep him in the thick of things after an opening-round 67, to give him a shot at becoming the oldest player to win one of golf\u2019s major championships.\nFor a sport that can be a bit lethargic, needlessly complicated and way too stuffy, this remains one of its overwhelming charms.\nOn any given day, the old guys can still go swing-for-swing with all those buffed-up youngsters, giving us all a bit of hope as we approach middle age and beyond, clear evidence that our golden years don\u2019t have to be confined to a rocking chair.\nThat\u2019s especially the case at Augusta National, which embraces the geezers like a warm, comfy blanket.\n\u201cEvery time I come here, I just feel like a kid again,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\nHe\u2019s already got one major title since entering his 40s, capturing the 2013 British Open at age 43. Now, with his 49th birthday a little over two months away, there\u2019s little doubt that he\u2019s still got the game to win another.\n\u201cI expected to be a little bit better, to be honest,\u201d said Mickelson, whose 4-under 140 left him three shots off the lead. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing better than having a chance going into the weekend at the Masters, and that\u2019s what I want to focus on. I know that I\u2019m playing well enough.\u201d\nAs with all sports, golf will always be a young man\u2019s game.\nA player is far more likely to win a major title in his 20s than his 40s.\nBut there\u2019s a good three dozen members of the Over-40 Major Champions Club, and it seems only a matter of time before someone in their 50s break through to win one of the biggest events.\nFor now, the oldest to do it was Julius Boros, at the PGA Championship way back in 1968, when he was about four months past his 48th birthday. But Tom Watson very nearly captured the 2009 British Open at age 59, squandering a lead with a bogey on the 72nd hole and losing to Stewart Cink in a four-hole playoff.\nMickelson already has a victory this season and it\u2019s not at all far-fetched to envision him contending for a few more championships after he turns 49 on June 16 \u2014 which just happens to be the same day as the final round of the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, site of his most recent triumph a mere two months ago.\nThe Masters leaderboard also included a pair of 43-year-olds, Tiger Woods and Ian Poulter. But, really, the most impressive performance of the first two days was turned in by Bernhard Langer, the 61-year-old German who is graying at the edges but still looks as fit as he did in his prime.\nLanger isn\u2019t going to win the tournament. But he easily made the cut, cruising around the course he knows so well with rounds of 71 and 72. He can\u2019t hit it as far as those players half as age (and then some), but he knows each nook and cranny of the course, the sort of local knowledge that goes far at a place such as this.\nNot that he\u2019d turn down a dip in the fountain of youth.\n\u201cI\u2019m hitting a 4-iron and (younger players are) hitting a 9-iron,\u201d Langer quipped. \u201cI would rather hit a 9-iron and have a little less experience.\u201d\nHe closed out Friday\u2019s round with three birdies on the last five holes, putting him one shot ahead of 25-year-old Jordan Spieth and ensuring he would finish above the cut line for the fifth time in the last seven years.\nBut Father Time will catch him one of these days.\nJust ask Ian Woosnam, the diminutive Welshman who won the Masters in 1991, the same year Mickelson made his Augusta debut as an amateur from Arizona State.\nSharing Langer\u2019s age but plagued by a bad back, Woosnam is no match for this course. Hasn\u2019t been for the better part of two decades. He wanted to quit a few years ago, but his spouse wouldn\u2019t let him.\n\u201cI got a telling off from my wife,\u201d Woosnam joked. \u201cShe said, \u2018Get out there and do it again.\u201d\nBut Friday\u2019s round was his last at Augusta National.\nIf Woosnam comes back again, it will just be for fun.

(Photo:AP)\nWashington: The children of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi have received multimillion-dollar homes and are being paid thousands of dollars per month by the kingdom's authorities, The Washington Post reported Monday.\nKhashoggi -- a contributor to the Post and a critic of the Saudi government -- was killed and dismembered in October at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul by a team of 15 agents sent from Riyadh.\nHis body has not been recovered. The payments to his four children -- two sons and two daughters -- \"are part of an effort by Saudi Arabia to reach a long-term arrangement with Khashoggi family members, aimed in part at ensuring that they continue to show restraint in their public statements,\" the Post said.\nThe houses given to the Khashoggi children are located in the port city of Jeddah and are worth up to USD 4 million, the newspaper reported. Salah, the eldest of the children, plans to continue living in the kingdom, while the others, who live in the United States, are expected to sell the homes, the paper said.\nIn addition to the properties, the children are receiving USD 10,000 or more per month and may also receive larger payments that could amount to tens of millions of dollars each, according to the report.\nSaudi Arabia's powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been accused of orchestrating Khashoggi's killing, but the kingdom has claimed that the prince was not involved. Saudi Arabia initially said it had no knowledge of Khashoggi's fate but later blamed rogue agents for his death. Its public prosecutor has charged 11 people over his murder.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. is seeking the county\u2019s first income tax increase in nearly 30 years \u2014 plus new fees on development and additional charges on residents\u2019 monthly cellphone and cable bills.\nThe move is a marked turn from decades of political tradition in the suburban county, where executives have made it a priority to hold the line on taxes. The county last raised its income tax rate in 1992.\nOlszewski presented his $3.4 billion budget plan Monday morning to the County Council, saying the county is \u201cat a crossroads.\u201d The Democrat, elected in November, said the county needs the increased revenue to close what was projected to be an $81 million deficit.\n\u201cI know how hard county residents work for the money they earn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe our residents understand that investing in the future requires us to make these hard choices.\u201d\nBut some members of the County Council called the proposal a tough sell \u2014 especially because it doesn\u2019t provide enough money to start construction on new high schools for Dulaney, Lansdowne and Towson. While the spending plan includes planning and design funds for Lansdowne, Olszewski said in an interview that the General Assembly\u2019s recent failure to pass the state Build to Learn Act was a huge blow to the county\u2019s construction plans.\nCouncilman David Marks, a Perry Hall Republican, said his constituents \u201care furious that school construction projects are delayed because of the state.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re now being asked to shoulder an income tax increase without any schools being advanced this year,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be very upset.\u201d\nCouncil Chairman Tom Quirk, though, said Olszewski was taking a long-needed action.\n\u201cThis is something that the county has really sidestepped for the last 20 years, and especially the last four or five years,\u201d said Quirk, an Oella Democrat. \u201cThis is what we have to do to keep our county on strong footing.\u201d\nTry your hand at balancing Baltimore County's budget with new online tool \u00bb\nThe tax proposals would need the approval of a majority of the seven-member County Council, which has four Democrats and three Republicans, to be enacted. The council must adopt a budget by June 1.\nOlszewski wants to increase the local income tax rate to 3.2%, from 2.83%, saying that would bring the county in line with its neighbors. Both Baltimore City and Howard County have 3.2% income tax rates, while it\u2019s over 3% in Carroll and Harford counties.\nThe higher rate would generate more than $33 million in additional money next year, according to the Olszewski administration. They said a person earning $50,000 a year would pay an additional a $180 a year in income taxes.\nA new cellphone tax \u2014 which would cost residents $3.50 monthly per mobile phone \u2014 would bring in an additional $29.5 million.\nOlszewski is seeking other fee increases as well, including a cable fee to offset costs for public education and government channels. Verizon customers already pay such a fee, and the county is negotiating with Comcast now to add one for its customers. And he wants to raise the county\u2019s hotel tax rate from 8% to 10% \u2014 and impose that tax on Airbnb-style rentals.\nOlszewski also proposed a new tax on residential and commercial development. So-called impact fees are common elsewhere in Maryland, but county leaders have resisted them until now. His administration estimates it would bring in about $7.7 million in the first year.\nBaltimore County Executive John Olszewski outline how the county can pay for his proposed budget cuts. (Kevin Richardson / Baltimore Sun video) Baltimore County Executive John Olszewski outline how the county can pay for his proposed budget cuts. (Kevin Richardson / Baltimore Sun video)\nHe said the money raised from the tax increases will help pay for 2% cost-of-living raises for teachers and county workers, put more counselors, special education professionals and English as a Second Language teachers in schools, build new sidewalks and bike lanes, and expand the county\u2019s community college scholarship program. It also will help begin to restore a fund set aside for retiree health care costs, he said.\nOlszewski has proposed eliminating 17 \u201credundant\u201d positions in county government. But he wants to create new top jobs, including a chief diversity officer, an opioid strategy coordinator and a sustainability officer who would address climate change.\nCouncilman Todd Crandell, a Dundalk Republican, who said he is \u201ca pretty solid \u2018no\u2019 on a tax increase,\u201d called the diversity and climate change positions unnecessary.\n\u201cWe have existing departments that should be charged with those responsibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t see the need for us to be growing government and to ask the taxpayers \u2014 hardworking taxpayers \u2014 to pay for it.\u201d\nOlszewski said his administration also found $20 million in savings, including a $1 million cut from the schools\u2019 laptop program by stepping back from the one device per child standard in early grade school.\nHe wants to keep the county property tax rate at $1.10 per $100 of assessed value, which it has been since 1988.\nBaltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski says cuts to $1.6 billion school budget will be needed \u00bb\nOlszewski\u2019s proposed budget increases county spending by more than $115 million above this year\u2019s \u2014 and roughly $44.7 million of that goes to the schools.\nOlszewski did cut the school budget request by about $90 million, but still gave schools $32 million more than the minimum the county is required to fund.\n\u201cIt leaves us overall with a lot more resources and staff than we currently have,\u201d said George Sarris, the school system\u2019s director of fiscal services. \u201cIt is a very positive budget.\u201d\nInterim Superintendent Verletta White had asked the county for a much larger increase than in past years, saying that it was what the school system needed. The school board subsequently added more on top of that aggressive request, despite Olszewski\u2019s pleas that the board slim down the budget.\nThe county executive cut $26 million from the proposed budget that would have paid for extending the school day by 15 minutes, a move the state has been pressing the school system to do for years.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As we get to the final days of this election campaign, it seems that there has been more heat than light. Stakes are high and many are wondering how to vote. At the City of Calgary, we\u2019ve been sorting through all the promises and speeches to see where the candidates stand on issues important to Calgarians.\nAs in previous elections, city council surveyed all of the parties and published the results verbatim at yycmatters.ca. We asked detailed questions on four issues: Honouring Commitments to Calgary, Promoting Economic Recovery for Calgary, Supporting Calgarians through the Recovery, and Closing Calgary\u2019s Infrastructure Gap. The parties put significant thought into their answers, and I thank them for that.\nLet\u2019s start with the good: all parties have affirmed their commitment to major projects like the Green Line and the Springbank dam \u2014 critical to protecting downtown Calgary from flooding. (One strange item here: the United Conservative Party\u2019s survey response enthusiastically supports the Springbank dam, with one or two loopholes, but their candidate in the Springbank area has said the party is opposed to building the dam, as is she. They should clarify this.)\nThere are also a few clangers in the responses: no party has a fair distribution plan for cannabis tax revenue where the costs have fallen disproportionally on the city, and none have a clear position on what should be a no-brainer: Extended Producer Responsibility, which makes manufacturers of products responsible for the cost of recycling their packaging, instead of citizens through blue cart fees.\nThe real problem, though, is that none of the parties show a real understanding of city issues, or how to help Calgarians during this slow economic recovery. None of them have specific short-term answers to help attract jobs to Calgary, nor do they show much willingness to assist businesses seeing large increases in their property taxes through no fault of their own. The City of Calgary, working within provincial rules, seems to be left on its own to solve these problems. This is particularly galling given that the property tax is also a provincial tax; about 40 per cent of the property tax you pay goes directly to the province, with the city acting only as their bill collector.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the parties don\u2019t have economic plans; it\u2019s just that their immediate impact will be muted. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that reducing corporate income tax over four years would do much to help businesses that are losing money today. And providing funding for technical education is much needed, but it doesn\u2019t lead to investment and job creation in the short term.\nAnd it must be made clear: despite all the rhetoric, no party would get the Trans Mountain pipeline built five minutes faster than any other. (In fact, Don Braid has argued in this paper that the UCP\u2019s plan may, in fact, delay construction by alienating those actually making the decision.) So those who are basing their vote for one party or another because they believe that party will help the economy in the short term may end up being very disappointed.\nAll of this stuff really matters to Calgarians; recent polling from the city shows people are very supportive of targeted investments in Calgary. For example, 83 per cent of Calgarians support building upstream flood mitigation, 79 per cent support the Green Line, 62 per cent support provincial funding of the expansion of Arts Commons, and 68 per cent think the province should support a field house. Seventy-three per cent want to see provincial investment in the Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund, and 61 per cent agree that the province must do more to help businesses struggling with their property tax.\nNo matter who forms government, I hope we can see a deeper commitment to partnering with us to address our downtown vacancy and localized unemployment. Before voting, I encourage all Calgarians to visit YYCMatters.ca to get informed on the key issues that will impact our city in the years to come. Discuss and debate with your friends and family, and question the candidates who come to your door. Most importantly, remember when you go to the polls on April 16 that, no matter your political stripe, we\u2019re all Calgarian. Let\u2019s vote for Calgary.\nNaheed Nenshi is the mayor of Calgary.\n", "label": "human"}

He bought shoes for students, re-paved basketball courts and provided jobs and shelter for the homeless. He helped renovate a Mid-City roller rink and redeveloped the strip mall that housed his Marathon Clothing shop.\nCradling one of his daughters on his hip, Anthony Drawhorn, a 54-year-old former Canadian Football League player, stood at the edge of the parking lot, near where mourners left hundreds of blue and gold candles, flowers and hats.\nHe said the community was lamenting never getting to see what else Hussle would accomplish.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish, and we could see where he was headed,\u201d Drawhorn said.\nCity News Service contributed to this story.\nShare this:\nView more on Orange County Register\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "5370537724001\nFill-in gloveman Matt Acton is savouring his moment in the A-League spotlight, saying he'll be ready if his stint in Melbourne Victory's goals continues through to the finals.\nBut he's not ready to look that far ahead, knowing even his best performances might not be enough to keep him there.\nSuch is the life of a back-up goalkeeper, and Acton knows it well.\nActon, 26, has been an A-League understudy for five seasons.\nSince winning a place on Brisbane Roar's list in 2013, he's made just eight A-League starts.\nThree of those have come in the last month due to a knee injury to championship-winning goalkeeper Lawrence Thomas.\nWith Victory reticent to put a timeframe on Thomas's return, Acton knows he could be back on the bench for Friday's trip to Adelaide United, or playing through the finals.\n\"If the opportunity does present itself to play in huge matches, I'll be very excited and ready to go,\" he told AAP.\n\"But it's hard to look in the future. So I just take each day as it comes.\"\nCoach Kevin Muscat paid tribute to Acton after his efforts in Victory's 2-1 defeat of Central Coast, saying the gloveman had his place \"on merit\".\nMuscat likened Acton's acrobatic 85th-minute save from the Mariners' only shot on target all match - save for their penalty goal - to the role he's played this season.\n\"He's right in saying that,\" Acton said.\n\"I haven't played a lot this season but I take pride in being ready.\n\"When you're in my position, for most of my career, you don't want to get to a point where you have to perform and you're not ready.\n\"So I'm always making sure I'm ready mentally and physically.\"\nIf Victory are to return to the grand final, for the fourth time in five seasons, they'll have at least seven games in 33 days.\nActon said squad rotation and getting back into a winning habit would be crucial.\n\"We haven't been playing bad, it's that results hadn't gone our way,\" he said.\n\"We've got games, finals, trips to Asia coming up.\n\"It's like myself, everybody needs to be ready.

{"text": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made one thing clear at its big launch event a few weeks ago. The tech giant is staking its future growth on services.\nThe company is best known for making sleek devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and those device sales make up the bulk of its business. But the gadget maker is now seeing most of its revenue growth come from services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Care, and related offerings. That means the success of its services strategy -- adding new verticals like Apple News+, Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+ -- is of the utmost importance. With iPhone sales now declining, concerns are rampant that the flagship smartphone has reached a saturation point thanks to longer upgrade cycles and Chinese consumers turning to cheaper phones made by manufacturers like Huawei.\nOn the back of those concerns comes a new one.\nAccording to a recent Morgan Stanley report, App Store downloads year over year declined in Apple's second quarter (January-March 2019) for the first time since it started reporting such data at the start of 2015.\nAn app sore for the App Store\nThe investment bank found that Apple app store downloads fell by 5% in the quarter. Importantly, app store revenue continued to move higher, increasing 15% to $3.7 billion, according to data from Sensor Tower. The average spent per download rose 21%, driven by gaming spending, especially in China.\nStill, declining downloads should be concerning, as revenue is ultimately tied to downloads, and a decline in new app usage would seem to portend a future slowdown in revenue growth (or even a downturn). There's a limit to how much individual iOS users will spend on the apps they're using, so it would be easier for the company to drive App Store revenue growth by increasing iPhone sales and downloads.\nMorgan Stanley's report suggested the culprit may be the decision by two of the world's most popular streaming services, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), to move away from in-app billing. Apple's commission of up to 30% on those billings could quickly add up.\nIn addition to the money Netflix and Spotify can save by not paying the \"Apple toll,\" the two companies may have also been motivated by Apple's launching of competing products like Apple Music and now Apple TV+, which is expected to include $1 billion in spending on original content.\nPrior to its decision to suspend in-app billing, Netflix was the top-grossing app in the App Store, according to Sensor Tower. The video streamer's app generated $243.7 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2018, up 90% from the year before.\nWhat's next for Apple\nApple's decision to move more aggressively into services could prompt more App Store partners to follow Netflix and Spotify away from in-app billing. For instance, four of the top five free apps in the App Store today represent paid streaming services. Those are HBO Now, YouTube (which has the subscription-based YouTube Red), Hulu, and HBO Go.\nNotably, HBO and Hulu will both be available on Apple TV+, indicating a willingness on their part to work with Apple. However, if app billings get large enough for either company, they could follow Netflix's example and force new subscribers to sign up directly through their websites so they don't have to share revenue with Apple.\nAfter Netflix, other top-grossing apps include Tinder, YouTube, Pandora, and Hulu, as well as several Chinese apps. Though it's easier for some companies to move away from in-app purchases than others (games, for instance, are more dependent on charging users while they're playing), the decline in downloads deserves attention from Apple and its investors. More defections could threaten subscription revenue streams.\nAs Apple moves to compete more directly against its top-grossing apps with portals like News+, Arcade, and TV+, it risks driving away some of the partners that have made the App Store so successful. With the launch of News+ and the upcoming rollout of Arcade and TV+, now should be the time for Apple's services segment to shine.\nWill it? We'll found out more when the company reports second-quarter earnings on April 30.\n", "label": "human"}

He also had diet \u201ccheat days\u201d with trips to the Wendy\u2019s drive-thru. But no more. Playing elite NFL football requires elite dedication in all facets of life. \u201cI just had to realize how to manage my time,\u201d he said. \u201d \u2026 When I felt like I did that, it helped me a lot.\u201d\nDon\u2019t overcomplicate what is at stake in Chubb\u2019s NFL development.

{"text": "BEIJING \u2022 An iPhone assembler, e-commerce emporium and property developer typically do not compete in the same business - except when it is electric vehicles (EVs) in China.\nThat is because of a seismic shift towards EVs, which has spurred billions of dollars in investments by traditional carmakers, start-ups and titans of the Internet, electronics and real-estate industries.\nThe rush is on even as the government pulls back on the subsidies that juiced the industry. There are now 486 EV manufacturers registered in China, more than triple the number from two years ago.\nWhile sales of passenger EVs are projected to reach a record 1.6 million units this year, that is likely not enough to keep all those assembly lines humming, prompting warnings that the ballooning EV market could burst and leave behind only a few survivors.\n\"We are going to see great waves sweeping away sand in the EV industry,\" said Mr Thomas Fang, a partner and strategy consultant at Roland Berger in Shanghai. \"It is a critical moment that will decide life or death for EV start-ups.\"\nAt least two dozen of those will be showcasing models at the Shanghai auto show starting this week. They range in expertise from nascent supercar maker Qiantu Motor to US-traded start-up NIO and elder statesman BYD.\nDozens of start-ups have entered the global EV business in recent years, raising US$18 billion (S$24 billion) since 2011, according to BloombergNEF (BNEF). Most of the biggest fund-raisers are Chinese. The start-ups promise to deliver a collective manufacturing capacity of 3.9 million vehicles a year. That is excluding what some of the world's biggest carmakers are planning.\nNO ROOM FOR BIT PLAYERS There is still huge room out there in the new-energy vehicle market with China's relatively low vehicle-penetration rate. Yet that market is for the competitive players, not the weakest ones, and the latter will be squeezed out. MR CUI DONGSHU, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, on the sale of electric vehicles in China.\nRISING ABOVE THE COMPETITION Only companies that have solid technology reserves can stand out amid competition. By owning core technologies, we can see further and deeper. MR WANG CHUANFU, BYD founder and chairman, on being an established player in the electric vehicle industry.\nChina's big, but it is not that big. Annual sales of passenger EVs only surpassed one million units for the first time last year, according to BNEF. Yet EV sales make up just 4 per cent of overall passenger vehicle sales of 23.7 million units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\nAt the same time, sales of traditional cars are currently in a free fall, plunging for the 10th straight month in March as a slowing economy and trade tensions with the US weigh on consumer sentiment.\n\"There is still huge room out there in the new-energy vehicle market with China's relatively low vehicle-penetration rate,\" said Mr Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association. \"Yet that market is for the competitive players, not the weakest ones, and the latter will be squeezed out.\"\nThe government started pushing development of electric cars to help eliminate air pollution, reduce oil imports and develop high-technology manufacturing.\nBy 2025, China's leaders want annual sales of new-energy vehicles - including pure-battery electrics, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars - to reach seven million units, about 20 per cent of China's total car market. Even that amount would barely be enough to sustain a few dozen companies - not hundreds. A factory typically needs to produce at least tens of thousands of vehicles a year to be profitable.\nAnother headwind is the subsidy cut announced last month by the finance ministry, a move meant to encourage manufacturers to rely on innovation rather than assistance. Then there is the swarm of global giants from Tesla to Volkswagen to Ford, all planning to flood the market with locally produced EVs.\nMr Elon Musk's company started selling its first mass-market model in China this year and plans to begin building vehicles in Shanghai by the year's end. Tesla sold 14,467 vehicles in China last year.\nToyota, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, and Mitsubishi chose a quicker way in: They all plan to sell what is essentially the same car, developed by Guangzhou Automobile Group.\nRelated Story Global car makers face bumpy road as China hosts car show\nRelated Story Will electric cars be more affordable?\nRelated Story Electric cars gaining ground\nMore established local manufacturers, such as BYD, likely can withstand the competition and the subsidy cuts, given a track record spanning years, a line-up including cars and buses, and an existing customer base.\nThe Warren Buffett-backed company has boosted revenue for six straight years and turned a profit since at least 2000.\n\"Only companies that have solid technology reserves can stand out amid competition,\" said Mr Wang Chuanfu, its founder and chairman. \"By owning core technologies, we can see further and deeper.\"\nThe ones facing the biggest risk are upstarts still seeking their footing. Many are founded or funded by people with an Internet or technology background, used to hefty cash-burn rates but still not necessarily fully aware of the massive investment needed for car manufacturing, Mr Fang said.\nThe non-car companies spending heavily on EVs include Foxconn, Alibaba and China Evergrande. Start-ups need to secure their funding within the next year or risk being wiped out, said Mr Li Xiang, founder and chief executive officer of the Chehejia brand.\nChehejia - which recruited talent from Daimler, Toyota and BMW - plans to start deliveries in the fourth quarter, after initially aiming for 2017.\nBLOOMBERG\n", "label": "human"}

Her team trailed 48-32 when she went up for a jump shot, then came down on the foot of Brittney Griner. Stewart collapsed to the floor in obvious pain and grabbed her lower right leg.

Former WNBA and Olympic star Tamika Catchings had surgery on her Achilles in Sept. 2007 and played in the 2008 Olympics and in the 2008 WNBA season. DeMarcus Cousins ruptured his Achilles in January 2018; he returned to the NBA a year later.\nBrian Stewart said he\u2019s been texting with his daughter since the injury occurred.

Stewart, the reigning MVP of the WNBA and the MVP of the WNBA Finals last year when she led Seattle to the 2018 title, is slated to earn $64,538 next season with the Storm. The max contract in the WNBA is $113,500, but Stewart is still working under her rookie deal.\nTwo years ago, she returned home from a season in China to tend to a relatively minor knee injury (sprained posterior cruciate ligament) and spoke then about the wear and tear the year-round game was having on her body.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a contributing factor,\u201d Brian Stewart said. \u201cThe odds are going to go up that something\u2019s going to happen the more you play, obviously. Whether this would have happened or not, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s kind of a freak injury. I initially thought it was her ACL. Now I\u2019m kind of wishing it was. Honestly, who knows? Wear and tear, long-term, is definitely going to be a factor for somebody like Bre. Unfortunately, since probably eight or nine years ago, this is going to be the longest break, by far, she\u2019s ever had. Kind of forced.

Between dual-harmony guitars and punky rhythms, he confesses to dwelling on \u201cmorbid stuff\u201d on the title track; he wishes death on somebody in \u201cSee You at Your Funeral\u201d; and he sings about feeling like a failure on the country-ish \u201cScorpion Hill.\u201d All this might make the album sound like a bit of a buzzkill, but he and the rest of PUP keep the music lively enough \u2014 occasionally recalling bands like Cursive, Say Anything and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists \u2014 that it\u2019s never as dreary as Babcock\u2019s lyrics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process of self-discovery for me,\u201d the frontman says. \u201cPlaying super-fun, rowdy, high energy songs about miserable shit is really a cathartic, productive, fun way to deal with all these negative emotions. It\u2019s great to have an outlet of angst and aggression and it\u2019s also four best friends having fun. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\nIt\u2019s early in the morning in Vancouver, where PUP will be playing a gig later that night, but he and guitarist Steve Sladkowski are wide awake, thanks to a 4:45 a.m. flight. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be getting on an airplane just to go and play gigs,\u201d Sladkowski says. The band has had a few years now to become accustomed to the touring life, as they\u2019ve built a steady following since forming in 2010. PUP, whose name is a self-deprecating acronym for \u201cPathetic Use of Potential,\u201d have previously released two well-received albums of frenetic, punkish indie rock \u2014 2013\u2019s PUP and 2016\u2019s The Dream Is Over \u2014 and have toured North America, the U.K. and Australia, among other places, signaling a gradual ascent.\nThat level of success has made Babcock somewhat uneasy: Although he knows he should be enjoying it, he says, his mood disorder often makes that difficult for him. \u201cI can objectively look at this band and what were doing and feel good about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that kind of adds to my anxiety of being depressed. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be feeling that way, because there\u2019s no reason to be.\u201d\nHe\u2019s tried therapy to mixed results and has started feeling more stable thanks to medication. Although he estimates he mentions drinking and taking drugs \u201ca couple of times on every record,\u201d he says drinking to excess is no longer a part of the PUP routine. Sladkowski offers that in the past the group used to drink until they passed out \u201cwhen we were sleeping on some stranger\u2019s floor\u201d but that they\u2019ve welcomed more stability into their lives. \u201cMaybe you can say I do the correct drugs, as well, and not the bad drugs,\u201d Babcock says with a laugh. \u201cOnly the good drugs.\u201d\nDespite the somewhat brighter outlook and push toward mental health (the band is donating a dollar from every ticket on their current tour to the Trevor Project, which provides crisis-intervention counseling for LGBTQ youth) Babcock still feels most comfortable pouring all his despair into PUP\u2019s songs. Even the supposedly romantic ones.\n\u201c\u2018Kids\u2019 is the first love song I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d he says, referring to the bouncy Morbid Stuff tune that opens with him saying he\u2019s been \u201cnavigating my way through the mind-numbing reality of a godless existence.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a very nihilistic person, in case you haven\u2019t figured that out. My partner\u2019s the same way. I\u2019m so lucky to have her in my life, but at the same time, my sense of humor and her sense of humor is so bleak that the way that I can express my love through a song to her is by talking about how fucking dogshit the world is and how she has made it slightly less dogshitty for me. You know, I don\u2019t know how she really feels about the song or my description of it. \u2026 I\u2019m sure she thinks it\u2019s stupid as fuck.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been thrown out on the street yet, so I think you\u2019re all right,\u201d Sladkowski offers.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing all right,\u201d Babcock says. \u201cEven if I throw a little barb towards her once in a while, she knows that 90 percent of this record is just me ripping on myself. So it makes it a little better.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "McKinnon performed in most of the episode\u2019s sketches, delivering sharp-toothed impressions including Joy Behar and the Queen of England, but her Loughlin fell flat. Dressed in a brown suit similar to the one Loughlin wore to her court appearance, McKinnon could do no more than look the part. But her trouble characterizing Loughlin perhaps spoke more to the actress\u2019s nondescript persona. After all, how do you intriguingly impersonate a woman mostly known for her anodyne TV roles, like lovable Aunt Becky on Full House and her more recent part as the bland but firm Abigail Stanton on Hallmark\u2019s frontier series, When Calls the Heart?\nMcKinnon\u2019s version strained to frame those roles as an explanation for Loughlin\u2019s alleged participation in the cockamamie cheating scheme. Upon being told that she wouldn\u2019t last long in prison, Loughlin laughed and pointed to her career with the Hallmark channel. \u201cI have seen hell, man,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in half those Hallmark movies, I marry Santa\u2019s son. I have lost all sense of reality.\u201d\nHad the cold open drawn to a close after that bit, the scene would\u2019ve been one of the weaker but still pointed moments of a disjointed episode. (Much of the audience was eagerly waiting for the globally beloved South Korean boy band BTS to make its SNL debut as the musical guest; repeated references to the group throughout the episode\u2019s mostly insipid sketches drew the wildest cheers of the night.) But then SNL also brought out Assange and Avenatti, squeezing more characters into a premise that hinged on a setting rather than an actual point. SNL\u2019s writers never managed to deepen the sketch\u2019s superficial commentary about contemporary criminality, and the distinctions between financial, cyber-, and violent offenses.\nTo the show\u2019s credit, the cold open did use its cast members to full effect instead of relying so heavily on outside talent. Keaton\u2019s smaller guest appearance marked a welcome shift away from Alec Baldwin\u2019s Donald Trump and Robert De Niro\u2019s Mueller, both of which have been SNL regulars of late. But Keaton, too, struggled to depict Assange in a way that didn\u2019t equivocate his alleged crimes. Battling Davidson\u2019s Avenatti and McKinnon\u2019s Loughlin for the title of craziest new prisoner, he said, \u201cYeah, you cheat your schools and you rob your companies; that\u2019s cute. It is. I\u2019ve attacked the U.S. military, bitches, because I\u2019m an actual James Bond super villain, and I\u2019m one step away from destroying the goddamn moon.\u201d That bloviating speech\u2014along with the show\u2019s fixation on the rumors that Assange wiped his fecal matter on the Ecuadorian embassy\u2019s walls\u2014won the half-hearted power struggle. In a confusing twist, though, the sketch ended by cutting to the incarcerated rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine (played by Melissa Villase\u00f1or) for no apparent reason other than to use him as an ambiguous foil for the other celebrity prisoners.\nThe news cycle of late seems to turn over rocks that reveal not just bad but utterly ludicrous behavior. In trying to cram the latest headlines into a single sketch that boiled down to \u201cfamous people accused of doing bad things,\u201d SNL wasted the punch-line gold it had been handed.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{"text": "It is a well-known fact that commodities have not kept up with inflation.\nWith the price of a tonne of wheat at around \u00a3120 in 1995, this would equate to \u00a3225 a tonne in real terms today. Based on this year\u2019s harvest wheat prices, farmers are achieving around \u00a375 less per tonne than they might expect, despite the increase in the input costs over the years.\nAlthough there are years which suggest prices are increasing, any spikes tend to result in an increase in production the following year and therefore a subsequent reduction in price.\nUnlike commodities, most inputs rise with inflation, or above inflation which therefore squeezes the profitability of a farming business. The recent adverse exchange rate movements also have an impact on imports, something which farmers can find hard to mitigate, especially with the pricing power of large multinationals.\nIt is not only inflation on costs which affect farming businesses and their profitability.\nIncreasing regulations often take both substantial time and money to ensure businesses are compliant.\nRecent examples include the introduction of Making Tax Digital this month for VAT return submissions, and the increase in pension contributions for auto-enrolment.\nThese affect the bottom line of a business.\nThe annual increase in the National Minimum Wage, and now the National Living Wage, will also put pressure on farming businesses especially labour intensive enterprises such as vegetables and soft fruit, where labour is already in short supply.\nFarming is like very few other industries where sales proceeds are largely unknown at time of production and the farming business has little option other than to be a price taker.\nTherefore, how can profitability be managed when the cost of inputs increase faster than the prices being achieved?\nOver the years, many farming businesses have reduced their overheads, which means there are often few areas where further savings can be made. Therefore, some expand their business to try to achieve savings through economies of scale.\nOther businesses try to find a niche market and develop this with the hope of achieving an additional income stream of higher margin. This can be achieved through diversification or by focusing on a part of the business where there are opportunities to either use existing produce or space, or using a by-product.\nIn the current climate, there are a number of opportunities for farmers to work together through the joint purchase of machinery, through providing assistance at busy farming times or entering into formal contract farming arrangements.\nA busy time in one farm may not be the same as the next. Agricultural businesses should take advantage of these opportunities and working through cooperation can save money, streamline operations and also maintain working relationships in farming communities.\nThere is no easy answer to the question of how to improve profitability. The agricultural industry cannot afford to be complacent with commodity price inflation continually trailing behind that of input costs.\nWith the likely reduction in subsidies, farming is going to continue to be put under pressure through the rise in costs and regulations.\nThe best advice is therefore to plan ahead, make changes which are within your control and be ready to react to changes which occur.\nSarah Millar is manager in the Forfar office of EQ Accountants LLP\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A variety of semi-automatic rifles. (Damian Dovarganes, Associated Press)\n(CN) \u2013 Rejecting a challenge by the Czech Republic, a magistrate judge urged Europe\u2019s top court Thursday to uphold a law banning the use of semiautomatic weapons by civilians, among other gun restrictions.\nThe European Commission began working on the legislation following a series of attacks in 2015 that left 120 people dead in Paris, France, as well several more deaths in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nAfter the directive took effect in 2017, Czech Republic applied to have the European Court of Justice annul it on multiple fronts. Hungary and Poland later intervened to support the challenge.\nIn particular, the countries took issue with the failure of EU lawmakers to conduct an impact assessment and the fact that the new law bars semiautomatic weapons that were not used in the 2015 attacks.\nAdvocate General Eleanor Sharpston recommended nixing the challenge Thursday, saying that the legislation should not have been left to the authorities of individual member states.\n\u201cIt seems to me that, given that context, divergent national measures would have impeded the free circulation of goods,\u201d Sharpston wrote. \u201cThe EU legislature had to act in order to adjust, at EU level, the balance being struck between free movement of goods and public safety. Moreover, precisely because Directive 2017/853 further harmonizes controls on firearms, it adds to the provisions promoting mutual confidence between member states contained in Directive 91/477 and thereby reduces the need for member states to act individually.\u201d\nPoland tried to make the case that firearms do not qualify as dangerous goods, but the magistrate determined otherwise.\n\u201cFirst (an obvious point): firearms are intrinsically dangerous goods,\u201d she wrote (parentheses in original). They give rise to safety concerns not only for their users but for the wider public. That is why the legislature has introduced marking and authorization obligations together with provisions that restrict the possession and acquisition of such weapons. Directive 2017/853 principally contains classic measures used to promote the establishment of the internal market in circumstances where it is necessary to place restrictions on a product (because safety is an issue) to avoid the establishment of border controls and to promote the free circulation of goods and persons. It follows that I emphatically reject Poland\u2019s submission that firearms are not dangerous goods for the purposes of EU law.\u201d\nAs for the law\u2019s proportionality, Sharpston said that the failure to conduct an impact assessment does not doom the legislation.\nSharpston called it \u201cperfectly true that impact assessments are an important and useful tool,\u201d but determined that a 2016 EU agreement on better lawmaking never uses the words \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d when referring to these tools.\n\u201cSuch an absolute construction of the Interinstitutional Agreement would be an unjustified fetter on the discretion conferred on the legislature under the Treaties,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt would make it impossible to take legislative action even where the circumstances clearly demonstrate the need for urgent action. I add, for good measure, that the court has already ruled that an impact assessment is not binding on either the Parliament or the Council.\u201d\nThe Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice will now begin its own proceedings in the case. Sharpston\u2019s opinion is not binding.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "After CEO Tim Sloan's abrupt departure from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) last month, the company announced that it would search for a replacement externally, to the delight of many investors and regulators.\nHowever, Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), doesn't think that focusing on external candidates will be enough. He believes that candidates with a certain type of financial industry background would do little to change regulators' opinions of the bank's cultural issues.\nWhat Buffett thinks Wells Fargo should do\nWhen a big bank or Wall Street firm is looking for a new CEO, it typically does one of two things. It either hires one of the company's existing executives -- like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently did with David Solomon -- or it hires an executive from a competitor.\nIn Wells Fargo's case, the first option is out. The bank has already said that it's only going to pursue external candidates. But Buffett doesn't think the second standard option would be a smart way to go, either, especially if the competitor is one of the Wall Street investment banks.\nIn an interview this week with The Financial Times, Buffett said that regulators and key players in Congress wouldn't be happy if Wells Fargo hired another Wall Street executive. \"They probably shouldn't come from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) or Goldman Sachs,\" he said.\nTo be clear, Buffett isn't advising Wells Fargo to avoid all banking executives. After all, Wells Fargo shareholders (of which Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are the largest, with a nearly 10% stake) should want the next CEO to have a great deal of banking experience. For example, a former CEO of a large bank that isn't Wall Street-based could still be a good idea.\nWells Fargo's biggest issue, and how Buffett's advice would help\nAt this stage of the recovery from the scandals of the past few years, Wells Fargo's top priority should be to convince regulators that it has made enough changes to ensure the past won't repeat itself.\nWells Fargo has clearly made some pretty big cultural changes, including getting rid of sales-based incentives for branch employees. In the minds of many regulators, however, the biggest lingering problem was that some of the executives that were in charge during the scandals were still there. And not only that, but the president and COO at the time, Tim Sloan, had been \"rewarded\" with the CEO job back in 2016 after the former leader stepped down in the wake of the fake-accounts scandal.\nNow that Sloan is gone, a new CEO could be just what Wells Fargo needs to move on, especially in the all-important eyes of regulators. For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, personally requested that the Federal Reserve continue to restrict Wells Fargo's growth until Sloan was gone. And bank employees recently told Fed officials that Sloan's efforts hadn't transformed the bank's culture nearly as much as he had claimed.\nHowever, a new external CEO might not be enough to satisfy everyone, especially if it's another Wall Street veteran, whom many in power (like Warren) see as part of the problem, not part of the solution. Wells Fargo can't truly move on until it's allowed to grow, and it needs the Federal Reserve's permission to start trying to grow again. Buffett may be right: A banking veteran who doesn't come from Wall Street could be the right person for the job.\nThe big question\nWill Wells Fargo listen to Buffett? That's the billion-dollar question. While Wells Fargo hasn't publicly named any CEO candidates yet, the rumored short list includes former Goldman Sachs executives Gary Cohn and Harvey Schwartz (both deny interest in the job), as well as JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake. In a nutshell, Buffett is hoping Wells Fargo doesn't hire any of the three.\nThere are also some names from outside Wall Street who have been rumored as candidates, such as former U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) head Richard Davis. Wells Fargo has refused to comment on any of the rumors.\nBuffett continues to believe in Wells Fargo's business, saying that the scandals really haven't cost the bank a significant number of customers. However, being unable to grow in what's arguably the best growth environment for banks in decades isn't exactly what an investor likes to see. Buffett could be right: To really move on, Wells Fargo may need to steer clear of Wall Street.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Lanxess attracted even Berkshire Hathaway in 2017 and we can now buy it at a much lower price.\nOverview\nLanxess (OTCPK:LNXSF) (ADR ticker OTC:LNXSY) is a German specialty chemicals manufacturer with a EUR 6B EV, based in Cologne. Last year, as the German automotive sector tanked due to its dependence on the weak Chinese consumer market, the WLTP issues, the trade war and tariff threats, it dragged down the German chemicals sector as well that traditionally is highly intertwined with the large automotive industry. In addition, an unusually dry summer caused an extremely low level of the river Rhine, along which most German chemical industries are located, profiting from a safe and cheap way to ship its products down to the North Sea. Given the low level of the river, more product needed to be trucked, causing higher expenses. Moreover, Brexit caused another logistics headache and a substantial build-up of working capital. Finally, the anticipation of a global slowdown made a highly cyclical sector like the chemical industry a very unpopular investment.\nLanxess' market cap roughly halved during this sell-off, despite being the only major German chemicals manufacturer that actually met its guidance. It excellently managed the low Rhine issue without suffering any meaningful loss. After selling out of its Arlanxeo JV, it has drastically reduced its reliance on the automotive industry. Finally, thanks to a large transformation process, it has actually a lot of levers to pull to compensate for lower growth and increase earnings even in a sluggish environment. So this baby was thrown out with the bath water, as you will see in more detail below.\nDespite being much less affected by last year's issues than many of its peers, Lanxess is trading for just 6x EBITDA pre-exceptionals (its key measure of profitability). If it traded for a similar multiple as its larger German peer BASF (OTCQX:BASFY), its stock would go up 45% immediately. Over the longer term, the upside is even better, as we will see below.\nA potential catalyst could be a major acquisition. Lanxess' CEO has demonstrated to be a smart capital allocator with a value investor mindset and made sure he would enter a potential downturn with a strong balance sheet and plenty of dry powder. Moreover, Lanxess could profit from the sale of hidden assets (see Currenta below) and/or reap a windfall profit from its recently announced lithium extraction JV with Standard Lithium. If any of these three happened, the market would likely appreciate how different and how much safer the Lanxess story actually is compared to the broad chemicals sector.\nYou can find a quick overview in this company factbook. An overview of basic financial ratios can be found here:\n(Source)\nEBITDA pre-exceptionals (or simply \"EBITDA pre\") is Lanxess' key measure for profitability, as sales are often influenced by volatile raw material prices.\n(Source: 2018 annual report)\nImportantly, the exceptional items excluded from EBITDA pre have shrunk to almost nothing in the most recent quarter and the company guided to an even smaller impact in 2019, which increases earnings quality, effective cash flows and validates the exceptional nature of the items excluded in previous years.\nSome history and perspective\nIn 2004, Lanxess was spun out of Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY), the German chemicals and pharma giant. It initially focused on specialty rubber production, increased its debt to expand its business there and was later hit by the declining oil price, while the global specialty rubber production overcapacity lead to sharply declining sales prices. In 2014, Matthias Zachert, the current CEO, came in and started a total transformation of the company.\nZachert had already been CFO at Bayer and Lanxess before and knows the company very well. He immediately made sure Lanxess got an investment grade balance sheet to lower its cost of capital (8.5m shares issued at EUR 52, by pure coincidence very close to today's price), took out EUR 150m of costs, started another restructuring plan aiming at further EUR 150m savings within 2019 from the closing of underperforming plants and refocused Lanxess' portfolio on high-value-added specialty chemicals.\n(Source: 2018 annual report)\nIn 2016 Chemours\u2019 (CC) Clean and Disinfect business was acquired for about EUR 210m (~10x EBITDA), with EUR 10m of synergies expected by 2020. In 2017, Lanxess acquired the U.S. company Chemtura for ~EUR 2.4B (~10x EBITDA). Chemtura immediately transformed Lanxess into one of the largest global providers of flame retardant and lubricant additives. Expected synergies by 2020 are ~EUR 100m and have so far been realized ahead of plan. Chemtura will also further expand Lanxess' footprint into faster-growing North America and Asia Pacific markets and further diversify Lanxess\u2019 end market customer industries.\nThe mid-sized specialty chemicals markets are much less competitive and products are often tailor-made for customers. The customer base is highly fragmented, chemicals costs are only a tiny fraction of the customer's total production costs, there are relatively low variable costs once the production plant is set up and R&D is done, so that incremental margins are high. Pricing power is better, margins are higher. By creating a more balanced portfolio, Zachert wants to make sure Lanxess becomes less dependent on economic cycles, which in itself should lead to a multiple expansion.\nSo far the results of the transformation have been the following:\n(Source: 2018 annual report)\nMargins and EBITDA pre increased, while ROCE grew substantially.\nWhile the market reacted euphorically when Zachert became CEO and certainly priced in a quite optimistic view, the new leadership has consistently overdelivered.\nLanxess has set a 2021 target of achieving EBITDA pre-exceptional margins of 14-18% across business cycles. This would indicate further improvements from here.\nFurther growth is likely for a few simple reasons:\nManagement has earned strong credibility and is targeting further cost synergies coupled with organic and inorganic growth.\nLanxess has yet to reap the full benefits from the Chemtura acquisition.\nLanxess recently completely disposed of its remaining 50% JV stake in Arlanxeo (a synthetic rubber producer), with net cash proceeds of EUR 1.4B. This reduced net leverage to about 1.4x EBITDA pre and significantly increased financial flexibility for potential M&A.\nWithout Arlanxeo, Lanxess' KPIs will improve immediately: Company presentation)\nCompany presentation) Already at the end of 2017, Lanxess had announced EUR 400m of investments in organic growth until 2020. These will add to earnings over time.\nSharply reduced dependence on the highly cyclical automotive sector.\nBrexit preparations and an exceptionally low level of the river Rhine caused severe logistics headaches and a working capital increase in 2018. These issues likely won't repeat in 2019 and beyond and enable better cash conversion.\nOngoing 5% share buyback program.\nBayer will sell its 60% stake in the Currenta JV it owns together with Lanxess (40% owner). The JV is said to be worth between EUR 1B and over EUR 2B. If Lanxess sells out, too, it will get between EUR 400m and EUR 800m of cash (~10-20% of its market cap). If not, the market might still appreciate the additional margin of safety provided by this asset which is carried at zero value on Lanxess' balance sheet.\nAccording to Zachert, it takes 10 years to change a company and hence there are 5 years to go.\nSince in its El Dorado, Arkansas, mine there is not only the bromine it originally expected to extract, but also lithium, Lanxess has partnered with Standard Lithium to extract the metal. Lithium is obviously important for battery technology. (However, there won't be any profits from a potential JV before 2020.)\nValuation\nThere can be little doubt that the 10x multiple paid for Chemtura and Chemours would be appropriate for Lanxess as well as a private market valuation, especially given the strong management, highly credible growth targets and already achieved successes. The company has a strong balance sheet and even on a more traditional metric is trading for an undemanding P/E valuation of 14x. On an EV/EBITDA pre basis it trades for just 6x.\nThe far larger and slower growing BASF is trading for an EV of EUR 80B, corresponding to 8.2 x EBITDA (2019e) of EUR 9.7B and its share price corresponds to 14 times EPS (2019e) of EUR 4.79.\nSo the market is attributing a lower multiple to Lanxess than to BASF, despite the former's much better growth profile and the high likelihood of a future in closer proximity to other highly diversified specialty chemicals manufacturers (which usually trade at premium multiples - see Croda (OTCPK:COIHY) or Fuchs (OTC:FUPEY).\nEV/EBITDA Multiple (2019e) Lanxess 6.2 BASF 8.2 Chemtura acquisition 10 Chemours Clean and Disinfect acquisition 10 Fuchs Petrolub 11.1 Croda 16.6\n(Source: Author, based on company data)\nInvestors can now buy into the story at the same price as at the beginning of the transformation (when shares were issued at today's price), but with the benefit of the certainties and insights into the soundness of Mr. Zachert's strategy gained in the meantime.\nThe following matrix shows the resulting share prices in EUR and returns (from today's share price of EUR 52) for different 2020 projections of EBITDA pre in EUR millions and different multiples. I assume constant net debt of EUR 1.4B and constant shares outstanding (despite the ongoing buyback program). Dividends are not factored in, although Lanxess currently yields about 2%. Only modest growth and a small multiple expansion will produce excellent returns:\n(Source: Author)\nIf Lanxess traded at the same EBITDA multiple as BASF, its stock would cost EUR 74 today (45% upside, based on EBITDA pre of EUR 1,000). With modest growth next year (on a per-share basis almost certain thanks to buybacks) and a full valuation of 10x, we get 102% upside (based on EBITDA pre of EUR 1,100).\nHowever, the risk/reward balance becomes even more interesting over the longer term. The following matrix shows the expected returns until 2023:\n(Source: Author)\nIf 2023 EBITDA was not much different from the start of the journey (and lower than today's), i.e. around EUR 900m, we would incur a total loss of just ~EUR 4/share or 8% (after adding ~EUR 4 of dividends). This alone highlights how bearish the market has become on Lanxess, despite the transformation being perfectly on track and management continuing to deliver 100% on its guidance.\nFar more likely is some further growth and a modest multiple expansion: In this case we would get at least decent returns with potentially even excellent returns with a greater multiple expansion. E.g., if the next 4 years produced only 10% total EBITDA growth to EUR 1,100, together with a still low 7x multiple, our total return would already be ~40% (including dividends).\nOverall, the risk/reward is very compelling. Therefore, I believe the company is far too cheap at its current valuation and established a long-term position during the sell-off late last year to profit from profitability and predictability improvements over time. Lanxess should experience a multiple expansion coupled with at least decent earnings growth over the next few years and stock returns will follow.\nThe Lanxess story has attracted even Berkshire Hathaway that holds 5% of the company. The stake was accumulated in two steps: The first 3% before the end of May 2017 and the second 2% between June and December 2017, i.e. likely always at prices above EUR 60 at the very least (~19% higher than today).\nRisks\n1) My thesis mainly depends on a multiple expansion, which can happen - or not.\nThe shift towards a more diversified portfolio should lead to more predictable earnings over time and, probably, a higher multiple. However, there is no guarantee.\n2) You may need to be patient.\nLanxess' transformation and smart diversification strategy has sharply reduced its reliance on any particular sector. However, this will likely be appreciated only over time by the market, as earnings demonstrate lower volatility. If the general market tanks, I fully expect Lanxess to tank as well. The German stock market is considered to be highly cyclical and mostly fuelled by foreign investors who tend to jump in with both feet during economic upswings, but also sell out regardless of fundamentals when macro headwinds loom.\nHowever, any significant price slump would likely trigger significant buybacks and thus benefit long-term shareholders.\n3) Lower market multiples could enable M&A, although acquisitions can become a disaster.\nSo far Zachert has done great, but next time could be different.\n4) Lanxess might not sell its Currenta stake and after all there might not be any meaningful earnings from the lithium extraction JV.\nThis would remove potential catalysts for share price gains. So, again, patience may be required.\n5) A large pension deficit.\nLike many old, large employers, Bayer carries a burden of legacy defined benefit pension plan and the spun off Lanxess has take its share of it. Especially in the past few years the low-interest rate environment impacted return assumptions of pension assets and led to additional payment obligations which consumed cash. While still a risk going forward, in the near term further strong interest rate declines across the globe are unlikely, so that some of the liability might even disappear with rising interest rates.\n(Source: 2018 annual report)\nWhen Lanxess authorized its EUR 200m share buyback, the company also reduced its pension deficit by EUR 200m. This was the right thing to do, as investors will be more inclined to pay a higher multiple with a lowered pension risk. - In any case, this liability is something to keep an eye on.\nAside from these issues, I see very little fundamental risks with Lanxess. So if you are able and willing to wait, Zachert's strategy will continue to transform the company into a more stable, more predictable and valuable asset.\nAs far as the potential downside is concerned, as my tables above have shown, we barely need the company to trade for a depressed multiple below its peer group and only constant EBITDA to break even over the long term. Since management so far hasn't shown any sign of weakness, I think the pessimism is far overdone. I would obviously reconsider my thesis if Zachert did some stupid acquisition or squandered money on projects with unattractive returns.\nThe Lanxess journey has just started If you want to continue following the story, full and timely coverage of Lanxess and much more detail can be found in my subscriber service Stability & Opportunity.

{"text": "\u00d7 Prostate cancer diagnoses and deaths decreasing worldwide, study says\nProstate cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer for men in the United States and worldwide, is on the decline, according to new research.\nResearchers looked at World Health Organization data from five continents from 1980 to 2012 and saw an encouraging trend. In most parts of the world, the rate of men diagnosed with and dying of prostate cancer decreased or stabilized, according to the study, presented Tuesday at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Atlanta.\nA walnut-shaped gland under the bladder, the prostate secretes seminal fluid, which provides nutrition for and allows the transport of sperm.\nDr. Alex Krist, vice chairman of the US Preventive Services Task Force and professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University, who was not involved in the study, explained that prostate cancer \u201cis one of the most common cancers that affects men. Usually, prostate cancer grows slowly.\u201d\nThe survival rate of patients with prostate cancer depends on factors such as how far it has spread.\nThe new study notes that prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer diagnoses and sixth most common cause of death from cancer among men worldwide. The authors also note that, since 2012, prostate cancer has led male cancer incidence, or new diagnoses, in 96 countries, and it is the most common cause of death among men in 51 countries.\n\u201cBy comparing rates from different countries, we can assess differences in detection practices and improvements in treatment,\u201d MaryBeth Freeman, lead study author and senior associate scientist of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said in a statement. \u201cPrevious studies have indicated significant variation in prostate cancer rates, due to factors including detection practices, availability of treatment, and genetic factors.\u201d\nProstate cancer diagnosis rates decreased in seven countries from 2008 to 2012, and 33 countries showed a stabilization in diagnosis rates, the study found. From 2008 to 2012, the United States had the greatest decrease in the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer.\nFreeman and her colleagues found these results encouraging and believe that the research supports the use of prostate-specific antigen screening.\nThis test was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1986 to monitor prostate cancer, and Freeman says its increased use resulted in a decline in diagnoses from the 2000s to 2015. In low-income countries, where screening is less available, later diagnoses and increased mortality rates are more common, she noted.\nCountries with the most cases of prostate cancer from 2008 to 2012 were Brazil, Lithuania, and Australia. The highest mortality rates from prostate cancer included Caribbean countries such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Cuba as well as South Africa, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.\nAlthough prostate-specific antigen screening has revolutionized prostate cancer management, it is not perfect. There is a risk of overdiagnoses and overtreatment.\n\u201cThe current recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force say that the decision of whether or not to screen for prostate cancer in men ages 55 to 69 should be an individual one, made only after a discussion of the benefits and harms with their doctor,\u201d Krist said. \u201cMen age 70 and above should not be screened for prostate cancer, as the harms outweigh the benefits for this age group.\u201d\nWhile Freeman acknowledges limitations in the scope of the data and how it was collected, she argues that overall, the research provides a more comprehensive look at prostate cancer globally.\n\u201cFurther studies should monitor trends in mortality rates and late-stage disease to assess the impact of reduction in [prostate-specific antigen] testing in several countries,\u201d she said.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Members of the business community filed two prospective ballot measures Thursday that would aim to rein in the runaway costs of Oregon\u2019s public pension system by transferring some of that cost to employees.\nThe first potential ballot measure would give new hires the option of a 401(k)-style retirement plan financed by matching contributions of 6% of salary each by employees and their employers. New hires could choose that plan or the pension system -- but not both, as employees get today. And moving forward, all employees participating in the pension plan would contribute 6% of their salary toward the cost of future benefits, starting July 1, 2021.\nThe second initiative would require the Legislature to study a new 401(k) style retirement plan for new hires and submit recommendations to implement it by 2022. Meanwhile it would require existing and new employees to pay one-third the cost of their pension benefits moving forward, which would range between 2.8% and 6% of pay depending on their job classification and membership tier.\nFormer Gov. Ted Kulongoski and Chris Telfer, a former Republican legislator from Bend, are the initiatives\u2019 chief petitioners. Telfer consistently advocated for pension reform during her tenure and during campaigns for state treasurer. Kulongoski unsuccessfully defended the last PERS reform ballot measure passed by voters in 1994 when he was attorney general, then helped pass the last significant round of changes to the pension system in 2003, when he was governor.\n\u201cThis is not a short-term issue,\u201d Kulongoski said Thursday. \u201cFor the next 20 years, this will eat at state government finances unless this issue is dealt with. If nothing else, I\u2019m hoping the legislature starts looking at this much more seriously than they have.\u201d\nThe policy heft behind the initiatives comes from the Oregon Business Council and its offshoot, PERS Solutions for Public Services. The council has consistently but unsuccessfully lobbied the Legislature for years to include pension reform in the annual discussion over raising corporate taxes, and has produced a policy playbook including various pension changes for the annual Oregon Leadership Summit.\nFor now, the initiatives serve mostly as negotiating leverage in a legislative session where Democrats are eager to pass new corporate taxes to fund schools. But they have yet to detail how they will ensure that money makes it into the classroom, and not simply to pay for the rapidly escalating pension costs hitting schools and other public employers across the state.\nThe handful of PERS reforms bills in the Legislature this session died at the first hearing deadline last week, but the concepts could be resurrected in end of session bargaining over new revenues.\nTim Nesbitt, a former labor leader who has consulted for the Oregon Business Council on pension reform for years, said it would require a far broader coalition than the business community to pass a ballot measure with meaningful changes to PERS. But he said filing the initiatives was not simply a feint to push for more action at the Capitol.\n\u201cIf the legislature doesn\u2019t act this year, it would be on the ballot for the 2020 general election,\u201d Nesbitt said. \u201cBy then, schools and other employers will be staring at another big PERS cost increase. This only gets worse. It intensifies to crisis proportions, whether we\u2019re there already or will be\u201d in the next few years.\nThe groups are shopping two ballot measures but would likely run only one, perhaps with a combination of elements from both, Nesbitt said. To qualify for the November 2020 election ballot, initiatives sponsors would need to collect 112,020 signatures from Oregon voters by July 2, 2020.\nNeither ballot measure, as proposed, would accelerate the paydown of the $27 billion unfunded liability in the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund. But they would ease the budget impact of the system\u2019s increasing costs for schools and public agencies by transferring more of the bill for future benefits to employees.\nThe backers suggest that for employers, the first measure would cut projected increases in pension costs by one half. They say the second measure would cut future pension cost increases by one-third.\nEmployees, meanwhile, would see a cut in their total compensation and their total retirement benefits as the state replaced its current hybrid system, in which employees get both a pension and 401(k) style plan.\nInfluential Democrats on the Ways and Means Capital Construction subcommittee, which has been holding informational hearings on PERS financing, have already expressed opposition to a 401(k), and skepticism that it would actually lower the state\u2019s costs.\nHouse Speaker Tina Kotek said at a committee meeting last week that one of the themes the Legislature had promoted in the last several years was retirement security. She said moving from a defined benefit plan, where the state absorbs all the risk, to a defined contribution plan, where the risk is transferred to employees, was not consistent with that.\n\u201cWhile people might think it\u2019s a good idea, the idea of going away from (the pension) to something that is less secure in terms of retirement is a problem for me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I don\u2019t see the types of dollars that could solve our bigger problem\u2026I worry about it.\u201d\nThere is still little analysis so far on the pros and cons of moving to a 401(k). While the contributions are set up front, public employers would still be on the hook for the unfunded liabilities already accrued in the traditional pension plan. And as more new employees moved out of the pension and into the 401(k), the payroll base being taxed to support the pension would shrink, making it more difficult to fund.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if their goal is to cut benefits for people who go to work for the state every day, or if it\u2019s to solve the problem we have,\u201d said Melissa Unger, executive director of the SEIU Local 503, Oregon\u2019s largest public sector union. \u201cBecause this doesn\u2019t solve the problem our state faces around the unfunded liability.\nUnger also said the business community is making a lot of assumptions about Oregonians\u2019 support for cutting public employee compensation.\n\u201cVoters don\u2019t see their role as cutting their neighbors\u2019 retirement benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cIn every poll we\u2019ve done, every focus group we\u2019ve done, they believe there may have been big commitments made in the past, but they don\u2019t think public employees are overpaid today.\u201d\nA pension ballot measure could be an expensive campaign to wage, one that would run into deep opposition from unions. Unlike a fight over corporate taxation, it\u2019s not immediately clear what deep-pocketed constituency would emerge to fund it, and what public and private sector organizations might eventually join a coalition.\nThe state\u2019s largest business group, Oregon Business & Industry, issued a news release Thursday calling the initiatives \u201can important step forward in the statewide conversation on how we should finally address the pressing PERS problem, which has been draining the budgets of school districts, local government and the state for decades.\u201d\nAnother new business organization run by former Tualatin Mayor Lou Ogden and former state representative Julie Parrish, Unified Business Oregon, said they also supported the new ballot measures.\n\"Our organization applauds Governor Kulongoski and Senator Telfer for stepping up to lead on PERS reforms,\" said Ogden. \"They too have set aside party differences to come together to do what's right for all Oregonians, and we'll be there to help.\"\nParrish is a co-sponsor of another ballot measure that would create a constitutional provision against any state or government entity from borrowing to pay pension obligations, forcing them to meet their obligations out of current funding rather than kicking the problem down the road. She said either of the two ballot measures filed Thursday would make a good companion to her own petition.\nKulongoski said he doesn\u2019t think the backing is there yet for a successful campaign, and that would require a significant expansion of the coalition. He says some things haven\u2019t changed since he was pushing for pension changes in 2003, such as the political risks of legislators sticking their necks out on PERS reform, even when they know something needs to be done.\n\u201cI bet over half the legislators agree with what we\u2019re doing but don\u2019t want to come out and say it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the same dynamic that was in effect in 2003.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s different, he suggests, is the legal environment. The Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Moro vs the state of Oregon affirmed employers\u2019 ability to change pension benefits prospectively, for future service, but said modifying benefits that have already been accrued for past service was an illegal breach of contract.\nKulongoski said that if the Moro decision had been in place in 1994, when Oregon voters passed Measure 8, many of the system\u2019s reforms \u201cwould not have been overturned and we wouldn\u2019t be in this position today.\u201d\nIn the meantime, he says he\u2019s still waiting for current lawmakers to act.\n\u201cI thought there was a clear direction the court said we could take with future reform work,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised there\u2019s been such a lag time and nothing has gotten done.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

Get your 14 day free trial >\nWHAT DOES AUSTRALIA\u2019S WORLD CUP XI LOOK LIKE?\nWith the puzzle of the 15-man squad solved, the attention now turns to what Australia\u2019s favoured XI will be at the World Cup.\nGiven the blistering form of Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja and David Warner, it appears selectors will try find a way to fit all three into the top-order.\nFinch and Warner have never played at No.3, whereas Khawaja has at ODI level 10 times. He\u2019s also a regular there in the Test arena.\nHis ODI numbers at first-drop leave plenty to be desired though; an average of 24.33 compared to 52.96 as an ODI opener. Although, he\u2019s never struck this sort of 50-over form before, so selectors would hope he\u2019s a better chance to carry it to No.3 this time around.\nIf not, then Finch is arguably the next best option to slide down a spot. He\u2019s been troubled in recent times by the swinging new ball, so there could be some merit in delaying his arrival at the crease, especially in England. That would, however, break up the left-right hand opening combination Finch helps create though.\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Australia\u2019s forgotten man and the cruellest snub of all\nDUMPED: Contract blow caps horror six months for Marsh\nGOING TO ENGLAND: Pucovski, Wade given Ashes lifeline\nCamera Icon Given the blistering form of Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja and David Warner, it appears selectors will try find a way to fit all three into the top-order. Picture: AFP\nAll three being selected assumes Steve Smith will bat lower than No.3, where he has played the most and has been at his best in ODI cricket. He averages 52.59 at first-drop compared to 35.60 at No.4.\nShaun Marsh, however, thrives at No.4 with an average of 48.33. He also scored two centuries in England last year and averaged 60.66 in his last ODI tour, which came against Pakistan in the UAE.\nIt would appear selectors would struggle to go wrong when selecting its top-order.\nNonetheless, given his standing as possibly Australia\u2019s best batsman since Bradman, Smith is widely expected to return to the XI in any event. That would likely push Marsh out.\nThere won\u2019t be a second entry into the XI at No.5 either - that spot belongs to the team\u2019s X-factor, Glenn Maxwell.\nFew batsmen in world cricket can comfortably slot into a variety of positions and roles like Maxwell can. He can shift the field and rotate the strike, or with just a flick of the switch, turn a run chase on its head with a short burst of power hitting.\nCamera Icon Shaun Marsh thrives at No.4 with an average of 48.33. Picture: AFP\nMarcus Stoinis is the only recognised fast bowling all-rounder in the squad and proved he can be an ODI match-winner with the ball over the summer. He also averages more than 38 with the bat and has only been dismissed once in his first four IPL matches this season (102 runs).\nAlex Carey is the only wicketkeeper in the squad and Pat Cummins the Allan Border Medallist. Enough said there.\nMitchell Starc remains under an injury cloud but, as the 2015 player of the tournament, will take a spot in the XI if fit.\nAs will Adam Zampa as Australia\u2019s wicket-taking leg-spinner, who claimed 18 scalps at 30.28 in his past ten matches.\nAustralia had success in the majority of those by pairing Zampa with off-spinner Nathan Lyon. The latter took few wickets but was highly economical, going for just 4.77 in his eight ODIs last month.\nThe conditions in England will not be the same as the subcontinent though, and are typically more conducive to swing bowling which could see his spot go to Jhye Richardson, with Jason Behrendorff or Nathan Coulter-Nile as the back-up options.\nNonetheless, the pitches for the World Cup are expected to dry out as the competition wears on, which could earn Lyon a horses-for-courses type selection deeper in the tournament.\nPOSSIBLE AUSTRALIA WORLD CUP XI\nWarner, Finch (c), Khawaja, Smith, Maxwell, Stoinis, Carey (wk, vc), Cummins, Starc, Richardson, Zampa\nCamera Icon Will Pucovski has been handed an Ashes lifeline through the Australia A series. Picture: AAP\nWHICH PATH LEADS TO ASHES FOR TEST HOPEFULS?\nFor Australia\u2019s Ashes hopefuls, there are now two paths that could lead to selection for the massive series.\nThe Australia A tour of England is one - Will Pucovski, Kurtis Patterson and Marcus Harris are among those who will follow this path.\nThe other is English county cricket, which Cameron Bancroft, Joe Burns, Marnus Labuschagne, Matt Renshaw, Peter Siddle and Daniel Worrall will use.\nWhether one carries more weight than the other is unclear. Given selectors opted to not pull the latter group out of county duty suggests that route carries at least as much weight as the Australia A tour.\nAlthough, it\u2019s worth noting that fiery quick James Pattinson was selected for Australia A despite holding a contract with Nottinghamshire, which could say otherwise.\nNonetheless, those playing county cricket are likely to play in more pressure-filled games given they are in the heat of a championship battle and not simply playing tour matches.\nThat also means the sides they play will be at full strength, whereas the Australia A players face the possibility of coming up against second-string players.\nEither way, it\u2019s valuable experience in English conditions facing the Dukes ball and big scores against anyone won\u2019t be ignored.\nCamera Icon Two middle-order Test spots are open to a stack of players, including Travis Head. Picture: AAP\nWHAT DO THE SELECTIONS MEAN FOR FRINGE PLAYERS?\nThere were Test vacancies galore a year ago, then there were just a few.\nNow - while a handful of places aren\u2019t locked in - just two are wide open.\nBoth are in the middle-order; No.5 and No.6.\nThe returns of David Warner and Steve Smith are set to take away two vacancies. Warner is in line to once again open for Australia, likely alongside Marcus Harris, Joe Burns or Cameron Bancroft.\nSmith is set to return at No.4. while Khawaja has a stronghold over No.3 given his recent form.\nThe bowling positions will understandably boil down to the regular few given the talent in those stocks. Meanwhile, Tim Paine is captain and wicketkeeper and will keep his spot at No.7.\nThat leaves two middle-order spots which are not open to a few, but a stack of players.\nKurtis Patterson, Will Pucovski, Matthew Wade, Travis Head and Peter Handscomb are those who have been selected for the Australia A tour and would fancy a spot.\nHead and Patterson are the incumbents and both scored centuries in their last Test matches. So is Marnus Labuschagne who will attempt to push his case with Glamorgan.\nNone of those are fast bowling all-rounders though, which Australia will likely want in England to take advantage of an extra seamer in swinging conditions.\nBut the only Australian fast bowling all-rounder in the A squad, or playing county cricket, is Mitch Marsh, who was selected in the Australia A squad.\nGiven his dire form in the Test arena, and the fact he wasn\u2019t offered a new Cricket Australia contact, he was considered to be the furthest away from the team he has been in years. But with few people to turn to, he still could make a late run at one of the two spots.\nCamera Icon Mitch Marsh was not handed a Cricket Australia contract. Picture: Getty Images\nWHAT DOES MARSH\u2019S CONTRACT SNUBBING MEAN?\nIt\u2019s not that long ago that Mitchell Marsh looked to be a man firmly on the rise. The 2017-18 summer saw him average 106.66 in the Ashes and before the next summer began he had been elected the Test outfit\u2019s vice-captain. He would only play one match for Australia that summer, axed after a dire series against Pakistan in the UAE and then again after flopping at the MCG.\nIn that time \u2013 longer really \u2013 he has slid below Marcus Stoinis as Australia\u2019s preferred ODI all-rounder, with his last match in the format coming last January. Given those facts, it\u2019s little surprise Marsh has slipped off the 20-man contract list.\nIt also suggests one of two things for the Test team going forward. Either Stoinis, who is on the contract list, is being looked to as the Test all-rounder or more likely selectors have moved on from their preference to include an all-rounder whenever possible.\nGiven the Australians did not turn to an all-rounder in any of the five Tests Marsh did not play in the 2018-19 summer, the latter seems more likely.\nCamera Icon James Pattinson earned a CA contract on Monday, Picture: AAP\nWHAT DOES PATTINSON\u2019S RETURN TO THE CONTRACT LIST MEAN?\nJames Pattinson\u2019s return to the contract list is significant. It has been more than three years since Pattinson played the most recent of his 17 Tests in a career that has been blighted by injury. Despite that he has been given a contract ahead Peter Siddle, who has been a regular in Justin Langer\u2019s Test squads. Ahead of Jackson Bird, who was the top wicket-taker in the Shield regular season. Ahead of Kurtis Patterson and Joe Burns, who are incumbents who both registered centuries in Australia\u2019s most recent Test.\nIt\u2019s a show of faith from selectors in a bowler capable of being among the best in the world. Four five-wicket hauls in his short Test-career to date attest to that. So do the 17 wickets at 11.48 he snared across three Shield clashes after returning from a side stain suffered in January.\nHis presence on the list suggests selectors are intent on getting whatever they can from him whenever they can. His is a rare talent too rarely seen on the Test stage.\nFurther, the decision to include him in the Australia A squad, rather than allowing him to continue playing county cricket like Peter Siddle and Joe Burns, indicates a desire from CA to take more hands-on role in his preparations for the Ashes. Expect to see Pattinson back in a baggy green sooner rather than later.\nAUSTRALIA\u2019S WORLD CUP 15: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Adam Zampa, Jason Behrendorff, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jhye Richardson\nAUSTRALIA A TOUR OF ENGLAND\nFour-day: Tim Paine (c), Marcus Harris, Kurtis Patterson, Will Pucovski, Travis Head (vc), Peter Handscomb, Matthew Wade, Mitch Marsh, Michael Neser, Jon Holland, James Pattinson, Jackson Bird, Josh Hazlewood (vc), Chris Tremain\nODI: Travis Head (c), Matthew Wade, Will Pucovski, Peter Handscomb, Ashton Turner, Mitch Marsh (vc), D\u2019Arcy Short, Kurtis Patterson, Ashton Agar, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Josh Hazlewood (vc), Kane Richardson, Sean Abbott\nCONTRACT LIST: Patrick Cummins, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Alex Carey, Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Peter Handscomb, Marcus Harris, Travis Head, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, Tim Paine, James Pattinson, Jhye Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, David Warner, Adam Zampa\n", "label": "human"}

The way we played the 80 minutes was outstanding.\n\"It's a good win. We know how dangerous Warrington are. It's a long season but that's an important win.\"\nWarrington head coach Steve Price:\n\"We clearly got dominated in all aspects of the game.

{"text": "\u00d7 Joe\u2019s Weather World: How KC is positioned for the massive Plains storm (TUE-4/9)\nGood morning..this will be a shorter blog compared to yesterday sine I\u2019m on a deadline of getting it all written and researched in about 40 minutes today. Overall there aren\u2019t too many changes to the situation locally\u2026this will be mostly a wind storm for the area as what rain we get locally won\u2019t be overly heavy or last too long. Many may not even get a drop of rain or maybe just get some brief fast hitting showers from this whole thing. Everybody will get the wind though.\nForecast:\nToday: Mostly sunny this morning with a few clouds in the afternoon. It may not be as warm as yesterday but we\u2019ll still be well into the 70s\nTonight: Increasing winds with with lows in the 50s\nWednesday: Windy\u2026gusts to 40+MPH likely..and very warm too with lots of filtered sunshine. Highs near or above 80\u00b0\nWednesday night: Remaining very warm\u2026with a few showers or brief passing storms possible. Lows remain in the 60s\nThursday: Falling temperatures all morning into the 40\u00b0 range. Then clouds with some mist/drizzle possible. Windy with SW winds gusting to 30-35 MPH.\nDiscussion:\nYesterday\u2019s high of 78\u00b0 was the warmest day of the year so far. Tomorrow we may do better as a very warm air mass combined with some very strong wind stirring the air up helps to send temperatures soaring. This despite the veil of clouds that may be with us at times during the day.\nThis is all ahead of a soon to be massive Plains storm that will pass towards the NW of KC aloft on Thursday.\nThe system itself is just now coming onshore in the western US.\nIt\u2019s not impressive. Look though what will happen over the next few days. Let\u2019s go up to about 18,000 feet or so using one of our models that show the developing storm.\nLook for the \u201cU\u201d that closes off into an upper level storm in the western Plains.\nFor time reference\u202600Z is 7PM\u202606Z is 1AM\u202612Z is 7AM and 18Z is 1PM.\nSo this thing really gets wrapped up aloft\u2026and interestingly it sort of taking roughly the same path of the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d that moved through the Plains about a month ago. I might delve more into that in tomorrow\u2019s blog.\nAt the surface this storm will develop from an area of low pressure coming through the Rockies.\nAgain this will really get together in KS on Wednesday afternoon/night.\nThe maps above are the surface features. The black lines represent lines of equal pressure or isobars. The storm will move through KS\u2026into perhaps far NW MO then up through IA. Once the colder air hits on Thursday\u2026it will linger for awhile.\nTypically the NAM model handles these cold air intrusions wayyyy better than some other models.\nLook at it\u2019s forecast for 4AM THU\u2026and see the contrast.\nNear 70 east of KC to 30s west of KC\u2026with lower 60s to 40s from east to west in the Metro. That is a moment in time though because by 10 AM\u2026here we are.\nand yet very little moisture is expected locally from this since the main features will be going towards the NW of KC and we get dry slotted at least aloft there is a dry slot. at the surface with the colder air rushing into the surface moisture that comes up from the south tomorrow into Thursday early AM\u2026the colder air should squeeze the lower part of the atmosphere\u2026and that means that moisture will cool and condense into clouds\u2026with maybe a few areas of drizzle/sprinkles developing.\nThe main thing though from all this will be the wind.\nAbout 5,000 feet above us tomorrow the winds will be around 55 MPH. The map below is for 4PM\nThen at 1AM Thursday\u2026wow! That\u2019s almost 80 MPH winds above us\u2026we may see 50+ winds at the surface tomorrow night. That will keep temperatures up into early Thursday before the front gets here!\nand then by 4PM Thursday the colder air has rushed in and the winds above us, while not as strong are still close to 40 MPH.\nSo NOT a lot of precip from this\u2026but yes to a LOT of wind from this. High wind warnings are possible for the area tomorrow night especially.\nNear freezing or below weather is likely FRI and maybe SAT AM too.\nWe still need to watch Sunday carefully. There is a 2nd storm coming up and while this storm is getting the attention the 2nd system may have more impacts\u2026rain at least and maybe something else that no one wants to think about right now\u2026and it\u2019s wintry.\nOK that\u2019s it for today\u2026our feature photo comes from Amanda Lewis. Things are blossoming all over right now!\n\\\nJoe\n", "label": "human"}

The app that is the medium of choice for artistic expression for lip sync pros and emo kids, is being deemed \u201cinappropriate\u201d by the government authorities. Madras\u2019 High Court has requested the federal government to ban the app. The claim against the video app - it's \u201cencouraging pornography\u201d.\nTikTok is wildly popular in India with hoards of Bollywood dubs, dialogues and songs made available for selfie-video stars to lap up.

{"text": "In the current AAA gaming climate in which live-service multiplayer and microtransaction-soaked mobile games reign supreme, there are a few words that will bring gamers to a new a title in droves right now, and Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is saying all of them: single-player with no microtransactions. Star Wars Celebration is on in full-force this week, and even though potential players will finally be learning some concrete details about Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order today, it's likely this latest news is all that some needed to hear.\nJedi: Fallen Order's presence at Star Wars Celebration has been known for a little while now, and the public's reception to what's shown of the game today may ultimately be a deciding factor in publisher EA's future with partner Disney. Having more or less piddled away six years of its exclusive ten-year Star Wars license with nerf-herding duds like the multiplayer-focused Battlefront games and, well, virtually nothing else, the pressure is on at EA and Respawn for Jedi: Fallen Order to be a commercial hit. Earlier this week, though, fans got a tiny taste of what's to come in the form of a leaked poster, and the hype surrounding this small news seems palpable enough to allay some fears about the game's performance upon launch.\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view. Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nRelated: What Trailers & Reveals To Expect At Star Wars Celebration 2019\nRespawn co-founder Vince Zampella took to the Star Wars Celebration stage yesterday to proudly announce that Jedi: Fallen Order is a strictly story-based experience with \"no multiplayer\" and \"no microtransactions.\" As captured in the video below, the waiting crowd went understandably wild at these words alone. The small reveal has since reverberated throughout the internet, taking the gaming community's excitement for the mysterious game to heights even Cloud City would envy. Additionally, if Twitter user Nibel is to be believed, the hype train isn't letting off anytime soon as the game apparently has a release date: November 15, 2019.\nSet after the cataclysmic events of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Respawn's Jedi: Fallen Order will see players follow the (probably bleak) journey of a Padawan who somehow escaped death after the declaration of Order 66 - Anakin couldn't get all of them in the Jedi Temple, after all. Left only with a small droid companion and a lightsaber, the Padawan protagonist must make his \"journey to - what, well we don't know,\" according to a humorously coy Zampella. What's known, though, is that Jedi: Fallen Order is highly unlikely to follow in the footsteps of EA's last major Star Wars title, Battlefront II, which was lambasted by consumers and critics alike for its shamelessly greedy balance around predatory loot boxes. A holiday release this year for Jedi: Fallen Order would only put icing on the cake.\nThough it may feel like fans know a lot already, there's still a Star Destroyer-load of unknown details about Jedi: Fallen Order that have yet to be revealed. With luck, though, today's panel focusing exclusively on the upcoming game will confirm what's been leaked so far, and it can be hoped it'll also show more than it tells by providing footage of the game's never-before-seen gameplay.\nSource: Star Wars Celebration, Nibel/Twitter\nWhen Will Sony Unveil PlayStation 5 and How Much Will it Cost?\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "THE rich mining heritage at the core of so many east Cleveland communities is being celebrated by generations of villagers with the unveiling of a bronze statue.\nThe Spirit of East Cleveland now stands proudly in the area to commemorate mining of ironstone that was extracted from the earth for more than 90 years.\nThe lifesize statue of miners at work was officially revealed by the community members and a filmmaker who fought and fundraised to see the figures brought to life in Skelton on the A173 towards Guisborough.\nAttending the formal unveiling were organisations, businesses, and politicians who supported the project. Schoolchildren and a brass band also marked the occasion earlier this week.\nAmong the crowd were the Friends of Skelton Community Orchard (FOSCO) whose treasurer and fundraiser Joyce White was deeply involved in seeing the project through.\nShe and her husband Stuart were delighted to be accompanied by their two great-grandchildren for the occasion.\nMrs White said: \u201cWe held a race night, tea afternoons, tombolas and a local firm raffled a glamping pod getaway break on our behalf, but we got a big breakthrough when ICL Boulby gave us a substantial cheque. However, I\u2019d like to thank all the other businesses, large and small, as well as individuals who made financial contributions.\n\u201cWithout their backing this wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\u201d\nThe statue was made by Skelton-based sculptor Bill Harling and it was unveiled by Craig Hornby, a North-East filmmaker whose documentary A Century In Stone tells of the discovery of ironstone and how it led to an explosion of industry and population throughout the area. \u201cI was thrilled to find out my film had helped Bill in creating this fantastic sculpture,\u201d said Mr Hornby.\n\u201cTo be asked by FOSCO to unveil it was a real honour. It\u2019s the finest tribute to our ironstone mining heritage in Cleveland by a long way.\n\u201cIt was the graft, endurance and camaraderie of the mining communities through tough times that Cleveland was built on and that spirit is still relevant today.\u201d\nICL Boulby vice president Andrew Fulton added the \u201chard work, dedication and bravery\u201d of the miners transformed Teesside.\nHe said: \u201cObviously we were delighted to help kick start the fundraising for such a project.\n\u201cAs fellow miners we know only too well the hard work, dedication and bravery these people displayed.\n\u201cThrough their efforts they changed the landscape of the region and made Teesside a world leader.\n\u201cThis is a fitting tribute to those men, their families and their achievements especially how, after all this time, mining still remains a vital part of these communities.\u201d\nMP for Middlesbrough south and east Cleveland Simon Clarke also praised the FOSCO group for their dedication to the cause and attended the opening ceremony Cross Green in Skelton.\nHe said: \u201cA massive well done and thank you to Joyce and all the volunteers at Friends of Skelton Community Orchard.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 As his first season as Rangers coach came to an end Saturday night against thePenguins, David Quinn said he knew what he was signing on for when he accepted the job and took over as coach during this team\u2019s rebuilding stage.\n\u201cHonestly, it was pretty much what I expected,\u2019\u2019 Quinn said, before his team closed out the 2018-19 season with a 4-3 overtime win over the Penguins at PPG Paints Arena. \u201cIt really was.\u2019\u2019\nIn the final game of the season for both teams, Ryan Strome scored the winner with 2:51 remaining in overtime. For the Penguins, the one point earned \u2014 combined with the Islanders\u2019 win over the Capitals in Washington \u2014 meant they finished third in the Metropolitan Division and will face the Islanders in the first round, with the first two games on Long Island.\nThe Rangers finished 32-36-14 for 78 points (20 points out of a playoff spot).\nAfterward, the Rangers sat in seventh in the pre-lottery draft order and had a 6.5 percent chance of getting the No. 1 overall pick. (Edmonton played a late game Saturday and the outcome could affect the Rangers\u2019 lottery odds slightly). The lottery will be Tuesday in Toronto.\nAfter the game, Quinn said he thanked his players for their effort all season and in the finale.\n\u201cI said this before the game, it\u2019s been a great group to coach,\u2019\u2019 Quinn said. \u201cObviously, not the season we wanted to have, and certainly not the record we wanted to have. We certainly want to be playing past this point next year, but they gave it their all. They were attentive, and I\u2019m proud of the way this ended.\u2019\u2019\nSubscribe to Newsday\u2019s sports newsletter Receive stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nQuinn said he didn\u2019t feel like the transition from coaching college hockey at Boston University to coaching in the NHL was a big deal, but he talked about how he was surprised by how \u201ccoachable\u2019\u2019 his players were. He said he believes he is a better coach now than he was at the start of the season and that the Rangers\u2019 coaching staff as a whole will be better next season after a full season together.\nAs the Rangers players meet with management Sunday for their breakup day interviews and the team plans for next season, Quinn said the one thing the Blueshirts need to improve is their defense.\n\u201cWe have to play better defense,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe cannot be giving up the chances we\u2019ve given up, and we can\u2019t be giving up the goals we\u2019ve given up. No. 1, first and foremost, we have to be a better defensive team. And that\u2019s going to be stressed in our end-of-the-year meetings with every individual.\u2019\u2019\nThe Rangers gave up 264 goals entering Saturday, ninth-most in the league. They had scored 217 goals, tied with the Vancouver Canucks for 23rd most.\n\u201cI thought there was a stretch where we played very good team defense; our chances [against] were down; we were defending the net front better; we looked more purposeful in our defending \u2014 I think we wanted to defend,\u2019\u2019 Quinn said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve lost that this last four, five weeks. But looking over the big picture, we have to defend better.\u2019\u2019\nThey defended OK Saturday, for the first two periods at least. Sidney Crosby, who entered the game needing two points to get to 100 for the season, scored on a two-on-one break, one-timing Jake Guentzel\u2019s saucer pass past Alexandar Georgiev for his 35th goal at 6:36 of the first period. But rather than folding, the Rangers got the equalizer when Brendan Smith \u2014 playing left wing \u2014 picked off a pass in the neutral zone and picked the top corner over Matt Murray\u2019s glove hand for his fourth goal of the season (second as a forward) at 12:49.\nThe teams were scoreless in the second period, but a total of four goals were scored in the third. Nick Bjugstad and Guentzel scored for Pittsburgh and Brady Skjei and Vladislav Namestnikov scored shorthanded for the Rangers.\nIn the overtime, Crosby appeared to score the game-winner, but the goal was wiped out after video review determined that Guentzel had interfered with Georgiev on the play.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Student leaders from the University of Otago's Knox College wrote a letter to hostel managers two years ago telling them sexual assault complaints were not being handled properly.\nPhoto: Otago University\nDozens of women have spoken to media over recent weeks with complaints of a toxic culture and a lack of support for victims.\nIn 2017 nine student leaders or resident advisors (RAs) from Knox surveyed those living at the hostel asking them how it could be improved.\nThe responses showed students felt they were not listened to, did not trust management and that the complaints and disciplinary processes were not clear.\nThe survey was then sent to the Knox management team.\nOne of the RAs, who did not want to be named, told RNZ that managers approached the student leaders individually asking them about their involvement in the document.\nThey said this response \"hurt everyone's feelings\".\nIn an official reply to the letter from the college master, Reverend Graham Redding refused to meet with the student leaders saying it was not clear if they were talking about systemic problems or specific incidents.\nThe same RA told RNZ they \"finessed\" the letter to make the points clearer but said the \"subtext of the letter was about the lack of support and handling of sexual harassment and assault complaints\".\nThe edited letter noted there was a \"level of dissatisfaction\" from the student body at Knox and an \"alarming cynicism about college culture\".\n\"We understand them to feel unheard by management, untrusting about sub-masters, and concerned with the school-like nature of the wider college body,\" the letter read.\nStudents also said they felt uncertain \"if staff's primary concern is resident welfare\" and because of that Knox residents held back from reporting complaints.\nResidents of the college felt like they could not trust the RAs or masters.\nFraser Irvine was one of the student leaders who put his name on the letter but said he could not remember much about it because of the time since it was written.\nHe spent multiple years at Knox and acknowledged there was a problem with the culture but said Knox was doing everything it could to improve.\nHeather Tribe was also part of the 2017 student leadership team. She said her decision to go to Knox was because she wanted to support women and help the college change.\n\"From the very beginning as a team we were sitting down and talking about how to address some of these really disgusting traditions and cultures.\n\"My voice is one of many that were trying to make Knox a better place.\"\nShe said there was an element of toxic culture at the college.\n\"Knox has been around for 100 years. These behaviours have been kind of happening for as long as men have been raping women - this is just one place where it happens.\n\"Every university has a rape, sexual harassment and assault problem. Knox is working to counter that.\"\nDr Redding said things were changing at the college after the meetings with sub-masters in 2017.\nChanges for 2018 included \"increased focus in sub-master training on sexual assault and harm-related issues and dealing with sensitive matters,\" he said.\nKnox had also created the Student Safety Advisory Group for students to discuss safety issues directly with management.

And despite the \"following\" independent Kevin Mack has, Mr Moss said he is \"yet to see a lot of policy detail come out\". \"Kevin obviously has a bit of a following but I haven't seen a lot of policy detail, so I do think we need to flesh that out a bit more and find out what he is standing for,\" he said. \"All I have heard is pause the plan so until we hear more I'm not too sure what sort of threat Kevin is going to be for the seat.\" Mr Moss said his main priority was to offer free TAFE and university courses. \"I really believe we are offering hope to young Australians and the first part of that really comes down to education,\" he said.

{"text": "In a cardiologist who splits his time between London and Cyprus, THEO PANAYIDES finds a man who is impressive, intense and articulate. And who sees a lot of patients\nProfessor Dinos (Constantinos) Missouris has a touch of the royal \u2018we\u2019. It\u2019s not overly apparent when he talks \u2013 I only notice when I play the tape back in order to transcribe it \u2013 but it\u2019s definitely there, weaving in and out of his conversation. \u201cThe system does not welcome us, as well as it could\u2019ve done \u2013 even though we love this island 100 per cent, we would die for it,\u201d he says, speaking in the plural but actually speaking of himself. \u201cThey don\u2019t approach us in a nice way\u2026 Even now, we find colleagues behave to us in a much more elegant and sensitive way in the UK than they do here.\u201d\nWhat does it mean, this no-doubt-unconscious affectation? Some might say it points to arrogance and vanity, but I\u2019m not so sure. It\u2019s true that Dinos has no false modesty about his many accomplishments \u2013 but I don\u2019t think the way he talks is a sign of being big-headed, if only because he seems so aware of that danger. \u201cIn medicine, there is a problem,\u201d he tells me bluntly, speaking extremely fast as he does throughout our hour together: \u201cThere is a confusion between arrogance and brilliance. And this is the thing that essentially needs to change. We are all doctors, we all make mistakes. We have to admit our mistakes\u201d. If anything, his royal \u2018we\u2019 may be a sign of the opposite \u2013 the fact that he\u2019s so empathetic (it\u2019s perhaps his greatest gift in treating patients) that he unconsciously tries to foster a sense of unity and togetherness, even when it\u2019s really just himself he\u2019s talking about.\nHe is indeed a doctor, and a high-flying one \u2013 senior cardiologist at Frimley Health NHS Trust in Berkshire (its catchment area includes affluent places like Ascot and Windsor) with his own private practice in Harley Street and additionally, for the past two years, a visiting professor at the University of Cyprus medical school. His background includes five years as senior registrar at St. George\u2019s Hospital in Tooting, an establishment so eminent that one of its consultants was the Queen\u2019s own cardiologist (Dinos is now a consultant himself, meaning a specialist with many years\u2019 training), plus three years doing cardiovascular research with Professor Graham MacGregor, a world expert on hypertension. Dinos isn\u2019t shy about acknowledging the world-class people he\u2019s worked with \u2013 and, for instance, recalls being helped along in his career by \u201ca very famous professor called Brian Robinson, I was his prodigy student\u201d.\nTo that rich CV we can now add Medoclinic in Nicosia: \u201cI am opening my own practice as we speak,\u201d he confirms \u2013 though in fact this is something of a transitional period, even without the additional wrinkle of Gesy, our national health system (which he plans to support as much as possible), due to launch in a couple of months. It\u2019s not clear if his plan was ever to leave the UK altogether \u2013 he does a lot of research, which is easier in Britain \u2013 but, in any event, he still has a foot in both camps. \u201cMy heart beats for Cyprus. 100 per cent,\u201d affirms Dinos earnestly. \u201cBut I always knew that there are problems.\u201d\nRight now he\u2019s in Cyprus five days a week, with two days in Berkshire. He\u2019ll teach Monday through Wednesday \u2013 he plans to transition more into academia as he grows older \u2013 then catch the flight to England, working flat-out Thursday and Friday; \u201cI finish at about eight, and run to the airport\u201d. Meanwhile his wife and daughter live here full-time, the family having relocated four years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got quite a unique family,\u201d he tells me proudly: \u201cI\u2019ve got a very intelligent wife \u2013 a child psychiatrist, the most talented physician on the island \u2013 and a talented young daughter\u201d. His daughter, almost 17, is a cellist and pianist who wants to be a musician. \u201cShe was at the Royal Academy of Music, that sort of level\u201d, so bringing her to Cyprus may potentially have been a mistake \u2013 \u201cbut I believe in destiny,\u201d says Dinos, \u201cand I think it\u2019s going to work for her. My gut feeling says that it\u2019s going to work for her\u201d.\nThe adjectives he naturally uses to extol his family are perhaps significant: not \u2018a beautiful wife and the sweetest young daughter\u2019 (which presumably would also be true), but \u2018intelligent\u2019 and \u2018talented\u2019. There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s impressive to talk to, intense and articulate, and there\u2019s no doubt he values brains and achievement. He talks very fast, as already mentioned, sitting in a coffee shop on a Sunday afternoon, a balding 58-year-old with a somewhat mournful expression; he questions the barista on the tea selection, asking specifically for Cypriot teas \u2013 then, having sniffed the various options, orders a cappuccino with no further comment. My first impression is that he doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly \u2013 yet I also suspect that he doesn\u2019t blow up at those who disappoint him, just accepts the slight and channels it into further achievement. You strike me as a person who doesn\u2019t get depressed very easily, I venture at one point \u2013 but Dinos just chuckles: \u201cNo, no, I get depressed easily. My other half thinks I\u2019m hopeless when it comes to emotions!\u201d. He shrugs bravely: \u201cBut we have to be strong, to survive the suffering of the patients.\u201d\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t get very much on him as a person; maybe there isn\u2019t very much, once you take medicine out of the equation. He likes to read, though not fiction \u2013 mostly \u201crelevant\u201d, i.e. medical books \u2013 and doesn\u2019t have time to relax at the moment anyway; he never smokes, and very seldom drinks. He sleeps on the flight back and forth, being too exhausted to do much else. He wakes up at five (not just now; this was always his schedule), does an hour of research, clinical NHS work from eight till six, then private practice, home at 10, in bed by midnight. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to think about tiredness,\u201d he tells me flatly. \u201cI think we have a big drive. Because medicine gives you a lot of drive, in a way.\u201d\nDoesn\u2019t he know, as a cardiologist, that too much work is bad for a person? \u201cI know, but \u2013 some people are built to last, as it were. The stock is good, the genetics are very strong.\u201d He himself is of fine village stock, born in Zodia to a teacher of metalwork who was also a farmer and landowner; he had \u201ca fantastic childhood, growing up in the fields\u201d, then came the invasion, a change in circumstances, and medical school in the UK financed by scholarships and working in restaurants. His heart \u201cbeats for Cyprus,\u201d as he says \u2013 but which Cyprus? Maybe not the venal and corrupt 21st-century Cyprus, where (for instance) civil servants always get top marks when being evaluated, so no-one ever gets fired.\nThat example is relevant \u2013 because quality control, says Dinos, is primarily what\u2019s missing in the medical profession here: \u201cIf a doctor makes a mistake, how does it appear? It cannot appear\u201d. It\u2019s entirely different in the UK, where all doctors get an annual appraisal and must also be \u201cre-validated\u201d by the General Medical Council every five years. The money is also very different: a consultant\u2019s salary in London \u2013 in London! \u2013 ranges from \u00a34-6,000 a month, he says (a junior doctor\u2019s will be \u00a32-3,000); a private physician here can make many times that in a single week. That\u2019s a big stumbling block for Gesy \u2013 though Dinos seems convinced it\u2019ll work, mostly on the reasoning that patients \u201cwill prefer to be seen by Gesy doctors\u201d since they\u2019re paying for it anyway, thus creating a virtuous circle that\u2019ll force more and more doctors into the system.\nMaybe; but only if Gesy is viewed as equivalent to going private \u2013 which isn\u2019t guaranteed when GPs (\u201cthe core\u201d of the service, the first port of call) are such an iffy proposition. In the UK, to be a General Practitioner you need three years of training, \u201csix months in obstetrics and gynaecology, six months in paediatrics, six months in general surgery, six months in medicine, six months in psychiatry, and six months out in the community\u201d; in Cyprus at the moment, due to a shortage of candidates, retired hospital doctors with no extra training are signing up as GPs, and being accepted. (They think they can do it, shrugs Dinos: \u201cAs I said before, there is something called arrogance, confused with brilliance: \u2018I\u2019m good enough. Why shouldn\u2019t I?\u2019\u201d.) It\u2019s entirely possible that these ageing medics will find themselves out of their depth, sending almost all patients to a specialist and clogging up the system \u2013 yet, as we know, the unions are resisting the solution of importing doctors from abroad.\nProf. Missouris sighs heavily, bristling with weary irritation. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to be liked by my colleagues for saying all this,\u201d he admits, but \u201cwe cannot have a group of doctors blocking the development of the national health system of Cyprus\u2026 To be honest, if I was the Minister of Health, I would have broken a few bones. A long time ago.\n\u201cI think we have the unions, which is the biggest cancer Cyprus has ever faced. There is no change \u2013 there can be no change \u2013 unless you break the unions. They are not interested about the patients, they are interested about their own small community, their few members, that pay them money to be there. So, unless we break the unions \u2013 and, if I was there, I would\u2019ve broken them a long time ago\u2026\u201d He pauses, his expression more troubled than ever. \u201cWe cannot leave a bunch of people who are abusing situations to determine the destiny of the nation. We are becoming a laughing-stock of Europe.\u201d\nI know, I agree reassuringly. It\u2019s what everyone\u2019s saying.\n\u201cBut I am saying it loudly! I say we need the political will, we need to break some bones of the unions. The political parties have done enough damage to Cyprus, now is the time [for them] to get out and let the system work. Because what are we going to give to the new generation? More politicians? More corruption?\u2026 I\u2019m saying this because I don\u2019t need them, in a way,\u201d admits Dinos, then adds: \u201cEven if I needed them, I wouldn\u2019t care\u201d.\nPartly, I suppose, it\u2019s because of his UK experience. I didn\u2019t really know how the NHS works, and I\u2019m stunned to discover just how marginalised private medicine is in Britain. Consultants, i.e. those at the top of the ladder, are allowed \u201ca session or two\u201d per week (a session is four hours) \u2013 but even that, even his own Harley Street practice, requires a referral from a GP; patients almost never come directly, bypassing the system. (It\u2019s not illegal to do so, but insurance may not cover it and many private hospitals have regulations forbidding it.) \u201cIn the UK, private practice is done in a more elegant and discreet way,\u201d chuckles Dinos. \u201cHere, it\u2019s done in a more vulgar way\u201d. What\u2019s more, UK hospitals are heavily regulated: \u2018they\u2019 know everything about Dr. Dinos, from what time he comes in to whether he washes his hands in between patients. \u201cThey\u2019ve got people essentially delivering to the management, day in day out, what the doctor is doing.\u201d\nSpies, in other words?\n\u201cThey\u2019re not spies, I think this is called management. Because the doctors, if you leave them on their own, they will do a bad job. They have to be controlled.\u201d\nAnyone who\u2019s worked in such a system all their life is bound to be more idealistic \u2013 or perhaps just more cowed \u2013 than a private doctor getting rich in Cyprus. But there\u2019s also something more in Dinos Missouris: an emotional intensity, a fervour that might almost be a spiritual calling (or, who knows, an escape mechanism?). \u201cI believe in philanthropy. I believe in the human soul,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhen patients come to see me, I reach the soul very quickly\u201d \u2013 meaning, again, that he empathises, feels their pain (which may often be psychological rather than cardiac pain) very quickly. \u201cMy clinics are usually very busy. I usually see twice the number of patients my colleagues see\u2026 I used to see three times more, but I\u2019m getting a bit older these days and not as energetic!\u201d. This profound connection means a lot to him, even more (it seems) than any remuneration he might get for it. He talks of doing \u201ccharity\u201d during the last few years in Cyprus, meaning helping patients who\u2019ve been badly treated, and also talks of wanting to provide \u201ca high level of care\u2026 possibly even without money, at the end of the day\u201d. His greatest satisfaction these days lies in academia, teaching students or seeing a line of young doctors queueing up outside his office, begging to help him with his research.\n\u201cWe are essentially very fragile,\u201d says this sad-eyed, high-achieving man, summing up the wisdom of a heart doctor who appears to have barely paused for breath in 35 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a very fine balance. A man comes in, the next minute he\u2019s dead, in his 30s or 40s \u2013 and you\u2019re there on the receiving end, trying to save them. So life, essentially, is very fragile. And it makes us aware that we have to live every minute of it, we have to enjoy every minute of life\u201d. His own life is packed, by design. \u201cI may crash out when I\u2019m 65 or whatever, but at the moment we have a number of years to essentially give it a good go, and create what we want to create,\u201d says Dinos, lapsing back into royal \u2018we\u2019. \u201cTo leave a legacy, as it were.\u201d He\u2019s gone before I know it, cappuccino barely touched, shuffling off with surprising briskness as the afternoon turns to dusk.\n", "label": "human"}

But in a film, we do not shoot them like that,\u201d said Shroff.\n\u201cThe difference between a stage performer and ours is that on stage, you are in one flow with the character. But when we shoot a film, we are not shooting all the scenes in the sequence we watch it in. So much back and forth happens and we have to mould ourselves to those emotional graphs. I, therefore, try to control my breathing, try to take control of my body, so that I can emote, project and perform,\u201d said Shroff.\n\u2018Criminal Justice\u2019 is helmed by Tigmanshu Dhulia and Vishal Furia and produced by BBC India and Applause Entertainment.

{"text": "QB happy to not have a \u2018best friend\u2019 as coach anymore\nFive years ago at this time, when super-cocky quarterback Johnny Manziel was always rubbing his money-hungry fingertips overhead, and happily willing his way into trouble at almost every turn, David Lee wanted nothing to do with him.\nThen the quarterbacks coach under Rex Ryan on the New York Jets, Lee refused to list the QB renegade on his internal Jets rankings of draftable passers in 2014. Not because of Johnny Football\u2019s ample off-field mischief, but rather because of his lack of on-field reliability.\nNow, after a two-week stint of coaching a \u201chumbled\u201d Manziel in the now-defunct Alliance of American Football, Lee says the 26-year-old deserves a second chance in the NFL.\nIn a phone interview following Tuesday\u2019s sudden demise of the AAF \u2013 after eight weeks of operation, and just two weeks before the fledgling league\u2019s playoffs were to have begun \u2013 Lee detailed why his short experience with the Manziel went so smoothly and promisingly, and why he has changed his mind about the infamous trouble magnet\u2019s NFL prospects.\nIn part, Lee said, it\u2019s because Manziel kept telling him, and showing him, that he now was open to doing whatever necessary to return to the NFL \u2013 and that the QB no longer wanted a \u201cbest friend\u201d as coach, but rather someone who\u2019d insist he play as NFL passers play.\nYeah, quite the change.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping and praying he gets another chance. My short experience with him was tremendous,\u201d said Lee, a six-time NFL quarterbacks coach since 2004, who this year had been QB coach and de facto offensive coordinator (after Hal Mumme\u2019s firing) of the AAF\u2019s Memphis Express.\n\u201cI really, really like Johnny as a person. Boy, he\u2019s got a fire in his heart. He loves football. Gosh, he loves it. And he wants to be good \u2026 He had been through hell and back from the time he left Texas A&M until the time he rolled into Memphis.\u201d\nThat might be an understatement, even if Johnny himself was a navigator.\nPrior to joining the Express three weeks ago, the previous seven years for Manziel had been a dizzying mashup of stunning, award-worthy, on-field college highs; of embarrassing, TMZ-fodder, off-field lows; and of perpetually perplexing disappointments as a professional player.\nAfter throwing for 26 touchdowns and running for 21 more with scintillating, dramatic flair in winning the Heisman as a redshirt freshman at Texas A&M in 2012, Manziel let all his sudden, subsequent fame and celebrity chew him up and spit him out.\nTwo years after crashing and burning with the NFL\u2019s Cleveland Browns from 2014-16, out of the blue he signed last May with the CFL\u2019s Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Two months later, the Ticats traded him to the Montreal Alouettes. In eight starts he threw for just five touchdowns and passed for just 161 yards per game, against seven interceptions.\nIn the end five weeks ago, the CFL not only ordered the Alouettes to release Manziel for contravening \u201cthe agreement which made him eligible to play\u201d there in the first place but banished him from the league entirely.\nThat\u2019s the young man and the train full of baggage that chugged into Memphis three weeks ago.\nAlmost immediately his personal travails continued, off the field. Manziel\u2019s wife Bre Tiesi left him, reportedly over broken wedding vows. She\u2019d already scrubbed her Instagram account of everything to do with Manziel when news of their split broke just last week.\nOn the football field, however, Manziel finally got himself together, Lee said in a phone interview Wednesday.\nGone was the head-strong, coaching-averse, \u201clook at me\u201d showboat. Manziel even turned to God for help, Lee said.\n\u201cI got a kid who was an open book who said, \u2018Come and coach me.\u2019 He loved praying with me,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMy wife always sends the quarterbacks cookies and sends them Bible verses. She gave him three, and he said she was right on, on all three. It was that kind of two weeks with him.\n\u201cI can say this. After being drafted into the NFL by Cleveland, and after his two stints up there in Canada, shoot, he came in through our doors very humble, and very willing to listen and be coached.\u201d\nMemphis head coach Mike Singletary, the fiery Hall of Fame linebacker and head coach of the San Francisco 49ers late last decade, asked just one thing of Lee in his dealings with Manziel.\n\u201cHe asked if I would treat Johnny like he was my son. And I said, \u2018Well I\u2019m going to coach him, and coach him hard,\u2019\u201d Lee said. \u201cMike said, \u2018That\u2019s okay. Coach him hard. But treat him like he\u2019s your son. That\u2019s what I want you to do.\u2019\u201d\nLee obliged.\n\u201cSo I got him here when he was looking for help, needing help, expecting support and help \u2013 and he got it all from me, and he got it from Mike.\u201d\nFamiliarity helped Manziel adapt quickly to the Mumme/Lee offensive concepts.\n\u201cOn the first day we met for about six hours on our offence,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere was carryover from what he did at Texas A&M to what we were doing here, because it was Hal Mumme\u2019s Air Raid system. Or half of it was anyway; the other half was NFL stuff. Hal Mumme was going to be the original coordinator but he got fired, and I became the coordinator.\n\u201cLong story short, the transition for Johnny was way faster than with any of the other three pro clubs he had been with, because it included so much of what he was doing in college.\n\u201cAnd he did okay with it, he really did.\u201d\nIn that first game, Manziel piloted three series \u2013 completing 3-of-5 for 48 yards as the Express topped the Iron 31-25 in overtime.\nLast Saturday against the Orlando Apollos, Manziel threw a touchdown pass negated by an offensive pass-interference call.\n\u201cHe played great,\u201d Lee said. \u201cShoot, he took us right down the field, threw a touchdown pass, they called it back, and he threw what would have been another touchdown pass but our guy tipped it up into the air and got it intercepted.\n\u201cSo, he was doing really well until he made the tackle on the interception and got kneed in the head and had to come out of the game. He went into concussion protocol. The next day, though, he was fine.\u201d\nTwo days after that, the AAF shut down.\nThe keys to Manziel\u2019s brief flash in the latest failed spring football league, Lee said, was (a) how the 6-foot, 208-pounder wanted to be coached, and (b) how Lee insisted he play.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to treat you like an NFL quarterback. I\u2019m not going to say, \u201cPull it down and run it.\u201d I want you to go through your progressions. I want you to read what you\u2019re supposed to read. I don\u2019t want you just looking to run, and looking at the rush.\u2019\n\u201cI told him we\u2019d seen enough of that.\u201d\nHow did Manziel, a noted lover of such freelancing, react to that edict? Differently than in the past, apparently.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s how I want to be coached, Coach. I want to be coached just like in the NFL. I want to be coached hard.\u2019 So he was ready for a change. He wanted to be coached differently.\n\u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t want a best friend as a coach. All the other coaches I\u2019ve had have always been my best friend. Coach me hard.\u2019 Gosh, he was so willing to do what we wanted him to do.\u201d\nSo, the thing everyone wants to know: Is Manziel good enough to get another shot in the NFL?\n\u201cHe can still play,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI can\u2019t say what happened at his other three (pro stops). Probably it was him. He didn\u2019t have his mind right, or his heart right, or something. All that crap he went through maybe got him to that humble point.\n\u201cYeah, I think he can (play in the right NFL environment). Right now he is willing to sit there in the pocket and throw it. That\u2019s what I told him in that first meeting. I told him, \u2018This is why I turned you down when I was with the New York Jets. I said to him, \u2018I watched your Alabama game, and you\u2019re staring right at open receivers about eight times, yet you take off and run. Now, you\u2019d make plays, but I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you right now that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t put you on our list for the Jets, because you break down the continuity of the passing game. And that\u2019s not pro football. These defensive ends are as fast as you are. You\u2019re not playing in the Big 12 anymore.\u2019\n\u201cI said, \u2018Until you can beat somebody from the pocket, I don\u2019t know if you can play in the NFL or not.\u2019\u201d\nAnd Manziel\u2019s reaction to that harsh but honest verbal punch to the nose?\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean when I say he was so willing to do it,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe\u2019d then go, \u2018Coach, MAKE me do it. I WANT to do it.\u2019 So that\u2019s how we started. It was great. His attitude was awesome every day I had him, from the minute he walked in. He really wanted this. Bad.\u201d\nLee\u2019s advice for Manziel going forward, after the AAF\u2019s demise, was simple.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Get your agent busy and line up tryouts with the NFL. Convince them to look at the tape, to show them that you can still play. And convince them you want to do it their way, by doing it in the pocket \u2013 but, to use your legs too when the time is right.\u2019\u201d\nIf he\u2019s asked by any NFL talent evaluator whether he\u2019d advise giving Manziel another shot, Lee said simply:\n\u201cI\u2019d say do it, yeah. Yes sir.\u201d\nAudibling out of QB draw underscores Manziel\u2019s on-field challenge\nOne instance during his two-week stint with the now-defunct Memphis Express of the dearly departed AAF perhaps best revealed what Johnny Manziel has to learn, and embrace, if he\u2019s ever going to succeed if given a second crack at an NFL career.\n\u201cWe had a quarterback draw put in for him on one play, OK?\u201d said David Lee, offensive coordinator and QB coach of the Express, until the whole league folded Tuesday.\nThe play occurred in practice just last week.\n\u201cThe defence just happened to be playing press cover-1. We had a quarterback draw called, and he looked out at his receiver and (audibled into) a go route, against bump-man. And he threw it, and I kind of went off on him afterward: \u2018You can\u2019t do that!\u2019\n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018Why not? We did it on that other one?\u2019 I said, \u2018You CAN\u2019T. Our centre\u2019s blocking down field, chasing the mike linebacker, and you\u2019re throwing a go route!\u2019\n\u201cBut those are the kinds of things that he would test you on, because it\u2019s something he\u2019d done in the past. Those kind of challenges were with him every once in a while. He\u2019d go off the reservation, if you let him.\u201d\nJoKryk@postmedia.com\n@JohnKryk\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "9 top moments of Game of Thrones season eight episode one Here are the best moments of Game of Thrones season eight episode one\nGame of Thrones season eight finally aired after a nearly two-year wait on Monday, and the opening episode gave fans plenty of new things to talk about as the characters prepare to take on the army of the dead. Take a look at the best moments in the opening episode but be warned \u2013 MAJOR spoilers ahead for season eight, episode one.\nThe opening credits\nFans of the show (who don't skip the credits, that is), are used to seeing the miniature versions of Westeros build up, depicting which area of the world the characters are in at the time. But for the final series, this has been given a whole new makeover. Beginning at the broken down Wall, the new world now depicts that winter is here, and it is BEAUTIFUL.\nSansa Stark, Lady of Shade\nJon Snow might have bent the knee to Daenerys Targaryen, but Sansa certainly hasn't, and she is not pleased that a would-be usurper has brought her giant army and giant dragons into her ancestral home. Sansa has learned not to trust anyone but her family, and is absolutely not going to accept Daenerys as her queen just because Dany tells her she is. While we massively respect Sansa for her stance, we're also a bit worried about how the Mother of Dragons is going to deal with this slight. She's burned men to death for less\u2026\nReunions, reunions everywhere\nEpisode one was all about bringing the characters together, and the writers got all of the key reunions out of the way quickly \u2013 giving fans something to scream over while getting the inevitable confrontations or emotional get-togethers over and done with. Most notably, former wedded couple Tyrion and Sansa spoke, and Sansa pointed out (accurately), that there was no way Cersei would ever bring her army to Winterfell, once again proving she's the smartest character in Winterfell right now. Jon reunited with (and was confused by) Bran, and had a lovely moment with Arya \u2013 which was perhaps the most anticipated reunion among Thrones fans and definitely worth the wait.\nArya and Gendry are ON\nSpeaking of reunions, Arya met up with Gendry so that he would make her a dragon glass dagger (all the better for killing White Walkers), and the pair most definitely did some flirting. Plenty of fans already see these two as 'end game', so could we be seeing the beginnings of a new Baratheon/Stark alliance? Either way, the viewers were loving it. One person wrote: \"Since I can't write about Jaime and Brienne, I'm gonna write about how #GameofThrones finally did some ship setup right. Tell me that Arya/Gendry [expletive] wasn't some [one true pairing] SETUP AND I'LL CALL YOU A LIAR. #Gendrya.\" Another person added: \"GENDRY AND ARYA FLIRTING. I AM CRYING ON THE FLOOR #GameOfThrones #ThronesYall.\"\nTheon steps up\nTheon is BACK. After literally jumping ship when his uncle Euron ambushed them and took Yara prisoner, Theon took 20 good men to King's Landing while Euron was, ahem, distracted, and rescued his sister and his Queen. She head-butts him for leaving her, and then they're friends again and she gives him leave to go and fight at Winterfell. Cue another extremely awkward reunion with Bran!\nCersei wants an elephant\nPossibly one of the most hilarious moments of the first episode is when Cersei meets her new army, the Golden Company, and laments that they didn't bring their elephants from Essos with them, because, 'elephants are too heavy for the boats'. Cersei is pretty devastated by the revelation \u2013 and fans loved her reaction to the bad news. One person wrote: \"Game of Thrones spoiler: Cersei hearts elephants,\" while another person added: \"Cersei's obsession with the elephants is hilarious. And surprisingly relatable.\"\nDragon riders\nJon trying a trip on a dragon for the first time was both funny and really sweet, particularly considering we know what we know (that he was born to be riding dragons, he's Aegon Targaryen). It also showed how his relationship with Daenerys has developed, and basically the pair are completely in love with each other. It was almost upsetting watching them race each other on the dragons while knowing that they were inevitably about to find out the truth about Jon's parentage. Speaking of\u2026\nTHE MOMENT. THE. MOMENT.\n\"I wasn't a king.\"\n\"You were. You've always been.\"\nSamwell Tarly, justly upset that Daenerys had burned his father and brother alive, finally tells Jon the truth about his parents \u2013 a moment book fans have been waiting decades for \u2013 aptly in front of Ned's statue in the crypts of Winterfell. It's actually pretty heartbreaking that Jon's first reaction is that his father, the man he admired more than anyone, had lied to him for his entire life. Then there's a question of the Iron Throne \u2013 if Jon's claim is better than Daenerys', will she be willing to bend the knee to him? We're going to say no.\nJaime arrives at Winterfell\nJust as the episode begins with a young boy climbing over Winterfell to see the arrival of the army, which is a throwback to the first ever episode of season one, the episode concluded the same way too \u2013 with Jaime and Bran coming face to face. Of course, this is the first time Jaime has seen Bran since he pushed him out of a window, and Bran knows all about what he did. Good thing that he's an emotionless Three-Eyed Raven now, or those two would be having words.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "State officials publicly apologized to WrestleMania 35 fans who were left out in the rain Monday night waiting for NJ Transit trains to take them home, and said the agency has to learn to work around concerts and sports at MetLife Stadium that run late.\nCommissioner Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti formally apologized Wednesday night \u201cto all of our customers\u201d who affected by long wait for trains from MetLife Stadium early Monday night after the conclusion of WrestleMania 35.\n\u201cWe are working with our partners at MetLife Stadium to ease these unforeseen circumstances,\u201d she said.\nEarlier Wednesday, former Gov. Chris Christie said someone in Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s administration needed to apologize for NJ Transit\u2019s lackluster performance. That job fell to the commissioner, who previously stepped up to apologize to commuters on behalf of the administration after a nasty Nov. 15 snow storm turned the evening commutes in to a multi-hour ordeal for many.\n\u201cFrom the board, from the dais, we want to make certain we extend those apologies to our customers,\u201d Gutierrez-Scaccetti said at NJ Transit\u2019s board of directors meeting.\nNJ Transit debacle over WrestleMania 35 should get Super Bowl-style investigation, ranking senator says A ranking Democrat said a full report, similar to one done after SuperBowl LXVIII, needs to be done about NJ Transit's post-Wrestlemania 35 rail problems.\nThe agency will work with MetLife Stadium administration to be flexible when events run long, she and NJ Transit Executive Director Kevin Corbett said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch the morning right after (WrestleMania) with their management to see what flexibility we can give them for events that run longer,\u201d Corbett said after the meeting. \u201cIf Bruce Springsteen wants to play for two hours longer, then we have to figure out a way to accommodate that, while being compliant (with federal rules) on rail side.\"\nNJ Transit officials blamed the rail problems on WrestleMania 35 ending two hours later than the 10:30 p.m., end time the agency said it has been told. World Wrestling Entertainment officials disputed that, saying the event had no set ending time.\nHowever, NJ Transit officials said Monday\u2019s WrestleMania ended later than WrestleMania 29, also held at MetLife stadium in April 2013. WWE officials could not be reached to confirm that.\n\u201cObviously, the difference in timing from 2013 and 2019 is when the event ended and the FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) regulation requiring no more than 12 hours (service) for engineers,\u201d Corbett said. By 1 a.m., (Monday) that was a problem.\u201d\nThe Meadowland rail line between the stadium and Secaucus Junction rail station has other operating limits. The line can handle 8,000 to 10,000 passenger and hour, Corbett said. Trains also take longer to make a round-trip because the engineer has to move to the opposite end of the train and do a brake test, he said.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NATO is preparing a package of measures to counter Russia in the Black Sea region. This package includes the deployment of NATO warships to the Black Sea to guarantee \u2018passage\u2019 of Ukrainian ships via the Kerch Strait, U.S. ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison stressed during a press briefing on April 2.\nHutchison said that the prepared package \u201cbeefs up the surveillance, both air surveillance as well as more of the NATO country ships going into the Black Sea to assure that there is safe passage from Ukrainian vessels through the Kerch Straits, the Sea of Azov\u201d.\nEarlier the US State Department announced that the Black Sea package is a response to the challenges the US and NATO face in the region, \u201cnot merely because of the Kerch Strait incident,\u201d but because \u201cRussia is threatening the alliance all along the eastern flank, not just in the north.\nThe public announcement of a possible NATO operation in the Kerch Strait is itself a move undermining the shaky stability created after the incident of November 25, 2018, when Russian coastal guards detained 3 ships of the Ukrainian Navy, which were attempting to enter the Kerch Strait in a way which violated the established norms and rules. Then, Moscow\u2019s actions gave rise to large-scale hysteria in mainstream and Ukrainian media outlets. However, the situation developed no further. Ukraine\u2019s \u201cpartners\u201d limited their response to formal declarations. It was clear that the Kiev government was the side that had provoked the conflict. Before and after the Kerch Strait incident Ukrainian ships were passing the strait after going through the formal procedures established in this area.\nIf NATO naval forces together with or in some form assisting Ukrainian forces were to make an attempt to break through the Kerch Strait by force violating the established rules of passage, this would be seen by Moscow as an aggressive military action, which would provoke an equivalent response. In other words, a military clash could be expected. In such an event, the situation might escalate further. The media and political importance of such developments could be compared with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which became the formal pretext for the start of the First World War or the annexation of the Sudetenland by Nazi Germany before the start of the Second World War.\nAt the beginning of 2019, it seemed that despite the unfriendly rhetoric between the United States and Russia, there were actually no valid reasons for organizing the next armed incident, at a minimum, or in the worst case, for starting a war. However, there are a number of factors which may nudge Washington towards pushing for an escalation in the Black Sea region.\n1. On March 25, President Donald Trump officially signed a declaration recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel. This step met with a negative reaction from almost all important regional and international players. The Trump administration has now destroyed one of the last fragments of the post-World War 2 international security system. This action as well as previous blatant violations of international law will have negative consequences for the entire system of international security and international law. Following this, global players can be less and less concerned about even the formal justification of their actions from the point of view of international law and can increasingly rely on military power, sanctions and informational pressure, coups and other \u201chybrid\u201d methods to achieve their goals. As we see, Washington is the forerunner in the employment of such approaches. Now, the White House is interested in diverting international attention from the current situation and from the expected consequences of Golan-style decisions.\n2. The failure of the Venezuelan blitzkrieg forced Washington to reconsider the approaches employed to force regime change. The inability of the US to fully delegitimize and overthrow the Maduro government is based on several factors:\nthe insufficient support from the local population for the US puppet;\nthe decision of the military to support the legitimate government;\nthe resolution of Maduro himself and his inner circle, who unlike the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, were not prepared to sit by indifferently while power was seized by the henchmen of external forces.\nThe strong stand of China and Russia in support of Venezuela and the surprising inability of the Trump administration to set up a strong anti-Venezuelan coalition even at the regional level. So far, most of the US regime change partners have limited their participation to formal declarations or, like Columbia, to a lack of opposition to the actions of US agents.\nSo, the US operation has entered a new phase. The economic and diplomatic pressure on the Maduro government has increased, and the country has experienced a series of large-scale \u201caccidents\u201d targeting critical objects of the energy infrastructure. The Maduro government openly blamed hostile actions by the US for the recent series of blackouts. There are signals that the US is preparing for a military operation in the region, on its own or within the framework of a formally created coalition to put an end to the resistance of Caracas. To ensure the success of this operation, Washington has to carry out actions on the periphery to distract attention from the Venezuelan issue.\n3. The situation in Ukraine ahead of the second round of the presidential election is not stable. Experts and analysts have serious doubts that Poroshenko actually gained fairly the 16%, which allowed him to proceed to the second round. It is suggested that from 3 to 8% may have been obtained fraudulently. Even if the incumbent president really did get 16% of the vote, the entire structure of voting demonstrated that the Ukrainians are frustrated by the destructive policy of the ruling regime and the status as a Western colony obtained by Ukraine in 2014. The arbitrary development of this situation could create conditions in which the US and the associated European bureaucracy would lose their influence in Ukraine, and as a result, the money spent on bringing Kiev to vassalage. In the event of the escalation of the political struggle, a possible outcoume could even be that Ukraine would split further into two political antagonists along the west-east line. If the Washington establishment wants to keep the situation under control, it must create the conditions in which Poroshenko could achieve victory. Or should Vladimir Zelensky win, he must be limited in his ability to maneuver and de-escalate relations and even start a dialogue with Russia. He must also be prevented from starting a more or less independent dialogue, ie not that of a vassal, with the European Union.\nA military provocation in the Kerch Strait with the support of NATO warships would be suitable for achieving all the goals just described. Moreover, the logic of NATO\u2019s actions includes damage to the infrastructure of the Crimean Bridge or at least its significant damage during the incident. This would have a resounding informational effect and would create significant problems for the economy of Crimea.\nAnother interesting point is the declaration that Russia \u201cis threatening the alliance all along the eastern flank, not just in the north\u201d. The entire format of such rhetoric raises eyebrows. If, in the case of the northern front, such statements can be justified with the complex configuration around Kaliningrad and the specific historical experience of the Baltic countries and Poland with Russia, the statement about the Russian threat in the south is a rude propaganda clich\u00e9.\nHutchison stressed that Russia is threatening \u201cRomania, Bulgaria, and Ukraine, as well as Georgia\u201d. But there are some issues. Georgia is separated from Russia by mountains, is not a NATO country and does not experience territorial claims from Russia. Moreover, Russia still categorically refuses to consider the inclusion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into its own territory. Almost 30 years have passed since the actual independence of these republics, and almost 11 years since the last aggressive war unleashed by Georgia with the support of NATO. Ukraine is also not a NATO country, and recent years have shown that Moscow has no desire to conduct full-scale military operations on its territory. Bulgaria and Romania do not have a land border with Russia and both states have working bilateral relations with Moscow. Even more strikingly, US statements do not even mention the second most significant military state of NATO, the country whose military potential exceeds the combined military potential of Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Greece \u2013 Turkey, which by the way, is located on the southern flank of the military bloc. This statement by a representative of the Washington establishment is another vulgar example of Psaki-style rhetoric that has little to do with democratic values, freedom, or a desire for justice. They themselves do not believe in it. They know only that a few others do believe in it. Thus they simply mock the masses, who they consider to be sheep. Such statements demonstrate that Washington is seriously considering conducting aggressive actions in the near future in several directions at once.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

{"text": "Nassarawa State Governor-elect Abdullahi Sule spoke on a live Television Continental progamme, \u2018The Platform\u2019, anchored by SAM OMATSEYE, on his victory, vision, and challenges of governing the Northcentral state.\nWhen the presidential election results came out, a record was broken. President Buhari has never won in this state won, but it was a cliff hanger; a 6, 000 vote. How did it feel going into the governorship?\nFirst and foremost, we thank God Almighty for giving us the opportunity to even get to this state. I think you have to look at the history of how it all started for Buhari in Nasarawa State. Buhari has never won election since 2003 when he started in Nasarawa State but gradually, he kept improving.\nIn 2011 when the CPC won, Buhari actually left just roughly about a hundred and something votes. By the time it went to 2015 when he also lost, he now lost very very marginally. So, it was expected that if it was going to go in that train of improvement, even if Buhari would win, it was going to be just maginally. You have to understand that Nasarawa State has been historically a PDP state. There were a lot of people who understand nothing but PDP and as a result of that you know, they were looking at it from that direction. So, yes, it was by a cliff hanger as you said, but we are glad, at least, that he won and historically because a lot of people who are naturally also in PDP had now joined to participate to vote for Buhari. But, more importantly, the governor had done a wonderful job that people now see and that is why he had the slogan \u201cseeing is believing.\u201d Also, people had seen a lot when it comes to the Buhari administration itself. He has done alot in the area of security, in the area of economy and, of course, you know all the other areas that the president mentioned that they were going to work on.\nYou are the transition mode to become governor. How is it like looking towards it and also anticipating it at the same time?\nI have been in different kinds of transition. May be, this is the first time that I have been in transition of governance. You know I was in a transition where when we bought a company, we came in as management and we were going to take over from that management and it was a transition period. So, and I notice what it means during transition. You have more or less a period of tension because a lot of things that you were trying to\u2026 you were so much eager to understand certain things and people were so eager not to disclose certain things to you. So, I understand what it means to go through a transition. In this case, however, it is a little different because it is an APC governor \u2013elect taken over from a very dominant APC governor who has also done well. If he had done the other way round then the question would have been more investigated during the process.\nThis is a question of a governor that has done so well and you are trying as much as possible to learn from the good things he did so you can be able to build on top of that, that is the type of transition we are having.\nYou worked in the US. You also schooled in the US. You schooled here and you also worked in the US and you worked here. You are also known to have done very well in turning African petroleum around from loss to profitability, some people say that is good resume. But, that is not governance in its sense. How do you think we can convert that experience to governance because in the corporate world, one plus one equals two in governance one plus one could be minus one?\nYes, if you look at the history of governance worldwide, you will see where people that have come from the private sector have also participated in turning governance around. No governance is an island and there is nobody who is coming into a government and thinks that he is going to be the only person turning the entire thing around. Even in African Petroleum, I didn\u2019t turn African Petroleum alone. In Dangote, when we moved Dangote from less than 100 billion to over 250 billion, I didn\u2019t turn it around. What we did was that we put a team together. It is a combination of this team that was able to team together, focus together, vision together, had a mission together and worked together towards turning the entire system around and I think it is the same thing that is going to happen to me in governance. We had a governor also who came in from the private sector and he was able to do a lot more than those who were dominantly in politics from what we saw in Nasarawa State and I have my energy from there. I have my aggressiveness from there believing that I can also do the same or better by putting a comprehensive team together that will support with all the idea. All the vision so that we can build into one vision and be able to turn the company around.\nI have absolutely no doubt in my mind that coming from a private sector will not be a disadvantage. In fact, it is the other way round. I strongly believe that coming from a private sector is going to be more advantageous because we are going to reduce inefficiency. We are going to reduce waste. We are going to encourage productivity and we are going to reward performance. If we go in that direction, we are going to generate revenue for the state, which the state badly needs, without necessarily infringing on the rights and privileges of any other persons. So, hose are the areas that we strongly believe we can work on.\nWhat is your focus? Your predecessor did a lot in terms of infrastructure work, education and stuff. Where are you going to focus?\nWe are going to build industries. The number one thing is industrialization is actually security in the state. We are focusing more on the areas of security to make sure that people live in peace. People can leave their homes for their farms. They will be able to work and come back home safely. With that in mind, then, we focus on industrialisation.\nIndustrialisation doesn\u2019t mean building factories, doesn\u2019t mean coming to build big industries. That is not just industrialisation; it is a complete and comprehensive economic development of the state. The state has a lot of potentials, not only in minerals, but also in land and the accessibility to the FCT. Our intention is to focus on that area so that the industrialisation that we have in mind will create a massive economic activity in the state, bring about employment opportunities. All these so-called minerals that we have that are in totally in control of the Federal Government so that we can jointly work together and make a progress. A good example I give is the hydro carbo presence that we have in Kalla which we are already working seriously on. We know that it belongs to the Federal Government, but we at the state are going to put a lot of efforts to make sure that it materialises. We will bring up all our ideas because we are very interested in that 30 per cent that is going to come from there and we believe that those are the areas that are going to create the activity for economic and IGR for the state.\nIn the lst eight years, we had herdsmen crisis and the overflow of IDPs from neighbouring states. There is also the tension increasingly created by the fact that you are close to the FCT and there is an overflow of people from the FCT into Nasarawa State. How do you now navigate this kind of tension?\nOur ethnic diversity is our strength and that\u2019s the approach that I want to do. On the inflow of people coming in from other states to places like Kalu, Keffi and others that you mentioned, the first part that you mentioned about feeling of the sense of belonging, our governor had made a commitment and being the kind of person he is, he was able to meet that commitment. He said he wanted to practice fairness, which is the whole thing about our political party, the APC, he said since others have already tested power, he wanted to use the opportunity to support somebody from our zone. Well, God is so kind and I thank the governor and everyone who participated to support that mission that our zone had the opportunity to produce a governor. So, at least, that should now dampen the tension that is there, which you were referring to.\nThe question of Mbaise and the others that you mentioned, these are issues that are very similar to many.The herdsmen you mentioned, for instance, and I think government had done its own best to ensure that they were able to contend with them in Nasarawa State. So, even with the inflow of the IDPs, which you mentioned from the neighbouring states that we have, it has not actually escalated to a level beyond control. So, the government was able to contend with it and manage it and being able to ensure that peace and security remains in the state and that is why in my early comment, I said that security is actually job. We want to make sure that people are secured, people are united, people understand the purpose of living together and the meaning of living in peace so that development can come.\nNow, the second part you mentioned about the inflow we are having. Today, in Karu, there are more foreigners, if you want o put it that way, non Nasarawa indigenes living in Karu than the Nasarawa State indigenes living in Karu, and they are both there.I think it is an advantage. I think Nasarawa State is not blessed with a lot of who have the capacities to build industries, who have the capacity to do other things. It is in situations like that we need the people.\nThat is why America is what it is today. America relied on the Chinese, American-Japanese, American- Germans, American-Indian, Americans all coming in to turn round America. That is why we say African-American in general. These were the people that came together to make American what it is called and made America what it is.\nSo, for me, I have the dream that if at all any local government in Nasarawa State will have that kind of opportunity , it is Karu that will start and coincidentally, just yesterday, the Ezu Karu, the leader came and he did a fantastic visit to me. When he was coming, he didn\u2019t come alone. He came with all his kingmakers who were Gbagi people. In addition to that, he came with all the other king makers for other ethnic tribes- Igbos, itsekiri, all the tribes outside Nasarawa State. He brought them along with him and they were all seated there with him and he said this is Karu family and I was very happy, very excited to receive them the way they are. So, I think that\u2019s what the second part it.\nI went to Maraba. I went to Massaka. On my own, I discovered there are a lot of small industries here and there; soap making factory, water factory, juice making factory, some beverages, all in small scale and 90 per cent of them are not owned by people from Nasarawa State. So, I don\u2019t want to keep these people away. We want to open our hands and welcome these people to come in and help us develop our states. The only way you can do this is to let them feel at home. By giving them opportunity to be part of that, it will help us to develop our state. It will help us to generate revenue. It will help us to create employment for our people. More importantly, it will help us to train our own people so that they can go and get jobs outside Nasarawa State.\nYou have spoken glowingly about Tanko Al-Makura, and in an interview with me, he spoke glowingly about you and about your competence, resume, pedigree and so on. We have seen how tension has always existed between god father and godson, predecessor and successor and so on. How are you guys going to make your relationship friendly?\nThe issue really with me, and I am afraid and I don\u2019t want it to look negative on any other way; because of my training, because of where I come from, I always try to avoid the word god fatherism because I don\u2019t want to have a god father in politics. I really don\u2019t and there were a lot of people when I just got back to Nigeria from the US, they would say Atiku Abubakar is my godfather and later on, they said Aliko Dangote was my godfather. Today, it is likely people will say oh, Tanko Al-Makura is my godfather. But, if you go to them,they will talk glowingly about me and the reason why they will do that is because I went in there, I did my job as engineer Abdullahi Sule, I did my job within the context of what I was supposed to do and after I finished, I left and that is exactly the way I intend to approach it here. I don\u2019t intend to approach it outside it. I think a god father is the one who will give you money, power; he will seize things and give to you. I have seen a movie, the godfather. So, for me, that\u2019s the way I explain a godfather. I may be wrong and if that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t want to have that kind of thing and I don\u2019t want to have just that because I don\u2019t want to be treated like a godson where I will be dictated to because I have a vision, I have a mission and I want to be guided.\nWhat the governor has done to me, I will never ever forget because he supported me the time I needed the support very badly. We had 11 contestants. Everyone of us eminently qualified to do this, but as a human being, there is no way you can support 11 people. You had to pick one and state your reason for supporting him and it happened to be me and I am forever grateful to him and I believe very strongly that I will continue to do that. But more importantly, I think the governor has done a wonderful job and if you look at the state, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what you want to say, you must say that he did a good job. So, you can abuse him, you can call him names and do whatever you wish to do, but you can\u2019t take away from him what God has gifted him with and that is the good work that he has done for Nasarawa State. He changed the landscape of Nasarawa State. So, is it not something I want to throw away. I don\u2019t want him to be a god father. Any good thing that he did that I believe I can use, I will take it and I will use it; anything that he did so bad and I don\u2019t believe in it, I will keep it away.\nI work for the Dangote family, and many times I argued with Alhaji Aliko Dangote. Certain things he brought that I don\u2019t like, I refused. Sometimes, he wanted me to sign certain cheques, I refused to sign and he knew me as that and he respected me also for that. So, that\u2019s the type of stubbornness that I also have inside me because of my own training, my own background and things like that.\nBut, it is not rudeness. It is just that to a certain extent ,I am an independent person. I know where I am going. I will look for advice. I will look for everything I can get to do that, but not to the extent of taking whatever is just thrown at me. I am not just that type of guy.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The star government witness in the torture-style killing of a former Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club member is the man who wielded the fatal blow with a baseball bat strike to the head, a defense lawyer said in court Thursday.\nThe prosecution\u2019s case largely rests on the words of the actual murderer, Tiler Evan Pribbernow, who has cooperated with the government, said attorney Matthew Schindler, who represents one of the co-defendants in the case.\nSchindler called it \u201coutrageous\u201d that prosecutors would allow Pribbernow to plead guilty to only racketeering to leverage his testimony against others. The deal allows Pribbernow to avoid accountability for the killing and save his own life by avoiding a potential death sentence, the lawyer said.\n\u201cTiler Pribbernow did it because he\u2019s a lunatic. That\u2019s why,\u201d Schindler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen one witness statement, and that statement is the statement of the murderer. \u2026 He killed this guy.\u201d\nRacketeering, kidnapping and murder charges are pending against five others in the 2015 death of Robert \u201cBagger\u201d Huggins, 56. Loggers found his battered body dumped in a Clark County field. He had a fractured skull, a broken rib, a broken leg, a removed nipple, nails driven through his boots, slash wounds to his back and face and many blows to his face, authorities said.\nSchindler was arguing for the pretrial release of his client, Ryan Anthony Negrinelli, now 36. At the time of the killing, Negrinelli was a \u201cprospect\u2019\u2019 to join the club. After the killing, he became a full member who went by the nickname \u201cStriker\u201d before splitting from the club in mid-2018, a prosecutor said.\nSchindler said the government has no physical evidence placing Negrinelli at the scene. Negrinelli has no prior criminal record, he said. The lawyer also pointed to Negrinelli\u2019s full custody of his 14-year-old daughter and ties to the community.\nU.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones ordered Negrinelli to remain in custody, citing the gravity of the alleged offense. But the judge said he wasn\u2019t willing to let the defendants languish in county jail indefinitely while waiting for \u201csome bureaucrat\u2019\u2019 at the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., to \u201cmake up their mind\u201d and decide whether to pursue the death penalty in the case. He said he was told it could take up to a year for the decision, and that\u2019s not acceptable.\nSchindler also urged the judge to discount Negrinelli\u2019s statement to two Portland detectives after his arrest, saying it should be suppressed because the detectives failed to acknowledge Negrinelli\u2019s repeated requests for a lawyer, placed him in a holding cell for eight hours without food and then plied him with leading information about the attack. Negrinelli also told the detectives he suffered from a childhood brain injury that impairs his memory.\nThe judge said he\u2019d rule on a motion to suppress any statements at a later date.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Leah Bolstad said Negrinelli was involved in a \u201cpremeditated, planned hunt of someone who angered the group he was part of.\u201d\nAccording to Pribbernow, Portland\u2019s Gypsy Jokers president Mark Leroy Dencklau ordered the attack on Huggins and others helped. The June 30, 2015, kidnapping and subsequent killing was in retaliation for Huggins\u2019 burglary and robbery at Dencklau\u2019s Woodburn home earlier that month, the government alleges. Dencklau is also charged in the killing.\nHuggins had targeted Dencklau\u2019s home after getting kicked out of the club for stealing and breaking club rules, Bolstad said. Dencklau\u2019s then-girlfriend was tied up and Huggins stole some of Dencklau\u2019s property, including guns, the prosecutor said.\nWhile Pribbernow is a key witness and has implicated co-defendants, he\u2019s not the only witness, Bolstad said. Information Pribbernow shared with investigators has been corroborated, including use of a Chevy Tahoe by some of the defendants to carry Huggins\u2019 body and dump him in Ridgefield, Wash., she said. DNA from blood found under carpet in the trunk of the Tahoe matched that of Huggins, she said.\nAccording to Bolstad, Negrinelli helped grabbed Huggins in the driveway of a Portland home and put him into an SUV, where he and four others beat him and drove him to a shed in Woodlawn, Wash.\nNegrinelli helped place Huggins in the shed, where the defendants continued to torture Huggins, according to Bolstad. In his own words, Negrinelli told Portland detectives after his arrest that he \u201cblasted,\u2019\u2019 or punched, Huggins a few times, Bolstad said.\nNegrinelli also used water-boarding on Huggins, placing a scarf over his mouth and pouring water into it, triggering a choking response, Bolstad said. He also helped apply burning hot wire to Huggins\u2019 body, she said.\nWhile others dumped Huggins\u2019 body, Negrinelli and two co-defendants drove away in another car to discard weapons, throwing baseball bats into brush off the side of a road, Bolstad said.\nWhile the prosecutor said there\u2019s surveillance video of the initial assault and kidnapping of Huggins in Portland, Schindler said the neighbor\u2019s security video is of poor quality and it\u2019s impossible to make out who is on the video or what is occurring.\nSchindler questioned how Negrinelli could be considered a danger to the community when the murder case languished in state court for more than two years before it was dismissed and prosecuted in federal court instead.\nKenneth Earl Hause, the national president of the Gypsy Jokers Outlaw Motorcycle Club, is the only one of the defendants who was released from jail this year to home detention with electric monitoring as he awaits trial. Hause\u2019s circumstances are different, Bolstad argued, because Hause is charged only in the alleged racketeering conspiracy and not with murder.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nEmail at mbernstein@oregonian.com\nFollow on Twitter @maxoregonian\nVisit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WELL, here we are again in the long-running production of Sartre\u2019s Huis Clos (usually translated as No Brexit) in which not only the characters on stage but the audience are required to suffer indefinitely. The play\u2019s most famous line is \u201cL\u2019enfer, c\u2019est les autres\u201d, a sentiment that, alas, far too many people have adopted as their motto, given the way in which quite moderate positions are now described as \u201cbetrayal\u201d or \u201ctreachery\u201d, while those previously considered extremely marginal \u2013 such as a total ban on immigration, tariffs and regulation, or a United States of Europe, complete with army, common currency and unified legal system \u2013 are presented as if no reasonable person could doubt their desirability and inevitability.\nThose who claimed that negotiation would be easy can\u2019t have thought about the etymology of the word, which derives from the Latin for \u201cnot leisure\u201d. Few could have anticipated, though, what hard work it would be if you gave charge of it to someone whose primary qualities are an obtuse inability to understand the issues and a stubborn refusal to listen to anyone else, or acknowledge basic facts. But thanks to Theresa May and the red lines she\u2019s drawn up, to a pattern that makes no sense and bears no resemblance to anything mandated by the referendum result, we\u2019re at the point where anything that does get negotiated can be guaranteed to be unsatisfactory.\nShe wanted an extension of six weeks, the EU wanted either none at all or a year, and the compromise is six months, with the deadline set for Halloween, a date for which all the hot takes and lame jokes will have been made by the time you read this. Whether it will have numerous sequels or desperate attempts to reboot the franchise is anyone\u2019s guess.\nWhat it does in the meantime is horrifying enough. The main parties had been steeling themselves for terrible results in the local elections for Northern Ireland and many English boroughs on May 2; now they also have, barring some miracle, elections to the European Parliament (the one we were supposed to be out of) on the 22nd.\nWe can predict that these polls will be a nightmare for the parties, because no one in his right senses would want to vote for either the Conservatives or Labour under their current leaders. As evidence, see the recent by-election in Newport West, where turnout was down 30 per cent, and the two main parties\u2019 share of the vote (previously 91 per cent) fell to 71 per cent. Indeed, unless both parties get rid of their stubborn and obstructive leaders, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that an election of any kind would even allow most people to express whatever their current opinion is.\nAnd before we even get to the noted haruspex Sir John Curtice fishing around in the entrails of the results, we can also predict that they will tell us nothing very useful. That\u2019s not just because a vote for the Tories (with opinions ranging from Dominic Grieve to Mark Francois) or Labour (Kate Hoey to David Lammy) won\u2019t actually disclose the electorate\u2019s opinion on Brexit. Nor just because both pro-Remain fanatics and monomaniacal Brexiters will have a range of oddball fringe parties to choose from: ChangeUK, the Brexit Party, Renew, Prosper UK and the latest incarnations of Ukip and the SDP will be lining up alongside mainstream parties \u2013 the LibDems, SNP, Greens \u2013 that, along with their faithful supporters, traditionally cater for protest voters.\nThere is also the likelihood that many Leave voters will simply refuse to turn out \u2013 part of the reason Leave won, after all, is generally thought to be that it persuaded non-voters there was an issue where their voices, unrepresented by the main parties, could finally be heard. If your opinion is that we\u2019re back to the normal business of ignoring unfashionable political opinions, it\u2019s understandable that you might be too disgusted to vote for anyone.\nThis, naturally, would suit Euroenthusiasts fine, since they think that the great unwashed had no business voting the wrong way in the first place, and should either keep away from the polling booth because they are stupid and racist, or hurry up and die because they are old and out of touch.\nDiehard Remainers have, in any case, not stopped campaigning since they lost the vote, rather as committed Scottish nationalists (unsurprisingly) didn\u2019t give up trying after their bid for independence was rejected. This follows the well-established EU principle that the wrong votes, such as those in Denmark, Ireland, Greece and Italy, should be rerun or ignored. One interesting aspect of Brexit, though, has been that Brussels, if it is secretly taking that position, doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s explicitly trying to reverse the decision, though its demands may amount to that in effect: the noisiest wrecking attempts have been domestic.\nThe SNP\u2019s argument is that, since the majority in Scotland rejected Brexit, the democratic thing to do is ignore the fact that the majority of those who constituted the electorate in the referendum approved it. And also, handily, that it provides a mandate for another referendum to contradict yet another referendum where the voters got it wrong. But at least that\u2019s consistent with its general purpose.\nThere\u2019s no such fig leaf for those, like Anna Soubry or David Lammy, or for that matter Tony Blair and John Major, who want a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d (which they assume will be a vote to Remain) or to revoke the whole thing. Their position is not selectively picking some apparent majority, in Scotland or London or Gibraltar. It\u2019s just flatly arguing for ignoring the result.\nAll elections are people\u2019s votes, of course. Whether there\u2019s a tiny turnout for the election of MEPs or a huge one, and whether it\u2019s a landslide for Remainers or for No Deal Brexiters or \u2013 as with all votes so far on the subject \u2013 indecisive and at the same time divisive, it will almost certainly be uninformative. It will also be pointless, since those elected will either serve for just a couple of months, or we\u2019ll still be watching Chuka Umunna and Nigel Farage, or similarly preposterous characters, yelling at each other in Brussels in five years\u2019 time. Perhaps Hell is not just other people, or other People\u2019s Votes, but all the other people\u2019s votes. It certainly seems like endless torment.\n", "label": "human"}

So they pulled out all the choreographed stops and angled fist-pumps for \u201cTearin\u2019 Up My Heart\u201d after the scintillating mashup of her song \u201cBreak Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored,\u201d which interpolates their No Strings Attached cut, \u201cIt Makes Me Ill.\u201d\nGrande continued with a few more songs off of Sweetener and an interlude featuring audio from Goldie Hawn in The First Wives Club (\u201cYou think just because I\u2019m a movie star, I don\u2019t have feelings.

Despite technical difficulties with Minaj\u2019s mic, the two worked up the crowd with the help of a small brigade of backup dancers that paraded around the stage\u2019s runway.\nGrande next performed \u201c7 Rings,\u201d featuring a car with an \u201cArichella\u201d tag, as well as a heartfelt rendition of \u201cBreathin'\u201d accompanied by a live orchestra.

{"text": "Warning: Minor SPOILERS ahead\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 2 offers some fresh connections to its sister show over on The CW, Riverdale. While there's no news of an actual crossover between the two shows yet, both Riverdale and Sabrina have waved to one another from afar and they appear to be set in the same universe - even if Sabrina's side is a little more supernatural.\nBoth Riverdale and The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina were created by Archie Comics CCO Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. They're both lifted from the pages of Archie Comics, and are both distributed internationally by Netflix (though Riverdale episodes air on The CW first). Riverdale has referenced Sabrina's home town of Greendale, with Archie and Jughead taking a nighttime road trip there in one particularly spooky season 2 episode. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has returned the favor, with season 1 dropping a reference to Riverdale High.\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view. Start quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nRelated: How A Riverdale & Sabrina Crossover Could Already Be Being Set Up\nIn season 2 the connections are still in the realm of being Easter eggs rather than actual plot links, but they subtly sell the idea that The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Riverdale are part of the same universe. Here are the major nods to Archie's world that we spotted.\nDr. Cerberus Sells Afterlife With Archie Comics\nThere are many things about Sabrina's world that are odd, not the least of which is the fact that Archie Comics exist in-universe. In The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 1, Sabrina was seen using a retro Archie Comics thermos flask, and in season 2 Afterlife With Archie comics are prominently displayed in Cerberus Books. Sabrina's ex-boyfriend Harvey can be seen buying the comics for himself in episode 2. Afterlife With Archie is also written by Aguirre-Sacasa, and is set in an alternative reality version of Riverdale where Sabrina, Archie and the gang accidentally kick off a zombie apocalypse. Of course, one could question why a shop in Greendale has comics featuring fictional versions of teens who live in a nearby town, but it's best not to overthink these things.\nSabrina and Ambrose Visit Sweetwater River\nSweetwater River played a prominent role in Riverdale season 1, as the fateful spot where Jason Blossom was found dead. Later that same season, Cheryl Blossom came close to joining her twin brother in Sweetwater River's frozen waters. In The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 2, Sabrina and Ambrose pay their own visit to Sweetwater River (though we don't actually see it) in an effort to build a golem, bring it to life, and then cast it into the river. The plan doesn't actually work out, and only succeeds in getting Sabrina covered in mud. Still, at least no one drowned.\nMandrake-Sabrina Has Blossom Maple Syrup on Her Pancakes\nSpeaking of the Blossoms, we get another taste of them in The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 2 when Sabrina creates a doppelganger from a mandrake. In true Men in Black form, the first thing the impostor wants is lots and lots of sugar, so she asks Aunt Hilda to make her blueberry pancakes and then proceeds to drown them in syrup. It's not just any syrup, though - it's Blossom maple syrup, the liquid gold that made the Blossom family so wealthy... with a little help from an illicit drug operation. Let's hope the Spellmans are only addicted to the syrup!\nMore: Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina Part 2 Review\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 2 is now available on Netflix.\nBiggest News From The Mandalorian Celebration Panel\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Much of Trump\u2019s career has been fueled by 9/11-related conspiracies, and the anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown because of them. Trump spread the false claim that Muslims cheered the 9/11 attacks. He suggested that former President Barack Obama might be a secret Muslim. One of his signature policies, a ban on immigrants and refugees from several predominantly Muslim countries, was widely perceived to be connected to past, inflammatory comments such as \u201cI think Islam hates us.\u201d\nIn the years following the September 11 attacks, as Trump was pushing conspiracies, equal and opposite effects were happening among American Muslims: a growing sense of fear, an urgent desire to distance themselves from violence, and, for some, a resolve to get involved in public service. Above all, there emerged \u201ca loyalty test, which demands that there be unequivocal denunciation of all these horrible tragedies,\u201d as Daisy Khan, a prominent Muslim speaker and advocate, described it to me.\nStarting in 2009, Khan, along with her husband, Feisal Abdul Rauf, an imam, advocated for the creation of an interfaith Islamic community center near the site of the destroyed Twin Towers, a project dubbed by opponents the \u201cGround Zero mosque.\u201d\nThe backlash was swift. \u201cWe were told, \u2018Not you, not here, not now,\u2019\u201d Khan said. That experience\u2014the way Muslims were pushed out of the collective American mourning process for 9/11\u2014reminds her of what\u2019s happening now with Omar. It\u2019s \u201cthe weaponizing of 9/11,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then, we had just a handful of people on the streets who were part of a network of people who had been fed a lot of disinformation\u201d about their project and about Muslims. \u201cNow it\u2019s \u2026 the most powerful man in the world.\u201d\nThe loyalty test has not gone away, she added: \u201cI think this is what Representative Omar forgot \u2026 The test, the burden, the cross that we have to bear is that at all times, we have to make sure we are voicing [condemnation of terrorism], saying it loud and clear.\u201d (Omar\u2019s office could not be reached for comment.)\n[Peter Beinart: Ilhan Omar\u2019s deeply American message]\nOmar seems to disagree with this approach to being a Muslim leader in public life. In other parts of her speech, which was delivered in March at an annual banquet for the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the congresswoman rejected the notion that American Muslims should bend over backwards to seem unthreatening. \u201cMuslims, for a really long time in this country, have been told that there is a privilege that we are given, and it might be taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are told that we should be appropriate. We should go to school, get an education, raise our children, and not bother anyone \u2026 Be a good Muslim.\u201d\nBut even with all of this work, she said at the time, Muslims have been denied their civil liberties. So she proposed a new model of Muslim political engagement. \u201cI say, Raise hell,\u201d she said. \u201cMake people uncomfortable.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "JEDDAH/DUBAI: Yemen\u2019s President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi on Saturday urged Iran-backed Houthi militias to \u201cstop giving our nation to our enemies.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it time to stop your crimes? Look around at the destruction you have caused,\u201d Hadi said at the first meeting of the country\u2019s Parliament since the Houthi coup in 2014.\nThe session took place in Seiyun in the eastern province of Hadhramaut, attended by 141 members, as well as international envoys and security personnel.\nSultan Al-Burkani, head of the General People\u2019s Congress party, was elected speaker.\n\"The Houthis have made the capital a place of chaos\", Al-Burkani said and asked officials to return to the temporary capital of Aden to fulfil their duties.\nIn his address, Hadi said that four months had passed since the Stockholm agreement and there had been no further progress.\n\"This meeting is convened during an extremely important and historic moment where we have to choose either peace or war,\" Hadi said.\n\"The Yemenis have recovered today, one of the most important institutions of their state, after a long journey of struggle, and they are in a station on the road to restoring their legitimate rights and the return of their stolen institutions,\" he said.\nThe president said that Houthi crimes must be exposed, adding that they do not understand peace.\nHe also called on government officials to resume their official duties.\n\"War is not just military, every governmental official who does not perform his job is betraying his nation. We have to perform our duty of protecting our country,\" he told the session.\n\"All the parliamentarians who did not attend this meeting should join with their colleagues in this institution to defend their homeland,\" he said.\nSupport for legitimate government\nMishaal bin Fahm Al-Salami, president of the Arab Parliament, who was also at the session, congratulated Hadi on holding a parliament session and called on the international community to condemn Houthi violations.\n\"The Yemeni crisis has always been at the heart of our agenda,\" Al-Salami said.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to Yemen Mohammed Al-Jaber said that Saturday\u2019s parliamentary session emphasises the determination of Yemen\u2019s people to reclaim the state and end the \u201cHouthi project.\u201d\nPrime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed arrived in Hadhramaut on Friday, with several ministers and officials to attend the meeting, Yemeni state agency SABA reported.\nThe prime minister is expected to set the public budget for 2019 during the meeting and prepare for further legal and constitutional procedures.\nAfter the Houthi coup in 2015, the Yemeni president ordered the relocation of the parliament to Aden, the temporary capital.\nSince the Houthis took hold of Sanaa, the militia captured around 100 lawmakers and threatened them into attending meetings, according to Arab daily, Asharq Al-Awsat.\nThe 301-member assembly was elected to a six-year term in 2009. It is split between Houthi supporters, government supporters and independents.\nYemen\u2019s government has been based in the southern city of Aden since 2015, but Hadi and other top officials live in Saudi Arabia.\nLocal authorities in Aden, who are allied with the United Arab Emirates, refused to allow parliament to convene there.\nWorld community needs to act\nHadi called on the international community to stop procrastinating and pressure the Houthi militia to implement the agreements signed with it.\n\"You are concerned with pressure to stop the war waged by the Houthi militias against the people of Yemen,\" he said.\nLast December in Stockholm, Sweden, the two sides agreed on a cease-fire and troop withdrawal in Hodeidah port, an exchange of prisoners, and the reopening of humanitarian corridors to help millions of starving Yemenis, with international monitors to oversee events.\nThe pact is intended to clear the way for wider political negotiations, with a transitional government supported by both sides, to end the war.\nThe Saudi-led coalition has accused the Iran-aligned Houthis of breaching the agreement. The Houthis want more guarantees from the United Nations that the other side will not exploit their withdrawal.\nThe cease-fire in Hodeidah has largely held despite an increase in violence in other parts of the country not subject to the agreement.\nThe Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in 2015 to restore Hadi\u2019s government.\nTens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed and an economic collapse has left about 16 million facing severe hunger.\n", "label": "human"}

But I think they didn't see it because they saw what I looked like: A little black girl that no one would want to see,\" Martin said. \"So, we fired them.\"\nFour years later, it's almost ancient history for the now 14-year-old sitting in the conference room of Genuis Productions, the company she founded, as she prepares for \"Little\" to hit theaters nationwide Friday.\nThe office space is a projection of Martin herself, with accent walls in her favorite color blue, her and her baby sister's preferred snacks in the break area (Goldfish crackers, rice crispy treats, etc) and a PS4 in the lobby (as well as her NAACP Image Awards). Her own office is well on its way to having the Alice in Wonderland-feel she wants with \"grand plants\" and colorful throw pillows. There's also a very teen-appropriate Polaroid wall, and a perfect view of the Universal sign out the window.\n\"It's a creative spot for me and a place where I can express how I feel and just get my mind in a cool place where I can just come up with anything I want,\" Martin said. \"I'm very grateful and doing it with my family is even better.\"\nAfter the break with the agents, \"black-ish\" creator Kenya Barris helped nudge Martin in the right direction, securing a meeting with his friend, producer Will Packer, who's been behind such high-profile hits as \"Girls Trip\" and \"Night School,\" to hear her idea.\n\"I didn't expect much, because, you know, I hear a lot of pitches and most of them aren't great. I said 'Listen, I'm sure she's sweet. I'll do it as a courtesy,'\" Packer said. \"And she comes in and she's got this fully thought out, really coherent, cohesive narrative, with characters and themes. I was like, 'She's how old again?'\"\nHer story would be about bullying and female empowerment.\n\"We wanted it to be as authentic as possible... even though it's a fantasy, body-swap film,\" Martin laughed.\nShe stars as the young Jordan Sanders, a science-obsessed teen who is bullied so much in high school that she grows up to be an insufferable bully herself, as the head of a major tech company. The adult version of Jordan is played by Regina Hall, who Martin had worked with on \"black-ish.\" Rounding out the cast is \"Insecure's\" Issa Rae (\"a creator like me\"), as Jordan's undervalued assistant.\nMartin loved the whole development process and is glad that it took a few years for filming to start, allowing her to mature a little bit into who she is today. And then, this past February, something even bigger came along: Martin got a first-look deal with Universal, too.\n\"It was so exciting, but to be honest, I didn't even know what it meant at the beginning,\" Martin said. \"I was like, 'Oh cool! What is that? Like, OK, this seems very professional. Am I in it now? Like is this some Jordan Peele-type stuff?'\"\nWhen she realized that it meant the studio gets first dibs on anything she creates, she was thrilled.\n\"I was like, 'Oh, OK! So I can create whatever I want?' I thought that was so cool because this mind has a lot of things,\" she said. \"I can keep creating things that people don't get to see often.\"\nShe knows it's unusual to be wielding this much creative power in Hollywood at this young age, but she also enjoys catching people off guard.\n\"It's like, 'Oh, snap, THIS girl, created this film?' And it's kind of shocking,\" she laughed.\nHer life is pretty crazy right now promoting \"Little\" and developing new films and television projects. She's home-schooled with a tutor, which she prefers, and she doesn't have any regrets about missing out on the high school experience.\n\"I used to be the shy kid who would barely raise her hand or speak her mind,\" she said.\nEven now she suffers her own share of self-consciousness.\n\"That's something that I have to work on: Self-confidence and loving myself,\" she said. \"Your girl gets a lot of anxiety. It's OK. It's a learning process. I feel like a lot of kids my age get it, whether they're in the industry or not.\"\nWhen she does have a moment to unwind, she plays \"gruesome\" video games like \"Mortal Combat,\" gets facials, massages, cooks and sometimes just watches YouTube. But even then her wheels are spinning about possible collaborations with her favorite YouTubers.\nDown the line, she wants to direct and write and, basically, do all the things.\nPacker, for one, is convinced she will.\n\"She's got a long, strong career ahead of her. And if she chooses to continue in movies and television, you better watch out because she's going to make a serious mark,\" Packer said. \"But she'll make a mark wherever she ends up.\"\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "President Donald Trump on Thursday backpedaled on his budget proposal to eliminate the program after two days of intense criticism on social media. | AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File education Trump budget cut turns out to be a boon for the Special Olympics\nThe Trump administration\u2019s now-abandoned plan to eliminate $17.6 million in federal funding for the Special Olympics is looking like a boon for the nonprofit.\nRather than cutting off the Special Olympics from all federal money, lawmakers are weighing a possible increase for the fifth year in a row as high-profile advocates rally behind the organization and its programs in thousands of schools. The social media outcry over the threat to its funding stream is boosting the Special Olympics' message \u2014 and private donations are expected to surge. It also shows the political risk for the Trump administration when it targets an educational program beloved by Democrats and Republicans alike.\nStory Continued Below\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit overwhelming in the best way possible,\u201d said Andrea Cahn, senior director of the organization\u2019s Unified Champion Schools program, through which the federal money is distributed.\n\"In some ways the most powerless, vulnerable, forgotten people in the country brought to their knees the most powerful people in the country,\" said Tim Shriver, chairman of Special Olympics International, speaking on Monday to advocates gathered at the Save the Children and Save the Children Action Network Advocacy Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\"Probably in my 39 years of professional life, I\u2019ve never had more attention than we got last week on anything I\u2019ve ever worked on, honestly,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump last week backpedaled on his proposal to eliminate funding for the program after two days of intense criticism on social media. The uproar followed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 defense of the proposed cut in a House hearing amid strong objections from Democrats.\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\u201cI have overridden my people,\u201d Trump told reporters, announcing the reversal, without citing which people. All of Trump's budget requests since he took office have proposed doing away with federal support for Special Olympics, and they've all been rejected by Congress. Instead, the funding has risen sharply from $7.6 million in fiscal 2015 to $17.6 million in fiscal 2019. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who heads up the Appropriations panel that funds education, is a Special Olympics champion.\nActing White House chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday defended the budget process that led to the decision to cut funding, saying on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cdebates take place all the time\u201d and that \u201cwhen the president realized that the public wanted this money, he made the change.\u201d\nDeVos stuck up for the proposed cut before a Senate subcommittee but also pointed out that she didn\u2019t \u201cpersonally get involved\u201d in the decision to slash funding. After Trump said the funding would be restored, she lauded the decision, saying she had fought for the money \u201cbehind the scenes over the last several years.\u201d DeVos last year announced she would donate nearly $50,000, a fourth of her salary, to the Special Olympics.\nMaria Shriver, who is Tim's sister, and former Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) penned a CNN column on Friday, attributing Trump\u2019s reversal to the \u201cloud and bipartisan outcry.\u201d\n\u201cHis swift response is a lesson for all Americans about what can be achieved when we come together, rise above our partisan concerns and use our voices to champion a cause that unites us all,\u201d they wrote. Tim and Maria Shriver are the children of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the program\u2019s founder.\nVice President Mike Pence\u2019s wife, Karen Pence, who led a U.S. delegation in March to the Special Olympics World Games in the United Arab Emirates, tweeted after Trump\u2019s announcement: \u201cThank you, Mr. President! Love the @SpecialOlympics!\u201d\nNeither the House nor the Senate Appropriations committees have received any formal notifications of a budget revision from the Trump administration following the president\u2019s comments. The Department of Education deferred comments on the next step to the OMB, which did not respond to an email requesting how much in funding the administration would request for the program.\nBut after Trump\u2019s announcement, Rep. Mark Pocan, (D-Wis.), said in a statement, \u201cCongress was already planning to ignore the administration\u2019s disgraceful budget request, so this is only an attempt to save face.\u201d\nPocan and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees education spending, have already agreed to try to increase the funding for Special Olympics in appropriations legislation, given \"how strong the public support for this program is,\" Pocan told POLITICO on Friday. That bill is still being written and no specific figures for the Special Olympics were available yet.\n\u201cThe willingness for all the members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to step up and speak out on our behalf in a time when there doesn't seem to be a lot of speaking up and taking a stand was also really gratifying,\u201d Cahn said.\nThe federal funding supports \u201cunified\u201d programs, including children with and without disabilities in the same activities, that are now in 6,500 schools. The organization says it\u2019s on track to reach 7,500 schools by the end of this school year and 8,500 next year.\nThe money represents a portion of the overall revenue from all sources for the Special Olympics, which reported $124 million in unrestricted revenues, gains and other support for the year ending Dec. 31, 2017, in a financial statement posted on its website.\nIn response to the attention, Cahn said the organization pushed out positive stories about the program, changing their timeline for release \u201cto take advantage of the attention that we were getting just to get our messaging out there.\u201d Many media outlets picked up on the story and its local impact and the overall importance of Special Olympics programs.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to these kids,\u201d said Anna Quinn, whose sons are on a Special Olympics New Jersey basketball team, to the Press of Atlantic City. \u201cWhat kind of person takes away from a special needs kid?\u201d\nThe Austin American-Statesman\u2019s editorial board opined: \u201cIf there is anything that should be considered untouchable, it seems Special Olympics would fall under that heading.\u201d\nSince March 26, the normal volume of social media posts referencing Special Olympics had tripled and the organization saw a 200 percent increase in visitors to its website, according to a spokesperson.\nOnce the data is gathered, Cahn expects to see a boost in donations. That\u2019s good news for an organization with a goal of funding programs in every public and private school in the nation.\n\u201cWe have at least a hundred thousand more schools to go,\u201d Cahn said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking that, 'Wow, maybe it\u2019s not going to take as long as we thought to be in every school.'\"\n", "label": "human"}

Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was onhand to tease Marvel\u2019s offerings on the TV side, which mark new territory as previous Marvel TV projects (like the Netflix shows and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) were handled by Marvel Television\u2019s Jeph Loeb. The Marvel shows on Disney+, however, will be overseen by Feige himself, and will be \u201cmajor storylines set in the MCU with ramifications that will be felt both through the other Disney+ series we\u2019ll be producing and the future on the big screen,\u201d according to the MCU architect.\nWhile all eyes are on live-action shows like WandaVision and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, Feige also teased the animated series Marvel\u2019s What If\u2026 ?. Based on the comics run of the same name, What If will revisit iconic moments from the MCU and see how they would have played out if key details were changed.\nAs revealed at the Disney+ event (via THR), the first episode of What If? asks what if Peggy Carter had taken the super soldier serum in Captain America: The First Avenger, leaving Steve Rogers as a scrawny kid who eventually joins the fight against the Nazis (and Hydra) wearing a metal suit made by Howard Stark?\nAs a cherry on top, Marvel revealed that talent from the movies will be lending their voices to the What If series, so while Hayley Atwell\u2019s short-lived ABC series Agent Carter may be gone, we can probably at least look forward to hearing her as Peggy again. Ditto to Chris Evans\u2018 Cap post-Endgame?\nThis is a pretty brilliant idea for a series, and I\u2019m eager to see what other What If scenarios are posited. Perhaps this offers Marvel a chance to right a few wrong turns from the past, namely Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World? Or maybe they\u2019ll undo that big Mandarin twist from Iron Man 3? The possibilities are endless.\nDisney+ launches in November, but Marvel\u2019s What If\u2026 ? won\u2019t be available immediately\u2014although Disney says it\u2019ll debut within the first year of programming.\nFor more on Disney+, peruse links to all the big news below:\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Last Friday morning, Samantha Josephson, a 21-year-old college student at the University of South Carolina, ordered an Uber at 2:00 a.m. after spending the night out with her friends. She was last seen on surveillance footage getting into a black Chevy Impala in downtown Columbia, thinking it was her Uber. It was not.\nOn Saturday, Columbia police chief Skip Holbrook announced that Josephson\u2019s body had been found by turkey hunters in Clarendon County, a rural area 65 miles southeast of Columbia.\nAlthough Holbrook did not reveal the cause of death, he did announce that a suspect had been arrested in relation with Josephson\u2019s murder: 24-year-old Nathaniel David Rowland, who was arrested and charged with murder and kidnapping.\nHolbrook said police believed that Josephson had mistakenly gotten into Rowland\u2019s car thinking it was her Uber, and that he had activated the child-safety locks to prevent her from getting out of the car when she realized her mistake. When reached for comment, Uber directed Rolling Stone to a blog post by a representative from its law enforcement outreach team summarizing best practices, including double-checking the driver\u2019s name and license plate number before getting into the car, but referred us to law enforcement regarding the specific details of the case.\nOn Friday afternoon, Josephson\u2019s friends became concerned that she had not heard from her and called the police to report her missing. Police received a call from hunters saying they had found her body a few hours later. \u201cThey quickly realized between clothing and description it was our missing person,\u201d Holbrook said in the press conference.\nAfter watching the surveillance footage, police pulled over Rowland when they saw him driving the Chevy Impala on Saturday morning. Rowland initially tried to flee the scene, but he was caught by police, who searched the car and found what was later discovered to be Josephson\u2019s blood in the trunk and the backseat.\nPolice also questioned a woman who was in the car with Rowland at the time of his arrest, but a spokeswoman said the department did not believe she was with him at the time of Josephson\u2019s death.\nOn Saturday morning, Josephson\u2019s father Seymour wrote an emotional post on Facebook confirming his daughter\u2019s passing. \u201cI will miss and love my baby girl for the rest of life. Samantha is no longer with us but she will not be for gotten,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is extremely hard to write this and post it but I love her with all my heart.\u201d\nJosephson was a political science student at USC and had been admitted to Drexel University law school in Philadelphia, which she was planning to attend in the fall.

The second area is industrialization and the two have something in common.\n\u201d If the government tries to do it alone, it would be extremely tasking.

The Crows key forward will visit a specialist in Wagga on Wednesday but the early prognosis is that his season may be over after one round. Muir dislocated his shoulder in the opening minutes of Saturday's 90-point loss to Wagga Tigers at Leeton Showground. Scans revealed a fracture and he will find out this week whether it requires surgery. \"I'd say I'm looking at 12 weeks or I dare say, season, if it's true what they're saying,\" Muir said. \"I'll have to wait and see. It's not a great start to my coaching career.\" Muir's injury was the first of many for Leeton-Whitton on Saturday, who were forced to play two short for a period in the third quarter. Key defender Tom Meline injured his hamstring, Bryce O'Garey hurt his sternum and full-forward Grant Commins rolled his ankle. Crows youngster Koby Shaw came off after a head knock, while former coach Jade Hodge was forced to stay on the ground with a hamstring strain. \"It was like Armageddon there for a while,\" Muir said. \"We had 16 on the ground for 15 minutes in the third quarter and played with 17 for pretty much the whole last quarter. \"I'm not making excuses though, we were outclassed in every aspect of the game. Full credit to Wagga, they were like a well-oiled machine.\" The Crows, like most of the competition, have the Easter weekend off and then will take on Narrandera the following week. Muir won't face the Eagles, while Meline and Hodge will be in some doubt. Mason Dryburgh will return, while Tom Van Buuren, Hayden Mahalm and Mitch Seymour could also come in. Muir must now get his head around the prospect of being a non-playing coach. \"It was frustrating on Saturday that I couldn't be out there and contribute,\" he said. \"My position in the team being a key forward is a key post too so we're going to have to rejig our forward line a bit. \"We just have to regroup now. We know internally where we're at, inside our four walls.

We approached this problem through experimentation and hands-on learning to inform the Guardian\u2019s strategy team around voice and the future of audio.\nThe project was designed to be limited in scope and this week we are winding down active work on the Lab. Before we close this chapter, here are a few of our key findings.\nA distinctive new medium\nSmart speakers are a catalyst for a disruptive transformation of how we engage with machines. But the current generation of devices represents an entry point rather than a terminus.\nThe technology powering this revolution provides natural language access to a range of services enabled through artificial intelligence. From streaming on-demand media to bespoke new interactive models, designing for voice requires novel approaches to building meaningful content experiences.\nAssembling teams from different disciplines, who are ready to rethink and relearn how to approach problem-solving, will be vital. It\u2019s been an exciting and rare opportunity to be at the nexus of the content creation process and product development methodology.\nAudio-centric, not audio-only\nAccess to digital assistants is proliferating to an ever-increasing variety of form factors with different surface capabilities. With device categories ranging from headphones to automobiles, building for the future of voice will require a flexible approach.\nUndoubtedly, the most basic response to any voice input is to respond with audio. Crafting high-quality sound has the potential to be a differentiator in an area lacking many traditional visual elements. While audio might be the default, it\u2019s not the only output possible.\nDifferent surfaces offer different capabilities for voice-based experiences. Composite: Jeremy Pennycook/The Guardian\nIn the same way responsive design influenced the process of building for the web, creating solutions for voice requires a similar set of principles. Investing in structured and flexible content will pay dividends when adapting to new surface capabilities and rapidly evolving user expectations.\nThe prospect of creating seamless multimodal interactions across devices used to feel like the realm of science fiction. Through smart-assistant platforms, using both visual and aural methods as inputs and outputs is becoming an exciting reality.\nEmergent content patterns\nHabits on smart speakers in particular are converging around two distinct types of experiences; short and transactional vs long and ambient.\nMid-length content has struggled to find a place in the smart speaker ecosystem. Illustration: Jeremy Pennycook/The Guardian\nOn one end of the spectrum, demand for succinct solutions to everyday needs is clear. Users are keen to get news summaries, weather updates, or even order a taxi on demand. The end of the interaction is to complete a straightforward request by providing something concrete and finite. Our Guardian Briefing project was an attempt to fit this mould.\nConversely, long music sessions and radio streams fill the background with indefinite sound as a companion to typical household activities. Easy to request and simple to control, these linear experiences provide a different type of value. More forward-thinking formats will take advantage of the interoperability of audio on smart devices to add layers of control and personalisation.\nNotably, podcasts haven\u2019t yet found a significant audience on this platform. Perhaps they live in the middle ground between short and long form, or maybe they\u2019re challenged by some other structural problem.\nOne theory is podcasting requires too much upfront specific knowledge to request compared to the relative ease of asking for a broadcast stream or music radio experience. The current model is based on aggregating feeds on a mobile device, choosing from a number of recent episodes a la carte, then listening during fixed increments in the day, such as commuting or during household chores. Many of us may have started to ask for a podcast from the Assistant before realising halfway through the command we lacked the exact vocabulary to get what we want.\nMany people are working on new formats and discovery mechanisms for podcasts to help address these problems, but until then smart speakers are likely to account for only a modest amount of listening.\nHorizons for search\nVoice has the potential to become a dominant avenue for search. Predictions assert by 2020 half of all searches will be done through dictation, and 30% of all queries will be performed without a screen. Asking general knowledge questions is already consistently ranked as one of the core use-cases.\nGeneral knowledge questions are a major use of smart speakers according to the Smart Audio Report, winter 2018. Composite: NPR / Edison Research\nThe nature of the medium poses challenges for primarily page-view-based business models. News media and platforms need to work together to better understand and quantify this behaviour. Explaining our fast-paced world through answers based on reporting is one of the core values news publishers provide. Especially for content creators whose main medium is text, exploring formats like speakables in combination with structured content systems could pay dividends as more of our audience relies on voice.\nMore than just hype\nIt\u2019s likely we have yet to reach \u201cpeak hype\u201d around voice. While smart devices continue to sell faster than mobile phones 10 years ago, it\u2019s also likely this trend will plateau at some point, reaching a saturation point similar to what we\u2019ve seen in other device categories. But equally it\u2019s difficult for us to foresee a future where we speak to machines less.\nPublishers should avoid myopic strategies on voice. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we encourage media outlets to grapple with the existential questions around voice and how this new medium will affect them.\nIf you\u2019re starting a new project in voice, feel free to dig into our work. We\u2019ve open sourced the code from our two big projects, the Guardian Briefing and Year in Review. Hopefully these can be helpful to get you up and running.\nExploring this frontier has been challenging and exciting. We can\u2019t wait to see what comes next.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As the dust settles from the Dwyane Wade retirement excitement, the reality sets in that the Miami Heat closed out a season without a playoff appearance for the second time in three seasons and the third time in five.\nSo now, for a roster that, sans Wade, will return most of its players for the 2019-20 season barring any major trades, the Heat will be moving forward looking to fill the void of the leadership he provided out of a young core of Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson and Bam Adebayo.\nCoach Erik Spoelstra closed 2018-19 on Friday by looking into their next steps, laying out an offseason plan for a Dion Waiters and James Johnson resurgence and determining what center Hassan Whiteside\u2019s role with the team can be as he has a $27 million player option on the table for next season.\nAnd no, two days after Wade had his last hurrah in Brooklyn, forward Udonis Haslem did not have any news to break on his impending retirement decision after his 16th NBA season with the Heat.\nAlthough Wade\u2019s final season didn\u2019t net the Heat a playoff berth, Spoelstra still sees the positives in his impact on the next generation.\n\u201cWhat [Wade] gave to that locker room and in particular our young players, impressionable players, will last for the rest of their careers,\u201d Spoelstra said.\nWinslow called the trio of himself, Richardson and Adebayo a \u201cmini-Banana Boat crew\u201d after the famed grouping of Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, with forward Derrick Jones Jr. looking to be \u201cinducted.\u201d\nFor Winslow and Richardson, it\u2019s not the first time they will see a post-Wade era in Miami. Both were rookies in the summer of 2016 when Wade left to sign a free agent deal with the Chicago Bulls.\n\u201cThe time without him was different, but I think we showed ourselves that we\u2019re capable,\u201d said Richardson, who added he learned from a first season where he was a primary offensive option, leading the team in scoring (16.6 points per game) and field goal attempts (14.1). \u201cWe\u2019re all wiser, better basketball players, so I\u2019m excited to see how this summer and everything plays out.\u201d\nWinslow showed strides in transforming himself from a forward to a viable point guard option while Goran Dragic, who has a $17 million player option to mull this offseason, missed 46 games.\n\u201cI would like to continue to grow within that point guard role, but I don\u2019t want the narrative to be between me and Goran, us fighting for that position,\u201d Winslow said. \u201cWe\u2019re both unselfish guys, and I\u2019ve learned so much from him. If James Harden and Chris Paul can play together, then I think me and Goran can play together.\u201d\nThe term \u201cworld-class shape,\u201d which Spoelstra has adopted from President Pat Riley, came up more than once in terms of his offseason plans for players. Spoelstra noted Waiters, who at 6 feet 4 is listed at 215 pounds.\n\u201cHe knows. I know. Pat knows. He just simply has to get there, and that\u2019s it,\u201d said Spoelstra of Waiters, who returned from a yearlong absence from ankle surgery in January. \u201cThis is a really important summer for Dion Waiters. He\u2019s healthy now. He feels good. He has to work. The next five months, he has to put in a body of work that changes his physique that gets him down to that optimal weight and body fat, which he was not at at the end of the year.\u201d\nIt\u2019ll similarly be a critical summer for Johnson, whose season was hindered from the start as he recovered from offseason sports hernia surgery last summer.\n\u201cThat was disappointing from last summer to have a setback and start behind the 8-ball during the regular season,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cGetting fully healthy and in world-class shape and being ready to go first day of training camp will be absolutely paramount for him.\u201d\nFor Jones Jr., Spoelstra said he wants his offseason work to get him looking like Scottie Pippen, with Jones\u2019 frame, length and athleticism already lending to the Hall of Famer\u2019s body type with added muscle.\nMiami Heat's Justise Winslow looks forward to forming a \"mini-banana boat crew\" during the off season. Miami Heat's Justise Winslow looks forward to forming a \"mini-banana boat crew\" during the off season. SEE MORE VIDEOS\nWhiteside is coming off a season where he found himself coming off the bench toward the end. He averaged 12.3 points, 11.3 rebounds and 1.9 blocks while playing 23.3 minutes per game, the fewest since joining the Heat.\n\u201cI think where Hassan is right now is where he has been,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe value him a great deal. He anchors our defense. I know it\u2019s easy to say that he finished the season on the bench and you can look at this season as something where he took a step back. I know he would like to play more, and every player should feel that way.\u201d\nBut the question is whether Whiteside can play a game compatible on the floor with Adebayo as he continued to emerge in his second NBA season. Kelly Olynyk has already proved he can share the floor with either other center as a stretch-4. Meanwhile, Whiteside and Adebayo only played 14 minutes together last season.\nMiami Heat's Josh Richardson looks to the offseason after his \"best season yet.\" Miami Heat's Josh Richardson looks to the offseason after his \"best season yet.\" SEE MORE VIDEOS\n\u201cI\u2019m open to anything,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cEvery offseason, we will look under the hood and evaluate A through Z. This year, the way our team was set up, we had a lot of the guys that can move the needle at our frontcourt positions, and then Bam was able to emerge from that.\u201d\nAdebayo expressed confidence on Friday that the two could make it work next season.\n\u201cJust because we\u2019re both great, great players,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like if we have the right mental, we can make anything work. [Whiteside] is one of those guys where he wants to work with somebody and he wants to grow, get on the court with you.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\nFor 15 years Logitech Harmony universal remotes have tamed sprawling multidevice home entertainment systems, making them simpler to use. They replace a coffee table full of remotes with just a single clicker that commands your TV, AV receiver, cable box, game console and more, seamlessly. One button press turns everything on, switches to the correct inputs and you're ready to go.\nWith the new Harmony Express, that button-press becomes a voice command: \"Turn on the TV.\"\nThe Harmony Express has been completely redesigned from previous models like the Harmony Companion and Harmony Elite to make things even simpler, starting with built-in Alexa. My family and I, including two elementary-school-age kids, have been using it for the last week to control the main entertainment center at home. It's already everyone's favorite clicker, mainly thanks to Ms. Alexa herself. (Note CNET may get a share of revenue from the sale of the products featured on this page.)\nNow playing: Watch this: Harmony Express universal remote gets simpler with Alexa...\nHere are the basics.\nThe Harmony Express costs $250 and is available now at Amazon and Harmony.com and coming soon to other retailers like Best Buy.\nThere's just 10 buttons and a four-way directional pad. The buttons are backlit and the D-pad has a colored ring just like an Alexa speaker.\nYou press the main top button and speak into the remote to issue commands.\nVoice is powered by Amazon Alexa, but you don't have to say \"Alexa,\" just the command itself like, \"Turn off the TV\" or, \"Launch Netflix.\"\nA built-in speaker lets Alexa talk back even when your system is turned off. Words like, \"Getting Netflix from Harmony Express\" issue from the remote in her familiar voice.\nYou can pair the Express with any Alexa speaker for hands-free commands. For example, \"Alexa, turn on the TV\" works hands-free, no remote required.\nThe remote finder function, a first for Harmony, causes the remote to play a tone, allowing you to find it if it's lost among the couch cushions for example.\nIt includes a small hub and IR blaster, just like current Harmony remotes, that controls gear via Infrared, Bluetooth and IP/Wi-Fi commands.\nThe remote doesn't need line-of-sight to your devices so you don't have to aim it or even be in the same room, and gear can be stashed inside cabinets.\nA redesigned app for iOS and Android, called Harmony Express, makes the setup process easier than previous Harmony apps.\nIt can control up to 15 AV devices and, just like any other Alexa device, control smart home devices like lamps, thermostats and more with voice commands.\nIt's a miniature handheld Alexa speaker, you guys\nThe craziest thing about the Express is that it has not only a mic built-in, but also a speaker. It talks back with Alexa's dulcet tones just like an Echo. My kids love Alexa, and one of the first things they did with the Express was test its limits as a speaker. Their favorite \"Sing a song\" worked, causing Alexa to spout her own little ditties, and \"What is your anus?\" evoked the familiar \"Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun.\" They even got it to play music from iHeart Radio, although the sound was terrible through the Express' tiny speaker.\nI asked for the weather, set a timer and, more useful in a remote, turned off the lights in the TV room and turned on the bias light behind the TV. I asked when the next Mets game was on and, \"Who are the stars of Stranger Things?\" Having Alexa in a device in my hand already was really convenient and a great alternative to raising my voice to reach the Echo in my dining room.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nVoice > buttons\nThe Express does away with the numeric keypad, the four color-coded buttons, smart home buttons and other Harmony staples. Instead there's that huge central push-to-talk Alexa button. Past Harmony remotes have had buttons that correspond to so-called Activities like \"Watch TV\" and \"Play Xbox.\" Pressing one turns on the TV, switches the input to device and maps all the buttons like Menu, Exit and the directional keypad on the device itself.\nTo watch TV or Hulu or play Xbox on the Express you'll have to talk into the remote. Issuing that command does all the same stuff as before. It's simpler in one way -- no need to figure out which activity button to press -- but also arguably more of a pain to speak rather than mash a button. You also have to speak (e.g., \"Turn off the TV\") to shut everything down since there's no off button anymore.\nThe main use for a numeric keypad is inputting channel numbers, but Express does that via voice, too. Just say \"Go to ESPN\" or \"Go to Net Geo\" and it dials up that channel from your cable or satellite box directly -- no need to remember the channel number. Sorry cord cutters: It only works with cable and satellite boxes, not live TV streaming apps like Sling TV and YouTube TV. At least for now.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nIn fact there's only nine keys -- all backlit -- below the big voice/select button and circular four-way D-pad, and three (volume up/down and mute) are devoted to controlling your audio device. That leaves just six for the actual device you're controlling, by default Back, Home, Menu and Rewind, Play/Pause and Fast Forward.\nYou can map any of those to any command using the app, and program each with long and short presses, but people who like dedicated keys for additional functions, like DVR, Guide or Record for example, may be annoyed at the paucity of keys. There's also no way to create custom voice commands.\nSeriously, who needs buttons?\nJust like switching channels, launching apps is faster with voice. \"Watch Netflix\" with everything off fired up the TV, switched inputs correctly and bright me right to my profile page in a couple of seconds. I also loved that you can map different apps to different streaming devices. I had a Roku, an Apple TV and a Fire TV hooked up and I was able to choose which one I wanted to associate with each app. Some devices are excluded, however -- associating an app with my Xbox or Nvidia Shield wasn't an option, for example.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nYou get access to deeper voice integrations on Fire TV. I was able to say, \"Find Comedies\" or, \"Find movies with Julia Roberts\" or, \"Watch Roma\" and the Fire TV served up exactly what I expected, even within the Netflix app. Unfortunately these kinds of deep links won't work with other streamers like Apple TV and Roku (yet). Logitech's reps also said the Express wouldn't be made compatible with Google Assistant or other voice systems in the future.\nAnd if you have other \"helper\" apps installed the Express can get, well, confused. Alexa video skills for Dish, Xbox, Roku and others can interfere with the Harmony Express Alexa skill (required to use the remote), causing you to have to specify the device (\"...on Express\") or disable the skill entirely. For example, when I said, \"Switch to Fire TV\" Alexa replied, \"I can do that on your Harmony Express. Which would you like?\" I had to answer, \"Harmony Express\" before it switched over. The more helper skills you have installed, the greater the potential for confusion (both yours and Alexa's).\nOtherwise my voice commands were executed flawlessly. The most common, including turning on and off and switching my various devices, happened much more quickly than the Fire TV Cube. Response times to key presses with devices and apps were similarly very quick.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nEasy on the eyes and in the hand\nThe Express is quite small, but doesn't feel cheap or toylike. It looks sleek on a coffee table and there's a pleasing symmetry. Unlike with an Apple TV remote, it was always easy to tell which end is \"up\" thinks to the big button and light ring. The attractive matte finish repelled even my kids' grubby fingerprints well.\nThe rounded sides and bottom felt natural in my hand. I really liked the fact that every button was an easy thumb reach away, and my thumb rested naturally on the play/pause button, which is concave for tactile reference. After a couple days use I rarely had to look at it to identify buttons. When I did, the clear icons and full backlighting served well.\nThe remote charges via Mini-USB and battery life is excellent. In a solid week worth of use, including plenty of songs from the kids, it went down to about halfway according to the battery indicator in the app.\nSetup with my system was as simple as any remote I've used, and much clearer than past Harmony devices. Yes, I had to provide exact model numbers and know which inputs I had connected -- not necessary with the Caavo -- but the steps made sense and I didn't hit any snags. I especially liked the suggestions telling me which phrases I could use.\nI did miss the ability to use the app to control devices directly. Unlike the standard Harmony app, the Express app is strictly for setup, help and finding the remote. And speaking of help, the Harmony Help skill for Alexa (automatically enabled during setup) walked me through troubleshooting when something unexpected happened. When the TV didn't turn on at one point, for example, a series of Alexa prompts fixed the issue quickly.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nThe $250 question\nDo you need the Harmony Express?\nI would argue that for a system with an AV receiver, a TV and two or more connected devices, a universal remote is a necessity. But if you have a simpler system, say a smart TV, a game console and a sound bar, it's probably overkill.\nIf you decide you need a universal remote, there are a couple that will work just as well as the Express for less. The Harmony Companion, my current CNET Editors' Choice, is less than half the price and can do pretty much everything the Express can, aside from built-in voice. It also works well with Harmony's Alexa app, so you can do a lot of stuff with an Echo speaker, no remote required.\nThen there's Caavo Control Center, which costs $100 and requires a $2 monthly service fee. It has Caavo's own voice system built-in, which lets you search across services and perform other functions, and overlays everything with an onscreen interface. We used it for a couple months in my house, before installing the Express and liked it a lot, although the onscreen stuff often felt unnecessary and I prefer the feel of the Express. I also like its backlit keys better than Caavo's capacitive onscreen indicators.\nThe Fire TV Cube is another cheaper universal remote option, but it requires you to hold onto your original remotes since Amazon's included clicker is very basic. And for pretty much the same price as the Express you can get the Harmony Elite, which has a screen, making some functions like direct app and channel access easier. But not as easy as asking Alexa.\nNone of those universal clickers is as intuitive to use as the Harmony Express, however. If you have a complex AV system and like the idea of simplifying it as much as possible with a combination of voice and buttons, it could be worth the steep price.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "What is your earliest memory of Baishakh? Is it of soothing Tagore songs playing in the background, the sight of your mother adorned in her festive red and white Gorod sari, fragrant with the heady scent of Beli strings wrapped around her hair, or is it the pungent smell of Paanta Bhaat spiked with fiery, smoky Shukna Morich Pora? Most likely, it\u2019s all of them, but most vivid is the memory surrounding food. We Bengalis love to eat; it is a fact universally acknowledged, and our fondest, earliest memories are mostly tied around food. Every festival is inadvertently associated to it, and whether we admit it or not, food plays a key role in our culture, our psyche and everything else in-between!\nThe beginning of the Bengali calendar is a phenomenon close to every Bangali\u2019s heart. As much as we like to celebrate the start of the Roman calendar, it is our own one that truly tugs at our collective heartstrings! And this, I speak on behalf of my people, the entire nation. It isn\u2019t merely a celebration, but one that celebrates our very being, our unique identity. Suffice to say, it warrants grandiose festivities and we never really disappoint. At the heart of this matter, all things gastronomically delightful, reign supreme. And one fit for a Bengali royalty might I add! Most households dish out an elaborate spread that is Bangali is every sense of the word. And need I remind you that it is not just a marker of our identity, but an emotion that runs deep? Food unites this nation like nothing else (Okay, maybe cricket), and for Pahela Baishakh, we return to our roots with much gusto!\nSo, in order to put together a meal that is so much more, setting the tone is essential. Let\u2019s begin with the basics shall we? Planning things out ahead of time is a good idea. Decide the theme you want to go with. Every dining table requires a centrepiece that sets the mood, and is the focal point of the whole setup. Ditching the French linen and lace, choose instead an organic, ethnically sourced tablecloth that speaks volumes about our culture. It could either be a basic neutral cotton one with block prints, or a muslin one with subtle hand embroidery. For placemats, go with a similar palette and material; contrasting is an option too. Aarong is a treasure trove of traditional table linens that run the whole gamut of our heritage weaves, patterns and fabrics. You could use banana leaves instead of placemats; it will lend a rustic Bengali feel to the table. With that settled, choose a centrepiece. It could a collection of little items such as terracotta figurines, clay pots and pans, cleverly placed on a koola with candles, a little prodip and fresh local flowers. Or single pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance like an ektara or dhol, placed on a small peeri for height, decorated further with flowers, candles and such. Choose items that have a decidedly Bangali feel and add to the overall ambience.\nNow, on to the food. Start off with a welcome drink. \u2018Kacha aam er shorbot\u2019 is a crowd pleaser, as is tetul er shorbot. Serve it in a terracotta jug or a brass one. A bhorta platter is necessary; it isn\u2019t really Pahela Baishakh without one! Include some unusual ones such as ghoinna shutki, narikel as well the basics. Fish is mandatory; fried and curried. How about something different, like do macha, a spicy curry with not one but two different fishes? Meaty dishes are also equally important. Give your bhuna gorur jhaal a twist by adding aachar oil and bits! Shorisha Ilish maybe a favourite, but shorisha murgi is equally delicious and different! Mochar ghonto is a delectable delicacy, as is maach er mathar ghonto. Daab chingri, doi maach and shaada ilish are some of the lost but loved dishes you can include in your menu. Lastly, don\u2019t forget the details. Assorted pickles, lime wedges, pora morich and onion wedges are essential to bring a true deshi fervour to your fabulously Bangali spread! For desserts, doi and mishti are staples, but include interesting items such as malpoa, chanar jorda, kacha golla and khejur gurer roshogolla. Baishakh is really about enjoying life with a renewed spirit and vigour. May your feast be one that feeds not just the tummy, but also the soul. Your Bangali soul!\nPhoto: Sazzad Ibne Sayed\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Want rain? If the answer is yes, schedule PASSCAR Super Stocks, Street Stocks, American Factory Stocks and the IMCA Modifieds.\nPerris Auto Speedway has twice tried to open the season for the classes, but the Feb. 9 and rescheduled March 9 dates got wiped out by rainstorms. Therefore, promoter Don Kazarian added a race Saturday night and Nov. 16 to the schedule.\n\u201cWe wanted to be sure these drivers get their full schedule in, so we had to reschedule the two canceled races,\u201d Kazarian said. \u201cThey have not raced at The PAS for nearly six months. And, or those who do not travel to other tracks, they have not raced at all. All the drivers should be chomping at the bit to get going.\n\u201cWe expect a very exciting night of racing.\u201d\nAnd once they find out what the track has planned, so will the kids.\nAt intermission, children will be allowed onto the track to collect Easter candy and meet the drivers. The first 20 kids to sign up will be matched up with a driver in the Modified main event. At the conclusion of that race, the child matched up with the winning driver will receive a trophy and a photo.\nIt was the idea of Modified veteran Steven Fangmeyer to duplicate the Halloween tradition of allowing kids down on the track to meet with the drivers and collect candy at intermission.\n\u201cThe Halloween night with trick-or-treaters on the track has become our biggest night for the PASSCAR/IMCA shows,\u201d Kazarian said. \u201cWe hope it does just as well this week for Easter. The kids pairing up with drivers should also make it extra fun for them. \u2026 It will give them something extra to get excited about and to cheer for.\u201d\nOf the drivers expected Saturday night, Luke Todd will draw plenty of interest. The winner of more main events than any stock car driver in the track\u2019s history, featuring five Street Stock track championships, he will make his Modified debut.\n\u201cIt is just something new and will be more of a challenge. It seems like the Modifieds are a good and growing show and you can run the same car at a lot of different tracks. I plan to do that,\u201d Todd said. \u201cIt is not like that with the Street Stock where almost all the tracks have different rules. I also like the crate motor idea in the Modifieds.\n\u201cAnybody can have the same motor and it only costs $6,000.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s a new class, the Rubidoux driver has a proven record behind him.\n\u201cModifieds are definitely different though, and that will present a new challenge. It (the car) felt pretty good the other night when I was on the track for a practice. I finally got comfortable, but that was without other cars on the track,\u201d Todd said. \u201cIt will be different with a full field of cars, so I will still have to get used to that.\n\u201cIt will be different than the Street Stock when I feather the throttle in traffic. In the Modified, that really upsets the chassis. It will take a little bit to get used to that.\u201d\nTodd will have plenty of competition in both classes.\nIn Street Stock, the field will include Blaine Whitson, Chris Leventis, 6-year-old Norco High School student Alyssa Smith (third as a rookie in the Street Stocks last season) and three-time champ Curtis Dietzsch.\nChuck Becker, who has won Modified championships the past three years at The PAS, will be after his fourth in a row. On Saturday, Becker, who began racing more than 40 years ago, will be driving a car owned by John Krebs. Among others In the class include 2018 runner-up Terry Hershberger, four-time PAS main-event winner Fangmeyer and 2016 Lucas Oil Modified Series champion Matthew Hicks.\nIn Super Stock, Mike Lerwell is expected to be back to vie for his third track championship against 2018 runner-up Fred Estrada, Ricky Lee, two-time class champ Dennis Wooldridge and Tom Smith (Alyssa\u2019s father). In Factory Stocks, Cameron Veatch is the defending champ, having edged Todd Fassler by a single point.\nTickets are $15 for adults. Active military (with proper ID and their spouse or date), teens 13-18 (with school ID) and kids 6-12 get in for $5. Children 5 and younger are admitted free. Parking on the fairgrounds is $8. Spectator gates open at 5 p.m. and the first race is at 7.\nBack in Force\nFor the second consecutive year, NHRA Top Fuel driver Brittany Force won the Houston stop of the Mello Yello Drag Racing Series. The victory pulled her within 11 points of leader Doug Kalitta.

{"text": "sport, australian-rules-football,\nWodonga Raiders posted a stunning upset over Yarrawonga. Raiders rebounded superbly from a 107-point hiding against Wangaratta in round one to score a 14.16 (100) to 8.15 (63) win. It was the first genuine upset of the opening 10 games. Raiders controlled play in the first quarter, but only carried a one-point break to the first change.

Filo was tagged out of the game in the second half, but the damage was done, while Connor Newnham also snared three goals.

{"text": "Who will be the next head coach of the Lakers? It\u2019s an all-too-familiar question for a franchise that has lacked stability since its last championship in 2010.\nThe team is looking for its sixth coach since then, a list which includes Phil Jackson, Mike Brown, Mike D\u2019Antoni, Byron Scott and Luke Walton (with Bernie Bickerstaff serving as interim head coach in 2012). Now with Walton out, the Lakers are combing through names yet again.\nWith General Manager Rob Pelinka running the search, absent a president of basketball operations, there are already a number of names linked to the Lakers by various media reports. A look at some possible candidates:\nTYRONN LUE\nExperience: Three-plus seasons as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers (128-83 record); Coached the 2016 NBA championship team, and won the Eastern Conference title three times.\nTies to the Lakers: Obviously, he\u2019s coached LeBron James before. He also played three seasons for the Lakers, including the 2000 and 2001 championship seasons.\nThe case for Lue: This is a pick that makes sense if the Lakers decide that getting a coach who engages James is their top priority. He has a well-chronicled ability to find ways to challenge the superstar and get him invested, and he\u2019s a coach whom James has a lot of good memories with and warm feelings toward. Lue also has a winning record and plenty of experience making deep playoff runs. He\u2019s not currently on an NBA staff, which makes for fewer workarounds in the interview process.\nPossible hurdles: The primary question might just be Lue\u2019s health. He missed nine games in his last full season in Cleveland with chest pains. Though he changed his lifestyle, there\u2019s a legitimate concern with how he would deal with the pressures of another high-profile job coaching a team with James. Lue is also not known as a developmental coach \u2013 Cleveland\u2019s rosters under Lue often skewed older with more veterans, and the Cavaliers fired him once they decided to go young and rebuild. It\u2019s unclear what hiring Lue would mean for the Lakers\u2019 young core. Also, the optics of hiring Lue might not look great after Magic Johnson once declared that he didn\u2019t want to be Cleveland all over again (then again, Johnson is gone).\nMONTY WILLIAMS\nExperience: Five seasons as head coach of the New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans (173-221 record); Two playoff appearances, both first-round losses. Currently an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers.\nTies to the Lakers: He has a slightly looser connection to James, as an assistant with USA basketball.\nThe case for Williams: He\u2019s worked under Nate McMillan and Brett Brown, two highly regarded coaches in the league, and he played under Gregg Popovich. It\u2019s a circle of strong influences. He has a reputation as a great communicator. He\u2019s not a newbie, and he\u2019s worked with superstars. If the Lakers continue to pursue Anthony Davis (which they likely will), there are going to be a lot of people noticing Williams was his former coach.\nPossible hurdles: Williams endured unthinkable personal tragedy in 2016 when his wife was killed in a car collision. Williams took time out of coaching to tend to his relatively young children. Life situation probably plays a huge role in how Williams will view his career choices, and if he feels the fit is best for his family. On more firm basketball ground, Williams\u2019 playoff record doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. His Pelicans rosters generally lacked talent, but the Lakers might be seeking a coach who has more playoff success on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nMARK JACKSON\nExperience: Three seasons as head coach of the Golden State Warriors (121-109 record); two playoff appearances, reaching the conference semifinals in 2013\nTies to the Lakers: As an analyst, Jackson has a lot of relationships with a lot of teams. It was reported by ESPN that Magic Johnson had interest in him as a candidate if he had conducted the search himself.\nThe case for Jackson: As a big name, Jackson would have a gravitas that everyone in the locker room could respect, including James. Even though he was ousted from Golden State, it\u2019s notable that Jackson still has some good relationships there, including with Steph Curry. Under him, the Warriors did have a strong defensive identity. As a player, he was in the playoffs almost every season, and he understands the challenges of making postseason runs.\nPossible hurdles: One of the biggest reasons Jackson hasn\u2019t wound up with a new coaching job since he was in Golden State was the perception that he was the biggest obstacle to the Warriors\u2019 success. Steve Kerr took many of the same players Jackson had and won a championship in his first season as coach by incorporating a movement-oriented, free-form style that took advantage of two of the best shooters in the league. Why couldn\u2019t Jackson? After firing Jackson, Warriors ownership cited an unwillingness by the coach to add to his coaching staff, as well as distant relationships within the organization. Jackson also has a reputation as more of an old-school coach who has not embraced analytics \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t be the only one on this list with that reputation, but it\u2019s worth noting, especially given how the game has evolved because of the Warriors dynasty.\nJUWAN HOWARD\nExperience: Six seasons as an assistant coach with the Miami Heat under Erik Spoelstra, with three playoff appearances in that span, including one Finals appearance.\nTies to the Lakers: Howard played with James on two Heat championship teams, and he has a strong lineage under the Spoelstra/Pat Riley administration there. As a Michigan alum, he also was college teammates with Pelinka, who is conducting the search.\nThe case for Howard: It helps to have existing relationships with two of the principals in the Lakers organization in James and Pelinka. As a former player, Howard would have reasonable cachet walking into the locker room, and as a Spoelstra disciple, it\u2019s reasonable to believe he\u2019d have good tactical ideas that have been passed on by a coach James respects.\nPossible hurdles: There\u2019s not much head coaching experience here, save for Summer League performances. It\u2019s reassuring that Howard has been involved on the defensive side of the ball for the Heat, who are consistent grinders on that end, but less reassuring that he\u2019s coached the big men (Hassan Whiteside has largely underperformed there). It\u2019s hard to say whether James would view him as a contemporary or as more of a leader to be listened to \u2013 perhaps an esoteric question that can\u2019t be fully answered until Howard is in the building, but a question nonetheless.\nDOC RIVERS\nExperience: Twenty seasons as a head coach for the Orlando Magic, Boston Celtics and the Clippers (894-658 overall record). He has 14 playoff appearances, winning the 2008 NBA title with the Celtics.\nTies to the Lakers: Besides the building he shares with them, Rivers\u2019 relationship with the Lakers has been more as an adversary, facing them in the 2008 and 2010 Finals and splitting those series. He has a similar relationship with James, running into his Cavaliers and Heat teams several times in the Eastern Conference playoffs. He\u2019s coached Rajon Rondo (whose contract is expiring).

Rivers got the job done in Boston, and many have admired what he\u2019s done this season with a Clippers team that doesn\u2019t have a high-profile star. He has a lot of relationships with a lot of players in the league and has managed a lot of egos in his time. After rescinding his front office responsibilities with the Clippers, the general consensus is that Rivers has done well on the sidelines. He has a reputation as a coach who leans more on experience, but he\u2019s found ways to engage youngsters on this year\u2019s Clippers roster, starting two rookies.\nPossible hurdles: The biggest is that the Clippers don\u2019t want to let him go. Rivers has publicly said \u201cI\u2019m going nowhere.\u201d He\u2019s told the press that he and Clippers owner Steve Ballmer have an agreement in place for him to stay on. There\u2019s also a question of whether Rivers would be interested in switching organizations, particularly since the Clippers also look ripe to land an elite free agent (or two) this summer and have the appearance of much more stability. As for his own record, the underachievements of the Lob City teams, which never made it to the conference finals, remain an indictment on everyone involved \u2013 it\u2019s hard to pick bones with Rivers\u2019 record, but that\u2019s the bone to pick.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "New Delhi, April 15 (IANS): Low-cost carrier and top rival SpiceJet appears to be making the most of the crisis at Jet Airways.\nSpicejet is now hiring engineers and pilots at much lower pay than their current salaries at the financialy-troubled Jet.\nIndustry sources told IANS that pilots from Jet Airways are being asked to take salary cuts of 25-30 per cent, while engineers have been advised to settle at 50 per cent of their current pay package.\nNot long ago, many airlines including SpiceJet were luring the same pilots and engineers with joining bonuses and better perks.\n\u201cThe prospect of closure is certainly one of the reasons for professionals agreeing to take salary cuts. But average salaries at Jet Airways have also been higher than the industry level,\u201d a top aviation source said.\nA senior aircraft maintenance engineer who has applied to SpiceJet and Air India Express for a job said that he has got an offer in the range of Rs 150,000 to 200,000 a month while his current cost to company (CTC) at Jet Airways is nearly Rs 400,000 a month.\n\u201cThe offer is much lower. It will certainly be a forced choice. We are hoping that some investor would take over Jet and our salaries will remain protected,\u201d he said.\nA SpiceJet executive said that the budget carrier was offering salaries based on their own structure and not the highly inflated one paid by Jet Airways.\nA senior commander with Jet Airways said that pilots with 4-5 years of experience are going to other airlines as they are feeling the pinch of salary delays.\n\u201cThey have loans and other financial commitments so they are looking for places where there is certainty of jobs and timely salary payment. Not many senior level pilots have so far left Jet Airways. They are reluctant to go to either SpiceJet, IndiGo or Air India Express as they feel their seniority and salary will be impacted. They do not want to sign 3-5 year bonds,\u201d he said.\nThe flying veteran noted that many co-pilots who do not have much experience generally get about Rs 2.9 lakh salary month at Jet Airways, and they are willing to join other airlines for even less than Rs 2 lakh a month.\nAmong various domestic airlines, only Air India Express and SpiceJet operate Boeing fleets, apart from Jet Airways. Those operating Airbus aircraft fear huge conversion costs for both pilots and engineers and are, thus, reluctant to hire the technical personnel from Jet.\n\u201cWe will have to train them for flying and maintenance of Airbus aircraft. In case of pilots, it will need six months of training, while for engineers the reskilling would take 3-4 months. This means the salary for entire training period will be a huge cost for us,\u201d said an executive of a private airline operating Airbus planes.\nBut aviation experts feel that the current situation is temporary and it will normalise once Jet gets back on its feet.\n\u201cThis is an unusual situation because Jet Airways remains almost grounded. Normally, supply and demand have been in favour of pilots and engineers. Now, it depends on how quickly Jet restarts again. If that happens things will stabilise. I won\u2019t be surprised if many pilots and engineers go back to Jet,\u201d said Rajan Mehra, a veteran aviation professional and Chief Executive Officer Club One Air.\nSaddled with mounting debt and losses, Jet Airways is fighting for its survival. The airline is in gradual descent and staring at closure with nearly 90 per cent of its fleet on the ground.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Facebook is pulling away from its ambitions to provide peer-to-peer money transfers via Messenger in Europe. Today, the company announced that it would be discontinuing the service \u2014 which let individuals send money to each other \u2014 in the two countries in the region where it had rolled it out, the U.K. and France, on June 15 of this year. It appears that for now, the service will remain active in the U.S., where Facebook holds a number of money transmitter licenses.\nIt\u2019s not shutting down payments altogether in Europe; it will continue to let people make charitable donations through Facebook itself.\n\u201cOn 15 June 2019, we will discontinue P2P services on Messenger or through Facebook messages for all residents in the UK and France,\u201d the company noted in a short statement on its main help page for the payments service. \u201cWhile you won\u2019t be able to exchange money with friends and family, you\u2019ll still be able to complete other transactions through Facebook, such as making donations to charitable organisations.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Messenger has now also provided us with a statement, which implies the payments service was not particularly well-used:\n\u201cWe are terminating the ability to send and receive payments in Messenger in both the UK and France effective June 15,\u201d the spokesperson notes. \u201cAfter evaluating how we give people the best experiences in Messenger, we made the decision to focus our efforts on experiences that people find most useful. Users have been notified in preparation for this change.\u201d Indeed, it started sending out notices to those who were using the service in the two countries. It\u2019s never been clear just how many of them there were.\nAfter getting a license at the end of 2016, Facebook made its first foray into P2P payments in Europe for people over the age of 18 in November 2017, taking on the likes of PayPal and others in the remittance world.\nThe move was long in the making: there had been rumors of Facebook developing social payments, and even acquiring a startup to help make it happen, for years before this as the market for remittances and people using social networks to make financial transactions to each other started to take off.\nIn particular, in developing markets, where transfer fees for services like Western Union are high and the amount of people holding bank accounts is low, remittances using mobile handsets have become a key way for people to send money to each other, either because they\u2019re supporting family or to pay each other for a service or goods. Mobile \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s supremacy in social graphs and messaging with the likes of WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram all a part of the Facebook stable \u2014 made it a natural fit for something like this.\nBut in the end, the launch of P2P payments in France and the U.K. was a baby step \u2014 you could never transfer money to international recipients, and new countries were never added \u2014 that never grew up. The company reported in its last quarterly results in January that payments and other services generated just $274 million in the quarter, compared to $16.64 billion in advertising. Europe accounted for a measly $64 million of that.\nFacebook does not explain why it decided to pull back on the strategy, but apart from question marks over just how popular the service actually was, there have been other developments at the company and the wider payments space in Europe that could potentially have been factors.\nCome September 14 of this year, there will be a new payment directive put in place across Europe called Strong Customer Authentication, requiring extra checks to be made for a user\u2019s identity in any online transaction. It\u2019s not clear how and if Facebook was preparing for this change.\nPerhaps more interestingly, the company is reportedly working on a cryptocurrency that would allow for people on its messaging networks to send money to each other.

{"text": "Doctors with foreign accents can be perceived as less competent, according to University of Alberta researchers.\n\u201cWe were interested to see if there was a difference in a person\u2019s perception of a doctor\u2019s competence depending on the doctor\u2019s accent,\u201d said Lorelei Baquiran, who conducted the study as part of an undergraduate thesis in the faculty of science.\nUnder the supervision of Elena Nicoladis, professor in the department of psychology, Baquiran\u2019s research included Chinese-Canadian and Caucasian-Canadian participants listening to an audio recording of a doctor speaking.\nSome participants heard a doctor with a Chinese accent, while others heard a doctor with a Canadian accent.\n\u201cWe found that both groups rated the doctor with a Chinese accent as less competent than the doctor with a Canadian accent, regardless of the severity of the disease the doctor was discussing,\u201d said Baquiran.\nBias lies at the heart of such perceptions.\n\u201cWe know that the patients\u2019 belief in their doctors\u2019 competence is essential for high quality care,\u201d said Nicoladis.\n\u201cIf a foreign accent can interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, then, as Canadians and human beings, we have work to do.\u201d\nRegardless of background or the type of disease, participants rated doctors with Chinese accents as less competent than those with Canadian accents.\n\u201cPrevious literature suggests that co-ethnicity, or sharing a background or accent with another person, will increase liking and perception of competence,\u201d said Baquiran, noting that 18 per cent of physicians in Canada were not born or trained in the country.\n\u201cHowever, our research suggests that the degree of acculturation is important. That is, we expect newcomers to adapt to our culture.\u201d\nFurther research is required to prove the claim that the degree of acculturation is what is behind the speech accent effect.\n\u201cAnother important next step is to develop ways that could help prevent specific groups of doctors and other foreign-accented individuals from being disadvantaged because they speak with an accent,\u201d said Baquiran.\nThe paper, A Doctor\u2019s Foreign Accent Affects Perceptions of Competence, was published in Health Communication.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "French President Emmanuel Macron greets British Prime Minister Theresa May before their meeting Tuesday at the Elysee Palace in Paris during which France softened its position on the timetable for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nBRUSSELS -- France softened its stance Tuesday and showed willingness to accept yet another delay in Britain's long-awaited withdrawal from the European Union, diminishing the chances that Britain would crash out of the bloc this week without any plan.\nBut British Prime Minister Theresa May still has a rough day ahead of her as she heads to an emergency summit in Brussels today to plead for a new extension -- for the second time in three weeks.\nWith nearly everyone fully resigned to Britain's departure from the European Union, two questions took center stage Tuesday: How and when to get the U.K. out the door.\nEU countries, especially France, have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain about a way forward.\nThe bloc's leaders have tried to help May over the past two years of negotiations, even after she missed her departure date on March 29 because of parliamentary opposition. After obtaining a delay until Friday, she will be asking for another postponement that lasts until June 30 at the special EU summit.\nMay flew first to Berlin on Tuesday to plead for good terms with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and then set off for Paris for an encounter with President Emmanuel Macron, seen as her counterpart with the toughest demands.\n\"France is really trying to play bad cop here,\" said Larissa Brunner, an analyst at the European Policy Center, referring to French insistence that another extension to her deadline must come with strings attached and assurances from London.\nHowever, an official in Macron's office said on Tuesday that France was ready to accept a new delay.\nWhile Macron still has a long list of conditions, it was a notable shift in France's tone compared with last week. The reason for the change was unclear, though concerns have been growing about how badly a hard exit would hit the French economy, too. France was also encouraged by May's outreach last week to Britain's political opposition to find a compromise, and Macron may have been swayed in part by a meeting with the Irish prime minister.\nFrance is now at the forefront to get the EU to take some decisive action.\n\"We won't be able to perpetually live with the exit of Brexit,\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said over the weekend. \"At some point there is an exit.\"\nGermany agrees. \"There isn't an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side,\" said Michael Roth, Germany's deputy foreign minister.\nAll eyes are now turned toward Macron, who has it in his power to force Britain to choose between a no-deal exit Friday and canceling its departure altogether. A drastic cliff-edge departure would have big costs for businesses and trade across the English Channel and would be very cumbersome to travelers because it would hit airports, ports, tariff rules and standard regulations overnight.\nAmong conditions France is now setting to agree to a new delay: A \"credible prospect\" of some kind of solution to the British political deadlock. A promise that Britain won't keep asking for more delays. And guarantees that Britain would not be involved in future EU decisions while its withdrawal is playing out.\n\"The longer the extension might be, the more guarantees are needed,\" the French official said, speaking on condition that he not be named in keeping with presidential policy.\nEvery British initiative to get a deal has floundered so far. Several days of talks between May's Conservative government and the main opposition Labor Party tried to find a compromise deal have failed to produce a breakthrough. Labor favors a softer exit than the government has proposed and wants to retain a close economic relationship with the bloc.\nAfter further talks Tuesday over an informal lunch, the two sides said they would resume their discussions after today's EU summit.\nMay's Downing Street office said the talks had been \"productive and wide-ranging.\" Labor business spokesman Rebecca Long-Bailey said there had not been \"any fundamental shift ... but we're hopeful that progress will be made.\"\nInformation for this article was contributed by Geir Moulson, Danica Kirka and Jill Lawless of The Associated Press.\nA Section on 04/10/2019\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 Prosecutors say a fatal shooting in January near the Girl Scouts of Southeast Wisconsin headquarters near 70th and O\u2019Connor followed an argument between the victim and a neighbor over loud music.\nDewayne Ford, 32, of Milwaukee, faces two counts:\nFirst degree reckless homicide, as party to a crime, use of a dangerous weapon, habitual criminality repeater\nPossession of a firearm by a person convicted of a felony, habitual criminality repeater\nAccording to a criminal complaint, police on Jan. 9 were called out to the area near 70th and O\u2019Connor for a shooting, and found first responders with the Milwaukee Fire Department administering first aid to the victim, William Jones, who had wounds to his chest, back, inner left forearm and the top of his outer left forearm. An autopsy revealed he suffered two bullet wounds. His death was ruled a homicide. Investigators noted the door to an apartment unit in the area was open. The complaint said a fired .40 caliber Smith and Wesson cartridge casing as recovered from the scene.\nA witness indicated about five minutes before the shooting, she heard arguing coming from the lot behind the apartment building, and saw Jones standing in the lot by his back door. She said Jones was facing two subjects \u2014 and she could only see the backs of their heads. She said when she heard the sound of gunfire, she saw a black vehicle pulling into a parking space and making a Y-turn. She offered a description of that vehicle \u2014 a 2008 Cadillac STS.\nThe complaint said investigators determined, through interviews with witnesses, that around 8:30 that morning, there had been an argument involving Jones and a neighbor over loud music. The homicide is believed to have occurred just after 1 p.m. that afternoon. Phone records showed approximately 15 minutes before the homicide, there were phone calls between the neighbor and Dewayne Ford. There were also calls approximately five minutes afterward.\nAccording to the complaint, approximately 11 minutes after the phone contact between Ford and Jones\u2019 neighbor, surveillance video showed a black Cadillac headed north on 70th Street \u2014 turning west into the driveway \u2014 entering the parking lot at 12:58 p.m. \u2014 about five minutes prior to the shooting. The complaint said it was not on scene when first responders arrived.\nAn investigation revealed the Cadillac has been reported stolen on Jan. 8 \u2014 the day before the shooting. A review of phone records showed contact on Jan. 8 between Ford and the owner of the vehicle. They were also in contact on Jan. 10. That person told investigators \u201che had made a deal with (Ford) to take the vehicle because he was upside down on his loan.\u201d He said Ford took the vehicle in January, and a couple days later, Ford called and asked if he should report the vehicle stolen, and indicated he was having problems removing the GPS from the vehicle. He confirmed for investigators that Ford was in possession of the vehicle on the day of the shooting.\nDNA analysis revealed Ford was the source of DNA on Jones\u2019 right hand. Additionally, the complaint said Ford\u2019s Gmail account pinged at the location of the homicide approximately one minute after the homicide.\nThe complaint said Ford was convicted in June 2016 on a charge of attempted armed robbery, as party to a crime \u2014 and he was therefore not allowed to possess a firearm.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Following Thursday\u2019s arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London, the governments of the US, Britain and Ecuador are engaged in a conspiracy to facilitate the whistleblower\u2019s extraordinary rendition to the US. Julian Assange\u2019s life and liberty are in imminent danger. It is necessary to mobilize all supporters of free speech to prevent him from falling into the hands of the American government.\nOver 40 years ago, a Rand Corporation analyst Daniel Ellsberg provided the Washington Post with evidence regarding the US government\u2019s illegal activity in the Vietnam War. Yesterday, Ellsberg issued the following statement:\nIt\u2019s a very serious assault on the First Amendment. A clear attempt to rescind the freedom of the press\u2026This is the first indictment of a journalist and editor or publisher, Julian Assange. And if it\u2019s successful it will not be the last. This is clearly a part of President Trump\u2019s war on the press, what he calls the enemy of the state. And if he succeeds in putting Julian Assange in prison, where I think he\u2019ll be for life, if he goes there at all, probably the first charge against him is only a few years. But that\u2019s probably just the first of many.\nThe official pretext being used to extradite Assange is a transparent lie. In a previously-sealed indictment made public Thursday, the US Department of Justice charged Assange only with violating a federal law against conspiring to break passwords to government computers.\nThe fact that the crime carries only a five-year sentence and does not fall under the Espionage Act provides all involved parties with a cover for handing Assange over to the Americans. In particular, the US-UK extradition treaty excludes transfer for \u201cpolitical offenses,\u201d including espionage. Citing the Justice Department document, the British government will claim in the courts that Assange\u2019s extradition will not be prevented by this exclusion.\nThe Ecuadorean government, moreover, claims it could revoke Assange\u2019s asylum because the indictment shows he will not face the threat of the death penalty.\nIn fact, once Assange is in the hands of the United States, he will quickly confront a series of additional charges, including espionage. The efforts to downplay the threat to freedom of the press and understate the charge against Assange are aimed at sowing complacency in the population and distracting from the core free speech issues at stake.\nThe language of the indictment itself makes clear that the government is targeting Assange for political reasons, despite the official charge at its conclusion. It asserts:\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the conspiracy was to facilitate [Chelsea] Manning\u2019s acquisition and transmission of classified information related to the national defense of the United States so that WikiLeaks could publicly disseminate the information on its website.\u201d\nThe indictment notes that the information WikiLeaks released to the public included \u201capproximately 90,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports, 400,000 Iraq war-related significant activities reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs, and 250,000 US Department of State cables. Many of these records were classified pursuant to \u2018Order No. 13526,'\u201d signed by Barack Obama in 2009. The indictment claims these releases \u201creasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.\u201d\nThis language mirrors the text of the Espionage Act, which bars releasing information \u201crelating to the national defense.\u201d The Espionage Act criminalizes anyone who \u201ccommunicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered or transmitted\u201d such information.\nBased on the language of the indictment, both Assange and Manning could face criminal prosecution under this law. By announcing that Assange is being prosecuted based explicitly on Manning\u2019s activity, the government is demonstrating her future is at risk as well. In fact, the first two words of the indictment are \u201cChelsea Manning.\u201d\nThis language also confirms last year\u2019s \u201cinadvertent\u201d release by prosecutors of documents arguing Assange should be extradited because there are \u201ccharges\u201d\u2014plural\u2014against him. Prosecutors convened a secret grand jury to investigate Assange at least as far back as 2011, and the US government sought warrants to spy on WikiLeaks employees based on allegations of \u201cespionage\u201d in 2012.\nOnly the complicit or the na\u00efve could accept that a secret grand jury spent over eight years to charge Assange with just one count of password manipulation.\nThe response of leading political figures in the US, as well as their previous statements, makes clear that the ruling elite is eager to seize Assange and lock him up for life\u2014if not impose worse punishments.\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer tweeted,\n\u201cI hope he will soon be held to account for his meddling in our elections on behalf of Putin and the Russian government.\u201d\nNow that Julian Assange has been arrested, I hope he will soon be held to account for his meddling in our elections on behalf of Putin and the Russian government. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) April 11, 2019\nDemocratic Senator Mark Warner called Assange\n\u201ca direct participant in Russian efforts to weaken the West and undermine American security.\u201d He continued, \u201cI hope British courts will quickly transfer him to US custody so he can finally get the justice he deserves.\u201d\nProsecuting Assange on the basis of the unfounded allegations of \u201cmeddling\u201d would involve charges of espionage.\nLike a dungeonmaster who has been handed his latest victim, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin declared,\n\u201cHe is our property and we can get the facts and the truth from him.\u201d\nOn the basis of this statement, Assange is being transferred to the US for the purpose of interrogation\u2014which would fall under the category of extraordinary rendition, not extradition.\nAssange has also faced open death threats in the press and from the government over the past several years. Rightwing radio personality Rush Limbaugh called for Assange to receive \u201ca bullet to the brain.\u201d Former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly told Assange: \u201cWe\u2019re going to hang you.\u201d Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said, \u201cJulian Assange is engaged in terrorism and should be treated as an enemy combatant.\u201d Democratic Vice President Joe Biden called Assange a \u201chigh-tech terrorist.\u201d Democratic operative Bob Beckel said, \u201cthis guy\u2019s a traitor\u201d and the US should \u201cillegally shoot the son of a b***h.\u201d\nAnother function of the indictment is to provide the corrupt and lying media with a cover for applauding Assange\u2019s arrest. The New York Times and Washington Post have played a particularly criminal role in downplaying the indictment by claiming that the use of a lesser charge means prosecuting Assange poses no threat to free speech.\nIn an editorial board statement yesterday, the New York Times wrote:\n\u201cThe government charged Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, not with publishing classified government information, but with stealing it, skirting\u2014for now\u2014critical First Amendment questions.\u201d\nThe single count against Assange, the Times wrote, means the arrest does not pose \u201ca direct challenge to the distinction between a journalist exposing abuse of power through leaked materials\u2014something traditional newspapers like the Times do all the time\u2014and a foreign agent seeking to undermine the security of the United States through theft or subterfuge\u2026 The administration has begun well by charging Mr. Assange with an indisputable crime.\u201d\nThe Washington Post\u2019s editorial is titled, \u201cJulian Assange is not a free-press hero. And he is long overdue for personal accountability.\u201d\nThe Post wrote,\n\u201cMr. Assange\u2019s case could conclude as a victory for the rule of law, not the defeat for civil liberties of which his defenders mistakenly warn.\u201d The Post labeled concerns over Assange\u2019s safety as \u201cpro-WikiLeaks propaganda.\u201d\nThe fact that the indictment does not charge Assange with violating the Espionage Act proves he \u201chad no legitimate fears for his life, either at the hands of CIA assassins or, via extradition, the US death penalty.\u201d\nThe Post explained that\n\u201cBritain should not fear that sending him for trial on that hacking count would endanger freedom of the press\u201d because Assange is \u201cunethical\u201d and not a \u201creal journalist,\u201d because he \u201cdumped material into the public domain without any effort independently to verify its factuality or give named individuals an opportunity to comment.\u201d\nWho are the New York Times and the Washington Post to lecture about \u201creal journalism\u201d? These statements expose the Times and the Post as nothing but government propaganda organs.\nThe Times is synonymous with peddling the Bush administration\u2019s false claim of \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d in Iraq, and the Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire CEO of Amazon, which recently reached a $600 million service contract with the Pentagon.\nThe conspiracy against Assange underscores the collapse of any constituency in the political establishment and corporate media for the defense of democratic rights. If Ellsberg approached the Post today with photocopies of Pentagon-commissioned Rand reports on the war, the Post would call the FBI and have him arrested for threatening \u201cnational security.\u201d\nThe Times and the Post may convince their affluent readers that Assange aided Russia by publishing evidence showing Hillary Clinton received hundreds of thousands of dollars secretly telling audiences of bankers and CEOs she would represent their interests if elected president. Meanwhile, the Democrats have made common cause with the leaders of the military and intelligence agencies responsible for the crimes Assange has revealed. The rightwing character of the Democrats\u2019 opposition to Trump is exposed by the fact that they support his administration\u2019s attacks on Assange.\nThe defense of Julian Assange, along with Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, is now a central political question that confronts the working class. Attitudes toward these whistleblowers break down largely upon class lines. As the ruling class cracks down on free speech and freedom of the press, class conflict is intensifying across the world.\nThe Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site make the broadest appeal to all those who are serious about defending democratic rights to join the fight to defend Assange, Manning and Snowden. Workers and youth internationally must mobilize immediately to defend these class war prisoners. Their lives depend on it.\nThe fight for Assange\u2019s freedom is the spearhead of the political struggle in defense of democratic rights, against imperialist militarism and capitalism. Only to the extent that the power of the working class can be harnessed can a defense of these whistleblowers be mounted.\nAs Socialist Equality Party (Australia) National Committee member Nick Beams said at Friday\u2019s emergency rally in Sydney,\n\u201cThe attack on democracy is a symptom of a profound disease. There is no defense of democracy without tackling the problem at its source, that is, the profit system of global capitalism, a system in crisis, that has played out its historic role and now has to tear up, trample, defile even the democratic rights that it once stood for. We have to begin, as part of this struggle, the fight for a socialist perspective. Only then can the world be cleansed of all the horrors that capitalism is conjuring up.\u201d\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below. Forward this article to your email lists.

Police in London arrested WikiLeaks founder Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy Thursday, April 11, 2019 for failing to surrender to the court in 2012, shortly after the South American nation revoked his asylum.\nCourt documents reveal federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in late 2017, NBC News reports, more than two months earlier than the indictment disclosed when he was arrested last week.\nAssange was taken into custody April 11 after spending more than six years under the protection of Ecuador's embassy in London.

Everyone does their best to make the race-day experience at Redcar the best it can be and it\u2019s wonderful for that to be recognised in this way.\u201d\nThe forthcoming season promises to be even better, with the course undergoing a number of further improvements for 2019, including new wheelchair access to buildings at the winner\u2019s enclosure, and refurbished outdoor toilets.\nA permanent outdoor bar has been added to the paddock-side canopy that was unveiled last year, and a new first-aid office has been built on the Course side of the track. Racecourse buildings have also been freshly painted.\nIt speaks volumes that the highly-respected Marske-based company H. Jarvis Limited, which has been making windows and doors since 1878, comes back to Redcar year after year for corporate hospitality.\nManaging director Dave Glendinning said: \u201cH. Jarvis Limited use the facilities at Redcar Racecourse every year at the Ladies\u2019 Day meeting in June and have done so for more than 10 years now. Why do we do so? Because the staff and facilities at the racecourse are first class!

Image Credit: AP\nAlso in this package Ajax stun Ronaldo's Juventus to make Champions League semis\nTurin: Ajax basked in widespread praise after their Champions League heroics, but their young players believe the 2-1 away win over Juventus in the second leg of the quarter-final should have been more emphatic.\n\u201cWe could have scored a few more in the second half,\u201d said midfielder Frenkie de Jong, one of the heroes of their triumph in Turin which was characterised by some sweeping passing play.\nThe 3-2 aggregate win ensured unlikely semi-final qualification for the Dutch club who have come all the way through the preliminary rounds of the competition.\n\u201cIn the first half they had a bit more control,\u201d De Jong said of Juventus\u2019 early showing as Cristiano Ronaldo put his side ahead in the 28th minute but Donny van de Beek levelling six minutes later.\n\u201cTheir 1-0 lead was not exactly undeserved but luckily for us we were able to get back to 1-1 quickly after that.\n\u201cBut after the halftime break, we were so much better than them. We wasted a lot of good chances and we should have been much more in the lead,\u201d the Barcelona-bound 21-year-old told reporters.\nVan de Beek agreed the victory margin should have been bigger.\n\u201cWe should have won 4-1. On the basis of our second half showing it was a deserved victory,\u201d said the midfielder, who turns 22 on Thursday.\nThe victory was secured by a second half header from 19-year-old captain Matthijs de Ligt, who was not even born the last time Ajax reached the Champions League semi-finals, losing 2-6 on aggregate to Juventus in 1997.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve witnessed such success for Ajax and the fact that I\u2019m was actually on the field and part of it, I find it bizarre,\u201d the skipper said.\n\u201cWe are now in the semis having knocked out another of the teams favoured to win the title.

{"text": "Updated\nAre Australia's efforts to curb global warming enough to meet our Paris target?\nAustralia has a carbon problem. We have one of the most carbon-intensive economies in the developed world.\nIn 2016, Australia joined more than 170 countries in signing the Paris Agreement \u2014 a global deal that seeks to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nAustralia promised to reduce its emissions by 26 to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. Instead, since 2015 our emissions have been going up year on year.\nThe Government's own projections show Australia is not on track to meet its current Paris target.\nAustralia's current Paris target is only a starting point \u2014 the Paris Agreement expects that in 2020, countries will come back with more ambitious pledges.\nMost of our emissions come from four areas of the economy: transport, industry, agriculture and electricity.\nFour Corners investigates why our emissions keep rising and the challenges we face in turning things around.\nTransport\nTransport makes up about 19 per cent of Australia's total emissions and they've been rising steadily for decades.\nRohan Lund, the CEO of motoring body NRMA, says our love for big gas guzzlers is partly responsible. Many of our top-selling cars last year were SUVs or utes.\n\"We're a big country, we've a big driving culture and particularly in outer suburban areas in the regions we like big cars,\" he said.\nOne way to get less carbon-intensive cars on our roads would be to introduce a fuel efficiency standard.\nAustralia is one of the only countries in the developed world that doesn't have one. The result is that our cars are, on average, less fuel efficient than those in Europe and the US.\nThat standard would essentially force manufacturers to sell a larger number of more efficient cars, but it's become a politically controversial idea in Australia. The Turnbull Government floated the idea in 2017 but abandoned it after pushback from within the party.\nLabor says it will introduce a fuel efficiency standard if it wins the next federal election.\nTime to phase out gas guzzlers?\nOther countries like the UK and France are taking a more interventionist approach and have announced plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars as early as 2040.\nThe NRMA says we should do the same.\n\"The Australian market has got a bit of catching up to do from where we are at the moment, so if anything, our targets here need to be a bit more aggressive than what we're seeing in other markets,\" Mr Lund said.\n\"I would expect to start seeing targets that are between 2025, 2030 for banning [the sale of new] petrol-driven cars in this country.\"\nAustralia is also a global laggard when it comes to electric vehicle uptake. There are only 7,300 on our roads and according to industry they make up about 0.2 per cent of annual new car sales.\nThe Federal Government recently announced a plan to develop a national electric vehicle strategy, but the Electric Vehicle Council says the idea is unclear and lacks urgency.\nIndustry\nIndustry makes up the second largest portion of our emissions \u2014 around 30 per cent \u2014 and they are rising.\nThis sector includes the greenhouse gases that come mainly from manufacturing and extracting and processing resources**.\nOne of the biggest reasons for the rise is our liquid natural gas exports. Australia is now the world's biggest LNG exporter.\nWhen gas is burned for energy it is cleaner than coal \u2014 which is good news for the countries that buy our gas \u2014 but extracting and processing it here is pushing up Australia's emissions.\nBaselines and big polluters\nThere is also no Government incentive for big polluters to reduce their emissions.\nRight now, under the Abbott-era Direct Action Plan, the Government sets a limit on how much each facility can emit and if facilities breach that cap \u2014 known as a baseline \u2014 they can be penalised.\nHugh Grossman, executive director of carbon market analysis firm RepuTex, says that since the policy was established, the Government has allowed big polluters to increase their baselines.\n\"Just under a third of all facilities have increased their baselines beyond where they began initially,\" he said.\nSince Direct Action started, emissions from the big polluters covered by this policy have gone up by 12 per cent and are expected to rise by 19 per cent by 2030, according to RepuTex.\nLast month the Government changed the rules, making it even easier for all big polluters to nominate their own baselines.\nCarbon savings could be wiped out\nThere is another problem too. RepuTex modelling shows emissions from Australia's biggest polluters will wipe out all the reductions contracted to date by the Government's taxpayer-funded carbon reduction scheme \u2014 the Emissions Reduction Fund, or ERF.\nSo far more than $2 billion has been contracted by the fund for programs like tree-planting, avoided deforestation and waste-to-energy.\nThe ERF contracts issued to date are expected to deliver 193 million tonnes of carbon savings between 2015 and 2030. The projected cumulative growth in emissions from big polluters over the same period is 280 million tonnes, according to RepuTex.\nThe Government recently committed an extra $2 billion to the fund, but Mr Grossman said until industry is forced to reduce emissions, Australia will struggle to meet its Paris target.\n\"Industry emissions are Australia's Achilles' heel \u2014 you can't meet a 26 per cent reduction target by letting emissions increase 19 per cent in one sector,\" he said.\n\"Until you address that and better counteract that you won't be meeting an emission reduction target.\"\nAgriculture\nEmissions from agriculture make up about 15 per cent of Australia's total emissions.\nThe drought has caused a decline in the cattle population, pushing emissions down recently but they're expected to rise over the next decade.\nMethane from livestock is the biggest problem. Each day Australia's roughly 90 million sheep and cattle produce the potent greenhouse gas through burps and farts.\nDr Rob Kinley and other researchers at the national science agency, the CSIRO, are working on a solution.\nAt their research facility near Townsville, they've discovered that feeding cows a certain variety of seaweed reduces their methane emissions to almost zero.\n\"All the seaweeds were doing a little something, but this one was rather unbelievable,\" Dr Kinley said.\nBut farming the Asparagopsis seaweed in commercial quantities and getting it into the diets of pasture-fed animals are big challenges.\nDr Bill Hare, a climate scientist and policy analyst who has co-authored reports for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says there is no quick fix.\n\"The way I see agriculture as part of a global strategy to meet the Paris Agreement's goals is that slow and steady is better in agriculture - whether it's in Australia or in India,\" he said.\n\"We need to look at measures that move forward slowly, that bring the farming community along, and that produce lasting and sustainable solutions\".\nElectricity\nElectricity accounts for the largest portion of our emissions \u2014 about 34 per cent \u2014 and they've been falling due to a decrease in gas and coal-fired power, as well as a boom in renewables.\nDespite the opportunities offered by renewables, coal still makes up nearly two thirds of our energy mix.\nMany of Australia's coal-fired power stations are old and due to close in coming decades, but replacing coal with renewables isn't straightforward. To allow more renewable power into the grid, Australia's transmission network needs to be upgraded.\nPaul Italiano, the CEO of network operator TransGrid, said in New South Wales, changes in the network are not keeping pace with the growth of new renewables.\n\"The biggest challenge we're facing at the moment is the number of applications to join the grid exceeds the capacity of the grid to meet those applications,\" he said.\n\"If we look at New South Wales, we have 14,000 megawatts of capacity being asked to join the system. We have about 2,000 megawatts that we can accommodate. So, it's about seven times oversubscribed.\"\nSnowy 2.0: One big battery\nThe second challenge is getting power when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.\nThe Federal Government recently announced funding for the Snowy 2.0 hydro scheme, which will act like a big battery to feed the grid when renewables are not producing enough power.\nBut to get the biggest emissions reductions benefit from Snowy 2.0, more renewable power needs to come online.\nThe project's future is not certain if there is a change of government at the next federal election. So far Labor has only committed to it in principle.\nProfessor Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, said Australia could make a big dent in its emissions through the electricity sector but in the long run, other areas of the economy will have to change too.\n\"We cannot just rely on cutting emissions in the one-third of the emissions budget and letting the two-thirds of the emissions budget keep growing. That is not a recipe for long-term success and that is not a recipe for achieving that 2030 target of whatever magnitude,\" he said.\nWhat's the end game?\nThe Department of Environment and Energy projections released in December show Australia is not on track to meet its current target.\nThe Government disagrees, insisting it is on track to meet the Paris target \"in a canter\".\nRegardless, even the current targets pledged by countries in the Paris Agreement will not be enough to curb potentially dangerous global warming. Under these targets, the world is still on track to warm by around three degrees.\nThe Paris Agreement expects countries to increase their current targets so it can meet its goal of keeping global warming well below two degrees.\nDr Hare warns that anything more than that could be dire.\n\"By the time we get to three degrees warming I think we'll have a continent that is ecologically transformed,\" he said.\n\"Summers will be a time to fear. We've seen over the last summer is just the beginning of that. We're only at one degree warming now. Think three degrees, you think a lot more.\"\nAbout the data\nAll of the data in the graphs presented in this report is sourced from the Federal Government's Department of the Environment and Energy, compiled with the assistance of Climate Analytics.\n*LULUCF refers to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry.\n**For the Industry sector, we have combined emissions from direct combustion, industrial processes and product use, and fugitive emissions as described by the Department of Environment and Energy in its report titled Australia's emissions projections 2018.\nCredits\nTopics: climate-change, environment, government-and-politics, alternative-energy, energy, solar-energy, hydro-energy, wind-energy, mining-environmental-issues, environmental-technology, computers-and-technology, rural, beef-cattle, world-politics, greenhouse-gas, australia\nFirst posted\n", "label": "human"}

Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nRelated: Game of Thrones Theory: Robin Arryn Is King At The End Of Season 8\nSome major episodes are missing (Ned Stark's death and the Purple Wedding, for example) because as shocking as they were, they aren't necessarily the most relevant to the current storyline. Instead, these are the episodes that include vital plot points, major changes, or moments that are likely to come into play as the world watches to see who finally sits atop the Iron Throne.\nThis Page: Rewatch Game of Thrones Seasons 1-4\nPage 2: Rewatch Game of Thrones Seasons 5-7\nWinter Is Coming (Season 1, Episode 1)\nThe very first episode of Game of Thrones is a surprisingly vital rewatch, and not just for the plot. From teasers and trailers, it's clear that the season 8 premiere is going to mirror the very first episode in several ways - although this season, it's Daenerys coming to Winterfell, not Robert Baratheon. \"Winter Is Coming\" sets up all kinds of vital plot points, from the 'kidnapping' of Lyanna Stark to the death of Jon Arryn and Ned Stark coming to King's Landing. It covers the war to take the throne from the Targaryens, Cersei and Jaime's relationship, Tyrion's place in the family, Jon's position as a bastard, and the return of the White Walkers. In addition to all the actual plot set-up, this is worth a rewatch to see just how far the show has come - and how the survivors have changed since the very beginning.\nFire And Blood (Season 1, Episode 10)\nHaving spent an episode on the Starks, now it's time for a very Targaryen episode - and the first appearance of Daenerys' dragons! \"Fire and Blood\" takes place immediately after the death of Ned Stark, and while that was a gloriously shocking episode, the fallout is actually a more important thing to rewatch than the actual beheading. This episode sees the War of the Five Kings begin in earnest, after the Starks learn of their father's death. It also sets up the start of Sansa and Arya's solo journeys to the final season - Sansa, as the betrothed of a man that she wants to kill, and Arya, hiding her identity and going on the run (with Gendry, who also makes this episode worth rewatching). On top of all of that, though, there's the absolutely epic moment that Daenerys kills her \"sun and stars\" and walks into his funeral pyre... re-emerging with baby dragons on her shoulder.\nThe Rains Of Castamere (Season 3, Episode 9)\nWe're not including a lot of episodes here that are all about the shock value, but no Game of Thrones rewatch would be complete without \"The Rains of Castamere\" - or, as it is better known, The Red Wedding. The episode does also provide a little extra helpful plot for rewatchers, as it shows Tormund, Jon, and Ygritte South of the Wall, as well as Bran learning how to warg into Hodor. Daario Naharis appears, which may end up being important for the final season (if the series isn't done with him), but this is also a big moment because it continues to chart Daenerys' growth as she takes Yunkai.\nOf course, while new character introductions and keeping tabs on Jon and Daenerys are important reasons to include \"The Rains Of Castamere,\" let's not pretend that the main reason isn't to see one of the most shocking moments of the entire series: the deaths of Robb, Catelyn, and their followers and family. The Red Wedding is brutal, bloody, and perfect for rewatching - even if the deaths of Robb and Catelyn don't directly impact the final season.\nRelated: Will Lady Stoneheart Finally Appear In Game of Thrones Season 8?\nThe Children (Season 4, Episode 10)\nJumping forward to the end of another season, \"The Children\" is a pivotal episode for multiple characters, although it's definitely more of a plot-heavy one than one for fans of the gory moments. The season 4 finale covers Daenerys attempting to actually rule Meereen - which is an interesting contrast to \"The Rains of Castamere,\" when she was focusing on conquering cities, not what to do after they have been conquered. \"The Children\" shows how Daenerys may struggle to rule Westeros, and struggle to control her dragons as they grow.\nThis episode also checks in with Jon, and shows a different kind of ruling style that may be relevant for the final season, as he risks his life to go negotiate with Mance Rayder. Bran Stark finally reaches the tree where he meets the Three-Eyed Raven, and Qyburn tells Cersei that he can 'save' the dying Mountain.\nAs if all that wasn't enough (this is Game of Thrones, after all), \"The Children\" also includes Tyrion's escape from the dungeons (aided by Jaime) and his murder of Tywin Lannister - giving him the title he uses later of the \"greatest Lannister Killer of our time.\" Finally, it includes the fight between the Hound and Brienne, one that ends with Arya leaving the Hound to die... something that will definitely come up in the final season, when Arya and the Hound are reunited for the first time since this episode.\nPage 2: Rewatch Game of Thrones Seasons 5-7\n1 2\nMarvel's Original MCU Phase 1 Plan Ended With A Very Different Avengers\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Opinion: the HSE has almost exhausted their 2019 funding for new drugs, so how can we ensure patients still get the cutting-edge treatment they need?\nScientific sophistication has enabled us to live longer, healthier lives. However, like all things in life, nothing comes free: the levy placed on living longer is the risk of developing health issues such as cancer or cardiovascular disease.\nRecent estimates in the Journal of Health Economics put the cost of developing a new drug at $2.8bn. This represents the cost of employing some of the world\u2019s brightest minds and completing various safety checks prior to a drugs approval. It can take eight years or more before a new medicine reaches the market. This cost trickles down to our health systems - and they are beginning to buckle under pressure.\nFor most of us when we get sick, we see the doctor who writes us a prescription, pop into the pharmacist and pay around \u20ac20 to get our medicines. However, some drugs for conditions like cancer could cost thousands. It would be unreasonable to expect people to pay this so the government has to subsidise the cost. The HSE have a finite budget each year to subsidise these expensive medicines as they are developed, and this year they have almost run out of money already.\nFrom RT\u00c9 Six One News, Aisling Kenny reports on protests over the HSE decision not to reimburse the cost of spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza\nThis is not the first time a national health system has shown the strains of funding new therapies, the NHS have made the news multiple times over the last number of years for refusing to fund these therapies due to an unjustifiable cost-effectiveness ratio.\nHowever, there may be some other ways to reduce the financial burden on our health system. Despite significant interest around cutting edge technologies, the older, less expensive drugs work very effectively in many cases and could be made even better by combining them or tailoring the dosage precisely to the patient. Although there is some scope for this currently, it can be difficult to find the right balance between side-effects and benefit. For example, it was recently suggested that the one-size fits all approach for aspirin (one of the world\u2019s most widely used medicines) could be ineffective and that dosing should be tailored for a patient\u2019s weight.\nHow do you treat a patient who has been stripped of their livelihood by a disease?\nFor some medicines it could be challenging to achieve precise doses through conventional methods, but the latest techniques in 3D printing could provide an answer. 3D printing enables researchers to print tablets and medical devices of various shapes and sizes to enable drug delivery. The flexibility of this equipment allows for precise tailoring of a dose within a few minutes for immediate dispensing.\nAlthough scientific journals are booming with the idea that there could be a 3D printer in every pharmacy, the statutory instruments haven\u2019t quite kept pace with innovation. When a drug is manufactured in the pharmaceutical industry, it must go through a number of regulatory checks (with expensive equipment!) to prove that the drug is what it says on the label, that it is pure and the correct strength.\nThe main drawback of 3D printing is that it would place the entire regulatory burden on the pharmacist, a mammoth task. However, analysts suggest that a hub-and-spoke model is the pharmacy of the future. With this model, prescriptions are sent electronically from the prescriber to a hub pharmacy with this validation equipment. Then medicines are delivered to the spokes in each of the local communities so that pharmacists can interact with patient at point of supply.\nFrom RT\u00c9 Lyric FM's Culture File, Gordon Wallace on how 3D printing might offer treatments for everything from bad knees to schizophrenia\nAnother approach to achieve cost-effectiveness follows the adage that \"one ounce of prevention better than a pound of cure.\" A famous paper written by Nicholas Wald in the British Medical Journal in 2003 argued that we could extend the life expectancy of a third of the population by 12 years if we gave every person over 55 or everyone with cardiovascular disease a PolyPill. This is not a new concept in medicine; a PolyPill is a tablet or capsule that contains more than one drug. Anyone who has taken a multivitamin or a cold and flu remedy has taken a PolyPill.\nWald\u2019s PolyPill would cost around \u20ac180 per patient annually and could help alleviate the financial burdens faced by our healthcare systems by reducing the rates of heart attacks and strokes by up to 80%. Repacking medicines in this way could also raise the threshold before more expensive treatments are required, potentially allowing more money to be put aside for the patients who need the latest medicine. This is not a perfect solution, however, as mass treatment of the population would put some individuals at risk of harm.\nFrom this, it\u2019s clear that healthcare professionals are faced with an almost impossible challenge. How do you treat a patient who has been stripped of their livelihood by a disease? Do we pay the designer prices or should we take a conservative approach so that we have enough money to treat the next person who walks into the clinic? Perhaps new approaches are warranted as the status quo is proving to be financially unviable.\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and do not represent or reflect the views of RT\u00c9\n", "label": "human"}

You can unsubscribe at any time.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is considering closing some of the lanes at ports of entry or preventing certain types of vehicles or people from crossing the border as he tries to force Mexico to increase its enforcement, three outside advisers told POLITICO.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get Mexico\u2019s attention,\u201d said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for tighter restrictions on immigration.\nThe administration already has taken some of those actions, though they have gotten little attention. Customs and Border Protection said in a March 29 memo to shipping companies, importers and other businesses that it would halt a Sunday screening program for commercial trucks at a Nogales, Ariz., port of entry and blamed an \u201cunprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis\u201d for the cutback.\nThe administration is considering ways to reduce the number of people crossing into the U.S. That could mean closing some lanes at ports of entry or limiting who is allowed to cross to only day workers. Another proposal under discussion would bar passenger vehicles \u2014 but not commercial trucks \u2014 from crossing the border.\nBut closing the border or even limiting the flow of people through the ports of entry would not prevent migrants from attempting to cross the border illegally.\nEven some people close to the White House called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cbluster\u201d and predicted he would not close off the border from one of its largest trading partners. Mexico is the United States\u2019s third-largest trading partner with more than $600 billion in cross-border trade last year.\n\u201cI understand the president\u2019s frustration but the unintended consequences of that would be bad for everybody: economic, diplomatic,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who questioned how such a move could disrupt negotiations with Mexico to handle migrations from the Northern Triangle. \u201cI take him very seriously. But I think we should have a longer conversation about unintended consequences.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the way he negotiates, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a particularly good idea and I\u2019m not sure it gets the desired result,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota of the potential closed border. \u201cTactically it doesn\u2019t get a result and probably has a lot of unintended consequences ... there\u2019s a lot of bilateral trade at the border.\u201d\nTrump will travel to Calexico, Calif., to tour the border on Friday on a West Coast swing that also includes 2020 campaign fundraising. The White House has not disclosed details of the trip.\nAsked whether he thinks Trump is serious about closing the border, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) replied: \u201cOh, I have no idea. You\u2019d need to ask him that.\u201d\nTrump has made cracking down on immigration a central theme of his presidency but has struggled to get his proposals past congressional Republicans. In February, he declared a national emergency to unlock Pentagon funds he can unilaterally steer to a border wall as well as use money from other projects. That action was immediately challenged in court.\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah said he takes the president \u201cseriously\u201d and wants more details about how it would affect trade and the economy. Romney was one of a dozen Republicans who rebuffed Trump\u2019s emergency request last month, revealing a sharp intraparty divide over border politics.\nMost Republicans agree there is a crisis on the border but disagree with tactics like closing ports of entry and the emergency request.\nAccording to a current and a former DHS official familiar with the situation, Trump is once again considering creating a so-called immigration czar, one person in charge of an issue that affects a dozen departments and agencies, including Homeland Security, State, Justice, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services. The position would not need Senate confirmation.\nSome of the people being considered are Francis Cissna, director of Citizenship and Immigration Services; Thomas Douglas Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs; former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach; and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, according to the former DHS official. Michael Neifach, who worked for former President George W. Bush, was approached about the job last year, the former official said.\nThe White House did not respond to questions Monday. But on Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted that Trump\u2019s talk of bold action should not be dismissed. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t a bluff. You can take the president seriously,\" she told Fox News.\nTrump on Friday renewed past threats to close the border after his administration announced it was at a \u201cbreaking point\u201d processing the paperwork at the border, where agents are seeing an influx of migrants. Border Patrol arrested more than 66,000 migrants in February, the highest monthly total since March 2009 \u2014 and officials have said the number rose higher still last month. \"Mexico is going to have to do something, otherwise I\u2019m closing the border,\" declared Trump, who is said to fixate on border-crossing statistics.\nTrump has long criticized Mexico for failing to halt Central American migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras from coming to the U.S. border. But he had not previously put a timeline on his threat to close the border.\nOn Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen ordered an expansion of the administration's \"remain in Mexico\" strategy, which forces certain non-Mexican asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico pending resolution of their asylum cases in the U.S.\nThe secretary said her department would expand the policy \u2014 formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols \u2014 \"to return hundreds of additional migrants per day.\" The program already has been launched at and between several ports of entry in California and Texas.\nIn a memo to Customs and Border Protection, Nielsen also called for the agency to accelerate a plan to reassign 750 customs officers to assist with Border Patrol efforts to process and house incoming migrants.\nShe added in a related announcement that CBP should explore reassigning more personnel, but should notify her if it details more than 2,000 employees to emergency border work.\n\"The crisis at our border is worsening, and DHS will do everything in its power to end it,\" she said in a written statement. \"We will not stand idly by while Congress fails to act yet again, so all options are on the table.\"\nThe number of family members intercepted at the southwest border soared in March, according to preliminary CBP statistics. While overall arrests remain below the higher levels of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, the Trump administration argues families and children present unique humanitarian and security issues.\nNielsen last week urged Congress to provide additional resources to deal with the growing number of migrants. In addition, she pressed lawmakers to change immigration laws to permit children to be detained for more than 20 days \u2014 the current limit set by a federal court order \u2014 and to allow for the swift deportation of unaccompanied minors from Central America.\nThe Trump administration has implemented a number of hard-line policies to deter illegal immigration and asylum-seekers, only to see a record number of family members caught crossing the border in recent months. Border Patrol estimated that it arrested more than 55,000 family members in March, a 520 percent increase over the same month a year earlier.\nTrump last week ordered the State Department to slash aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras because those nations haven\u2019t taken enough action to deter migrants from traveling northward. The State Department informed congressional offices in recent days that it would redirect $450 million in fiscal year 2018 funding to the countries and examine already-committed funds to see if they could be rerouted.\n\u201cCracking down and being harsher has not deterred anybody from coming,\u201d said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cUltimately, what would stop people from coming is if those countries improve the conditions on the ground.\u201d\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "(This April 16 story corrects paragraph 1 to indicate the study came from Singapore)\nBy Lisa Rapaport\n(Reuters Health) - Hundreds of smartphone apps promise to make managing type 2 diabetes easier, but very few offer real-time guidance on what to do for dangerously high or low blood sugar, a study from Singapore suggests.\nResearchers looked at 5,185 apps for phones running Google\u2019s Android software or Apple\u2019s iOS system. Out of this total, they found 371 apps that claimed to provide several key components for type 2 diabetes management: recording blood sugar data; reminding patients when they need to do specific things to manage the illness; and educating patients on how to handle conditions like dangerously low or high blood sugar.\n\u201cPeople with diabetes will need to make many decisions relating not only to diet and lifestyle but also which medication to take and what dose depending on their blood sugar levels,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Josip Car of the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\u201cApps could potentially support some aspects of self-management - if well-designed,\u201d Car said by email. \u201cBut our study demonstrates the immaturity of diabetes apps and missed opportunities to improve care and health outcomes.\u201d\nThe study focused only on patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which is associated with obesity and aging and happens when the body can\u2019t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, diabetes can lead to nerve damage, amputations, blindness, heart disease and strokes.\nRoughly one in 13 people with diabetes who own smartphones use an app to help them manage their condition, researchers note in JAMA.\nEarlier studies suggested that using an app that supports blood sugar management may help people achieve lower blood sugar than they can on their own, the study team writes.\nEvery app in the current analysis allowed people to record blood sugar levels.\nBut just 37 percent let people set goals like a target blood sugar level, and only 28 percent gave patients reminders to check their blood sugar.\nRoughly 58 percent of the apps alerted users when they had dangerously high or low blood sugar levels. But only 21 percent of the prompts warning about low blood sugar offered suggestions for what to do about it, and just 15 percent of warnings about high blood sugar gave this kind of guidance.\nWhen people did get advice on how to handle dangerously low blood sugar, the apps suggested that people consume food, juice or sugar just about 14 percent of the time - about as often as the apps advised patients to seek medical help.\nWith dangerously high blood sugar, the apps that gave advice told people to seek medical help about 13 percent of the time, and proposed insulin about three percent of the time.\nThe study can\u2019t prove whether or how apps might directly impact health outcomes for people with diabetes. Another limitation is that the apps were reviewed in December, 2018, and features might have changed since then.\n\u201cSmartphone apps can be a great way to track health data, but there are many inconsistencies, flaws, and shortcomings that need to be worked out,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\u201cThere is tremendous variability in available apps, and there is minimal regulatory control to ensure content is accurate or efficacious,\u201d Platt, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\nAs the study shows, patients who rely on the apps for medical advice may not get what they need when they need it, said Sheri Colberg of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\u201cMany of these apps did have alerts for blood glucose out of range, but little usable advice to follow the alerts,\u201d Colberg, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\u201cFor example, the message \u2018seek medical help\u2019 is not useful to most if they lack easy access to medical care or the financial means to do so,\u201d Colberg added. \u201cSelf-management has been shown to work better but requires diabetes education not provided by most of these apps.\u201d\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2VUrEQZ JAMA, online April 16, 2019.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "To remain independent and be effective, a host of new Chicago aldermen would do well with formal training and assistance, the authors write. | Sun-Times file photo\nGiven this month\u2019s election results, Chicago will have one of the most diverse and progressive City Councils in modern history. With about a dozen new aldermen, including some progressive Democratic Socialists and the fewest white men since 1923, voters have declared that they want change.\nBut even with these developments, corrupt power dynamics are still institutionalized through the inner workings of City Hall. Old-guard politicians rely on newly elected aldermen not knowing the ropes, so they handpick freshmen who pledge their loyalty in exchange for legislative assistance.\nOPINION\nIn government, process often dictates outcome. Those elected to make change need fair and comprehensive access to information for truly progressive ideas to see the light of day.\nOne of the first things our new City Council can do is champion the creation of an independent entity that would provide expert-led information and training for aldermen, as well as opportunities for veteran alderman to expand and deepen their knowledge base. Perhaps partnering with a university or non-profit organizations will provide consistent, independent expertise that can help prepare our elected officials.\nNow that the election is over, we must focus on substance over platitudes. New leadership at all levels means an opportunity to create the kind of government that speaks to our values. Chicagoans want independent leadership, but independence requires a certain level of confidence, and that confidence comes when aldermen are empowered with information.\nFive months after they are sworn in, new aldermen are expected to vote on a complex $9 billion dollar budget that cuts across 34 city departments and dovetails with several other agencies. It is in our interest that they are operating at the maximum level of knowledge and capacity.\nIf you were having surgery, you wouldn\u2019t want a first-year medical student leading the operation. If you found yourself in a big court battle, you\u2019d be apprehensive about a recent law graduate managing your case.\nIn the third largest city in the country, it is problematic that there is no formal mechanism for aldermen to receive orientation and training on the fundamentals of city government: things like tax increment financing, budgeting, zoning, how to draft an ordinance and parliamentary procedure.\nChicago is a global city that must be at the forefront of the latest trends in economic development, housing, tourism, environmental issues and much more. Our aldermen must be able to keep up and lead the public policy issues of our time. They cannot do that if they spend their first couple of years trying to make heads and tails of city government, all while simultaneously managing services in their respective wards.\nNow that change is upon us, we must take advantage of this opportunity to institutionalize better government. We hope this low-hanging fruit will be a top priority for our new, and hopefully independent, City Council.\nAmara Enyia, executive director of the Austin Chamber of Commerce, was a candidate for mayor this year.

{"text": "This story is about Published 3d\nFilm room: Grading 3 Cowboys pre-draft visitors, including a running back-turned-receiver with enticing traits Share This Story On... Twitter\nFacebook\nEmail\nEric Gay/AP FILE - Baylor wide receiver Jalen Hurd (5) tries to avoid a hit by UTSA safety Darryl Godfrey (23) following a catch during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018, in San Antonio. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\nBy John Owning Contact John Owning on Twitter: @JohnOwning\nMeasuring 6-foot-2, 201 pounds with 4.39 speed, Missouri's Emanuel Hall is one of the preeminent deep threats in the entire draft. In fact, he is one of the most explosive players in the class, testing into the 99.4 percentile among NFL wide receivers at the scouting combine, according to Three Sigma Athlete (though he didn't participate in the three-cone and short-shuttle drills).\nHall leverages that speed and explosiveness to stretch the field vertically and run by defensive backs on the outside. His freakish acceleration and deep speed enable him to quickly eat up a cornerback's cushion before separating down the field.\nHe also does a good job of hand-fighting downfield to clear contact and maintain his pace on route, which is a big reason why he's able to consistently create separation even when defenses know it's coming. Hall's entire game is predicated on speed, and that enables him to have a lot of success on stop routes (curls and comebacks) and back-shoulder fades. Because cornerbacks have to quickly bail on their backpedals to have a chance at turning and running with Hall downfield, it gives him the ability to manipulate them, opting to sit down on his routes once corners open their hips to turn and run. Hall's success on vertical routes extends to his ability in the slot, where he easily runs past safeties and linebackers. Because defenses often gift slot receivers with free releases, Hall's NFL team would be wise to use him to stretch the seam from the slot.\nHall is outstanding at widening cornerbacks with his release in an effort to win inside leverage, which is why he is adept at creating separation on slant routes. He displays quick footwork to widen corners with his release. Hall's speed on the outside gets cornerbacks to bite hard when he initially stems outside with his release, leaving the inside track open for him to create separation.\nHis speed enables him to eat up large chunks of ground after the catch and he shows enough elusiveness to make the first defender miss. Hall, however, lacks the creativity and power through contact to be a consistent yards-after-catch threat. Unfortunately, Hall doesn't run the most diverse route tree, as a large portion of his snaps are spent running go routes to stretch the defense vertically. Because of this, he is raw in his ability to disguise and create separation on horizontal breaking routes.\nMoreover, despite magnificent leaping ability (43.5-inch vertical), Hall is not nearly assertive enough at the catch point. He doesn't attack the ball often, allowing cornerbacks to have more effect at the catch point than they should. On top of that, Hall has a bad tendency to lose focus at the catch point, leading to frustrating drops (12 in his last two years, according to Pro Football Focus).\nHall's lack of physicality at the catch point carries over to his route-running ability. His speed scares defenses into gifting him a lot of free releases and off-coverage, but when cornerbacks don't cede separation on his initial release and are able to be physical with him through his stem, Hall often struggles.\nHe isn't much of an asset in the run game, putting forth minimal effort to block his man or inhibit a defender from pursuing the ball carrier. Honestly, Hall looks mostly disinterested in blocking altogether, which will be a barrier between him earning early playing time -- especially on a team that values the run game as much as Dallas. Hall's best use in the run game is running decoy routes to occupy cornerbacks on the outside. He also has some durability concerns, having dealt with hamstring and groin injuries in 2017 and 2018.\nDespite Hall's lack of refinement in running a full route tree and at the catch point, his ability to consistently create separation on vertical, stop and slant routes makes him an enticing target on Day 2 -- or possibly early Day 3 -- of the draft.\nIf selected, he could back up Michael Gallup at the Z receiver position with the ability to vie for the starting job in Year 2. Sanjay Lal is one of the most detail-oriented wide receiver coaches in the NFL, which positions him well to improve the unrefined portions of Hall's game while giving him tools to maximize his best skills. GRADE : 7.43 (Round 3) Jalen Hurd, WR, Baylor\nJalen Hurd was once a heralded running back at Tennessee, but the beating of the position started taking a toll on his body (including a concussion) and prompted him to make changes. He transferred to Baylor, where he sat out in 2017 due to transfer rules after accumulating more than 2,000 rushing yards in three seasons with the Volunteers. Despite being new to wide receiver and predictably raw in key areas, he showcased impressive traits last season, accumulating 946 receiving yards and four touchdowns on 69 catches (13.7 yards per catch) while becoming a draftable prospect at receiver. Listed at 6-5, 225 pounds with 10.25-inch hands, Hurd possesses an exquisite frame to go along with passable athleticism at the position. He lacks the speed and acceleration to consistently stretch the field on the outside, but he does have the kind of fluidity that will enable him to continually improve as a route runner.\nAs one would expect with his lack of experience at the position, Hurd is significantly lacking in the refinement and variety of his releases on top of the ability to disguise routes with his stems. His releases are slow and lack the creativity and suddenness to manipulate coverage.\nHurd struggles when jammed at the line of scrimmage, which is why most of his initial value in the NFL will come in the slot. He also needs to understand how to adjust his routes based on coverage. Despite his lack of experience, Hurd showcases improving ball skills, showing the ability to win through traffic and in contested situations. He adjusts to the ball well and does a good job of tracking the ball in the air. Hurd effortlessly extends to snatch passes outside his frame. Furthermore, he uses his body well to box out defenders and win at the catch point. Despite showing nice traits at the catch point, Hurd still struggled with focus drops in his first season at receiver, logging nine last season, according to PFF.\nHurd also showed impressive refinement on breaking routes, showing the ability to create separation fluidly on horizontal breaking routes (dig and out routes) and double-moves. He accelerates well out of his breaks, enabling him to create or maintain separation.\nAs one might expect with Hurd's experience at running back, he's gifted with the ball in his hands. He has too much power and contact balance for most defensive backs, which allows him to bully smaller defenders after the catch.\nHe was even utilized as a ball carrier out of the backfield at Baylor, enjoying a good amount of success -- given the opportunities -- with 209 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 48 carries (4.4 yards per carry). Furthermore, Hurd's experience at running back makes him a great option on screens and jet sweeps.\nHe is also an energetic and willing blocker. He lacks refinement in his blocking technique, but Hurd's size and strength give him the potential to be a huge asset in the run game as a blocker, which could make it easier for him to find playing time early in his career. He lacks a lot of the nuances that separate the successful receivers from the unsuccessful ones in the NFL. Having said that, Hurd possesses a lot of enticing traits that, if developed, could lead to significant success, which is why he is a worthwhile gamble on Day 3 of the draft.\nIf selected by Dallas, Hurd would likely hang around at the end of the gameday roster while he develops the requisite traits to consistently produce. His size and blocking upside could enable him to challenge Noah Brown for a spot on the roster in Year 1, though he likely wouldn't contribute much as a traditional receiver until Year 2 or 3.\nGRADE : 6.85 (Round 5) Jace Sternberger, TE, Texas A&M\nAt 6-4, 251 pounds, Jace Sternberger is a versatile tight end who had a lot of success from a variety of alignments, including in-line, in the slot, out wide and in the backfield. He tested as an average athlete, which limits his ceiling, but he displays the fluidity to become a real pass-catching threat. After spending 2015-16 at Kansas, Sternberger spent a year at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M before transferring to Texas A&M, where he excelled in his lone season by racking up 48 catches for 832 yards (17.3 yards per catch) and 10 touchdowns. He is a smooth route runner who gets into and accelerates out of his breaks well, which enables him to create separation against defenders who may be better athletes. Sternberger sells his routes well, enabling him to manipulate coverage and create separation despite modest athleticism.\nOut at #NFL Films today with @gregcosell...Watching Texas A&M TE Jace Sternberger (6-foot-4, 251). Sets up the DB to win on the seam/post here. And you can see his ability to run after the catch. @NFLMatchup pic.twitter.com/NMLlyU4PKd \u2014 Matt Bowen (@MattBowen41) April 9, 2019\nHe also does a good job of reading coverage and the leverage of defenders to find soft spots in-between zones and create passing windows for his quarterback.\nSternberger is extremely refined at the catch point and has an impressive catch radius, showing the ability to pluck the ball outside his frame or rise above the rim to make plays above his head. The Oklahoma native also possesses strong hands, which allow him to have a lot of success in contested-catch situations. He also shows good enough body control to adjust to an inaccurate throw.\nGood lord Jace Sternberger just dragged this man 30 yards. pic.twitter.com/Kc6PHKHJ3g \u2014 Nick Farabaugh (@FarabaughFB) April 4, 2019\nDespite being an average athlete, Sternberger thrives after the catch. He isn't the fleetest of foot, but he runs with power and has excellent contact balance, as he is able to carry or pinball through defenders to pick up extra yardage.\nSternberger is a willing blocker but lacks the play strength to survive in one-on-one situations against edge defenders. He will need to improve his anchor at the point of attack while being more aggressive with his hand placement. One of his biggest issues is that he takes poor angles to second-level defenders, causing him to miss blocks and muddy running lanes on occasion.\nSternberger does show interest in blocking, as he continually looks to sustain blocks even when out of position. He's currently more pesky than consistently effective as a blocker. Even though the Cowboys brought Jason Witten back from retirement, they could still look to add a tight end who they think can develop into a starter once Witten is gone for good. Sternberger is exactly that kind of tight end. He could immediately vie for the No. 2 tight end spot, where he'd likely see a good amount of snaps while splitting time with Witten.\nHere's another 3rd down conversion for Sternberger. This is impossible to defend.

{"text": "Screenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nKnowing your credit score is an important part of your financial picture. You'll need a credit check for loans and major purchases, like down payments on a new home or vehicle, and when opening some new credit cards. Being involved in your credit is another way to verify that your identity hasn't been stolen. Note that looking into your credit score will not affect your credit.\nWith the new Apple Card coming out this summer, it may be time to do a checkup on your credit score before you apply. You need to be a well-qualified customer to be approved for the new credit card. Apple hasn't exactly explained what that means, but knowing your standing is never a bad thing.\nIf you haven't checked your credit score lately, start with a well-known company like Experian and Credit Karma (full list below). There are several that offer a range of services at different price points, including a free online check and free 30-day trial. Keep in mind that some companies require your credit card information, but they typically provide additional services, like insurance against identity theft and flagging suspicious use of your Social Security number.\nSo how does a credit score work? Everyone starts out with a FICO score, which is your creditworthiness number that can range from 300 to 850. The higher the number, the better. Some factors that affect your FICO score include \"hard inquiries\" like applying for credit (your credit is under review); \"derogatory marks\" like paying a bill late (these can keep your score down); and how much of your total credit you're using (the less you use, the better). You get a FICO score from the three major US credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. Here's how these services break down.\nRead: The best identity theft monitoring services for 2019\nExperian\nFree 30-day trial\nPrice: $20 per month\nOffers tool to help boost your credit score\nIncludes identity theft monitoring\nSays it will address fraud if your identity or personal information is stolen\nShows your FICO scores for all three bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax)\nMonitors your credit\nScreenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nExperian (or download the app for iOS or Android) is one of the major credit monitoring services that offers your FICO scores for the three bureaus. Experian can help you boost your FICO score by using utility bills that you're already paying to apply to your credit. Your new credit scores will immediately take effect.\nThe company monitors identity theft and conducts daily scans of dark web pages to detect if your information has been stolen. If anything is detected, Experian says its support team will help.\nTransUnion\n$25 per month\nIncludes free identity protection\nUnlimited score and report access\nCredit Lock Plus\nUp to $1,000,000 in ID theft insurance\nAlso among the top three major credit monitoring services is TransUnion (or download the app for iOS or Android). With TransUnion, you can check your credit score report as often as you'd like to see if your score has changed.\nIdentity protection is included through Javelin, an identity protection service provider. Your monthly fee includes credit monitoring, instant alerts if someone applies for credit in your name and up to $1,000,000 in ID theft insurance. TransUnion Credit Lock is a service that keeps your credit profile on lockdown until you unseal it. For example, if a criminal applies for credit in your name, the lock will prevent them from stealing your credit information.\nScreenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nEquifax\n$5 for a 30-day trial\n$20 per month\nShows your three-bureau FICO scores\nIncludes identity protection\nSends alerts about suspicious activities\nMonitors credit and social security number\nThe third main credit bureau in the US, Equifax (or download the app for iOS), suffered one of the worst data breaches in 2017 affecting more than half of all Americans. Equifax has a three-year plan to earn back your trust.\nIf you're feeling forgiving, Equifax's services are on par with competitors. It provides a copy of your Equifax credit report and monitors your credit and Social Security numbers by scanning websites where consumer information has been sold. Equifax also sends alerts about suspicious activities, like someone applying for credit in your name on the other side of the country.\nScreenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nRead: How the Equifax hack happened, and what still needs to be done\nCredit Karma\nFree\nCheck credit score for free\nMonitors credit\nShows credit factors and how they affect your score\nCredit Karma (or download the app for iOS or Android) is a personal finance company. You can use it to check your credit scores as often as you'd like for free. You can also access your credit scores from TransUnion and Equifax, but not from Experian. Credit Karma monitors your credit and sends weekly updates and will notify you if there's any change to your credit score.\nThe site also shows you your score and credit factors that affect your score, like if you're using too much of your credit card limit, derogatory marks and hard inquiries.\nScreenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nMint\nFree\nCheck your credit score for free\nAll personal information is encrypted\nMint (or download the app for iOS or Android) is a free service for managing your personal finances. In addition to tracking your payments, you can use it to find out where your credit score is lacking, like not having a long credit history, and where it's doing great, like paying bills on time. Mint shows you your on-time payments, credit usage (so you can see if you're reaching your limit) and average age of credit on one screen.\nAfter you verify your identity, Mint will send your credit report summary and credit monitoring alerts if your score goes up or down.\nScreenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nFreeCreditReport.com\nFree\nCheck your Experian credit score\nScore information updates every 30 days\nMonitor credit usage, hard inquiries and late payments\nScreenshot by Katie Conner/CBS Interactive\nFreeCreditReport.com is a pared-down service provided by Experian to access your credit report for free. The company provides you with an updated credit report every 30 days. You'll have access to your account history, like real estate and credit accounts. FreeCreditReport.com shows you hard inquiries on your account, tracks your credit usage and shows any potential marks against you, like late payments.\nMix and match services may help cover more ground\nWhen it comes to checking your credit, there are a lot of ways to go. You can select one service, or pair free services together to access your FICO score from all three major bureaus.\nHowever, if you go that route, keep in mind that you won't have the promised credit protection and monitoring that Experian, TransUnion and Equifax offer.\nPublished March 31 at 7 a.m. PT\nUpdate, April 2 at 3 a.m. PT: Added more details\nNow playing: Watch this: Apple Card FAQ: What you need to know\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hovered near its weakest level since May 2017 on Friday as traders waited to see whether United States GDP numbers due out later will reinforce signs of economic strength and send the dollar surging even higher.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Dollar and Euro notes are seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS/Thomas White\nAfter a small rise in volatility this week - albeit from multi-year lows - currency markets turned calm on Friday, with most major pairs stuck in tight trading ranges.\nThe dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies inched lower to 98.101 after advancing to 98.322 on Thursday, its highest since May 2017.\nThe euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.1143\nData at 1230 GMT is expected to show that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.0 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. That follows strong capital goods numbers on Thursday.\n\u201cThis week\u2019s break in EUR/USD below $1.1200 has largely been a dollar story. Over the next few days, however, focus could return to Europe,\u201d ING analysts wrote in a note to clients, citing Sunday\u2019s Spanish election, an S&P credit rating review of Italian sovereign debt, and possible French economic reforms.\nMany analysts have been surprised at the strength of the dollar after the Federal Reserve paused its interest rate hiking cycle at the start of 2019.\nThat was followed by other policymakers delaying tightening plans, with the Riksbank the latest to do so on Thursday, sending the Swedish crown to 17-year lows. The crown recovered 0.4 percent versus the dollar on Friday to 9.5015, with similar gains against the euro to 10.5825 crowns.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said dollar weakness was \u201cdelayed but not canceled.\u201d\n\u201cNevertheless, economic data suggest that our anticipated USD decline may be delayed by a quarter or even longer should the US administration impose tariffs on European autos in May,\u201d they said.\nThe yen slipped slightly on Friday to 111.63 yen per dollar, after shedding 0.5 percent overnight following the Bank of Japan putting a time frame on its forward guidance for the first time.\nIt told investors that it would keep interest rates at super-low levels for at least one more year, in a move aimed at dispelling any doubt over its commitment to ultra-loose policies.\nThe Australian dollar, which this week hit a four-month low as soft inflation data boosted the prospect of a rate cut, rose 0.4 percent to $0.7045.\nThe New Zealand dollar gained half a percent to$0.6659 on increased optimism about the domestic economy.\nSterling, which has been hurt this week by dollar strength and concerns Brexit talks between the ruling Conservative and opposition Labour parties had run into the sand, clawed itself back above $1.29.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Ridin\u2019 the range. Bonding with a doe-eyed horse. Chowing down \u2019round a campfire. And soothing your riding aches with a massage. It\u2019s a dream vacation for a wanna-be cowpoke.\nDude ranches are popular because the Wild West is eternally captivating and showbiz has fired up that popularity to the max. HBO touched a nerve with the sci-fi series Westworld, but mid-20th-century TV was the mother lode, airing Wagon Train, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Bonanza and Rawhide starring a young Clint Eastwood. On the Hollywood screen, nothing beats the 1991 dramedy City Slickers, featuring Billy Crystal learning about ropin\u2019, ridin\u2019 and life from Jack Palance, the wise, weathered trail boss.\nBut the cowboy life is open to all. If you are tempted to don boots, spurs and a Stetson, there\u2019s a home on the range for almost every weekend wrangler, from greenhorns to experienced equestrians.\nI sought out Gene Kilgore for advice. He\u2019s an expert on dude ranches and an author who has visited hundreds of vacation spots, and covered thousands of kilometres of ground on horseback.\n\u201cThe secret is that you don\u2019t have to be an accomplished equestrian, so anyone who loves the outdoors\u201d should try a ranch vacation, Kilgore said. \u201cVacation ranches are really proud of their activities and their novice horsemanship programs, so they welcome all visitors, from beginners to experts.\u201d\nHorsey getaways vary widely, even though they\u2019re almost all called dude ranches. Here are Kilgore\u2019s picks for two different experiences, a family-centric destination in western Canada and a top rustic-but-refined resort in the U.S.:\nBest for kids: Three Bars Guest and Cattle Ranch sprawls amid meadows where elk and deer roam, at the foot of the snow-capped Rocky Mountains of B.C.\nThree Bars is a classic for families, with kid-friendly fun like panning for gold and evening campfires. Horseback riding is No. 1, but sporty options include an indoor pool, hiking, mountain biking, rafting, fly-fishing and ATV rides.\n\u201cWhatever activity you or your children choose individually, there always is togetherness because everyone meets for meals,\u201d says Tyler Beckley, who runs the ranch with his family.\nAt Three Bars, a total of about 50 guests bunk down in deluxe log cabins of various sizes. The newest Black Series is a set of modern suites with glass walls overlooking the scenic wilderness of the Kootenay Rockies.\nIn the region, you can boost your cowpoke quotient with visits to the Calgary Stampede in July or the Cranbrook Pro Rodeo in August.\nUltra luxury: If you\u2019re a tenderfoot, the Lodge and Spa at Brush Creek Ranch in Wyoming is a supremely comfortable option. Here you\u2019ll indulge in luxurious spa life, elite sports, gourmet Rocky Mountain cuisine and Champagne. Oh yes, and horseback riding, too.\nBrush Creek has been endorsed by Forbes and has been voted the top resort of any style in the continental U.S. by readers of Travel + Leisure. Rating a ranch higher than an oceanfront vacation spot or a posh golf getaway is saying a lot for Brush Creek\u2019s sky-high standards and service.\nTucked into a valley of the majestic Sierra Madre Mountains, Brush Creek is a scenic spread ringed by towering pines.\nIt can accommodate up to 120 guests in various rustic-elegant lodgings decorated with a refined Western look.\nThe dining room serves such delicacies as elk, bison osso bucco, or akaushi beef (a Japanese breed raised on the ranch), with side dishes like black truffle pur\u00e9e and blue cheese ro\u00ebsti. For casual nights, Brush Creek holds barbecues at an old-time chuck wagon, with live bluegrass music. Cocktails, beer and wine are included in your visit.\nBrush Creek\u2019s extensive spa offers facials, massages in teepees and outdoor yoga in splendid surroundings. Sports include riding, fly-fishing, shooting sports and hiking on 100 kilometres of trails.\nIF YOU GO\nGene Kilgore\u2019s roundup of dude ranch vacations: genekilgore.com or top50ranches.com.

{"text": "Nearly three years after first announcing their then-surprising split, Brad Pitt and Angelina are officially single once more. Per documents obtained by The Blast, the former couple was granted a bifurcated judgment on Friday allowing them to revert back to single status before their divorce is finalized.\nAccording to The Blast, Pitt and Jolie wanted a bifurcation because they were ready to \u201cget on with their lives\u201d and needed to move on emotionally \u2014 the move was not, sources told The Blast, motivated by any purported new relationships on either side. Now that the bifurcation has been granted, Pitt and Jolie will still have to negotiate the remaining details of their divorce. Those details include things like hammering out specifics of shared assets, as well as coming to a custody agreement for their kids: 17-year-old Maddox, 15-year-old Pax, 14-year-old Zahara, 12-year-old Shiloh and 10-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\nJolie filed for divorce from Pitt back in September 2016. At the time, the pair had been married for two years and together for over a decade. They met while making 2005\u2019s Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which they played husband-and-wife assassins for hire. Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time but, following their divorce, Pitt and Jolie began publicly dating after the movie premiered.\nSince their highly publicized split in 2016, numerous reports have claimed communication between the two has been contentious, particularly regarding custody. However, it would seem they\u2019ve turned a corner on that front. \u201cBoth parents are focused on what\u2019s best for the kids,\u201d a source told People on Saturday.\nAnother source reportedly told Hollywood Life that Pitt feels like the bifurcation is a step in the right direction for the entire family. \u201cBrad feels great to officially be single and getting these documents filed was really important to him. He really wants to close the chapter with Angelina as much as he can and move forward, and he feels it\u2019s one step closer to doing so,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cBrad will always wish Angie well since he had so many great years with her and they share children together, but the chapter is closing and that feels good for him. The primary part of the divorce is over.\u201d\nIn addition to caring for their large brood, Pitt and Jolie undoubtedly have plenty to keep them busy as they officially say goodbye to their marriage. In July, Pitt stars in one of the summer\u2019s most highly anticipated movies, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. As for Jolie, October will see her return in the Disney sequel Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\n", "label": "human"}

Nani plays the protagonist of Jersey \u2013 an ardent player of cricket, who decides to return to the sports after ten years and gain back his dignity and respect. Standing by his side like a pillar is his son while his wife essayed by Shraddha Srinath is only trying to make her family survive amidst the race of life. The recent trailer of Jersey may have hit us hard with its intense emotions and Nani\u2019s character\u2019s determination but behind all that \u2013 there is another story \u2013 that of his wife Sarah!\nIn a male-dominated story, Shraddha Srinath explains the importance of her character Sarah and how her director Gowtam Tinnanuri has weaved the varied characters who have been integral in the life of Arjun aka Nani. Speaking about it, Shraddha says, \u201cYes, the movie is about a man who resigns to cricket and wants to get back to it. But there is so much beauty in playing the supporting character also. The greatest thing about the writer and director of the film, Gowtam is that he is written the film in such a way that he has given all of us equal importance.\nShe went on to add, \u201cThe film is indeed about this guy but what about the love of his life [played by Shraddha]. What about her? What about am I going through? What kind of struggles are we facing? So there is a story from my side too. I may not be playing \u2018the protagonist\u2019 or Nani\u2019s character but I am playing his girlfriend/wife or whatever. But I think I can get the audiences hooked on to my character too just as much and that\u2019s the challenge! It is sometimes enjoyable to have a smaller part too sometimes.\u201d\nJersey also stars Kattappa fame Satyaraj in a key role and it is slated to release on April 18.

{"text": "Native American tribes have emerged as key players in the legislative debates over whether states should legalize sports betting, with some opposing the idea because it could threaten their casinos and others supporting legalization but only if they retain a monopoly.\nIn many states, tribes are fighting sports betting or taking a go-slow approach because they worry it might force them to reopen decades-old agreements that give them exclusive rights to operate casinos and offer certain forms of gambling.\n\"The tribes have a major-league seat at the table,\" said Bill Pascrell III, a lobbyist for gambling interests that are seeking legalized sports betting across the country.\nSix states have joined Nevada in allowing sports gambling since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year opened the door to its expansion. Legalization is being considered in more than 20 others.\nIn Minnesota, a bill seeking to legalize sports betting cleared its first hurdle earlier this year, passing a committee in the state Senate. But that's likely to be as far as it goes, in large part because the state's politically potent tribes oppose it.\nGambling \"is the only successful economic development tool the tribes have ever had,\" John McCarthy, executive director of the Minnesota Indian Gaming Association, told the committee.\nThe tribes, which operate 21 casinos and have given millions in campaign donations, are especially concerned about allowing sports betting on mobile devices, which they fear could invite wider internet gambling that could threaten their casinos.\nIn Texas, the only sports betting bill is almost certain to die. It was introduced by a Democrat, the minority party, in a state where casino operators from neighboring Oklahoma and Louisiana have donated millions to keep gambling out. Two Oklahoma tribes, the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations, have given more than $5 million to Texas officeholders and candidates since 2006.\nSports betting measures introduced in Arizona and Washington state are also considered longshots, mostly because of tribal ambivalence or opposition.\nIn some states where tribal gambling is prevalent, sports betting bills have not been introduced at all. That's the case in Oklahoma, as well as California and Florida, which are home to politically influential tribes that have been cool to the idea.\nBut elsewhere, casino-operating tribes are the ones leading the legalization efforts.\nThe Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribes have exclusive rights to casino gambling in Connecticut and are working with the governor's office to add sportsbooks. Two tribal casinos in New Mexico began running sportsbooks after the Supreme Court decision, even though the tribes never received explicit permission from the state.\nIn North Carolina, a bill pushed by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians would allow the tribe to offer betting on sports and horse races at its casino near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, without forcing it to make any substantial concessions.\nConservative religious groups have warned about the dangers of more gambling, but the legislation has so far sailed through committees in the state Senate. The tribe is one of the state's top political contributors.\nThe bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Jim Davis, lauded the tribe for bringing jobs to an otherwise distressed portion of western North Carolina.\n\"They've been incredibly good stewards of the revenue, and it's transforming that community,\" he said.\nLike other powerful interest groups, tribes ensure they have access to lawmakers and governors through political contributions. Tribal governments have contributed more than $114 million to state-level candidates and political committees over the past decade, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by the National Institute on Money in Politics.\nIn some states, including California, allowing sports betting would probably require a constitutional amendment. That and tribal reluctance means the NBA's Sacramento Kings will have to wait longer, perhaps indefinitely, to allow gambling in a suite the team dedicated for that purpose inside the Golden 1 Center arena.\nArizona is the rare example of a state where tribes are the key players in the legalization debate but are on opposite sides.\nThe Navajo Nation is pushing for a measure that would give tribes the exclusive right to operate sports betting off their reservations in exchange for sharing winnings with the state. Tribes could put betting kiosks in non-tribal bars and private clubs.\nBut other Arizona tribes oppose the legislation, saying it could hurt existing casinos on reservations.\nLawmakers in many states are not eager to push the issue without support from tribes, said Hilary Tompkins, a former solicitor with the Department of the Interior, which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\"It's not worth the pain of engaging in a fight with the tribes in their states,\" Ms. Tompkins said. If states \"open the door to non-tribal sports betting, the tribes are going to say, 'We're going to reduce our revenue to you.' And that could end up in court.\"\nMinnesota state Sen. Roger Chamberlain, chairman of the tax committee that passed this year's sports betting bill, acknowledged that it will be virtually impossible for the measure to succeed without backing from the tribes.\n\"They've got momentum and are telling folks they don't want it to go anywhere,\" he said. \"I think that's a little unfair, but we're willing to talk with them and protect their interests.\"\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

{"text": "Sanding a deck\nQ: Does sanding clog the pores of outdoor wood? I\u2019ve been staining decks professionally for a year, and it\u2019s my understanding that when you sand a deck the particles from the abrasive plug the pores and prevents stain from properly penetrating the wood.\nIs this true?\nA: The main issue when finishing outdoor wood is maximizing the absorption of stain into the lumber, and I\u2019ve never seen any facts that show abrasive particles clog wood pores.\nAnd if you think about it, there aren\u2019t that many sand particles on a disk given the size of deck area involved anyway.\nSure, a few particles might come off the sanding disk, but not enough to affect hundreds of square feet of deck.\nThe best information I\u2019ve found on stain absorption in wood comes from an Akzo-Nobel study. They discovered that 60-grit and 80-grit abrasives maximize wood absorbency, with no issues due to residual abrasive particles.\nIn fact, the people behind this study insist on sanding as the best way to extend the life of film forming outdoor wood finishes.\nThis is the same as my own experience. I always stain sanded wood right away (after blowing off all the dust, of course), and I find it works really well.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nInsulating a basement\nQ: Is spray foam the best way to insulate our basement? We don\u2019t plan to finish the basement, we just want to make our house warmer. Our basement does leak in the spring with heavy rains and snow melt.\nA: As much as I like the performance of spray foam in many applications, I wouldn\u2019t apply it directly to basement walls without being used in some kind of framework of wall studs.\nMetal studs would be best because it doesn\u2019t feed mould like wood can. Without this framework, if someone ever wanted to finish the basement down the road, they\u2019d be dealing with a wall surface that can\u2019t accept any kind of wall board.\nA bigger issue is the wetness of your basement. I wouldn\u2019t do any kind of finishing (not even basic wall insulation) if leaks still happen.\nYou mentioned that your goal is to have a warmer house. What\u2019s the state of insulation in your attic and above-ground walls?\nThese areas are important and easier to upgrade than a wet basement. Also, have you considered having spray foam applied to the underside of the floor? This would require less foam than spraying the walls, and it wouldn\u2019t matter if the basement was wet.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nRepointing basement stonework\nQ: What should I do about cracks between the stonework in the basement wall of my 1904 house? This winter cold air was coming through and I\u2019d like to insulate.\nA: You need to repoint your stonework.\nStart by removing any remaining loose mortar, then repack the joints with fresh mortar. The rule of thumb for this kind of thing is that the mortar should be a little softer than the stones involved.\nIf your stonework made of hard rock, I use a mortar mixture of one part Portland cement, one part masonry cement and six parts sand.\nIf your stonework is sedimentary rock it will be softer. A mixture of one part masonry cement with three parts sand will do a good job.\nTo get the mortar into the gaps, you\u2019ll need a few hand tools called \u201cslickers\u201d. These are like long, slim trowels that can fit within the gaps you\u2019ve got.\nOnly after the stonework is repointed should you consider insulating, and only then if your basement has a long track record of being dry.\nThe nice thing about repointing is that it\u2019s pleasant, simple work. Devote a few hours each evening to the job with some music playing and you\u2019ll be done in no time.\nSteve Maxwell has always liked simple, manual labour.

{"text": "Investors who want a high yield and a stable price should look to the preferred shares.\nARR has been one of our most frequent bearish calls.\nThe thing that pains me about mortgage REITs is seeing how many investors and analysts just give up. They might start with all the best intentions for doing due diligence, but the complications of mortgage REITs can easily leave investors pulling their hair out and screaming that it is impossible to know what is happening.\nUnfortunately, that conclusion is entirely wrong. It is possible to know what is happening and to forecast it as it happens.\nWhen you combine knowing precisely what is happening in the interest rate environment, you can forecast changes to book value and earnings and compare it to changes in the share price. The advantage this technique produces should be similar to counting cards in a game of blackjack. There is one major difference though; watching these developments in mREITs is perfectly legal. This is the very definition of strong analysis for a mortgage REIT.\nInstead of finding out all the tricks to reading through the mortgage REITs, many investors and analysts end up doing a poor job and accepting poor results because they weren't willing to dig deep enough.\nArmour Residential REIT\nARMOUR Residential REIT (ARR) has been one of our most frequent bearish calls. We regularly projected shares to decline over the last few years. We believed the mortgage REIT would eventually revert back to trading at a material discount to book value. That\u2019s precisely what we\u2019ve witnessed. With shares trading around a price-to-estimated-current-tangible-book-value of .93, we see a reasonable valuation for setting ARR to a neutral rating.\nARR has a few things going in their favor. The first is that the net balance sheet duration was increased before the end of February:\nThe higher net balance sheet duration was a clear positive going into March as rates dropped materially. However, the term \u201cNet Balance Sheet Duration\u201d is specifically referencing the balance sheet. That is important because ARR often holds a material portion of their portfolio in TBA (To Be Announced) securities. A position in TBAs is similar to simply holding additional fixed-rate agency RMBS (Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities), but it isn\u2019t carried \u201con the balance sheet\u201d.\nWe wanted to verify that the TBA position had not changed dramatically:\nThe position shrank slightly, but not enough to be material. Therefore, we believe ARR\u2019s position heading into March was quite reasonable. This could be a positive surprise for the market. With ARR trading around a 7% discount to our estimate of current book value, we think our bearish outlooks have lasted long enough. We are switching to a neutral outlook.\nRating History and Performance\nWe've occasionally been criticized for \"always being a bear\" on ARR. We don't mind that distinction, because it means we were consistently correct. Despite that accuracy, ARR's monthly dividend has endeared it to some investors. They refuse to see the capital loss because of the yield.\nWe're comparing results for ARR against AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC), MFA Financial (MFA), Annaly Capital Management (NLY), Two Harbors (TWO), and Chimera Investment Corp. (CIM). You can easily spot ARR in each upcoming chart because they have an orange line every time. If you're having trouble finding the orange line, just look closer to the bottom.\nFor instance, we published this piece on 6/27/2017:\nHere are the results since our bearish piece on 1/11/2018:\nThe piece brought out insightful critiques, such as:\nWe remained bearish in another article on 2/2/2018:\nWe hammered it again on Valentine's day:\nWe hammered ARR again in August 2018:\nDespite a solid fundamental basis for the article, it was countered by the great insights of shareholders:\nThe outlook was the same in November 2018 as we sent out one more warning:\nYet each investor is entitled to their own view. Some prefer to utilize other sources for their ratings:\nWhen Should Investors Buy Shares?\nWe need to start that discussion with a reminder that the common shares of mortgage REITs are built for trading. Investors who want a high yield and a stable price should look to the preferred shares. However, we have found opportunities to buy ARR as well. Those opportunities just haven't occurred in the last few years.\nThe most important factor in picking an entry opportunity is finding a significant discount to book value and a discount to the valuation of peers. We found such an opportunity back in 2016:\nFor years we've been following the same simple principles in predicting the change in valuation. The technique has been consistently correct over the long term. There were months within those periods where we appeared to be wrong, but eventually, the market would come around.\nUnderstanding Our Outlook\nWe're using price-to-book value ratios, but we aren't waiting for the book value to be announced. Instead, we rely on modeling the book value throughout the quarter. That gives us better insight into the changes as they happen, rather than waiting for the latest data from management.\nThis is precisely the technique we suggest using for any residential mortgage REITs. It is also the technique we follow. Trying to create a prediction several years in advance for a mortgage REIT requires betting on what will happen with interest rates and how management of a REIT may change the portfolio over time. Shorter time frames allow the investor to focus on what has happened so far and to act on it before the next major data release.\nIn prior periods, ARR's price-to-book value was high in isolation (too close to 1.00, or even higher) and it was too high relative to peers. That problem has finally corrected itself, so we are happy to pull off the bearish rating and replace it with a neutral rating.\nNot all investors are created equal. At The REIT Forum, we recognize that. That\u2019s why we offer REIT ideas and strategies for every type of investor. Want a simple, low-risk strategy that still delivers sector-beating performance?

They can both be installed alongside the old Edge as well as each other. You can download these builds now from the Microsoft Edge Insider site.\nHere is how Microsoft differentiates the two channels:\nEvery night, we produce a build of Microsoft Edge \u2014 if it passes automated testing, we\u2019ll release it to the Canary channel.

We expect most users will be on the Dev channel.\nIn December, Microsoft embraced Chromium for Edge development on the desktop, announced it is decoupling Edge updates from Windows 10 updates, and said that Edge is coming to all supported versions of Windows and to macOS. The company also promised that the first preview builds of the Chromium-powered Edge would arrive \u201cin early 2019,\u201d and while it is starting to deliver on that today, the first builds are only for Windows 10 64-bit in English. Microsoft confirmed today that Beta builds are coming \u201cin the future\u201d and that support for 32-bit, other languages, and other operating systems \u201cwill also come over time.\u201d\nChromium-powered Edge features\nMicrosoft gave us access last week to an early build of Chromium Edge. The browser feels snappy and stable for a preview. That said, don\u2019t expect it to outperform Chrome or even the old Edge.\n\u201cIn these first builds we are very much focused on the fundamentals and have not yet included a wide range of feature and language support that will come later,\u201d Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president in Microsoft\u2019s operating systems group, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to people starting to kick the tires and will be refining the feature set over time based on the feedback we receive.\u201d\nHere are a few changes you will notice in the preview builds:\nThe design finish is a mix of the old Edge and Google Chrome (a conscious decision).\nYou can sign-in and manage your Microsoft Account profile or your Azure Active Directory.\nBing works in the address bar (and you can switch to Google Search if you like).\nThere\u2019s a New Tab page with three customization options: Focused, Inspirational, and Informational.\nExtensions can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store (by default) and there is an option to \u201cAllow extensions from other stores\u201d to get Chrome extensions from the Chrome Web Store. (Microsoft is asking Chrome extension developers to test and submit their extensions to the Microsoft Store.)\nThat last point is worth explaining further. Chromium Edge users can install extensions from the Microsoft Store (enabled by default) that extension developers have submitted and the company has confirmed work well with Edge. At the same time, Microsoft has added the capability for Chromium Edge users to opt into downloading and installing extensions from the Chrome Web store (disabled by default). Think of this option as similar to how Android users have to enable an option to \u201cinstall unknown apps\u201d if they want to use third-party app stores.\nUpdate at 1:20 p.m. Pacific: And above you can see everything Google-related that Microsoft has removed, courtesy of Walking Cat.\nFeatures still in the works\nAgain, the new Edge is still in an early preview phase. It is not at all feature-complete, and plenty of work still needs to be done.\nHere are a few things in the pipeline:\nThe visual look of the browser is still evolving, including more touches of Microsoft\u2019s Fluent Design.\nEdge-specific features like Set Tabs Aside, inking on the web, and full PDF support have not yet been ported over.\nChromium Edge does not sync with Edge for Android and iOS. It partially syncs with Chromium Edge on other Windows 10 PCs (for example, favorites do, but open tabs don\u2019t yet).\nCasting to Chromecast devices is an option but doesn\u2019t work yet.\nSupport for Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) is coming.\nMore performance and reliability improvements are on the way.\nProductivity, privacy, and other features that might differentiate Edge from Chrome are in the works.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t releasing a feature-complete browser because it\u2019s soliciting feedback from the Chromium open source community, extension developers, and web developers in general. That feedback will result in not only a better first stable release of Chromium Edge, but improve other browsers built using Chromium as well.\nIndeed, Microsoft has started making contributions to the Chromium open source project (over 275 commits since December) in areas like accessibility, smooth scrolling support, Windows Hello integration, touch, and ARM64. (Microsoft likes to point out that Edge is the only major browser with a 100 percent HTML5Accessbility score and is known for having solid touch scrolling performance.)\nSwitching to the Chromium-powered Edge\nMicrosoft still hasn\u2019t quite decided how it will switch old Edge users to the new Chromium Edge, but here\u2019s the plan as it stands today. Over the coming months, the Edge Insider program will scale up to include more language versions, other Windows versions, macOS, and more users in general. Once Microsoft deems the quality, reliability, stability, compatibility, and features high enough, it will replace the old Edge with Chromium Edge. This will take the form of a normal update \u2014 on Windows it will not be tied to an operating system update as Edge updates have been in the past. After that, Edge will be updated every six weeks or so, similarly to how often Chrome and Firefox are updated.\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable using preview builds, stick with the current version of Edge. Chromium Edge is not at the beta stage yet, so non-technical users and businesses should wait.\nWhile these preview builds are certainly not ready to be used as your default browser, developers should switch to them for all their Edge testing purposes. Sure, Microsoft plans to continue supporting the Edge rendering engine EdgeHTML and the Chakra JavaScript engine, but Edge\u2019s future lies with the Blink rendering engine and V8. You might as well ditch the old Edge now.\nWeb developers should also note that Microsoft has updated the user agent string. Chromium Edge has the Chromium user agent string with the addition of the \u201cEdg\u201d token. This is to avoid compatibility issues with the string \u201cEdge\u201d used by the current version of Edge based on EdgeHTML, and is consistent with existing tokens used on Android and iOS.\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.48 Safari/537.36 Edg/74.1.96.24\nMicrosoft launched Edge in July 2015 as the default browser for, and exclusive to, Windows 10. But it never saw much adoption. Sure, Microsoft claimed Edge had 330 million active devices back in September 2017, but it never did reveal an active user figure beyond \u201chundreds of millions\u201d (Google said Chrome passed 1 billion active users in May 2015). Edge has 4.40 percent market share today, according to the latest figures from Net Applications. Whether switching to Chromium and adding more operating system support will make a material difference remains to be seen.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Is your business \u201csocially mature\u201d? What does social maturity mean, and how can you improve the social maturity of your brand or business? What is the biggest thing disrupting the marketing industry right now? And what will be the biggest future challenge for marketers?\nThese are all big questions, but luckily, we have the answers.\nB&T chatted with Penny Wilson, global chief marketing officer at Hootsuite, to learn more about the toughest dilemmas the marketing industry is facing, as well as to gain an insight into the current and future state of social media and digital marketing.\nCan you talk to the idea of \u201csocial maturity\u201d and what it means?\nA socially mature organisation is defined as an organisation that has integrated social company wide \u2013 from customer care to sales, people (human resources), to product development and beyond. A socially mature organisation will incorporate the voice of the customer into their culture and innovation.\nGiven the scale of Hootsuite\u2019s customer base, we\u2019ve built industry benchmarks which help us study social shifts and trends for businesses \u2014 adding value by bringing these insights back to our customers.\nThis includes social maturity assessments that we\u2019ve completed for over 600 enterprise organisations. We review their technology, business strategies, social sophistication, and other factors, ranking them relative to their industry peers\u2019 performance. These criteria determine a business\u2019 social maturity.\nOnly 40 per cent of all global organisations analysed are at the \u201cstrategic\u201d stage of social maturity. In this stage, social isn\u2019t siloed to one aspect of an organisation like marketing, but social is being used in a coordinated way across multiple departments. Globally, over half of companies using social media could benefit from optimising their approach to social and a digital-first strategy.\nOff the back of that, what steps can Australian businesses take to fulfill the transformation to becoming more socially mature?\nTo improve social maturity, organisations can use social media beyond marketing to encourage other departments such as sales, customer care, recruiting and the C-Suite \u2013 to engage with their customers and employees This helps to unlock the full potential of social to drive brand awareness, strengthen customer relationships, build competitive advantage and contribute to the bottom line.\nImpressively, according to Hootsuite\u2019s 2018 Social Barometer report, APAC businesses are leading the charge with around two thirds (62 per cent) of businesses extending the social function beyond marketing. Globally, however, this number falls to just 54 per cent.\nWhat are some of the best practices for the Australian C-Suite who want to rise to their full social potential?\nEnabling social media\u2019s implementation across the organisation \u2014 rather than as a standalone or part of the marketing stack, is paramount. Starting with leadership is imperative; if the CEO and the executive team are invested in and engaging with their customers and employees on social, your business is setting itself up to realise its optimal social potential.\nIn Australia, there are a number of senior executives that are leading the charge by really demonstrating the value of social media.\nShayne Elliott (CEO at ANZ Banking Group) is a great Australian example of how a social executive program works. Shayne utilises his LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook presence to share his thoughts on topics that he and his customers are passionate about. From developments surrounding AI, through to the recent droughts in Australia and ANZ\u2019s support in the recovery, his social presence has given his business a personal touch, which in turn leads to increased trust in his business.\nWhile Australian CEOs are ahead of their global counterparts, data from Hootsuite shows that 34 per cent of chief executives do not have any public social media presence.\nIn an era where trust on social is at an all-time low \u2013 with Edelman\u2019s 2018 Trust Barometer Report finding that 60 percent of people no longer trust social media companies \u2013 I strongly believe more CEOs should use social media as their primary channel to rebuild trust by creating focused communities and sharing insightful, relevant content.\nThe Digital 2019 report found that Australians are googling themselves more than anything else, why do you think that is?\nI think the reality is that Australians are using Australia as an affix to their search terms. Australia weather, Australia cricket, deadly spiders in Australia.\nWhat other interesting stats came out of The Digital 2019 report and how is Australia doing compared to the rest of the world on social?\nOur Digital in 2019 report revealed a lot of interesting data in regards to Australian social media habits, providing useful insights for businesses to use when interacting with customers.\nAustralian social media use (57 per cent social media penetration) is very comparable with the regions of Western Europe and Southeast Asia, however Australia is behind the likes of North America and Eastern Asia who both dominate globally with a social media penetration of 70 per cent.\nHaving said that, Australians are still using social media with vigour \u2013 with users on the rise and 18 million people \u2013 or 72 percent of the population \u2013 actively engaging on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter (up from 66 percent in 2017). They love Facebook more than any other social media platform with 16 million monthly average users (this stat remaining steady since 2017).\nAustralians are a mobile nation \u2014 with more people using smartphones than laptops or desktop computers (87 percent versus 84 percent). They are willing to part with their money to spend on their apps \u2014 particularly when it comes to love. Australians spent more money on Tinder than any other app in 2018.\nAussies are using their mobiles for more than just scrolling or streaming. Australian everyday life is being lived through smartphones \u2014 interestingly, CommBank was downloaded more than Netflix and Uber, which is a great nod to how the financial services industry is investing in consumer digital use. Overall it signals a shift to make more of our daily lives digitised. Australia is getting more digital by the day, and consumers want to be able to do more with their smartphones and apps.\nOne trend to watch is social commerce \u2013 where we\u2019re seeing the best of e-commerce and social media combined to create a convenient shopping experience through direct response advertising buttons such as \u201cshop now\u201d to encourage action. We\u2019ve seen this take off in Asia in recent years, and expect Australians to be soon to follow!\nWhat is the biggest thing disrupting the marketing and social media industry right now?\nNow more than ever, maintaining trust in our institutions is becoming a major consideration for Australian marketers. In the wake of various data security scandals like Cambridge Analytica, there has been an unprecedented pressure from customers and regulators to improve security, transparency, and accuracy. In fact, according to Edelman\u2019s 2019 Trust Barometer Report, 73 per cent of people worry about false information or fake news being used as a weapon on social media.\nEmployee advocacy is one way to combat this dynamic. Empowering your employees to leverage social media to amplify your brand\u2019s purpose, value and community connection can help to re-establish this lost trust. We can particularly see the value of employee advocacy in the financial services industry. Edelman\u2019s 2019 Trust Barometer report also revealed 53 per cent of people trust the voice of a regular employee above that of a CEO (47 per cent), journalist (36 per cent) or government official (35 per cent) \u2013 making your employees one of your biggest assets when it comes to social media.\nWhat will be the biggest future challenge for marketers?\nMarketing technology is going through a rapid evolution, and while this brings an immense amount of opportunity to empower the customer journey across entire organisations, it also brings challenges.\nTwo such challenges are effectively harnessing the power of the immense amounts of data we now have access to, and staying authentic as our audiences are increasingly migrating to private communities.\nData is the way forward in helping businesses align on the value of social in connecting with customers authentically, or they will miss out on developing trusted relationships. It comes back to my note around ensuring your organisation has an integrated, inter-departmental approach to social, and making sure your data use policy is easy to understand and accessible.\nOne way we can do this is by mapping the customer journey and aligning it across departments, then to ensure you have the right technology in place to connect departments throughout this journey for a consistent customer experience and to maximise the value of data collected.\nOnce you\u2019ve successfully mapped out the customer journey, you need to think about how you measure success. Marketing leaders need to better align social media KPIs to overall business and customer KPIs to ensure they\u2019re measuring the right metrics for social.\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of businesses that are still using vanity metrics, like likes and shares. A business isn\u2019t going to really feel the impact of these. Instead businesses need to be set up to measure social media\u2019s contribution to lead acquisition, sales and retention. Only then can you really see the true value of social media.\nThe next challenge for marketers is about maintaining authenticity and cut-through as audiences retreat to private communities. Bombarded by ads and irrelevant content, users have migrated into smaller spheres of influence, so it\u2019s tricky for brands to assess how to add value in these hyper-personal contexts.\nWe know that consumers crave human connection online, so it\u2019s up to us to hyper-personalise content so our audiences don\u2019t block out information, cut off contact with brands, and avoid digital experiences that do not add value to their life. Some tactics to achieve this hyper-personalised effect are to employ conversational advertising in new formats such as Messenger, using stories to their full potential to mirror the individual\u2019s world and increasing 1-1 human interaction.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The season eight premiere of the final season of Game of Thrones is packed with plenty of awesome imagery \u2014 including some great peeks at Daenerys Targaryen's dragons (with Jon Snow on the back of one!). Her fire-breathing babies will surely play a big part in fighting the White Walkers and her quest for the throne, but let's not forget that she's down a dragon. In season seven, the Night King sadly kills Viserion and turns him into a wight to assist his undead army. Can Daenerys successfully defeat them with only two dragons? And more importantly for all the dragon-loving fans, can she ever get more of them?\nThough the dragons seem like such a staple on Game of Thrones, they don't actually show up until the very last episode of season one, so a refresher might come in handy. For much of that season, they're simply eggs. Dany receives the three eggs as a wedding gift from Illyria Mopatis, the guy who arranges her marriage to Khal Drogo. The eggs are mostly for decoration and revered for their worth, as they've aged and turned to stone overtime. But Dany feels connected to them somehow, and tries to get them to hatch.\nNothing happens until she burns Mirri Maz Duur for cursing her and failing to save Drogo. Dany has the witch tied to Drogo's funeral pyre, places her dragon eggs on it, and walks into the fire when it's ignited. The next day, she's miraculously unharmed, and the eggs have hatched into three baby dragons.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDany names the dragons Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion and raises them like her own children throughout the series. But as far as we and the characters on the show know, these are the only living dragons around, and the first ones to appear in centuries. If there are more out there, there's no definitive place they would be, since their origins are a little vague. In season one, Dany's handmaiden Doreah says that she heard dragons came from a second moon that hatched when it got too close to the sun. Dany's eggs, however, are said to have come from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. Could there be more eggs there? If so, Dany would have to travel all the way back to Essos, even further away from Westeros than she's gone previously.\nHowever, the season eight premiere also includes a new title sequence. that hints at the possibility of Dany finding at least one more dragon. After the episode aired, Reddit user ninajo94 noted how when a sword blazes across the screen, you can catch a glimpse of four dragons \u2014 count 'em, four \u2014 decorating the metal, as well as a comet soaring across the sky.\nNow, if you've read up on the Azor Ahai prophecy, this should ring some bells. In A Song of Ice and Fire, the series of books that inspired the TV version of Game of Thrones, there is a popular myth surrounding a hero figure named Azor Ahai who allegedly rose up to save the world from the White Walkers centuries earlier by forging a legendary sword \u2014 Lightbringer \u2014 that helped him push the Others far, far into the North, where they were all but forgotten about.\nIn A Dance With Dragons, the prophecy about Azor Ahai is stated as follows: \"When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.\" Seeing as the White Walkers are back and more terrifying than ever, it stands to reason that Azor Ahai's reincarnation is, too. Could the sword emblazoned with a falling star and dragons be a hint Dany is the Prince That Was Promised? OR could it simply be teasing the arrival of a fourth dragon?\nWhile the television series has deviated from the book series multiple times, there's always a chance that the final season pulls from the books for inspiration. In A Feast for Crows, Maester Aemon reveals that dragons are \"neither male nor female . . . but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame.\" Dany's remaining dragons could feasibly reproduce, though it seems quite late in the game for that. If she wants fully grown dragons, her best bet might be the Azor Ahai prophecy.\nPopular guesses think this refers to raising dragons from Dragonstone, which is a volcanic island. Since Dany has been hinted as a possible candidate to fulfill the prophecy, it would certainly be an exciting twist if she found even more dragons!\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Government must find creative ways to tackle the unemployment problem\nLast week, Steve Hanke 2018 Misery Index listed Nigeria as the sixth miserable country in the world. Embattled Venezuela came first, followed by Zimbabwe, Argentina, Iran and Brazil. According to Hanke, an economist at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, United States, \u201cMy modified Misery Index is the sum of the unemployment, inflation and bank lending rates, minus the percentage change in real GDP per capita. Higher readings on the first three elements are \u201cbad\u201d and make people more miserable.\u201d Nigeria came to the list chiefly because of the high level of unemployment.\nEven if we question the criteria employed in the listing, as some countries that are obviously in more precarious conditions were left out, Hanke\u2019s report fits into what is increasingly becoming a ranking routine: Africa\u2019s largest economy is often associated with the worst or close to the worst indices in many areas of life. Nigeria has the most number of citizens living in extreme poverty, among the worst in open defecation, in basic health infrastructure \u2013barely ahead of war-torn Central African Republic, and leads the world in maternal mortality. In 2018, Bill Gates, American business magnate and foremost philanthropist, dubbed Nigeria \u201cthe most dangerous place in the world to give birth.\u201d\nAs the index rightly explained, the country\u2019s misery ranking is laid at the foot of the economy and the unemployment crisis. Figures available paint a dire situation of millions of adults and youths roaming the streets looking for work but finding none. Indeed, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBC) has reported a consistent pattern of worsening situation of unemployment in the country, rising from 9.7 per cent in 2012 to 18.8 per cent in 2017 to the present 23 per cent. That 23 per cent of the nation\u2019s labour force is idle is bad enough. But worse and extremely dangerous is the fact that more than 50 per cent of that army of idle citizens is peopled by those between the ages of 15 and 35. Many of them, university graduates, are not only miserable but condemned to the street corner.\nThe clear and present danger of such a high level of idleness among young persons is already manifesting in the high level of strife and crimes in virtually every corner of the country. Whereas the multitude of violent outbursts might have religious and ethnic colorations and undertones, it is also a notorious fact that most of the people in the fields and trenches of war are youths who if otherwise meaningfully engaged would have been unavailable for those worthless anti-social endeavours. Worse still is that there is no evidence to suggest that the authorities in Abuja and the 36 states appreciate the gravity of the situation as there are no clear-cut plans to deal with the problem.\nWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari who was recently re-elected for a second term to begin to find a creative way of tackling this challenge before it becomes unmanageable. The economic recovery plan of the federal government must prioritise youth employment and formulate policies to reduce it to the barest minimum. The economic empowerment programmes specifically targeted at young persons should also be reviewed and appropriate measures taken to improve and make them more efficient to achieve their objectives.\nBeyond the foregoing is the urgent need to realign the nation\u2019s educational curriculum with the needs of the economy. It has been said with some measure of justification that many of the school leavers are actually unemployable having regards to their training and skills. It has become necessary therefore that our educational training curriculum at all levels must incorporate skills acquisition and entrepreneurial development so that graduates leave school with the capacity to create wealth and jobs rather than seeking jobs\n", "label": "human"}

Instead, I reached for a 1950s book called \u201cNotre Dame of Paris: The Biography of a Cathedral.\u201d Its author brought home a truth that seems timely, as politicians draw on their countries\u2019 past to fuel populism and nationalism.\nThe fire that struck Notre Dame in Paris has resurfaced an important lesson: that any nation\u2019s history \u2013 any great building \u2019s history \u2013 is far too complex to fit on a bumper sticker.\nWhen fire struck Paris\u2019s Notre Dame cathedral last week, my first instinct, shared no doubt with millions across the globe, was to Google it. Yet then I reached for a yellowed edition of a 1950s book called \u201cNotre Dame of Paris: The Biography of a Cathedral.\u201d\nThe catalyst was less intellectual than personal: its author was Allan Temko, my late uncle. But his 300-page tour of how the cathedral, and Paris and France around it, came to be, brought home a truth that seems timely nowadays, as politicians worldwide draw on their countries\u2019 past to fuel a mix of populism and nationalism. It is that any nation\u2019s history \u2013 any great building\u2019s history \u2013 is far too complex, too nuanced and too rich to fit on a bumper sticker.\nThe same might be said of my uncle. He was best known as the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic of the San Francisco Chronicle. But \u201cNotre Dame of Paris\u201d was a product of his years as a would-be novelist. I always think of him as the on-again, off-again friend of fellow Columbia student Jack Kerouac, to whom he loaned his typewriter when Kerouac was working on \u201cOn The Road,\u201d and in whose books he appears under a bizarre carousel of pseudonyms: Roland Major and, much less imaginatively, Irving Minko and Allen Minko.\nThe \u201chistory\u201d invoked in movements like Brexit in Britain, \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d in Poland or Hungary, Vladimir Putin\u2019s rise in Russia, or Donald Trump\u2019s clarion call to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d has little place for nuance. In drawing a picture of past glories and triumphs, it tends to airbrush out setbacks or misjudgments, not to mention the suffering, injustices, or other human frailties invariably part of history as it\u2019s actually lived. Even the history of a cathedral.\nCenturies in the making\nIn exploring Notre Dame\u2019s place in the hearts of the French, and the millions of others who visit it each year, my uncle\u2019s book draws a great arc stretching from the earliest settlement of the \u00cele de La Cit\u00e9 in the middle of the River Seine, long before there was a Paris, to the years after the Second World War. He traces the vision and design, the role of the limestone-quarriers and tree-fellers, stonemasons, and other artisans, that made possible the greatest Gothic cathedral on earth. And he revels in its beauty, describing how it strikes the eye from the Left Bank of the Seine, the Right Bank, or the river itself.\nBut that\u2019s just part of the story. There is Maurice de Sully, the son of peasants from the Loire who became Bishop of Paris and conceived the idea of the cathedral. The interlocking role of the Roman Catholic Church and the monarchy during the stretch of nearly a century in which the cathedral was built and France emerged as a nation. The tumults of war and crusade and inquisition. The aftermath of the French Revolution, when the crowds toppled and decapitated 28 stone statues of the ancient kings of Judah \u2013 wrongly believing them to be figures of French kings. And the fact that Notre Dame, in its current form, is the product of multiple fixes and changes over the centuries, and of long periods of deterioration and willful neglect.\nIn fact, its oaken roof has twice before caught fire, though the flames were spotted and put out. The emblematic image of last week\u2019s blaze was of the enormous spire, or fl\u00e8che, toppling as the roof gave way. But it, too, was a replacement, after the revolution. And my uncle\u2019s eye for architectural detail leaves little doubt that once the fire roared out of control, its fate was sealed: It weighed one million pounds.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Hundreds of violent criminals were brought to heel.\n\u201cWe helped bust at least 40 bad guys in Canada, too,\u201d Walsh said, adding his country remains \u201csadly, incredibly violent.\u201d\n\u201cLast year, 2018, was the worst year ever with 307 mass murders, 144 cops were murdered.\u201d\nAnd, as The Sun has reported, homicide clearance rates are dropping.\nNot just in Toronto but Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and scores of lesser American cities.\n\u201cThe clearance rate has fallen from around 70% to just 28%,\u201d he said. \u201cThese monsters are getting away with it. We need people\u2019s help.\u201d\nWalsh went out of his way to praise Canadian gun laws in general and the Toronto Police sex crimes unit in particular.\n\u201cThat unit,\u201d Walsh said, \u201cis one of the best in the business.\u201d\nHis new show In Pursuit with John Walsh debuted in January on Investigation Discovery.\nNow doing most of the travelling and burning of shoe leather is his son.\nBut the old formula still works.\nLuis Frias had been on John Walsh\u2019s get list since 2013 when the Oklahoma man allegedly stabbed his police officer ex-wife, Janett Reyna, to death in front of their terrified children.\nA viewer tipped off the show and that was passed onto the U.S. Marshals who busted Frias in Mexico. The Marshals used Reyna\u2019s cuffs to bring him in.\n\u201cIt was a horrific crime and all because his ego was bruised,\u201d Walsh said.\nAnd it brought some closure to the gutsy cop\u2019s devastated family.\nWalsh knows the feeling.\nOn Dec. 16, 2008, detectives from the Hollywood Police Department finally named serial killer Ottis Toole as the murderer of Adam Walsh. It took 27 years.\nA hillbilly headcase, Toole was a murder buddy of Henry Lee Lucas. He pegged out in prison from cirrhosis of the liver in 1996.\n\u201cIt took 27 years to solve Adam\u2019s case,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI know that pain. It was a big thing for our family. It was a terrible cloud that hung over our family, the children and their mother and myself.\u201d\nNow traveling less, Walsh still follows the simple maxim: \u201cEvil prevails when good people do nothing.\u201d\nbhunter@postmedia.com\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A bulk of the output in the 2018-19 financial year came from fields that were given to ONGC on nomination basis.\nNew Delhi: Reversing years of decline, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has reported a record 6.5 per cent jump in natural gas production to 25.9 billion cubic meters in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, as it doubles up efforts to raise domestic output to curb imports.\nNatural gas production from ONGC-operated nomination fields, NELP blocks and joint venture assets reached 25.819 BCM in 2018-19 as compared to 24.61 BCM output in the previous fiscal, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said here.\nThe company is on course to produce 42 BCM by end of fiscal 2022, when its prized KG basin discoveries will come onstream.\n\"Some of our gas fields are very old like the Bassien field in western offshore. These continue to make a substantial contribution to the overall domestic production of gas because of continuous monitoring of the fields, applications of state-of-the-art technology and best possible reservoir management,\" Shanker said.\nA bulk of the output in the 2018-19 financial year came from fields that were given to ONGC on nomination basis. Gas output from these rose to 24.683 BCM against 23.43 BCM in the previous 2017-18 fiscal.\nThere has been a marginal increase in the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) fields also from 0.054 BCM to 0.073 BCM.\nThe growth rate was higher than the global average of 3-4 per cent year-on-year.\nNatural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world. It is the cleanest burning petroleum-based fuel and has wide applications -- from being used to generate electricity to the running of automobiles (CNG) and firing kitchen stoves.\nAiming to reduce dependence on imports for meeting energy needs and cutting greenhouse emissions, India is looking at increasing consumption of natural gas by more than doubling its share in energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030.\nShanker said, gas sales also recorded an impressive increase during the year with sales (provisional) standing at 20.472 BCM against the sales of 19.494 BCM in 2017-18.\nDuring 2018-19, the company has, for the first time in its six-decade-old history, witnessed the highest ever gas production of 71 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in November 2018.\nONGC, he said, is taking all measures to sustain the production level and then grow further as per the company's operational blueprint.\nThe company has stepped up efforts to bring newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.\nThe growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, he said adding ONGC has charted out a plan to double the gas production at 42.7 BCM by 2021-22.\nIt is investing Rs 57,000 crore - one of the highest investments in the world in gas projects - in the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Bay of Bengal as well as in developing other discoveries on off the west coast.\nFirst gas from the KG-DWN-98/2 project is targeted for end-2019 and peak output is envisaged at 16.56 mmscmd by 2022.\nGiving details of projects that contributed to the increase, he said the incremental production came from Daman Offshore in the West as well as S1 \u0096Vashishta in the eastern offshore. Some of the onshore fields too saw the trend of falling output reversed.\nThe Daman project has been completed at an investment of Rs 6,086 crore for a production profile of 26.93 BCM over a period of time. The project contributed 4.5 mmscmd last fiscal.\nSimilarly, ONGC has drawn an investment plan of Rs 5,725 crore for Vashishta and S1 for total gas production of 14.61 BCM. Current production from the project stands at 3 mmscmd.\nOne of the major breakthrough On-shore projects is Tripura Gas Project for which an investment plan of Rs 5,000 crore is being drawn up to recover 49.37 BCM gas up to the profile period.

With 10 queens left in the game, this week\u2019s installment featured the franchise\u2019s first-ever Drag-lympics \u2014 and not everyone involved was a good sport about it.\nBut before the ladies could go for the gold, they had to warm up via this week\u2019s mini challenge, a \u201cgal-isthenics\u201d class led by Ru\u2019s pal Love Connie. The dual win went to A\u2019Keria C. Davenport and Plastique Tiara, the latter of whom really impressed me with her floor work. Most of this season\u2019s contestants have been underestimating Plastique as a mere look queen, so I\u2019m always excited when she steps it up and proves them wrong. (Those back-to-back death drops!) That said, I think we should also give a little credit to Yvie Oddly, who did\u2026 well\u2026 this:\nWith their limbs properly loosened, A\u2019Keria and Plastique were named the leaders of competing countries \u2014 Tuckpantistan and The People\u2019s Republic of Glamazonia, naturally \u2014 and got to select team members for this week\u2019s maxi challenge: the Drag-lympics. Proving she knows exactly how to play this game, A\u2019Keria loaded up her team with heavy hitters like Brooke Lynn Hytes, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, Yvie and Shuga Cain.

(\u201cIt\u2019s a hard place to start from,\u201d she admitted.) As for A\u2019Keria\u2019s team, everyone managed to turn it out, though poor Yvie struggled to put her body through some of the more complicated choreography. Hearing about her journey with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was absolutely heartbreaking, especially as she looked towards a future where this type of drag might not be an option anymore.\nThen came this week\u2019s runway, \u201cAll That Glitters,\u201d which included an impressive variety of gold-based looks: A\u2019Keria could have passed as Ru\u2019s body double, Brooke Lynn gave us pure Norma Desmond, Yvie kept it comedic as an old lady with a golden cane and Plastique revealed her personal \u201cmega evolution.\u201d Her team\u2019s victory, combined with her stunning runway look, earned A\u2019Keria this week\u2019s well-deserved win.\nAnd while Vanjie\u2019s basic Playboy Bunny-inspired ensemble nearly landed her in the bottom two, Ru let her off with a warning this time. Instead, Scarlet \u2014 who had to stand there and listen as her fellow teammates voted her off the damn runway \u2014 battled against Ra\u2019Jah to the tune of Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cLast Dance.\u201d Admitting that she\u2019s no dancer, Scarlet opted to pull out every last trick in her bag, from an unexpected reveal of pants to a well-timed golden glitter bomb.

{"text": "Bonds have proved to be a good hedge during virtually every stock decline. But outliers may occur, notably when rising inflation has triggered a stock decline.\nThere are growing fears that the global economy is slowing down.\nThe first 3 months of 2019 have been busy for bonds.\nJeff explains that bonds appear to be back to playing their traditional role as diversifiers against stock downturns. But a look back in history reveals that inflation may be key to how well this relationship holds up in the future.\nThe first 3 months of 2019 have been busy for bonds. Global interest rates have declined significantly, the Federal Reserve has implied that it will halt short-term rate hikes and the yield curve inverted. Overall, there are growing fears that the global economy is slowing down.\nThese market movements highlight a critical theme for investors in 2019: Bonds are once again playing their traditional role of offsetting equity risk in investor portfolios.\nWhat we can learn from the summer of 1969\nIn contrast to this year's trend, the negative returns of both stocks and bonds throughout most of 2018 presented a critical challenge to investors. Bonds, instead of offsetting equity losses, actually started to contribute to the losses. While bonds were modestly up to end 2018, there was a real possibility that both stocks and bonds would end down for the year. This is exceptionally rare. To put that into perspective, that has only occurred three times since 1929.\nThe first time was in 1931, during Britain's currency crisis that eventually resulted in its abandoning the gold standard. The second time was in 1941, when the U.S. entered World War II. Both of these years coincided with exceptionally rare events that resulted in exceptionally rare investment outcomes.\nThe most recent occurrence of negative stock and bond returns, in 1969, has some lessons that may be useful for today.\n1969 demonstrates the risk of an economy \"overheating\" and the threat of a recession that typically follows. The 1960s began with low inflation. But by mid-1966, inflation hit 2%, and subsequently rose to just under 5% by the end of the decade. The Fed's response was to raise short-term interest rates. That pushed the economy into recession and drove down stock returns - but along the way, it also pushed bond yields higher and bond returns lower.\nWhat's the key takeaway for investors?\nBonds have proved to be a good hedge during virtually every stock decline. But outliers may occur, notably when rising inflation has triggered a stock decline. In that case, bonds may be a less successful hedge.\nWhat happened in 2018: Inflation fears undermined bonds\nAt the beginning of last October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's description of policy rates as \"far from neutral\" suggested multiple future increases in rates in order to curtail the possibility of future inflation. But the expectation of rising rates - and the resulting falling bond prices - undermined the ability and willingness of investors to hold bonds to offset risks in their stock portfolios. As a result, during Q4 2018, stock and bond return correlation increased as returns to both declined.\nIn 2019: A lack of inflation underwrote the \"Powell Pivot\"\nIn January, the Fed's pivot towards dovishness and pausing on future rate increases changed that outlook. A lack of inflation was cited as the rationale. As expectations for future Fed increases fell, investors were freed up to reallocate to bonds as a portfolio hedge, allowing them to revert back to their traditional role as portfolio diversifiers.\nLooking forward, the lack of broad-based inflation represents a key dynamic for bonds. We expect broad-based inflation to remain in check in 2019. But the outlook for wage inflation remains less clear, as signs of acceleration have appeared in some economic measures.\nOverall, we view the Fed as on hold and willing to tolerate the rise in wage inflation as long as broad-based inflation remains benign. However, as the lessons of 2018 - and 1969 - point out, inflation expectations are an important data point to watch, even for traditional portfolios that are diversified across stocks and bonds.\nThis post originally appeared on the BlackRock Blog.\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Outside Looking In\nTC Boyle\nBloomsbury, \u00a318.99\nReview by Todd McEwen\nWHATEVER you think about Timothy Leary, the guy was trouble. A pain in the arse for psychologists, for Harvard University, for parents, for Richard Nixon, even, who called Leary \"the most dangerous man in America\".\nKicked out of academe, he led a series of communes based on self-discovery dependent on the use of LSD. The honesty and possible usefulness of all this went rapidly downhill.\nThis novel by the prolific TC Boyle is a puzzle. It deals with many themes he\u2019s used before: small groups of people under pressure to conform, renegade behaviour in the search for truth and spiritual fulfilment. In his excellent novel of Los Angeles, The Tortilla Curtain, he explored the frightened lives of illegal Mexican immigrants. San Miguel touchingly portrayed an unlucky family\u2019s desperate attempt to make a living on an isolated California island. The Terranauts was a lengthy story of men and women sealed in a biosphere bubble for a year. Boyle\u2019s early novel, The Road to Wellville, was a comic tour-de-force about a community of health food crackpots.\nThe problem with Outside Looking In is this: how do you write interestingly about people who are irredeemably dull? Boyle mocks the intelligence of the Harvard postgrads who follow Leary around like ducklings, particularly his insecure graduate student protagonist, Fitz.\nFitz is not much fun to read about. He\u2019s a jerk, a psychology academic. He\u2019s timid. He knows nothing about himself and he\u2019s got female breasts on the brain. It\u2019s a little hard to believe that he teaches at Harvard. Or maybe it isn\u2019t.\nFitz\u2019s wife, Joanie, is the novel\u2019s real subject in terms of revelation. Not as well educated as Fitz, she works as a local librarian. But once the psychedelics start flowing, she becomes possessive of the experience and is up for anything \"Tim\" wants to do. When the group is disgraced in Massachusetts and moves to a hotel in Mexico, Joanie starts sleeping with the other men. This is another Tim idea: use the drugs to break down sexual jealousy. Worked for him, apparently.\nWe suddenly see the reality of the endeavour from a woman\u2019s perspective. And while Joanie is gung-ho for acid and all the other stuff that\u2019s hanging around these fearsomely conventional would-be revolutionaries (beer, wine, cigarettes, pot, martinis, station wagons and pizza), there\u2019s still a lot of cooking and housework. Guess who does it.\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell what Boyle really thinks about the little communities he writes about. At times it seems he\u2019s chiding them for believing that anything could ever be different in America than it is. But just as often he takes their side, a champion of the inherent value of weirdness and the contrarian.\nBut maybe these people are just incompetents. Where is the certainty that what LSD does is genuine? Does it just poison you in such a way that you think something has been \"revealed\"? (The brain is always trying to order things, no matter what you do to it.) These sad sacks never elided grandly into the world, or transformed it. They became parasites, mooching off millionaires, fighting with cops and taking menial jobs.\nThe richest and best-imagined part of Outside Looking In is about Albert Hoffman, who first synthesized LSD in 1943, and experimented with it on himself and his colleagues. Told from the point of view of his lab assistant, it\u2019s a virtuoso performance by Boyle \u2013 joyous, mad-scientist slapstick, frightening, profound and even erotic. One could wish that Boyle\u2019s narrative excitement here could be sustained through the rest of the novel. But then the academics arrive and humour and joy, of course, are banished, no matter what pills are popped.\nIn the \"commune\" novels of Boyle there\u2019s often a capitalist intervention \u2013 a sudden realization that somebody\u2019s got to make some dough around here. The upstate New York group decides to offer revelation and the \"sacrament\" (LSD) to businessmen and bored housewives, for money. Joanie, doing the dishes as usual, is looking out of the kitchen window. A man appears asking a question that startles her but reveals to us the depth of this whole \"spiritual\" enterprise: where do I park?\n", "label": "human"}

He was drafted to Collingwood in 2009 then sought a trade to Brisbane in 2014 to be closer to his father, who was battling cancer at the time and died last year.\nThe 29-year-old came full circle when he rejoined the Pies during last year's trade period.\nCollingwood have mostly played on Thursday or Friday nights this season, allowing Beams to keep a watchful eye on the Lions' games.\nAnd while there's every chance he'll be booed by the Lions faithful, Beams has been thrilled to see his old side tasting success.\n\"I actually sit there like a supporter,\" Beams told reporters on Tuesday.\n\"I genuinely love watching them do well because I've been there the last four years when times have been tough.\n\"Last year was a step in the right direction and you could see that things were going to change in turn - it was just a matter of how quickly.\n\"It's been really nice for me to see the guys that came into the footy club when I was there start to really progress in their careers and take that club forward. Their supporters are loyal and they deserve to see some success.\"\nBeams' addition to a Collingwood engine room already boasting Scott Pendlebury, Steele Sidebottom, Adam Treloar and Taylor Adams had some commentators labelling it potentially the best midfield ever assembled.\nThe evidence to date suggests the quartet are a long way off hitting such heights, although Beams noted the midfield unit was still learning to gel.\nWhile thoroughly familiar with 2010 premiership teammates Pendlebury and Sidebottom, Beams had never partnered Adams or Treloar prior to rejoining the Pies and only played alongside ruckman Brodie Grundy sporadically.\n\"It's just about finding that chemistry,\" Beams said.\n\"You can have all the depth in the world but if you can't make it work, there's no point.\"\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "whats-on,\nAUSTRALIAN playwright Andrew Bovell's Speaking in Tongues has had global audiences sitting on the edge of their seats as they observe people who initially seem to have no connections but are gradually revealed to have interacted or been seen doing puzzling things. Bovell also has four actors, two male and two female, playing nine characters, and this format likewise serves to underline that people can have inadvertent relationships and chance connections. And with four performers each playing two or three different characters the play is testing for directors and actors. Speaking in Tongues is being staged by Maitland Repertory Theatre as a special event between May 1 and 19. The show was put forward by its director, Brendon Harris, who found it to be very engaging when he read it. Harris, who is 24, showed his directorial skill with unusual play formats with his first major production, Kiss Me Like You Mean It, at Maitland Repertory last year, a work he read while doing an Advanced Diploma in Acting course at Hunter TAFE. That play shows the very different relationships of two couples whom circumstances bring together: two people in their early 20s who meet at a drunken birthday party and an elderly couple in a house next door who have been married for 50 years. Speaking in Tongues begins with two pairs of unrelated people looking at sharing motel beds while having a drinking night out and becoming separated from their marriage partners. One pair, Jane and Leon, go ahead with the proposal, but the others, Pete and Sonja, don't. When Jane gets home she tells Pete she saw a bloodied male neighbour, Nick, throwing a woman's shoe into the rubbish. In the second part, watchers find out where the shoe came from, with new characters interacting: Nick, the bloodied man; Valerie, a psychologist whose car breaks down on a lonely road at night; John, Valerie's guilt-ridden husband; Sarah, one of Valerie's troubled clients; and Neil, a man who is still attracted to Sarah long after she left him. In a short third part, more is revealed about the people and their relationships, with Leon, who is a police officer, trying to resolve the disappearance of one of the others. The players in this production are Maddy Claire Lardner (Jane/Valerie), Faiz Khan (Pete/Neil/John), Brittany Writer (Sonja/Sarah), and Daniel Stranger (Leon/Nick). Daniel Stranger, who had professional training in England as an actor before migrating to Australia a decade ago, has helped Brendon Harris and other young actors in Newcastle and Hunter towns develop their skills. He is also acting in plays, with his roles including Romeo in a contemporary Newcastle staging of Romeo and Juliet. He is impressed by the way the Speaking in Tongues script shows the different reactions to things that occur. \"And you find out as the story develops what really happened to the people, rather than what others express in their discussions,\" he said. Maddy Claire Lardner is enjoying playing very different women. She points to Jane being a housewife who is stuck at home all day, \"like a big cat in a zoo\" and watching her neighbours through a large window. Valerie, she notes, is very efficient. \"She knows that her relationship with her husband has deteriorated, and she wants to help other women avoid what has happened to her.\" Speaking in Tongues opens at Maitland Repertory Theatre with an 8pm show on Wednesday, May1, then has Friday and Saturday 8pm performances from May 3 to May 18, plus 2pm Sunday matinees on May 12 and 19. Tickets: $25, concession $20. Bookings: Maitland Visitor Information Centre, 4931 2800 (10am - 3pm); maitlandticketing.com.au. THIS bright musical, adapted by Kevin Del Aguila from the script of the Dreamworks animated film and with a lively collection of songs by George Noriega and Joel Someillan, moves briskly along for an hour, with each of its two large young casts delighting watchers of all ages. The adult staging team have made it a colourful 1970s rock-style show, as the main animals in the New York Zoo, led by the athletic Alex the Lion, escape from their cages to pursue Marty the Zebra, who has just celebrated his 10th birthday with virtually all his life spent in the zoo, and is following a quartet of mischievous penguins longing to return to their Antarctic birthplace. Nothing goes right, of course, and the animals find themselves being shipped back to Africa. The pesky penguins again take control and the ship ends up on the coast of the island of Madagascar, where the animals encounter battling creatures called lemurs and fossas. The costumes certainly suggest the nature of the animals, with the penguins in warm black industrial-style garb that would be appropriate in an icy setting. And, as Alex the Lion recalls in Madagascar the uncooked steak that the zoo keepers fed him every day, a chorale quintet appears in red clothes to bring colourfully alive in the song Steak what he is thinking, with the dance movements putting big smiles on watchers' faces. Alex's garb, likewise has a rocking nature. The set designs also bring out the character of the various settings, with an elegant New York skyline behind the zoo and ceiling-to-floor greenish-vegetation fabric strands behind the animals in the Madagascar settings.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/SZjBdCvXzdW4Ygt94axh3r/028bfbac-9122-4d72-ab95-258e54524b61.JPG/r0_331_6000_3721_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\u00d7 Nurse cared for baby left alone in ICU \u2014 then adopted her\nBRIGHTON, Mass. \u2014 Liz Smith had always dreamed of becoming a mother and building her own family, but her road to motherhood was rough. She suffered from infertility and went through several treatments that didn\u2019t work.\nThe pediatric nurse\u2019s dream began to come true in 2016 when she crossed paths with Gisele, a 3-month-old girl who had been transferred to the Massachusetts hospital where Smith worked. Gisele was born premature to a mother who had used drugs and the baby had resulting health problems. She weighed less than 2 pounds.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t all: The infant had no visitors for several months at the hospital, Franciscan Children\u2019s.\nBut hospital staffers paid special attention to little Gisele, and one nurse asked Smith whether she had met her.\n\u201cI said, \u2018No, why?\u2019 She said, \u2018She needs a medical foster home and you two are the perfect pair,'\u201d Smith recalled Thursday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\nSmith had never considered foster care or adoption until a week after the conversation with her co-worker, when Smith saw Gisele in a stroller.\nAt that moment, Smith, now 45, said she knew she wanted to be her mother. But a lengthy legal process was ahead, given that the baby was a custodian of the state when she arrived at Franciscan Children\u2019s.\nThe state had been discussing putting the child in foster care and Smith stepped forward, saying she would care for Gisele. The baby went to live with the nurse in April 2017.\n\u201cIt was an emotional roller coaster,\u201d Smith told CNN later Thursday. \u201cWhen I initially started fostering her, the goal was reunification with her birth parents. I always had that as a reality in the back of my mind while I was taking care of her, but in the moment (I) knew she needed and deserved every ounce of love I had to give her.\u201d\nSmith said the birth parents had supervised visits but they became less frequent over time.\n\u201cI could tell they believed they would one day be her parents and believe they wanted to be,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were always supportive and noticed how healthy she looked when they did see her.\u201d\nThe state terminated parental rights last June after they determined the parents could not adequately care for Gisele, Smith said. \u201cIt was a very bittersweet. I was experiencing this tremendous gain and happiness in my life where others were experiencing the opposite.\u201d\nCo-workers, friends and family joined Smith in October for the adoption day.\nGisele, 2, has grown to be a giggly, spunky little girl. Her health has been stable and she continues to improve, Smith said.\n\u201cShe is thriving. She has a feeding tube where she still gets the majority of her nutrition through, but other than that, the specialist thinks she is just remarkable,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey can\u2019t believe the strides she has made and how healthy and strong she is. Her resilience is inspiring to me and every day I\u2019m amazed by her.\u201d\nSmith and Gisele\u2019s lives have changed dramatically for the better. And the toddler continues to teach Smith the beautiful meaning of life and motherhood.\n\u201cWe talk about the power of love, but to witness how it can transform a life and to witness how it transformed her life and mine is unbelievable,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI have never been happier or stronger and just I couldn\u2019t imagine life without her.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The government's historical abuse inquiry has been accused of shutting down questions on potential conflicts of interest and condemned as unsafe for survivors, with one senior official being described as \"entirely unfit for purpose\".\nPhoto: RNZ / Johnny Blades\nDr Christopher Longhurst, an abuse survivor, made his comments after being invited to a meeting in Wellington to give expert input into the work of Royal Commission of Inquiry into Historical Abuse in State Care and in the Care of Faith-based Institutions.\nThe 11 March meeting was attended by the inquiry's chairman, Sir Anand Satyanand, and its four commissioners, as well as another abuse survivor and survivor advocates.\nHowever, Dr Longhurst said he was abruptly \"shut down\" when he asked questions about a potential conflict of interest of commissioners who had religious affiliations.\nDr Longhurst said when Sir Anand and commissioner Andrew Erueti disclosed they were Catholic, Sir Anand was further asked if he had personal relationships with senior Catholic clergy and if he had talked to church officials about the commission's work.\nHe said commissioner Judge Coral Shaw then intervened and accused Dr Longhurst of \"personalising\" the discussion.\n\"This is not the time to make this into an interrogation, if you don't mind,\" she told him.\nDr Erueti then said he felt \"uncomfortable\" with the questions.\nDr Longhurst, a survivor of clerical sex abuse suffered in Hastings as a schoolboy, told RNZ he had attempted to ask legitimate questions and raise concerns about how the commission intended to deal with what seemed like a clear conflict of interest.\n\"If one of the commissioners has a personal friend, and is a member of the Catholic institution, that to me would be a conflict of interest, based on relationships,\" he said.\n\"Therefore, if I was disclosing to a person - who was a friend of a person who was protecting the institution that abused me - it would be a conflict of interest, and I've never met another person who wouldn't share that view.\"\nHe said the commissioners gave him no answers and instead displayed a total lack of ability to provide a safe environment for abuse survivors to converse with the commission by shutting him down.\nDr Longhurst told RNZ the meeting had made him feel like he was on trial.\n\"Survivors have been shut down all our lives and to relive that experience with the commission is retraumatising. Coral Shaw is a judge. But she was not there to judge, she was there to listen... she is entirely unfit for purpose,\" he said.\n\"Granted, I am one person, but how they have treated me, could be the way they have - and I suspect they have - other people, people fearful to talk about their abuse, never mind do so in front of a Royal Commission.\n\"They have alienated me and it's because they are not trained in dealing with trauma and historical sexual abuse.\"\nDr Longhurst had agreed to take part in a promotional video for the commission, organised through the Department of Internal Affairs. He reversed his decision after the meeting as he believed the commission's work was unduly PR-focused, instead of survivor-focused.\nDr Longhurst wrote to Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin on 19 March requesting Judge Shaw and Dr Erueti be investigated over the matter and recommended they be disqualified from the commission.\nHe later decided he wanted nothing to do with the commission altogether. He advised survivors to stay away from the body.\n\"I would caution them very, very strongly to stay away,\" he said.\n\"If a survivor comes forward to tell their story they are going to get hurt and they are going to get angry. Some of the people I've met are in positions that are more vulnerable than I am.\"\nHe said Judge Shaw had claimed a Conflict of Interest Policy was on the commission's website, which proved not to be the case. After he insisted multiple times that he be sent a copy, Dr Longhurst said he received one, which he suspected was drafted after his meeting.\nCommission spokesperson Mary-Jane Rendle told RNZ the policy was given to the commissioners when the commission was first established, had been revised, and then further \"reaffirmed\" and revised after the meeting with Dr Longhurst before being published on the website. She did not explain what changes were made.\nApology for 'distress one meeting caused'\nDr Longhurst has since received two letters of apology from Sir Anand on behalf of the commission.\nThe first letter apologised for the way Mr Longhurst \"felt\" he had been shut down, with an assurance that wasn't the intention of commissioners.\nThe second letter, received after survivors advocate Liz Tonks insisted the first was not substantive, stated: \"We regret the way conversations in the meetings were handled and that commissioners did not allow you to complete your questions.\n\"You have our commitment that we will strive to improve the way we work with survivors and their advocates going forward.\"\nRNZ asked for comment from the three commissioners, but the commission said in a statement that for privacy reasons it did not comment on individual cases.\nIts statement continued: \"All staff at the Royal Commission, including Commissioners, receive ongoing supervision and advice on communicating with survivors of abuse. In addition, all have had trauma-informed training, and this is ongoing.\n\"In February and March 2019, Commissioners held 32 separate meetings - in both Auckland and Wellington - involving more than 50 individuals and organisations who had a strong interest in the work of the Royal Commission.\n\"The aim of the meetings was to listen to survivors and others and hear their expectations of Commissioners and the Inquiry itself. The meetings also sought comments and input into the proposed work plan the Commissioners were developing.\n\"The Commission acknowledges that engaging and sharing experiences will often be traumatic and stressful. The Commission has apologised for the distress one meeting caused.\"\nThe commission did not answer questions over whether it believed its two Catholic members and its one Presbyterian member (commissioner Ali'imuamua Sandra Alofivae) presented a conflict of interest in its work.\nAnother abuse survivor, Whang\u0101rei Heads resident Annie Hill, told RNZ she was not surprised by Dr Longhurst's grievance.\n\"It fits with the way that the Catholic community have been shutting down anyone who has an abuse story, while appearing to be polite.\"\n\"I think there is a lack of experience on the state side understanding how Catholicism works and how for centuries it has managed to gain the upper hand when it is criticised...\n\"So, if you have Catholic people asking the questions, that makes it very complicated for a Catholic survivor to feel they will be fully heard.\n\"Within the culture of Catholicism everything is done with a smile, a nod and on a need-to-know basis. And that is the reason people like me had been silenced for over 27 years.\"\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "newsletters, editors-pick-list,\nONE of Australia's most senior health bureaucrats is under fire for repeatedly using his phone during an emotional presentation by pelvic and hernia mesh victims at a forum where the Morrison Government was slammed for its response to a series of medical device scandals. Department of Health deputy secretary Professor John Skerritt used the touchscreen on his phone during a 30-minute film presentation that included a woman saying she was in constant pain and \"totally incontinent, living in urine-soaked pads\", and another saying \"We've lost our mental health, our physical health and many of us contemplate suicide every day\". Professor Skerritt's phone use angered women who wept during the presentation, only minutes after Greens Senator Rachel Siewert cried during a Skyped speech while talking about the impact of devastating submissions by pelvic mesh victims to a Senate inquiry she chaired in 2018. Nicolle Germano, whose pelvic mesh surgery in 2013 has left her with severe, permanent injuries requiring self-catheterisation every four hours, said she was gobsmacked to see Professor Skerritt beside her \"with his head down and his phone in his lap\" repeatedly through the film, or reading notes for a speech he delivered after the presentation. \"I was blown away. It was unbelievable he did not give the most important part of the day his full attention. I'm pretty hardened but hearing the stories of all those people so badly affected by mesh really hurt me, and he didn't even look up for a lot of it,\" Ms Germano said. \"I was in tears and he was doing things with his phone. I thought 'You didn't even hear that'. That's what it's been like for years - mesh victims trying to get people in the health system to listen.\" In his speech Professor Skerritt said it was \"very important for us to hear directly from individuals who have had adverse effects with medicines and devices and to hear their personal stories\" to make sure products on the market \"are as safe as possible\". In response to questions about the phone use a Department of Health spokesperson said Professor Skerritt had \"special dispensation\" to appear at the forum rather than Budget Estimates, but he was \"required to provide support to those attending on his behalf\". \"After international developments overnight on Thursday, urgent planning was required for a meeting of the TGA's breast implant expert reference group - being held (on Monday) - to discuss macro-textured breast implants,\" the spokesperson said. \"A number of other media enquiries and briefing requests also required Professor Skerritt's urgent attention. Professor Skerritt cleared his schedule as much as possible to attend the forum, where he recognised the serious impacts on the women who were affected and the need for the health system to work together to address the issue of mesh injuries. \"Professor Skerritt has reassured those who attended the forum and other affected women that the TGA is totally committed to ensuring that the regulation of medical devices protects the health and wellbeing of all Australian women.\" The phone use on Friday was only hours after Professor Skerritt revealed a medical device national action plan, headed \"The safety of Australian patients comes first\", was developed in 2018 but not released until last Thursday, on the eve of a federal election where health is a key issue, because \"politicians decide when things go out\". The plan aims to improve how devices get on the market, strengthen monitoring and \"significantly improve\" transparency about device approvals, after sustained criticism of device regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, following a series of scandals, including pelvic mesh device approvals that have left some women with catastrophic injuries. The action plan's release also follows a Department of Health report in the European Medical Journal in January showing only an estimated 0.5 per cent of adverse events involving implanted medical devices are reported to the TGA under a risk alert system that has operated for more than two decades. The device action plan was announced on the first day of a forum in Melbourne organised by health consumer groups from across Australia aiming to make health system reforms a federal election issue. Professor Skerritt told mesh-injured women that \"much of the writing behind the action plan was done last year but we do not control when documents like that are released\". \"I would have loved to have released that action plan ages ago but it's not my job and politicians decide when things go out,\" he said. \"It sounds like a cop-out but really, it's the same right across government.\" Professor Skerritt said the TGA had discussed problems with the device adverse event reporting system \"with all political parties\", including making health care facilities and hospitals mandatory reporters of device adverse events. \"Governments have not had an appetite at any point in time, governments have not had an appetite to look at mandating the reporting by hospitals and health care facilities until the announcement this week and that's governments of both colour,\" Professor Skerritt said. On Friday pelvic mesh and hernia mesh-injured people booed and jeered after a pre-taped film in which the Federal Government announced $2.3 million to fund a pelvic mesh registry for women implanted with devices in future. A government spokesman told the forum he was \"sorry for what has happened in the past\" but was \"delighted\" to announce a $2.3 million registry \"that we should always have had\". \"So this is your moment, it's overdue recognition, but it's real action and it will protect women, it will protect their health and it will also protect their mental health. And it's an acknowledgement of that which has occurred in the past, on our watch, thanks to your work,\" the spokesman said. \"I want to thank you, I want to acknowledge the suffering of those who have suffered historic wrongs, but above all else it will give you a real note of hope that going forward this registry will help you and help us make a profound difference.\" Forum participants booed, called the announcement \"delusional\", and strongly criticised the \"This is your moment\" comment. \"Our moment to be what, shat on again?\" said Mesh Injured Australia Incorporated founder Justine Watson, who attempted suicide because of the severity of mesh device complications. The government has not acted on a pelvic mesh Senate inquiry recommendation for a retrospective audit of an estimated 150,000 devices implanted in women since the late 1980s, after damning evidence that authorities have no firm data on how many women were implanted or have complications. Injured women and health consumer groups say the audit is a \"top priority\" because stronger regulatory action can be delayed while accurate complication rates for different mesh devices remain unclear. Senator Siewert told the forum she was \"disappointed\" at the lack of action on a retrospective audit. Two Newcastle women, who did not want to be named because of legal cases against a device manufacturer, said they were shocked and angered by Professor Skerritt's phone use during the film presentation, and despairing after the government spokesman's comments. \"The registry is for what happens in future, but what about financial assistance for everything we've already endured and have to endure in the future?\" said one of the women. \"It's too late for so many of us. They're convinced there's just a few mesh-injured people because doctors have told them that, but they don't know and they don't want to know because then something would have to be done about it.\" The TGA has not initiated criminal or civil penalty proceedings against any pelvic mesh manufacturers, despite manufacturers being the only mandatory reporters of device adverse events, and confirmation only a fraction of adverse events have been reported to the regulator over the past two decades. The TGA has only initiated criminal proceedings against four medical device manufacturers in the past decade. Professor Skerritt told a forum event it was \"very easy\" to explain the lack of criminal proceedings against device manufacturers because \"in order to prosecute a company in a criminal way you have to provide.. that there's been deliberate withholding of evidence by companies\". He said it was a failure of the legislation that more legal cases had not proceeded. Professor Skerritt told the forum the TGA had only recently obtained powers to increase monitoring of drug manufacturers, but the increased powers did not extend to device companies. Extending the powers to medical devices was \"a decision of whoever our political masters will be\", Professor Skerritt said.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/pBvqKxHgUnSrdaeEwDT49F/660442d9-b758-4cb3-8695-599f6e12b9e9.jpg/r618_734_2661_1888_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "human"}

Some observers say Macron may open up the possibility that citizens could propose referendums.\nThe French leader has repeatedly said he won't reintroduce a wealth tax on the country's richest people \u2014 one of the protesters' major demands.\nThe yellow vest movement, prompted by a fuel tax hike in November, has expanded into a broader revolt against Macron's policies, which protesters see as favoring the rich and big businesses. Their protests, which often turned violent, especially in Paris, provoked a major domestic crisis that sent Macron's popularity to record low levels.\nStill, the number of demonstrators has been falling in recent weeks.\nMost yellow vests leaders have urged supporters not to take part in Macron's national debate, saying they did not believe the government's offer to listen to the French. Ingrid Levavasseur of the yellow vests published an open letter Monday called \"M.

They talked about deleting emails and there is frequent reference for the desire for there not to be other people around when they were meeting up.\nMiss Clarke said: 'This is not about a moral judgement or whether it is right or wrong for how two adults want to conduct a sexual relationship, it is about the fact they were on duty.\n'Instead of serving their community they weren't, they were putting their sexual relationship first. We say the conduct of both individuals fell far below the standards expected of police officers.'\nThe disciplinary panel heard the pair had kissed each other during their meetings but denied their relationship was sexual.\nStephen Chippeck, for Sergeant Porter, said: 'They admitted kissing. This is not a kissing case. Kissing, it is my submission, is not a sexual act.'\nMr Chippeck said Sergeant Porter had been through a 'difficult and miserable' few years and the relationship with Chief Inspector Leet was a 'fantasy, an unreality.'\nHowever Miss Clarke rebutted: 'Kissing formed part of their relationship but there was more.'\nThe hearing was told Chief Inspector Leet also conducted a sexual relationship with Miss A between November 2014 - January 2016.\nMiss Clarke said Miss A felt she had been 'groomed' by the chief inspector.\nShe added: 'It should have been abundantly clear to Mr Leet there was a vulnerability that should not have been taken advantage of.'\nSergeant Porter could face the sack if the allegations against her are proven.\nThe hearing continues.\nThe case is the latest in a catalogue of sex scandals which have hit the force in the past few years.\nPC Daniel Moss was suspended from duty in December 2016 after he was caught advertising himself online as a male prostitute, offering to perform sex acts for cash.

{"text": "The Auburn Gresham neighborhood is among those targeted in a home-loan program designed to encourage some city employees to buy homes in certain areas and stabilize those neighborhoods. | Brian Rich/ Sun-Times\nTwo years ago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel set aside $3 million to provide \u201cforgivable,\u201d $30,000 loans to police officers and firefighters in hopes it would stabilize high-crime neighborhoods.\nThe program has been a bust, with just 13 loans and two pending \u2014 either because the income ceiling is too low or the boundaries are too narrow.\nOn Tuesday, the City Council\u2019s Budget Committee moved to salvage the program by changing the name, broadening the umbrella of eligible recipients and expanding the geographic area where homes may be purchased.\nInstead of confining the program to police officers, firefighters and paramedics in six police districts, the loans also will be made available to rank-and-file members of Laborers Locals 1001 and 1092.\nThose unions represent several thousand employees of the city Department of Streets and Sanitation, Aviation and Water Management. Those unions have been among Emanuel\u2019s biggest supporters \u2014 both financially, and in their willingness to agree to work rule and pension concessions.\nJoe Healy, business manager of Laborers Local 1092, said he\u2019s confident there will be plenty of takers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got over 450 members who live in those areas. Multiple members have been asking to be included in this program,\u201d Healy said. \u201cThey are anchors of those communities already. They are anxious to put down roots and become homeowners in the communities they already live in.\u201d\nThe name of the program will also change. It\u2019s no longer the \u201cPublic Safety Office Homebuyers Assistance Program.\u201d It\u2019ll now be called \u201cCommunity Connection Homebuyers Assistance.\u201d\nDetails of the new and expanded targeted area are still in flux, under the ordinance championed by Ald. Emma Mitts (37th), whose impoverished ward will be home to the new $95 million police and fire training academy in West Garfield Park.\nIt simply allows for \u201csuch additional police districts and census tracts as shall be designated by\u201d the city\u2019s housing commissioner.\n\u201cWe have some laborers coming on with the city who may want to take advantage of it. They\u2019re coming into the apprenticeships program. They\u2019ll now have an opportunity to be first-time homebuyers,\u201d Mitts said Tuesday.\nMitts said she is also \u201copen to having a conversation\u201d with mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot about changing the eligibility requirements and raising the income ceiling needed to qualify for the $30,000 loans.\nFor now, the income ceiling remains 150 percent of the median area income. When the program was launched, that was roughly $82,950 a year for single officers and $118,500 a year for a family of four. That essentially confined the assistance to younger officers, which might have been part of the problem.\nEligible employees must secure a mortgage from a private lender to buy a single-family home or two-flat that would become their primary residence. They also must agree to live in the homes for the entire 10-year period.\nIf not, they are required to repay $3,000 for every year of the 10 years that they don\u2019t live there.\nThe earlier program was confined to parts of six police districts that need both the economic shot in the arm and the added safety that comes with having police officers, firefighters and paramedics as residents.\nThose neighborhoods included parts of Auburn-Gresham; Austin; Brighton Park; Chatham; East and West Garfield Park; Englewood and West Englewood; Gage Park; Greater Grand Crossing; Humboldt Park; New City, and North and South Lawndale.\nWhen the program was launched, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) urged Emanuel to extend the incentive to \u201cother areas that are now considered to be Tier 2 police districts.\u201d\n\u201cThere is crime being experienced in those districts. I call those communities \u2018on the bubble.\u2019 You want to be able to keep families in those communities. The extent to which the city shows its interest in putting resources in those community is very important,\u201d Dowell said then.\nAld. Michael Scott (24th) has questioned how the city would \u201cpolice the police\u201d and make certain that officers are not \u201cgetting this $30,000, getting a home and renting it out.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an important program \u2014 especially in a community like mine where there is violence on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Scott said on that day.\n\u201cTo make sure that we have first responders there engaging with the community goes a long way to bridge the gap that we currently have between community and police, but also to stabilize communities like north Lawndale and East and West Garfield.\u201d\nFormer Mayor Richard M. Daley tried a similar incentive in the early 1990s, with only mixed results.\nPolice officers buying homes for the first time in nine low- or moderate income neighborhoods were given $5,000 subsidies and required to make a down payment of just 3 percent of the purchase price.\nEmanuel\u2019s plan was more generous in hopes that the incentive would be enough to lure a fresh crop of newly hired police officers to buy homes in areas plagued by gang violence.\nBut, that plan plan barely moved the needle either, setting the stage for the changes made Tuesday.\n", "label": "human"}

Sandra Monroy headed north for a good job.\nThey told California Gov. Gavin Newsom their stories Monday, the second day of his visit to El Salvador. He met them at the country's only processing center for migrants who are deported from Mexico or the United States.\nIt was his first opportunity to interact directly with people who have left the small Central American country because of poverty and violence. Later, he traveled to the small mountain town of Panchimalco to watch song and dance performances rooted in the mountain village's indigenous history. He then attended a stark conversation on human rights abuses against women and LGBT people.\nCalifornia has more Salvadorans than any other state, and Newsom is in the country to learn more about why thousands are fleeing for the U.S. About 3,000 unaccompanied Salvadoran children and 12,000 family members have entered the United States since October, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\nTrump Purges Homeland Security Dept.

{"text": "ENERGY minister Giorgos Lakkotrypis gave a new date for the opening up of the electricity market at a meeting of the House energy committee on Tuesday. Lakkotrypis said the best-case scenario was that the system for buying power from independent producers would come online no earlier than October 2021 and be fully operational by the end of that year.\nIt is extremely difficult to take the minister\u2019s assertion seriously because the government has lost all credibility on this matter. We have been hearing of new deadlines for the liberalisation of the electricity market to end the EAC monopoly with such regularity they have become a running joke. Originally, the market was to have been liberalised in 2016, then in July 2019, then the beginning of 2020 and now the end of 2021. Two-and-a-half years may be some time away, but there is no reason to believe the new deadline will be met.\nDiko deputy, Angelos Votsis, described the constantly changing deadlines as \u201ca mockery that needs to stop\u201d, while Lakkotrypis was more diplomatic, recognising the existence of problems that cause the delays at the Transmission System Operator (TSO) that is supposedly to be administering the project of purchasing power from independent producers. The head of the energy regulator (Cera), Andreas Poullikkas, did not mince his words, blaming the manager of the TSO.\n\u201cAt the moment we have no confidence in the manager that the schedule he gives us will be respected,\u201d said Poullikkas. There could not have been a more emphatic expression of no confidence in the TSO manager than this, but given his consistent failure to meet past deadlines it is justified. In fact, several deputies, speaking after the meeting said the manager should be sacked given his failure to deliver the results expected of him.\nThe problem is that failure to perform your duties adequately is not a sackable offence in the public sector, so the government may have great difficulty removing the TSO manager despite his failure to perform his duties competently. This included a botched tenders\u2019 procedure in which the cost was estimated at \u20ac5 million by the TSO and the only offer submitted was \u20ac15 million. Last week a new tenders\u2019 procedure was announced for the software needed for the TSO. Whether contracts will be signed by the December 2019 deadline so that the market is opened up at the end of 2021 is another matter.\nThe mockery Votsis spoke of is set to run and run because the government appointed as head of the TSO someone that was unsuitable for the job and now cannot have him removed.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Honda HRV Sport\nHowever, there's also a Civic Sport and a Jazz Sport with warm-hatch credentials and now Honda wants to add the HRV Sport to that list. Pitched in the same class as the Nissan Qashqai and a multitude of other mid-size SUVs, the Honda HRV is aimed at families with children. Honda hopes the Sport version will attract more younger families. These would be people who are aware of Honda and its sports heritage, reliability and innovation but haven't bought from the brand before. Honda doesn't give an exact sales prediction for the HRV this year but it will admit sales are running level with the past few years, when it has sold around 6,000 a year.\nThis Sport version is expected to take around a fifth of that with the majority being the six-speed manual version and around a third being the auto. To distinguish the Sport from the rest of the HRV range Honda has given it a gloss black bodykit. At the front this means a smooth swathe between the lights and a lower aero splitter beneath the grille, there's then side skirts and wheel-arch edging in black. Finally, at the rear there's a black section across the lower portion of the bumper.To cap off the exterior design tweaks, the Sport sits on gloss-black 18-inch alloys. The visual impact of the bodykit works particularly well with the grey metallic paint, giving the small family SUV a meaner, more aggressive look that suits a sportier car.The biggest difference between the Sport and the rest of the HRV range, which also gets a mid-life update, is the 182bhp 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine. It's an impressive unit. Power delivery is smooth and linear throughout the rev range and it cleverly manages to be quiet and refined at both lower speeds and on a motorway cruise, while offering some vocal character from the engine and exhaust when you want to get on a bit on a twisty road. Plus, it manages this without having to resort to sound amplification through the speakers, which some rivals opt for. Blistering isn't a description you'd use for the performance of the HRV Sport but it's reasonably quick with a 0 to 60mph time of 7.8 seconds and a top speed of 134mph, so it's what you'd call \"usefully nippy\".\nIt also means that there's plenty of shove to handle motorway work with ease. Despite being a Sport model, economy is good too, with an average fuel economy of 47.9mpg. On the road the HRV Sport can be hustled along fairly swiftly but it is let down by a decided lack of feel from the steering. The steering may be well-weighted but it offers no guidance as to what's happening or about to happen between the road and the tyres. The brakes similarly lack feel and if you up the pace on your favourite twisty road you'll notice them start to soften.This is a shame because the car is balanced rather well and there's the right amount of body roll and control to give both good guidance about what the car's doing without it feeling wallowy, thanks to upgraded suspension over the rest of the HRV range. It somewhat makes up for the poor steering feel. Similarly, there's a contradiction between the clutch action, which is particularly long with a strong spring action at the top of its travel and a sweet six-speed manual gearbox that feels accurate and positive. Overall comfort levels are fine.The car isn't stiff and jarring over less than smooth roads but it's not that settled either and the result is that the heads of occupants will wobble over rougher surfaces and potholes. The automatic version is in many ways a better car, given the lack of fun-factor or driver involvement.And for those doing more town and motorway work, the auto will definitely be the better bet.\nInside, all Sport models gain a black and red-themed interior and the latest upgrades across the HRV range provide higher quality materials in the main dashboard.The front seats are comfortable for everyday use but as with a few other aspects of the car they don't quite convey a sporty nature. Interior space is still as impressive as it has always been in the HRV, with some of the best in class rear seat legroom. Honda's clever rear seat folding mechanism is also useful for carrying large loads if you don't need the rear seats while the boot is a competitive 410 litres. Where Honda may win sales is for those looking for a quicker SUV without having to resort to efficiency-sapping all-wheel drive.There are very few rivals that offer similar performance without having to go for a premium brand and the associated price hike. For this reason, Honda shouldn't have any problems selling the HRV Sport. Honda's HRV may be called Sport in name but it doesn't have a sporty character. This doesn't stop the HRV being a good car. It's still very well built, looks smart, is supremely practical and priced well against its rivals. It's just that it's missing the fun element that a car needs to deliver driver enjoyment.\nThe back of the car\n", "label": "human"}

Any disputes can be taken to the Constitutional Court where a nine-judge panel will have 14 days to rule on them.\nFRAUD CONCERNS\nMore than 10,000 volunteers crowd-sourced results posted at polling stations in a real-time bid to thwart attempts at fraud.\nHowever, even before the election, the opposition alleged voter-list irregularities that it said could affect millions and vowed legal or \u201cpeople power\u201d action if its concerns were ignored.\nWidodo campaigned on his record of deregulation and improving infrastructure, calling his first term a step to tackling inequality and poverty in Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy.\nBread-and-butter issues were at the forefront of the minds of many voters.\n\u201cI hope in future prices of staple foods will be cheaper, especially as we are heading into Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr,\u201d said Nurani, a 41-year-old mother of three, voting in Bandar Lampung in Sumatra.\nBut religion was also a factor in the election in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country, where conservatives have been increasingly influential.\nWidodo, a moderate Muslim from Java island, had to burnish his Islamic credentials after smear campaigns and hoax stories accused him of being anti-Islam, a communist or too close to China, all politically damaging in Indonesia. He picked Islamic cleric Ma\u2019ruf Amin, 76, as his running mate.\nPrabowo, a former special forces commander who has links to some hardline Islamist groups, and his running mate, business entrepreneur Sandiaga Uno, pledged to boost the economy by slashing taxes and cutting food prices.\nFollow Trend on Telegram.

The colossal list also includes aeroplanes, beeswax, tables for casino games, tractors and car parts.\nThe countermeasures are in response to a dispute over Boeing at the World Trade Organisation, that claims US subsidies to the aircraft manufacturer cause harm to its rival Airbus, including lost sales.\nCecilia Malmstrom, the European Commissioner responsible for trade, said: \u201cEuropean companies must be able to compete on fair and equal terms. The recent WTO ruling on US subsidies for Boeing is important in this respect. We must continue to defend a level-playing field for our industry.\n\u201cBut let me be clear, we do not want a tit-for-tat. While we need to be ready with countermeasures in case there is no other way out, I still believe that dialogue is what should prevail between important partners such as the EU and the US, including in bringing an end to this long-standing dispute. The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome.\u201d\nAn EU official insisted the tariffs would not have implications for European consumers.\nThe source said: \"Our list is comprised of products where there is a possible substitution, where US supply is limited.\n\"European consumers shouldn't be radically affected by our countermeasures.\"\nThey added: \"Composing a list is a complex exercise and reaching such a big amount is difficult, we can't have a list of this magnitude without a very high number of products.\n\"We're not in favour of a trade war, we are not looking for a trade war, they're bad.\n\"We are confident if there is good faith on both sides a solution can be found and we won't be forced into the extremity of having tariffs applied on both sides.\"\nBoth the EU and US are waiting for WTO officials to make an assessment on potential loss of sales for both Boeing and Airbus in the dispute before slapping on the sanctions.\n", "label": "human"}

If Gladys and co reduced it for us nomads we may even be able to help in the communities we visit. Paying a fee for rego, but no road tax is a no brainer in NSW. Just a thought from a wanderer. HOW is Snowy 2.0 going to help when the Murray goes the same as the Darling? Must be going to pump sand. THE alarming rises in house fires resulting in a deceased person seems to be on the increase. I recall a sobering moment when I was about 18. One morning as I gazed out of my bedroom window I saw an ambulance which was parked across the road. It wasn't too long before I saw the crew carrying out which was obviously a deceased person. Then I noticed that they brought out a smouldering mattress. No explanation was necessary, but I made a vow that I would never smoke, and if I did, it would never be in bed. This is not what happens in all cases, obviously, but to my young mind, it was a lesson well learned. SORRY I made a mistake, I was a few billion short of the tax government steals from smokers. It's $12.5 billion. I estimate smokers cost Medicare $300 to 400 million, and we even get blamed for $300 million in bush fires. That's about $11.5 billion profit. I WATCHED the antics of the vegan protesters and couldn't help but wonder if any of them wear leather. Do they use leather wallets or handbags? Is there leather upholstery in their car, or on their lounge suites? Winter is coming. Will any of them be wearing winter woolly coats, beanies or scarves? Will they be putting their woollen doona and underlay on their beds? If so, then I believe they are hypocrites, and I think they better gripe about something else. I BELIEVE the only way to get rid of activists who chain themselves to machinery in abattoirs or any primary-producing business is to walk away and leave them there, ignoring their agenda. I call on the meat industry and meat eaters to achieve long-term gains for minimal pain as well as saving the police and the courts valuable time and money: simply leave the protesters to starve.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/iKQx4aiD4Q7fvCgDvFeGgz/2460819b-f60a-4a41-aa04-27d72f4e2a71.jpg/r3_0_1198_675_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Bloomberg is reporting that President Donald Trump will select former Republican presidential candidate and pizza company executive Herman Cain to join the Federal Reserve Board. The outlet is reporting that three people have said that Trump is set to make the announcement, but that they would prefer to remain off the record as it isn\u2019t official yet. Cain would be selected to take one of the two seats on the board that are currently unoccupied. Trump is widely expected to appoint Stephen Moore, a longtime Trump supporter and fellow at the Heritage Foundation, to the other vacant seat.\nCain is the former chairman and CEO of Godfather\u2019s Pizza from Georgia who ran for president in 2012. Prior to that, he served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Kansas City, Omaha Branch from 1989 to 1991. Perhaps more importantly, he is seen as another loyalist to Trump, one who would be unlikely to raise his ire, as has occurred with Trump\u2019s own appointment to the chair the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell. In recent months when Powell has taken the step of raising interest rates, Trump has repeatedly berated him via Twitter and even mused publicly about firing him.\nCain\u2019s run for the nomination in 2012 ended abruptly when allegations he was a serial sexual harasser during his time as head of the National Restaurant Association came out. In addition, a woman claimed she had a 13-year extramarital affair with him.\nRick Diamond / Getty Images\nSince his run for the 2012 nomination, Cain has remained politically active, hosting a radio show and working as a tea party activist. In September, he helped to found a Trump-aligned political action committee, the America Fighting Back PAC. The PAC features a photo of Trump on its website and is emblazoned with the phrase, \u201cWe must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.\u201d However, as recently as 2017 he called for a hike in interest rates, in direct contradiction to President Trump\u2019s stated position.\nCain\u2019s other well-known political position touches on economic policy, and that\u2019s his call for the U.S. to return to the gold standard.\nThe president received a great deal of criticism over the announcement that Moore would be appointed, with notable voices calling for the Senate to deny him confirmation. Those voices included Harvard professor Greg Mankiw, former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, who said that Moore doesn\u2019t have the \u201cintellectual gravitas\u201d to help run the Fed, as reported earlier by Bloomberg.

Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury.\nRoad traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\nWHO highlights that road traffic injuries can be prevented. Governments need to take action to address road safety in a holistic manner. This requires involvement from multiple sectors such as transport, police, health, education, and actions that address the safety of roads, vehicles, and road users.\nEffective interventions include designing safer infrastructure and incorporating road safety features into land-use and transport planning, improving the safety features of vehicles, improving post-crash care for victims of road crashes, setting and enforcing laws relating to key risks, and raising public awareness.\nFB/MQ/MG\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "While the concept of any member of the royal family going incognito seems downright laughable, it isn\u2019t just possible \u2014 it actually happened. And recently, no less. Per a press release issued by Kensington Palace on Sunday, Prince William has learned to be a spy via a top-secret three-week training mission. The \u201cattachment,\u201d as referred to by the royal family, involved interning with three of the country\u2019s intelligence and security agencies: the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service and the Government Communications Headquarters.\nAt this point, you\u2019re probably wondering what use the heir to the British throne has for such covert shenanigans. In the press release, William explained, \u201cSpending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience. These agencies are full of people from everyday backgrounds doing the most extraordinary work to keep us safe. They work in secret, often not even able to tell their family and friends about the work they do or the stresses they face. They are driven by an unrivaled patriotism and dedication to upholding the values of this country. We all owe them deep gratitude for the difficult and dangerous work they do.\u201d\nAccording to Kensington Palace, the work that William alludes to is more vital than ever \u2014 the release somberly states that \u201cthe threat level for international terrorism in the UK [has been] set at SEVERE or above for the last five years.\u201d Not surprisingly, then, William took the mission very seriously, even spending a week at M16 (aka the foreign intelligence unit of the beloved fictional spy icon James Bond).\nAnd if you\u2019re harboring any delusions that William wouldn\u2019t be cut out for the double-agent life, think again. The GCHQ Head of Counter-Terrorism Operations, who is identified only as \u201cDavid,\u201d revealed, \u201cWilliam worked exceptionally hard to embed himself in the team and comfortably held his own amongst some highly skilled analysts and operators. His Royal Highness asked some probing questions and demonstrated a real grasp of our mission.\u201d David noted that the mission was a \u201crare opportunity\u201d to expose an outsider to the extreme acumen it takes to keep the UK safe on a daily basis.\nIn the grand scheme of roles and responsibilities William has tackled outside of the royal family, it sounds like he\u2019s far better suited at being a spy than, say, his more strait-laced prior gigs at the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange. Come to think of it, isn\u2019t Hollywood still looking for the next star to slide into 007\u2019s shoes? While we can\u2019t imagine Kate Middleton would be too keen on her royal husband being a real-life double agent, she might not object to him playing one.

She is about 5-foot-5 and was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots, authorities said.\nAuthorities said they are being especially cautious because Pais' statements don't express a specific plan and were mostly spoken.\n\"She did make statements that were threatening to schools and she did purchase a firearm ... and that's why she's a credible threat,\" said Patricia Billinger, a spokeswoman with the Colorado Department of Public Safety.\nAnniversary of Columbine shooting is this week\nThe 20th anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School is days away.\nOn April 20, 1999, two students killed 12 of their schoolmates and one teacher in a mass shooting at the high school in the town of Littleton -- about 10 miles from Denver.\n\"I know that this opens a wound, especially on an anniversary week, for those families who were most deeply impacted by this,\" Shrader said.\nAt this point, there might not be enough probable cause to arrest Pais, but the federal and state attorneys' offices are working to develop appropriate charges, Phillips said. He said once they detain her, they will hold her for as long as they legally can.\nAuthorities said they have not identified any connections she has with Colorado and most of her threats were spoken. They are asking for the public's help finding her, and tips can be sent to the tip line at (303) 630-6227 or emailed to denverfbitips@fbi.gov.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 For nearly a month, medical officials at the Cuyahoga County Jail pleaded with County Executive Armond Budish\u2019s administration to make changes aimed, in part, at decreasing suicides at the jail.\nThe calls for reform went unanswered, according to emails obtained by cleveland.com.\nTwo days after Christmas, 27-year-old inmate Brenden Kiekisz hanged himself in his cell.\nWithin 17 hours, as Kiekisz lay on life-support, the county implemented the changes that would help ensure inmates, like Kiekisz, receive a state-mandated medical screening that provides critical information to jail staff about their mental health and medical needs.\nThe revelation about Kiekisz\u2019s death \u2014 the eighth Cuyahoga County inmate to die in 2018 and now under review by federal investigators \u2014 are contained in emails exchanged in December between top county and MetroHealth officials. The county released the emails more than two months after several requests by cleveland.com.\nMetroHealth sought to curb the rising number of suicides and attempted suicides at the jail, largely attributed to crowded pods, squalid conditions and an understaffed and overworked jail staff. Half of the eight inmate deaths in 2018 came by suicide, including Kiekisz. The number of attempted suicides tripled to 69 in a three-year span.\nWhen Kiekisz arrived at the jail, he told a corrections officer that he tried to take his own life two days earlier, according to records obtained by cleveland.com.\nHe never received a medical screening, according to the emails.\nAnd neither did 28 percent of inmates booked into the jail in the four days ahead of Kiekisz\u2019s arrival, the emails said.\nMetroHealth Director of Correctional Medicine Dr. Thomas Tallman reiterated in an email to jail officials on Dec. 27 the need to make the changes. The message came less than an hour after Kiekisz was found in his cell.\n\u201cPlease, please please\u2026\u201d Tallman wrote. \u201cMy patience is gone\u2026\u201d\nThe conversations happened in the weeks when county officials said they were working to make swift changes in response to the Nov. 21 release of a U.S. Marshals Service report that detailed \u201cinhumane\u201d jail conditions.\nEvery official who participated in the email chain \u2014 in Budish\u2019s administration and at MetroHealth, which at the time oversaw a portion of jail health care \u2014 did not respond to questions from cleveland.com. Cuyahoga County spokeswoman Mary Louise Madigan said the county would not comment because of lawsuits filed over jail conditions. MetroHealth spokeswoman Tina Shaerban Arundel also declined comment.\nAmong the unanswered questions is why the county failed to act on MetroHealth\u2019s urgent recommendations until after Kiekisz\u2019s hanging.\nOn Tuesday, MetroHealth Chief of Staff Jane Platten reported to County Council that all inmates are receiving intake screenings now that MetroHealth is taking over as the jail\u2019s sole medical authority.\nPlatten had been emailing the county since Dec. 3, asking jail officials to \u201cimmediately\u201d implement changes. She asked again on Dec. 17, according to the emails.\nOne change was ensuring that all inmates get their health screening within four hours of their arrival, according to the emails.\nTo streamline that process, Tallman asked jail administrators to move nurses who perform the medical screenings to the jail\u2019s entry way, known as the sally port.\nMedical screenings used to take place in the sally port, but then-jail Director Ken Mills moved them to one of the jail\u2019s upper floors in May, Platten said in an email.\nHaving medical personnel located somewhere other than the sally port meant inmates were being dispersed throughout the jail complex without medical officials knowing whether they were booked, let alone given the chance to screen them, Platten\u2019s emails said.\n\u201cMoving to the sally port should cure this issue,\u201d Platten\u2019s emails said.\nBudish asked his staff Dec. 25 if the changes had been made.\nThen-Chief of Staff Earl Leiken, Public Safety and Justice Chief Brandy Carney, Sheriff Cliff Pinkney and interim jail director George Taylor didn\u2019t email him back, the emails show. The county will not say if anyone acted on Budish\u2019s inquiry or otherwise responded to him.\nThe county\u2019s failure to screen some incoming inmates in accordance with Ohio law was a problem Budish and his administration knew about for months.\nIn June, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction found that the county had failed to screen six out of the 30 inmates sampled. The agency asked to be notified when Cuyahoga County to corrected the problem. No response was sent.\nThe U.S marshals in November found that some inmates still weren\u2019t being screened.\nEven when inmates were screened, officers were being forced to conduct the screenings despite not being properly trained as medical officials, according to a grievance filed by corrections officers in November.\nThe county denied the grievance.\nAnother change suggested by Platten involved a new policy that would require the jail to turn away people brought to the jail that met certain medical criteria, including people who had attempted suicide in the previous seven days.\nThat, too, was implemented within a day of Kiekisz\u2019s hanging.\nIn the months since, a federal grand jury subpoenaed the records of Kiekisz\u2019s death, a sign that federal investigators have ramped up their investigation into conditions at the jail. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office is also leading a probe into jail conditions that has so far included indictments of the former jail director and five current and former corrections officers.\nBelow is an accounting of the emails and how the county responded:\nDec. 3\nPlatten sends the first email to Carney, Pinkney and Taylor about the changes. She asks for them to be \u201cimplemented immediately.\u201d No one replied, Platten said in a later email.\nDec. 17\nPlatten follows up with Budish and jail administrators to see if the changes were made. She cites an incident where an inmate who needs immediate attention did not receive their medical screening. She again asks jail officials to move intake screenings to the sally port and for an update on the proposed changes. No one replied, according to her later email.\nDec. 25\nBudish forwards Platten\u2019s latest email to Carney, Pinkney, Taylor and Leiken, and asks if the changes were made. No one returns Budish message.\nKiekisz is booked into jail on an accusation that he violated the terms of his probation stemming from a 2016 heroin and fentanyl possession case\nDec. 27\nMorning \u2014 A judge finds Kiekisz didn\u2019t violate probation, orders him released from the jail and back into treatment.\n10:56 p.m. \u2014 Kiekisz, who was returned to the jail to await transfer to a treatment facility, is found hanging in his cell. He is taken to MetroHealth and put on life-support.\n11:39 p.m. \u2014 Tallman emails Pinkney, Taylor, Platten, and then-warden Eric Ivey. He cites the hanging and again asks for intake screenings to be moved back to the sally port.\n\u201cWe just had another code green and my nurses tell me the likelihood of survival is low,\u201d Tallman\u2019s email said. \u201cIf that is true, then, well you do the math.\u201d\nTallman relays that Kiekisz didn\u2019t receive a screening when he was booked into jail. He asks for a full investigation into the case and wants to know who was working on Christmas and what events contributed to Kiekisz not being screened.\n\u201cMy patience is gone and we need our nurses down in the sally port intake area 24 seven, beginning immediately,\u201d Tallman said.\nDec. 28\n10:12 a.m. \u2014 Platten emails Carney, Taylor, Pinkney and copies Budish, Leiken and County Council members. The email says MetroHealth officials were never made aware of Kiekisz\u2019s booking, and he was not given a medical screening.\nShe again questions officials about her \u201crepeated requests\u201d for the changes, and asks for an immediate response.\n\u201cWe have gotten no response to our emails and requests and there has been no change at the jail to accommodate medical staff having immediate notice and access to incoming inmates for purposes of medical screenings,\u201d Platten\u2019s email said.\n10:15 a.m. \u2014 Budish emails Leiken, Carney, Taylor and Pinkney: \u201cI thought all changes were made. What\u2019s the problem? This can\u2019t continue!\u201d\n11:11 a.m. \u2014 Leiken emails Budish: \u201cI also understood all of these issues had been and were continuing to be addressed at the jail.\u201d\n1:39 p.m. \u2014Dr. Julia Bruner, MetroHealth\u2019s physician executive for ambulatory operations, sends Ivey an outline of how some of the changes will be put into practice. She says she reviewed the changes with Ivey and Pinkney earlier that day.\n2:18 p.m. \u2014 Ivey asks that changes get added to jail policy and asks for the unions representing jail staff to be notified.\n3:34 p.m. \u2014 Pinkney replies to the group but addresses the message to Tallman. Pinkney says the changes Platten recommended on Dec. 3 would be put into effect immediately. He says he had ordered the changes to be made weeks ago but had to wait for a property machine for an unrelated part of the booking process. (Cuyahoga County refused to answer questions about the property machine, its purpose and why they had to wait for it to implement changes)\nPinkney says that Tallman has authority over medical decision in his role as medical director.\n6:37 p.m. \u2014 Platten emails Pinkney and points out that she had emailed jail administrators about the changes three times and got no response. Platten addressed Pinkney\u2019s claim that he ordered the changes weeks prior but says \u201cexecution of those orders though had not been fully realized.\u201d\nShe also notes that Pinkney was able to implement the changes within hours after the hanging.\n\u201cIt is clear that the lines of communication on these matters have broken down,\u201d Platten wrote.\nPlatten also mentions that 28 percent of inmates failed to receive screenings from Dec. 25 to Dec. 28.\nDec. 30\nKiekisz dies in what is later ruled a suicide.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Sweater and trousers by Salvatore Ferragamo; socks by Pantherella. Alexi Lubomirski\nWhen the whole thing comes to a presumably dramatic halt on Sunday, May 19\u2014the last gasp of what we once called \u201cappointment television\u201d?\u2014Game of Thrones\u2019 tale of magic, broadswords, and power politics will have played out over eight seasons and seventy-three episodes. If this were a movie to be watched in a single viewing, you would be stuck in your seat for three days. The number of credited cast members reached 635 through season 7, by IMDb\u2019s reckoning\u2014and that\u2019s not including hundreds, if not thousands, of extras. Shot on locations and in studios across three continents and ten countries, the series is one of the most expansive physical productions ever mounted, with a budget that Variety claims has grown to $15 million per episode, a fiscal height rarely scaled by TV (and roughly 50 percent more than the budgets for only-just-lavish-enough competitors Westworld and The Crown). A more visceral statistic: The show, in its search for muck-and-mire medieval authenticity, has used enough prop mud to float the Titanic.\nHarington has devoted much of the past decade to Game of Thrones, growing into the role as he grew into adulthood\u2014and as the show itself grew from cult hit to global phenomenon.\nJacket, trousers, and shirt by Alexander McQueen; shoes by Brunello Cucinelli. Alexi Lubomirski\nI made that last bit up\u2014I don\u2019t think there\u2019s even such a thing as prop mud. (Game of Thrones uses the real thing.) But it feels true, as the saying goes, and I do believe it is fair to claim that Game of Thrones is the most . . . abundant narrative in the history of filmed entertainment, unless you count soap operas and telenovelas (and maybe you should). For certain, though, it makes the likes of The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter saga feel as spartan as works by Margaret Wise Brown. Game of Thrones is so sprawling it refuses even to have a true central character, no Frodo or Harry, only a shrinking constellation of protagonists and villains.\nBut maybe more equal than most is Kit Harington\u2019s Jon Snow, the closest thing the show has to a conventional hero: bighearted, steadfast, seemingly humble-born but with world-saving destiny slowly thrust upon him. Moreover\u2014and unlike Frodo and Harry\u2014Jon Snow is handsome in a grand, Byronic manner, windswept and untamed. You could imagine him moonlighting in a Bront\u00eb adaptation, or selling fancy cars in arty commercials, as Harington has done (for Infiniti).\nThe actor, too, has had pop-cultural destiny thrust upon him. He started from a good place, born into an English family with posh lineage and graduating from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. But filming the Game of Thrones pilot in 2009, when he was twenty-one, was the first time Harington had acted in front of a professional camera. He has devoted much of the past decade to the show, growing into the role as he grew into adulthood\u2014and as the show itself grew from cult hit to global phenomenon. He was lucky: Not only has his character not (yet?) been killed off, but he met his wife of less than a year on the show, Rose Leslie, the Scottish actress who played a love interest of Jon Snow\u2019s, Ygritte, a \u201cwildling\u201d who was, alas, killed off. (Arrow in the back, season 4, episode 9.)\nThe Game of Thrones pilot was the first time Harington had acted in front of a professional camera. \"I remember feeling like an adult then,\" he says, \"but looking back, I was just a kid.\"\nSuit and shirt by Givenchy; boots by Barbanera. Alexi Lubomirski\nHarington and I met over tea at an apartment he and Leslie were sharing in downtown Manhattan while she finished up work on the third season of the CBS All Access legal drama The Good Fight and he took a breather following four months spent doing a play in London (True West). Shorter of hair and trimmer of beard than on TV, his civilian speaking voice closer to the King\u2019s English than Jon Snow\u2019s burly northern accent, he wanted to reflect on his decade as a key part of such an unprecedentedly complicated work of pop culture\u2014the friendships, the challenges, the collaborations, the artistry, the horrendous hours, and, indeed, the mud. With the aid of a well-curated selection of photos from his iPhone, reproduced here, that\u2019s what he did.\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nKIT HARINGTON: This picture was taken just after the very first table read of the pilot for Game of Thrones\u2014the pilot that no one saw. That was a complete disaster that meant the show nearly never got made. [The pilot was rewritten and substantially reshot with much of the same cast but a few key changes; most notably, Emilia Clarke was cast as Daenerys Targaryen.] What\u2019s happened here is that Richard [Robb Stark], Alfie [Theon Greyjoy], and I all met for the first time at that table read. We were completely fresh off the boat. This was a huge job for us: a pilot for HBO. American TV. That was massive. I remember it was very, very exciting. We left the table read, where we\u2019d just read with Sean Bean [who played Ned Stark, beheaded toward the end of the first season]. We\u2019d met Sophie Turner [Sansa Stark], Maisie Williams [Arya Stark], and Isaac Hempstead-Wright [Bran Stark] that day, and they were just these tiny, tiny little kids. I remember Isaac looked like a puppy\u2014he was just so small\u2014and they came running up and they were very excited. I remember feeling like an adult then, but looking back, I was just a kid.\nBRUCE HANDY: The picture looks like a souvenir.\nAlfie, Richard, and I went to the Wheel of Belfast. It was that time when every city had to have a huge Ferris wheel. We were almost like kids ourselves, going on this big wheel and obviously having this souvenir photo taken. It\u2019s just remarkable looking at it now and thinking we had no idea what was going to happen with the show. We were just young actors happy to be working\u2014literally a world-at-your-feet sort of thing but no expectations from it.\nKit Harington, Isaac Hempstead and Richard Madden in season 1 of Game of Thrones. \"We were the young lads of the show,\" Harington says. HBO\nThat was the start of a very close friendship between us, because I think we looked around the room at the table read and went, \u201cYou\u2019re a young lad. You\u2019re a young lad. You\u2019re a young lad.\u201d We were the young lads of the show. For about three years after that [until Robb Stark was killed toward the end of the third season in the famous Red Wedding episode] we were inseparable. You know, we were best, best mates. And we still are.\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nKristofer has one of the most amazing faces ever. I think he looks like an Arctic explorer in this. He\u2019s just wonderfully eccentric and became a very, very good friend.\nWhat [executive producers] David Benioff and Dan Weiss would do was bring in a new character and see what the actor was doing with it, and depending on whether they liked what the actor was doing, the actor might continue on the show a bit. Kristofer\u2019s a perfect example. Tormund could have been one of those flitting characters who came in and went. But David and Dan loved what Kristofer did with Tormund.\nKristofer is Tormund. He\u2019s big and fun and funny, and he\u2019ll give you a bear hug and nearly crush your ribs. What David and Dan like is when someone\u2019s a nice person and fits in well.\nSpeaking of fitting in, you told me the cast spent a lot of evenings together in the bar of your Belfast hotel, the Fitzwilliam.\nIt was like our common room! That, for me, is what a lot of making Thrones was\u2014bar culture. A lot of jobs, everyone goes back to their apartments at the end of the day. They have their lives and they have their families and they have their girlfriends or boyfriends back home. They sort of isolate. That\u2019s fine. Lots of jobs are like that.\nThe bar at the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast. \"It was like our common room!\" Harington says. Courtesy of the Fitzwilliam hotel.\nBut if Thrones had been like that, it wouldn\u2019t have been what it was. I think part of what made it successful was the fact that we got on like a family. Everyone who came in was welcomed into the family. No one was the lead of that family\u2014it was an ensemble. We were just genuinely happy in one another\u2019s company. We made each other laugh. We cared for each other. We picked someone up if they fell. Look, over ten years of anyone\u2019s life, family members die, people have breakdowns, shit gets real in people\u2019s lives. All of that can be accentuated in this bottled environment of being on a famous TV show. And sometimes the only people who can guide you through those problems are the people who also know what it\u2019s like to be on a famous TV show.\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nSo the story behind this one is that it was season 5, when John Bradley, as Samwell Tarly, leaves the Wall and goes off to the Citadel, and me and Hannah Murray, who plays Gilly [Samwell\u2019s love interest], decided to pull a prank on John, because obviously he\u2019d be getting a new costume. And so we said to the costume people, \u201cCan you just mock up the most ridiculous outfit you can possibly come up with that could still be feasible? Like it can\u2019t be too wild, because you won\u2019t believe it\u2014but just about feasible.\u201d And they came up with this, which was just so perfect.\nThe amount of effort and time that\u2019s gone into that, just for a joke, is brilliant. But if you look at John\u2019s face in that, he\u2019s so upset and angry and he\u2019s totally bought it. I was expecting a text off him straightaway saying, \u201cWhat the fuck have they done with my costume?\u201d And I didn\u2019t get anything, and I turned to Hannah and I was like, \u201cI think we\u2019ve genuinely upset him.\u201d We got a report back from the costume designer saying that he completely bought it.\nHow long did he have to wait until he found out he\u2019d been pranked?\nWell, we left it. I was like, \u201cLet\u2019s see if he has to call his agents or how far this goes.\u201d And he was so silent and he got on set, and I think they even hung it up in his trailer for his first day before they broke it to him. And then I still didn\u2019t hear from him and I thought I\u2019d actually pissed him off. I asked him afterward, and he was like, \u201cI was never going to tell anybody about that.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s his facial expression in this. He looks so upset. It\u2019s just\u2014it just gives me so much joy.\nWe all started pranking one another a lot, and the thing was we all wanted to get David Benioff and Dan Weiss, \u2019cause they were the biggest pranksters. They were the ones that would really go hard on it. They\u2019re so intelligent that they get bored and they start pranking actors. They pranked me a few times.\nI\u2019ve read that early on they gave you some fake script pages that made you think Jon Snow would be a burn victim with a horribly scarred face for most of the show.\nThat was pretty rough. It\u2019s season 1, and you\u2019re just kind of young and starting out. I rang my mum and was like, \u201cMum, they\u2019re gonna cut my nose off! I\u2019m gonna have a prosthetic nose for six years. Jeez, I\u2019m going to be playing a character part now\u201d\u2014and all this stuff. I walked on set and I went up to Dan and was like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve become a burn victim?\u201d And Dan was like, \u201cYeah, we just felt the character was getting a bit Harry Potter and we felt that you\u2019re a bit pretty. . . .\u201d And then I see David just pissing himself in the background.\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nThis was taken in Spain, and I thought Emilia looked like, as the old saying goes, a million bucks. To me, in this photo, she screams fifties, sixties, Old Hollywood chic. And that\u2019s why I took this snap, \u2019cause she sort of has a timeless quality to her.\nMe, Rose, and Emilia have been best mates for years, but I never got to work with her until season 7. That\u2019s a long time to be experiencing the same show and also the same kind of journey, me and Emilia, because we\u2019ve followed the same path. We both came out of drama school and this was our first big show, and we became kind of the ice and fire of it all a bit\u2014the two youngish leads, I guess. Probably the closest to what we were each experiencing was what the other person was experiencing, but then not to work with each other until season 7 and then walk on the same set. . . . I remember our first scene together was bizarre. We kind of looked at each other and tried not to laugh.\nHow did you become close if you weren\u2019t working together? When did you see each other?\nWe would see each other at table reads, but our friendship was based around doing press and meeting each other at Comic-Con or hanging out outside of Thrones. But once the series got started, we were rarely in the same place at the same time. She was always filming abroad [on locations in Morocco, Croatia, and Malta], and I was always in Belfast.\nI remember the first time I ever saw her. She came into the Fitzwilliam bar. I had been talking to Rich Madden at the bar and he went, \u201cI\u2019ve just met the new Daenerys. She\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally? I haven\u2019t met her yet.\u201d And then she came in and I saw her and was like, \u201cWow.\u201d She takes your breath away when she walks into a room, Emilia.\nI think we\u2019re good mates because we, maybe more than anyone else, know what the other one\u2019s going through a bit. I don\u2019t mean to sound like we\u2019re going through the worst thing in the world. But I think no one else other than Emilia\nwill know exactly what being on Thrones is like, the way we\u2019re on Thrones.That\u2019s really how we kind of bonded.\nWhat\u2019s behind the picture of you wearing the Daenerys wig?\nThis is just me fucking around. I just got bored one day and put it on. Quite often Dany\u2019s wigs were lying around. If that picture says anything, it\u2019s about how much of your time is spent in hair and makeup.\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nI took this selfie during the Battle of the Bastards [season 6\u2019s biggest episode]. Just to give you an idea, we had six stages of dirt and blood, and I\u2019m on about stage three at that point. And it was pretty uncomfortable. All of that stuff on my face is sticky blood, which is sugar based and attracts wasps and flies. I think I took that selfie just to go, \u201cWhat the fuck am I in? I\u2019m halfway through this and this is how messy I am.\u201d\nMiguel [Sapochnik, who directed the episode] wanted to get away from heroic Jon Snow. Jon turns a bit into a monster; he turns into this fucking ruined . . . [Searches for but can\u2019t quite find an appropriately ruinous noun.] I think every time I walked on set, Miguel went, \u201cMore blood, more mud! More blood, more mud!\u201d And so it was just building and building, and that picture was just me in my trailer going, \u201cFuck this.\u201d\nThat sequence took two weeks to shoot. To give you a comparison, this year we have a battle that took six weeks.\nWas the Battle of the Bastards filmed sequentially?\nThey had to. I mean, Thrones generally is not filmed sequentially at all. On Tuesday you might be filming a scene from episode 9, and on Wednesday you might be filming from episode 1. That was part of the test of Thrones, keeping your character\u2019s journey very clear in your head, so you knew where\u2019d you been and where you were going. So you weren\u2019t just playing it generic. But the battle had to be in order for the most part because hair and makeup can\u2019t go, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got to clean him up to the beginning of the battle.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work like that.\nThe mud on my face here is makeup, but you get covered in real mud by the end of the day anyway. They\u2019ll have things called mud slingers and mud cannons\u2014they just shoot mud at you, so that\u2019s always quite fun. I used to get in the bath at the end of the day, and it was fucking black with mud. You\u2019re like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a hard day\u2019s work.\u201d\nKit at the Battle of the Bastards in season 6 of Game of Thrones. \"The producers and directors pushed us to our limits,\" he says. \"But there\u2019s something about the incessant nature of what we were doing that I think added to the show\u2019s authenticity.\" HBO\nI don\u2019t know what happens on other TV shows or other sets\u2014I haven\u2019t been on many. But on Thrones, the money put into it goes into the show. There weren\u2019t many luxuries on Thrones, not for anyone. The actors obviously get a place to sit because they\u2019re sitting around a lot, but it\u2019s usually some crappy little cabin. You don\u2019t get driven back [from the location] to your trailers. You get to sit there in a cold, wet, damp cabin all day and in these sodden, heavy costumes.\nI\u2019m going to do a quick bit of math. [Opens metric-conversion app on phone.] So my costume weighed thirty-three pounds, and you\u2019d carry all of that on your shoulders all day. So thirty-three pounds for ten hours.\nAnd if it\u2019s wet or muddy, it\u2019s heavier.\nYeah. And then you\u2019ve got the sword, and that weighs two kilograms, which is another X number of pounds. [It\u2019s four pounds and change.] Plus, I was in fucking high heels, because I\u2019m short and they need me to look taller than other people, so I\u2019m carrying fifty pounds in high heels. You\u2019d have about a week or two where your body went into shock, going, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m knackered. But you just kind of get into it and your muscles build up, and it was actually quite a good workout every day. You didn\u2019t need to go to the gym.\nThe producers and directors pushed us to our limits. They pushed themselves to their limits. But there\u2019s something about the incessant nature of what we were doing that I think added to the show\u2019s authenticity. This year, in season 8, everyone on the show is meant to look exhausted\u2014and everyone was exhausted. I saw some of the costume and hair-and-makeup guys recently. I walked in and I looked at them and I was like, \u201cYou guys look great!\u201d And they were like, \u201cYou look great!\u201d And I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2019cause we were knackered!\u201d At the end of last season, we were all gray, gray in the face. We were bone-tired, you know. But you push everyone to their limits and something brilliant happens.\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nThis is from this season. I think he\u2019s asleep there. That was during these long nights filming battles. There was just something so weird about chilling in the greenroom\u2014a tent, basically\u2014with the Night King, who\u2019s making jokes, and the White Walkers around him, who are cracking up. To you it\u2019s normal, but to anyone else walking into that room, it would be bizarre. It\u2019s these bits I\u2019ll miss most\u2014the moments of \u201cWhat the fuck is my job?\u201d\nWhen you see the White Walkers in the flesh, they look exactly like they do onscreen. They have the blue eyes, those contact lenses they put in\u2014fucking uncomfortable. And because of the prosthetics, they can\u2019t eat for hours. So they have to drink, like, mushed-up protein. Whenever I kind of got tired or pissed off with my costume or makeup, I\u2019d look over at Vladimir, who plays the Night King, and think, Fucking hell. But they never moan, those boys. They\u2019re all stuntmen. The actors moan, but they don\u2019t moan.\nYou\u2019d always love fighting with stuntmen and really hope that if you got an actor to fight with, they were good. The difference is the stuntmen will always pull their sword at the right time. They\u2019ll be careful of you. They\u2019ll know what they\u2019re doing. Actors tend to act, and that can be dangerous in a fight. If you\u2019ve got an actor who is throwing his sword so hard because he\u2019s selling the scene, if you miss your block, it\u2019s going to hit you in the face.\nDid you take some pretty bad whacks over the years?\nYou get some whacks. But nothing on the stunt boys. I remember one stunt guy getting dragged off set with a broken leg, having fallen twenty feet. And all he was yelling was \u201cDid we get the shot? Did we get the shot?\u201d\nCourtesy of Kit Harington\nWe took this this season. I can\u2019t remember what we were there for, whether it was a photo shoot or a costume thing, but it struck all of us that it was so rare that this many people were in one place at one time. So we were like, \u201cRight. We need a family photo.\u201d\nThis is obviously just a snippet of people who were on Thrones. I\u2019d love to get a massive group of everyone who was on Thrones in one big photo. This is just what we ended up with, kind of the core group of us, minus for some reason Lena [Headey, who plays Cersei Lannister]. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s not there. But it\u2019s a really happy photo. I remember diving into the middle of it, trying to be center. The photo cuts a bit through all the shiny little faces we have to pull on press tours, and the people we are when we\u2019re all dolled up for a premiere or a talk show or what have you. When we get on set together, a group like this, we\u2019re fucking goofy and we play around. And I think you can tell from this photo how much everyone loves each other.\nI haven\u2019t got any little sisters or little brothers. I\u2019ve got one older brother. But I guess if I were to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the closest thing I have to a younger sibling?\u201d it would be Isaac, Maisie, and Sophie, just from a shared experience. I mean, it\u2019s a weird thing seeing someone like Sophie grow from thirteen, fourteen\u2014I can\u2019t remember how old she was when she started the show\u2014to now, when she\u2019s twenty-three years old and engaged. To see them all grow from little kids who\u2019d come and badger me, Alfie, and Richard when we were smoking\u2014they\u2019d come and tell us not to smoke. Then, as the years went by, I caught Sophie or Maisie having a cigarette at fifteen years old, and I\u2019m like, \u201cAh, I see!\u201d\nKit Harington with Sophie Turner in Season 6 of Game of Thrones. \"I\u2019d go from looking down at them to looking up at them,\" Harington says of his on-screen younger siblings. \"Now Sophie ruffles my hair.\" HBO\nSophie and Isaac grew past me! Each year, they\u2019d come back and they\u2019d just be taller. I\u2019d go from looking down at them to looking up at them. Now they pat me on the head. I used to pat them on the head, ruffle their hair. Now Sophie ruffles my hair.\nEach season you\u2019d lose people. Richard died in season 3. End of season 4, Mark Stanley died, Josef Altin died. [Stanley and Altin played members of the Night\u2019s Watch, Grenn and Pypar.] Each season you\u2019d lose people; everything would be regenerated. People came in and went, came in and went. You forged new friendships and found new groups\u2014you\u2019d find yourself in a different bit of the story [with a less familiar cast]. Each season would shift. The plates would shift. You\u2019d have wrap parties for those people who died. And you might see them again. You might not.\nDid the cast develop a ritual for saying goodbye to \u201cdead\u201d friends?\nNot really. Just a drink in the Fitzwilliam bar. Maybe a night out or something. A big dinner if they were a big part of it. That\u2019s one of those really transient things about being an actor: You become really tight-knit with a family, and then you leave. You know, you fall in love with people. I don\u2019t mean romantic love. But you fall in love with friends and then they\u2019re gone. That happened all the way through Thrones.\nKit Harington\u2019s Jon Snow is the closest thing Game of Thrones has to a conventional hero: bighearted, steadfast, seemingly humble-born but with world-saving destiny slowly thrust upon him.\nJacket, Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello; sweater by the Row; trousers by Dior Men; shoes by Pierre Hardy. Alexi Lubomirski\nIt\u2019s quite unique as an actor to say I was in it the whole way through, from season 1, or even the pilot, through season 8. I think there are only eight of us. I feel privileged to have worked my way through the whole thing.\nHow did you all find out about your fates in season 8?\nThey just sent us the scripts and we all read them. I didn\u2019t read them until I got to the table read, \u2019cause I wanted just to listen to it. I thought, There\u2019s no point in reading it when I can hear the actual actors speaking out loud. So yeah, that was the first time we knew what was happening this season and the fates of our characters. I think it hit everyone very personally around that table when a character didn\u2019t make it. There was a kind of tear in people\u2019s eyes, and we\u2019d look up at the other actors and be like [mimes a salute] for, you know, whoever it was that had gone.\nBut I think you get tired of that [cast shuffling] after eight years. And that\u2019s when the show needs to end. We\u2019ve gone through as many variations of people as we can. The show\u2019s gotten as big as it can. The in-house jokes that go around are getting slightly tired now. We need to end.\nT-shirt, trousers, and shoes by Louis Vuitton. Alexi Lubomirski\nMy final day of shooting, I felt fine . . . I felt fine . . . I felt fine. . . Then I went to do my last shots and started hyperventilating a bit. Then they called, \u201cWrap!\u201d And I just fucking broke down. It was this onslaught of relief and grief about not being able to do this again. It wasn\u2019t so much about Jon. It was about not being in this world, not getting to smell those smells, fight those fights, be with these people\u2014the whole package.\nBut the weirdest bit was when we came off set and they started taking the costume off and it felt like being skinned. It felt like they were unceremoniously, for the last time, ripping off this character. I was still blubbering my tears. The costume girls were like, \u201cFucking, come on, get it together.\u201d I\u2019m being very actorly and crying. I remember going, \u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d And they wouldn\u2019t. They just ripped. [Pantomimes sleeves being taken off.] I was like, \u201cI need to say goodbye.\u201d But it was too late. He was gone.\nThere was something about the costume being taken off me that was like, Oh, I don\u2019t get to be him anymore. And I love him. I loved being him. I got a really good deal in this!\nAlexi Lubomirski\nThis article appears in the May 2019 issue of Esquire\nSubscribe\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\u201cWith our group, we know we\u2019re capable of doing something special. We know how good we can be.\u201d\nYou could understand if the Vancouver Giants were goofy and giddy.\nTheir 6-1 victory over the Royals on Thursday at Victoria\u2019s Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre gave the Giants a sweep of the best-of-seven Western Hockey League Western Conference semifinals and vaulted them to the league\u2019s Final Four for the first time since 2009-10 \u2014 or back when Montreal Canadiens mainstay Brendan Gallagher was a 17-year-old, second-year Giant.\nVictoria was also the team that rallied from a 3-2 series deficit to eliminate Vancouver in seven games in the first round last spring, keeping them from what would have been the Giants\u2019 first series win of any sort since that run with Gallagher and crew nine years ago.\nThe Giants players were obviously elated after Thursday\u2019s win. Still, it was a controlled, polite celebration rather than lampshades-on-heads shenanigans. It came off like the players believe there\u2019s much more to go.\nThat can\u2019t exactly be an automatic mindset to reach when you consider there are still several guys in the Vancouver group that went 20-46-3-3 two seasons ago.\nVancouver needed six games to finish off the Seattle Thunderbirds in the opening round this year for that elusive first series win.\n\u201cWe\u2019re only halfway there right now,\u201d defenceman Alex Kannok Leipert said, making a reference to four playoff series triumphs that Vancouver would need for a WHL title and a berth in the Memorial Cup national championship later this spring.\n\u201cWith our group, we know we\u2019re capable of doing something special. We know how good we can be.\u201d\nFellow blue-liner Dylan Plouffe added: \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied. We took another step toward the next round here but we have to keep working on our game.\u201d\nVancouver will face either the Spokane Chiefs or the Everett Silvertips in the best-of-seven Western Conference final beginning next weekend at Langley Events Centre. The Silvertips avoided elimination Friday by tripping the Chiefs 4-1. The Chiefs still lead the series 3-1. Game 5 was scheduled for Saturday night at Veterans Memorial Arena in Spokane, Wash.\nThe winner of the Chiefs-Silvertips series will be a step up in weight class for Vancouver from the Royals.\nVictoria was in rebuilding mode this season and had to play the Vancouver series without their leading scorer, Kaid Oliver, because of an upper -body injury and over-age forward Kody McDonald because of a suspension. The Royals were also missing over-age defenceman Ralph Jarratt for a game because of an apparent shoulder injury and suspended rearguard Jake Kustra for two games.\nVancouver (48-15-3-2) was the top team in the Western Conference in the regular season. They were two points ahead of second-place Everett (47-16-2-3), and 14 in front of third-place Spokane (40-21-2-5). Victoria (34-30-2-2) was 29 points behind Vancouver.\nVictoria\u2019s best player was over-age goalie Griffen Outhouse. He was continually a thorn in Vancouver\u2019s side throughout his time with the Royals, and you can debate whether pro teams are missing out, but the fact remains he\u2019s an undrafted free agent when it comes to the NHL.\nSpokane\u2019s best player is defenceman Ty Smith, who was a first-round pick of the New Jersey Devils last June, or maybe centre Jaret Anderson-Dolan, who was a 2017 second-round pick of the Los Angeles Kings and got into five NHL games this year before being reassigned to Spokane.\nEverett\u2019s best player is centre Connor Dewar, who was a third-round pick of the Minnesota Wild last summer and has signed a deal with the club.\nVancouver went 3-1-0-0 against Spokane and 2-2-0-0 versus Everett. They last faced Spokane on March 8, losing 4-1 on the road. Their last meeting with Everett was Dec. 14.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be prepared,\u201d Plouffe said of the next playoff round. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019ve been all season. Our coaches have prepared us very well. I don\u2019t expect anything less now. We\u2019re going to watch a lot of video and prepare ourselves for what they play like and what kind of game they bring.\u201d\nVancouver captain Jared Dmytriw, a centre, added: \u201cThose lessons that we learned in the first round and even last year are paying dividends now. It\u2019s coming down to crucial points in the games now where we\u2019re using that playoff experience. We\u2019re becoming pretty seasoned.\u201d\nThe WHL doesn\u2019t reveal ice-time stats, but Dmytriw, Owen Hardy and Dawson Holt have likely been the forward unit that coach Michael Dyck has called on most often through the first two playoff rounds. They combined for 14 points in the four games against the Royals, highlighted by three goals and three assists from Dmytriw, who played his first three seasons in the WHL with Victoria.\nIt will be interesting to see if that continues and if Vancouver centre Davis Koch (2-12-14) and defenceman Bowen Byram (4-9-13) can continue to lead the scoring charge in the postseason. Koch and Byram held down the top two positions in the circuit heading into league action Friday.\nThey\u2019re key figures on a Vancouver power play that connected at 33.3 per cent (11-of-33) through two rounds.\nByram, a projected top-five pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft that goes this June at Rogers Arena, received all sorts of added attention from the Thunderbirds and the Royals, but has yet to lose his composure.\nsewen@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/SteveEwen\nNEXT GAME\nFriday, April 19 | Game 1\nSpokane or Everett vs. Vancouver Giants\nGame 1 of WHL Western Conference Final\n7:30 p.m., Langley Events Centre, Radio: Sportsnet 650 AM\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

{"text": "By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press\nCaptured marine mammals in a holding facility in Srednyaya Bay, dubbed as \u201cwhale prisons'\u201d near the port of Nakhodka, Russian Far East, on Jan. 13, 2019. Russian officials say that nearly 100 illegally captured whales could be returned to the wild during the summer. Russian Natural Resources Minister Dmitry Kobylkin says summer offers the most favorable conditions for release. (Whale Watching Russia via AP)\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian officials have invited a French ocean explorer to offer advice on how to safely release nearly 100 illegally captured whales, voicing hope that the animals could be let into the wild during summer.\nJean-Michel Cousteau of the Ocean Futures Society arrived Friday in Russia\u2019s Far East on a mission to inspect the mammals and help create conditions for them to be released. Cousteau, son of famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, has voiced concern about the animals\u2019 condition and offered his help to the Russian government.\nThe whales\u2019 condition has drawn international concern, and President Vladimir Putin has ordered authorities to investigate the case and release the animals. Russian prosecutors have brought criminal charges against four companies keeping the whales.\nWhales are worth a fortune on the black market, and local environmental activists suspected that they were captured for sale to amusements parks in China. Russian law only allows for the capture of whales for \u201cscientific\u201d purposes.\nRegional Gov.

Act 910 allows the governor to reduce the number of agencies reporting to him from 42 to 15. - Photo by Mitchell PE Masilun\nGov. Asa Hutchinson on Thursday signed a 2,047-page bill into law that will implement his plan to reduce the number of state agencies reporting to him from 42 to 15, effective July 1.\nThe Republican governor also announced the creation of a transition team to help with the implementation of House Bill 1763 by Rep. Andy Davis, R-Little Rock. The legislation is now Act 910, Hutchinson spokesman J.R. Davis said.\nThe transition team will be chaired by the governor's chief transformation officer Amy Fecher, who also serves as executive vice president of operations at the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. In addition to Fecher, the team has 15 members, including governor's office legislative liaison Conley Hurst, the son of Department of Arkansas Heritage Director Stacy Hurst.\nHutchinson said the transition team \"will be setting the stage for the 15 Cabinet secretaries that will be announced most likely within the next 30 days.\"\n\"The work to a large extent has been done from a legislative standpoint, but this transformation effort, the heavy lifting will begin now,\" he said at a news conference in the state Capitol. \"We are going to be committed to it. We are going to be working hard to make sure that it is successful.\n[RELATED: Complete Democrat-Gazette coverage of the Arkansas Legislature]\n\"Our objectives are better managerial control ... to make sure that we provide services to the taxpayers of Arkansas and we do it efficiently,\" Hutchinson said.\nThe governor declined to explicitly say whether he is looking at bringing new people in as Cabinet-level secretaries, after a reporter asked that question.\n\"Stay tuned,\" he said. \"Obviously, I am very, very happy with the Cabinet that I have, so I fully expect there to be an interview process and we'll look at that very closely as to who those secretaries should be. We have been careful to keep personalities out of this debate on transformation, but I don't want to limit myself as to what we are going to announce and what we are going to be able to do. I have made a commitment to make sure that we do this transformation with no new money and no new personnel and so to do that, obviously you got to utilize existing resources.\"\nAfterward, Davis said Conley Hurst was included on the transition team based on his exceptional abilities and that doesn't mean the governor has already decided to promote Stacy Hurst to a Cabinet secretary post.\nAct 910 establishes the following Cabinet-level departments: agriculture; commerce; corrections; education; energy and environment; finance and administration; health; human services; inspector general; labor and licensing; military; parks, heritage and tourism; public safety; transformation and shared services; and veteran affairs.\nAct 910 requires the Office of Personnel Management, as directed by the governor, to establish and submit the appropriate class code, grade or line-item maximum for each Cabinet-level secretary to the Legislative Council or to the Joint Budget Committee for its review before July 1.\nHutchinson has estimated that the reorganization effort could save about $15 million a year beginning in fiscal 2021, which starts July 1, 2020.\nThe reorganization represents the most sweeping overhaul of state government since 1971 when then-Gov. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat, led an initiative to meld 60 agencies into 13 departments under Act 38 of that year.\n\"This transformation is not just any transformation,\" Hutchinson said. \"It is not just a redoing of the executive branch agencies.\"\nHutchinson said the reorganization will create a new Department of Transformation and Shared Services \"which will be the first in the United States of America for state government that will have a private-sector business model that will develop in state government.\n\"It gives us the Inspector General's Office that will be a broad look at executive branch agencies in terms of savings. It will give us a new Department of Public Safety, a new Department of Commerce and on and on down the list converting 42 different departments of government down to 15,\" he said.\nHutchinson said the reorganization would place about 200 state boards and commissions in either the Department of Health or the Department of Labor and Licensing to \"give the support for what we are trying to accomplish with professional licensing and efficiencies at the same time.\"\nSenate President Pro Tempore Jim Hendren, R-Sulphur Springs, said, \"We got a little grief about why Rep. Davis was in the Senate committee so long,\" referring to the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affair Committee, where the bill was vetted for a few weeks.\n\"Well, that's because we actually read the bills,\" Hendren joked. \"We were very thorough and I am very confident that the legislation is better because of us. But it was a joint effort. The transformation team was amazing.\"\nThe Senate's amendment to the bill took the Public Service Commission out of the proposed Department of Energy and Environment to make it independent, and will allow the banking, insurance and securities departments in the proposed Department of Commerce and the Plant Board in the proposed Department of Agriculture to maintain rule-making abilities and independence from their respective Cabinet secretaries.\nThe governor's office said the other members of the 15-member transition team include:\n\u2022 Becky Anderson, Arkansas Economic Development Commission director of strategic support services.\n\u2022 Chad Brown, Office of State Procurement statewide program manager.\n\u2022 Charlie Collins, Department of Finance and Administration budget and policy manager. He is a former Republican state representative from Fayetteville.\n\u2022 Steve Goode, Tobacco Control director.\n\u2022 Solomon Graves, Department of Correction's public information and legislative liaison.\n\u2022 Jay Harton, Department of Information Systems chief operating officer.\n\u2022 Danni Hoeffer, Alcoholic Beverage Control medical marijuana attorney.\n\u2022 Alex Johnson, Arkansas Economic Development Commission director of rural services.\n\u2022 Caleb Osborne, Department of Environmental Quality associate director.\n\u2022 Steven Porch, Department of Career Education litigation attorney.\n\u2022 Ann Purvis, Department of Health deputy director for administration.\n\u2022 Mitch Rouse, Department of Environmental Quality chief of staff.\n\u2022 Phillip Warriner, Arkansas State Police human resources administrator.\n\u2022 Brooke Woodward, assistant transformation officer in the governor's office.\nMetro on 04/12/2019\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Working with animal welfare groups to help improve lives of stray cats and dogs\nBy Bejay Browne\nHotels are catering to animal-loving tourists by teaming up with animal welfare charities and launching programmes to improve the lives of stray dogs and cats.\nWith Cyprus\u2019 stray cat and dog population estimated at around 200,000 to 250,000, initiatives to keep those numbers down are clearly welcomed by animal welfare groups.\nJust last week, a couple of these more recent cat initiatives at Aphrodite Hills hotel and Columbia Beach resort were featured in the UK\u2019s Telegraph newspaper.\nPaphos-based animal charity Animal Rescue Cyprus featured in the newspaper for its cooperation with Aphrodite Hills hotel where feeding stations and a sort of \u2018cat hotel\u2019 have sprung up under the watchful eye of manager Nicholas Kittis, said the charity\u2019s Oana Bodnaras.\nAnimal Rescue Cyprus has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the resort.\n\u201cFor a long time we have trapped, neutered and returned the cats from the area. There are a lot there and they have embraced the cats. They are creating \u2018Kittis cat hotel\u2019, named after the manager, and have built special cat houses for them to sleep in, in certain areas and feeding stations as well.\u201d\nBodnaras said that children and tourists enjoy visiting the cats and that the charity hopes more hotels will follow suit.\n\u201cCyprus is a popular holiday destination, so our overall aim is that all sorts of establishments will become more and more pet friendly.\u201d\nAnimal Rescue Cyprus has also teamed up with five-star luxury hotel Almyra \u2013 the first pet friendly hotel in Paphos complete with dog park \u2013 to hold a dog adoption day in May.\nThe Almyra approached the charity to hold a double event. One is their annual dog party where the public is encouraged to bring their dogs to the hotel dog park. The second is a dog adoption day.\nBodnaras said dogs from the shelter will be special guests at the event where the public will be able to adopt them, sponsor them or other dogs at the shelter.\n\u201cThis is a great chance to find the dogs a lovely home and an important event for us, like other similar occasions, to raise awareness of the work we do and the plight of unwanted animals in Cyprus.\u201d\nThe shelter currently has around 500 dogs and puppies looking for homes as well as cats, donkeys, rabbits, horses and goats.\nAlmyra hotel manager, Radu Mitroi, told the Sunday Mail that the hotel decided to hold an adoption day as they recognise the issue of shelter dogs on the island and wanted to do something to help.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to be involved in such actions as we have to live together in synergy on the island, people and animals, side by side. We must do what we can in order to assist and make it happen,\u201d he said.\nThe hotel became dog friendly last year.\n\u201cPeople are traveling with their dogs which are part of their family, so this is an added value we wanted to provide for our guests as a unique experience. We also built a designated dog park at the hotel.\u201d\nAlmyra spoils pets with VID, a \u201cVery Important Dog\u201d service. Play dates in the dog park and a special menu for discerning dogs are all available.\nThe hotel\u2019s dog park has a designated fenced dog run area, walkways, lawns, a water station and an obstacle course and dogs can run free here. There is also room service for dogs, the menu includes five main courses and two desserts!\nAnother animal welfare charity has long been aware of how animal-loving tourists can help stray dogs and cats in Cyprus. Paphos charity, Paws, joined forces with the Aldiana hotel in Larnaca many years ago, in a bid to rehome many of the district\u2019s unwanted dogs in new homes in Germany.\nA large number of the shelter\u2019s dogs find new homes in Germany through the work of the facility\u2019s sister charity, Zypern Hunde.\n\u201cMost of the holiday makers staying at this hotel are from Germany and they let us \u2018attach\u2019 a dog as their luggage and they accompany them on the flight home back to Germany where the dogs are rehomed. The dogs need to be accompanied on the trip and the arrangement works well,\u201d shelter manager, Matthew Harris told the Sunday Mail.\nIn return, the animal charity supports the hotel with any stray dogs they encounter. Paws will take the animals to their shelter in Achelia, near Paphos airport, with the aim of finding them homes. The facility cares for around 150 abandoned, rescued and abused dogs.\nThe shelter has to rehome as many dogs as possible to keep functioning on a daily basis, said Harris. They exist solely on donations, fund-raising, sponsorship and money raised through their charity shop.\nDogs remain at the shelter for around one to three years on average before they find homes and the shelter does not euthanise any healthy dogs.\nThe second hotel to feature in the Telegraph is the Columbia Beach resort in Pissouri Bay. They started cat shelters in the hotel grounds almost a decade ago and operate the Columbia Cat Care Project (CCCP) with the main aim of neutering and vaccinating the cats, ensuring that they are well-fed and groomed.\nThe hotel blog notes that witnessing the ever-increasing number of cats on the island \u2013 with no place to formally call home \u2013 Columbia Hotels and Resorts felt inspired to do what they could to aid the cats\u2019 healthy living and also protect the environment.\nThey say that guests may support the CCCP project in a number of ways, firstly by not feeding the cats around the grounds or at any of the restaurants to help maintain their daily routine.\nGuests may also become a \u2018Godparent\u2019, take part in the name a cat programme, or officially adopt one of the project\u2019s cats, \u2018taking more than just memories of Columbia home\u2019.\nBodnaras said it would be fantastic if more hotels in Cyprus were pet friendly, undertook similar schemes and held adoption days.\n\u201cIt would be nice to see more pets accepted in shops and coffee shops, under the right circumstances.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Imlisanen Jamir\nIt has long been the government\u2019s narrative that hesitant landowners have become a major stumbling block to the growth and development of Nagaland state by refusing to part with their land.\nThe argument has been based on the incidences where such obstructionist moves by landowners have indeed crippled efforts to improve or build infrastructure in several parts of the state. However, there seemed to be a growing realization among the people, moving them to accede with land acquisition offers from the state in return for vital infrastructure.\nA recent example of this realization was witnessed with the ongoing four-lane roadworks connecting Dimapur and Kohima. While the works have been progressing at sometimes too steady a pace, administrators issued regular notices to concerned communities to collect their compensation for parting with their land.\nBut just when there seemed to be some semblance of efficiency in the process, a landowners union recently issued a statement that should serve as a caution to the government. Last week, the NH-29 Landowners\u2019 Union (NH-29 LOU) alleged that landowners not being compensated for their land and properties in view of the ongoing expansion of the highway from Purana Bazaar to Chumukedima.\nWhile making clear that they were willing to part with their land situated within the vicinity of the ongoing highway expansion, the union however said they were \u201cappalled at the government\u2019s indifferent attitudes.\u201d\nIt cited a letter to the Dimapur Revenue Officer (RO), dated May 3, 2005, where the Union Ministry of Road Transport & Highways had directed the former to a prepare detailed project report on NH-29 for land acquisition from Dimapur to Kohima.\nThe union however alleged that the road stretch from Purana Bazaar to Chumukedima was excluded \u201cfor reasons best known to the Slate government.\u201d It however suspected that the decision to exclude the said stretch from the DPR was a ploy to avoid paying a hefty compensation.\nIt must be made clear that debates over land acquisition for extractive and for-profit purposes are a completely different matter\u2014especially when there are livelihoods, ways of life and environmental factors at stake.\nWhile there has been understandable frustration resulting out of unflinching landowners, even in cases pertaining to critical infrastructure, the government must make sure that any change in attitudes should not be hindered by shoddy handling of the compensation factor.\nIt must work towards ensuring that law and regulations, procedure for land acquisition and compensation, and land valuation approaches for compensation are handled in a transparent manner. This includes relevant land governance elements such as public participation, access to information, fair compensation, transparent procedure and stakeholder co-ordination.\nComments can be sent to imlisanenjamir@gmail.com\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The number of resale homes sold in Ottawa slid in March, as tight inventories put pressure on buyers to bid on limited offerings, pushing the prices of available homes even higher.\nMarch marked the first month in 2019 where the number of resale homes sold was lower than the same month last year. According to the Ottawa Real Estate Board (OREB), agents sold a total of 1,511 homes last month, a drop of 8.6 per cent when compared to the 1,654 properties sold in March 2018.\n\u201cLack of inventory is responsible for March\u2019s deficiency in residential unit sales,\u201d said Dwight Delahunt, president of the OREB. \u201cThis tightness of supply is manifesting in significant reductions in days on market, and properties selling very quickly. In some pockets of the city, buyers are facing multiple offer situations, and properties are often selling over list price.\n\u201cThese dynamics of low inventory, reduced days on market, and multiple offers are signs of a seller\u2019s market in these areas. While a benefit to those sellers, it\u2019s stressful and time-consuming for buyers.\u201d\nNew residential listings in Ottawa were down 21 per cent in March, compared to the same month in 2018. The number of those new listings in 2019 is down 30 per cent when compared to March 2017.\nThe tightening market is forcing buyers to compete for whatever is available, pushing the price of real estate even higher. According to the OREB, the average sale price of a residential-class property sold in March in the Ottawa area was $480,143, a rise of 7.2 per cent over March 2018. The average sale price for a condominium-class property was $290,181, an increase of 5.2 per cent from this month last year.\nThe OREB said the increasing price of real estate in Ottawa isn\u2019t likely to slow down anytime soon, as demand continues to skyrocket for homes in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cIn Ottawa, we have a population base that\u2019s increasing year over year with a growth rate of 8.8 percent, which is higher than Ontario (5.7%) and Canada as a whole (5.9%). Immigration and high employment levels are bringing residents to our desirable and affordable city,\u201d said Delahunt.\n\u201cWith high demand and limited supply, prices will continue to be pushed upwards. It\u2019s a simple and fundamental economic principle. Although we appreciate the recent measures the federal government has taken towards affordable home ownership, all three levels of government need to work together at implementing mechanisms that will also restore the supply side of the market.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s federal budget introduced an incentive program that could lower mortgage payments for households making less than $120,000 per year.\nThe OREB suggested that more high quality, upscale developments are needed in the nation\u2019s capital, which would spark existing home owners to consider listing their property, creating an opportunity for \u201cmove up\u201d or first-time buyers.\nThe OREB also urged the federal government to rethink the stress test that is applied to new home buyers. The stress test affects buyers looking to finance more than 80 per cent of the home\u2019s price. Those buyers are forced to qualify for their loan using a higher interest rate than what is being offered to them, in order to ensure they can handle additional financial pressure should the economy improve.\nALSO IN THE NEWS:\nTransportation committee likes park-and-bike spots at Andrew Haydon Park\nParking was temporarily free after Lansdowne Park lot hit by ransom-seeking malware\nDoor-to-door water treatment sales company faces 112 charges under Consumer Protection Act.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "\"Elegance wasn\u2019t just a look, it was his lifestyle, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s remained an icon of style all these years later,\" Grant's daughter, Jennifer Grant, told THR of the line of optical frames and sunglasses based on her father's style.\nJennifer Grant was never interested much in any product collaborations that referenced her famous father. Of course, when your dad is bona fide icon Cary Grant, few proposals ever seem like they might reach his standards. \"Opportunities definitely have come our way, but nothing ever fit,\" Grant tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"Our attitude has always been that if we\u2019re not going to honor Dad, we\u2019re not going to do anything. We always knew that his character and his work stands for itself.\"\nThen she met Rocco Basilico, the CEO of luxury eyewear brand Oliver Peoples, who was proposing a line of optical frames and sunglasses based on the style Cary Grant wore in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1959 classic North by Northwest. \"Honestly from the first moment of the very first meeting, it felt like a fit,\" Grant says. \"There\u2019s a directness in Rocco\u2019s approach that felt like home to me. I sensed both a substance and a style, and the team was incredibly well prepared.\" Grant, whose mother is Dyan Cannon, discussed the project with her stepmother, Barbara Harris, her father's wife from 1981 until his death in 1986, and they agreed that Basilico\u2019s idea \"was a natural fit that suited the elegance and essence\" of the actor, Jennifer Grant adds.\nKnown simply as \"the Cary Grant,\" the design is available on the Oliver Peoples site as sunglasses and optical frames, in five color choices each and priced from $380 to $475. (The collection will be officially feted this week at a private dinner party in Los Angeles co-hosted by the Grant family and Oscar-winning actor Mahershala Ali). Among the offerings is a \"Grant Tortoise\" that was developed exclusively for this collection and closely resembles the style the actor famously wore as his North by Northwest character, Roger Thornhill, attempts to conceal his identity.\n\"Something wrong with your eyes?\" a ticket seller at Grand Central asks in the film.\n\"Yes, they\u2019re sensitive to questions,\" Thornhill responds.\nGrant says that she and Harris approved frame colors and closely monitored all details, which include an exact replica of Cary's \"CG\" monogram, seen on the temple tip of each pair. \"We shared some of his personal effects so all of the materials would really look like dad,\" Grant notes.\nBeyond liking the idea and feeling a comfort level with Basilico, Grant also did her homework; as this would be the first sanctioned collaboration bearing her father\u2019s name, she wasn\u2019t taking any chances, she says. In 2012, Oliver Peoples produced a limited-edition collection based on the glasses Gregory Peck wears in 1962\u2019s To Kill a Mockingbird, so Grant called Cecilia Peck, the daughter of the actor and his second wife, Veronique Passani.\n\"As though Oliver Peoples needs to be vetted, right?\" Grant says with a laugh. \"But I wanted to understand her experience. She said they were only wonderful to work with and that it had been a very successful collaboration. That told me everything I needed to know.\"\nUnlike classic-film fans who have seen her father's films dozens of times, Grant admits that watching her father\u2019s work was never a priority growing up. \"He rarely shared details about his films with me,\" she says, recalling that once when she was around 13, she stayed up to watch Bringing Up Baby, then sought him out the next morning to discuss the 1938 Howard Hawks comedy that stars Grant with Katharine Hepburn. \"I told him I saw it, and he said, 'Then you\u2019re staying up too late at night.\u2019 But he was just being a father.\"\nOne element of his career that her father did share, Grant says, was his relationship with Alfred Hitchcock, known as \"Hitch\" to his friends. \"When dad spoke about Hitch, his face would light up,\" she says. \"They shared a sort of shorthand understanding, and I think they both had gleaned some artistic truths, as though they knew the destination. They knew where they wanted to get, and they knew they needed each other to get there. They elevated each other, and that chemistry is very apparent.\"\nThough Grant appeared in four Hitchcock films \u2014 including 1941\u2019s Suspicion, 1946\u2019s Notorious and 1955\u2019s To Catch a Thief \u2014North by Northwest is perhaps the best example of that idea. \"There\u2019s something unique to North by Northwest \u2014 it\u2019s not just the blending of these two British powerhouses and the magic they had, it\u2019s also seductive and charming,\" says Grant. \"It\u2019s rare that you see intrigue and suspense and humor all at once. And then you have dad and [co-stars] Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. It\u2019s pretty dreamy.\"\nUltimately, how does Grant think her father might view this first-ever usage of his name? \"I think he would be a fan of this venture,\" she says. \"That\u2019s also because rarely in my life did I ever see dad without glasses; maybe if he was taking the sun or swimming. But he didn\u2019t like anything frivolous. He believed in quality, utility and style.\"\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what she and Harris were striving for when they signed on with Oliver Peoples: to create something that both honored and reflected Cary Grant\u2019s crisp, classic style, which only seemed effortless.\n\"He worked very hard and honed his character until he truly embodied elegance,\" Grant points out. \"And it was never a superficial charm; it was always a charm born of tenderness. Those qualities are still needed and honored. He always looked great in a suit or a tux, but what was best about him was that his outsides matched his insides. Elegance wasn\u2019t just a look, it was his lifestyle, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s remained an icon of style all these years later.\"\n", "label": "human"}

In four appearances, the left-hander has posted a 23.40 ERA, 3.40 WHIP and .444 opposing batting average.\nIn the top of 14th inning of Sunday\u2019s loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, Chen allowed a game-winning two-run home run to Jean Segura in his one inning of work.\nFinancially, Miami is in tough position since Chen is still owed $42 million over the next two seasons as part of the five-year, $80 million deal he signed with the team in 2016. If the team releases him, they would still have to pay the remainder of the contract.\nOn Monday, Marlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill said he feels confident Chen can turn things around and be an asset for the team.\n\u201c[Chen\u2019s] been a successful pitcher in the major leagues,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe know he can help us win baseball games and our job is to get him straight, get the ship righted and get him back to helping us win baseball games.\u201d\nPrior to this season, Chen made 170 career starts and just four relief appearances between his seven seasons with the Baltimore Orioles and Marlins. Last year, Chen posted a 4.71 ERA in 133 1/3 innings in a starting role. His home/road splits were extreme, notching a 1.62 home ERA and 9.27 road ERA.\nAfter recording a 9.37 ERA in five spring training appearances, Miami moved Chen to the bullpen to make room for its young starters.\nOver five relief innings, Chen has allowed multiple base-runners in each outing. His worst performance came on Apr. 9 in Cincinnati when he allowed 10 earned runs \u2014 including four home runs \u2014 on seven hits, two walks in two innings.\nChen has relied primarily on his four-seamer, which he\u2019s thrown 61.8 percent of the time. Batters are hitting .421 off the fastball, which is averaging 90.6 MPH \u2014 down from 91.1 MPH last season. Opponents have done the most damage off his slider, hitting .600 off the breaking pitch, which accounts for 15.1 percent of his pitches.\nHill said in studying the analytics, he believes there\u2019s room for improvement in Chen\u2019s outings.\n\u201cThere\u2019s areas he can focus on that will allow him to be a more successful pitcher,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to involve making some adjustments with his pitch mix and sequencing, but we feel confident it will put him in the best position to be successful.\u201d\nEntering the game for short stints, there\u2019s a much lower margin of error for relievers due to the limited innings. Following Sunday\u2019s loss, the left-hander said he needs to be more aggressive once he gets on the mound.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s too much in my head,\u201d Chen said Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve been paying too much attention of what adjustment I should make or my mechanics, but now I just want to try to do my best to execute on every pitch, so today, even though I allowed a home run, I feel much better.

Instead of the 80,000 married and registered couples that were in line to benefit from reduced taxes, it was 454,000 couples.\n\u201cDemocracy has won, but it looks like a Pyrrhic victory,\u201d the Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve continued. \u201cBy setting this precedent, the judiciary has opened a Pandora\u2019s box and we don\u2019t yet know what\u2019s going to come out of it.\u201d\nThe paper said the debate raised two fundamental issues: citizens\u2019 trust in the authorities and the margin of error that a society is willing to accept. \u201cIn a direct democracy the public is called on to vote all the time and on all sorts of issues. To do that, it has to have the arguments for and against (including the fake news that comes with it), but also figures that it can legitimately consider correct. Caught out, will the government dare try [to provide numbers] again?\u201d\n\u2018Slap in the face\u2019\nIn German-speaking Switzerland, the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (NZZ) reckoned the court verdict was above all a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for the government.\n\u201cIts significance lies primarily in the signal for the information policy of the authorities. We can expect additional caution with future estimates, a stronger emphasis on uncertainty and faster updates,\u201d it said.\nCriticism of the authorities is certainly appropriate, in the paper\u2019s view, \u201cbut many of those involved in politics should also take a look in the mirror: the deliberate misleading of citizens by parties and lobbyists is par for the course in vote campaigns.\u201d\nFor the Tages-Anzeiger and Der Bund, \u201cit would have been to the detriment of democracy if the judges in Lausanne had accepted misinformation of such magnitude with a simple shrug of the shoulders\u201d.\n\u201cThe federal administration has now been given a warning that it should have got for the vote on corporate tax reform [in 2008],\u201d the papers said. \u201cIn that case, the voting documents also contained numbers that in hindsight turned out to be completely off.\u201d\nBack then, the Federal Court rejected demands to cancel the result of the corporate tax reform vote, saying a re-run would undermine legal security.\nLe Temps in Lausanne said the court decision had a double effect.\n\u201cOn the one hand, it is imperative to abolish tax disadvantages for marriage; on the other, the public must be appropriately informed. The annulment of the 2016 vote is historic and for the government such a setback is serious. The decision will force the government and above all the federal administration to pay attention to the numbers they submit to parliament and voters,\u201d it concluded.\n\u201cThis is good for democracy.\u201d\nswissinfo.ch\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n", "label": "human"}

Here's what you need to know.\nReuters 1 Theresa May has faced calls to quit over her handling of Brexit - and may resign if her deal is passed\nWill Theresa May resign?\nJust two days before the UK was originally meant to leave the European Union, Mrs May finally pledged to step aside to win over colleagues who have previously opposed her deal.\nHer voice cracked as she told the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs: \"I know there is a desire for a new approach, new leadership, in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations \u2014 and I won't stand in the way of that.\n\"I know some people are worried that if you vote for the withdrawal agreement, I will take that as a mandate to rush into phase two without the debate we need to have.\n\"I won't \u2014 I hear what you're saying.

{"text": "I briefly touched on John Maynard Keynes\u2019s track record on investments in his personal account in the last post. I wanted to take a deeper dive into the impact margin loans had on his results.\nFor those not aware, a margin loan is borrowed money used to buy securities in an attempt to juice returns. The results can be exceptional if things go right or horrendous when things go wrong.\nWhen you borrow money against an asset, and the value of the asset falls, bad things can happen. The same is true when borrowed money is used to buy an asset like a stock, that then declines in value.\nThe main reason is due to minimum margin requirements. Lenders don\u2019t like to lose money any more than we do, so minimum margin requirements help to safeguard lenders from losses.\nBut they don\u2019t protect you from losses. In fact, it does the opposite whenever the minimum gets triggered. At that point, you\u2019re hit with a margin call and forced to cover the difference. So you either scramble to come up with more money or are forced to sell. Forced selling is the typical outcome, at what is likely a (big) loss.\nKeynes talks about being forced to sell shares because of margin calls several times. The only thing worse than selling out of fear after a sharp decline is being forced to do it. At times, Keynes was forced to take huge losses, while knowing he likely sold near the bottom too. It\u2019s like rubbing salt in the wound.\nTo give you a better idea of what he dealt with, I snapped a couple of images showing his record from 1905 to 1945. Keep in mind, this doesn\u2019t account for any money being added or removed in any given year. It just shows the change in security value and net asset value from year to year. So it\u2019s not a perfect picture of his annual returns. But I think it offers a rough idea of the type of big swings his investment strategy produced.\nA couple of quick points before moving on:\nOnce Keynes started on margin, he was hooked. Whether it was some internal need to get rich quick, I don\u2019t know, but it seems like it. He fully experienced the joys and pains that came with it.\nOver the entire period, Keynes played in the UK stock market, the US stock market, commodities, and currencies. He had no problem having half the portfolio or more in borrowed money.\nThe big hit in 1920 completely wiped him out. He was in the hole, plus owed money to friends and family shown in the footnote of Table 3. He borrowed more from friends and family to stay in the game, which took him two years to get back to even and repay everyone. And he did it the same way he lost it, by speculating mostly in currencies and commodities on margin.\nIn 1934, there was a drastic increase in the number of securities held. Don\u2019t let the numbers fool you. Keynes preferred a concentrated portfolio. Even though the total number of securities increased, a small number, roughly 3 or 4, consistently made up half his portfolio.\nHis overall results were described this way:\nThe first thing that strikes one\u2026is that he was not uniformly successful as an investor. In the 1920s, for example, in five of the seven years between 1922 and 1929 Keynes did worse than the Bankers\u2019 Magazine index. On the other hand, in the years after 1929, his investments outperformed the market in 21 of 30 accounting years and did so cumulatively by a large margin. As well, the figures indicate that he was much more likely to beat the market when it was rising. From the detailed records available, it is also clear that he was an extremely active investor\u2026 More often than not, especially after the late 1920s, the securities of a few firms would dominate Keynes\u2019s portfolio.\nThe combination of margin loans, a concentrated portfolio, and illiquid currency and commodity investments provided the boost he wanted when markets were rising. For the same reasons, he suffered more when markets fell.\nSo the question is: Is following a similar strategy worth it? I guarantee a bunch of people will gaze at the last line of the last table and say absolutely. Keynes died wealthy, so of course, it\u2019s worth it, right?\nBut the two tables are just a snapshot of the end of year results. He invested through two World Wars and a U.S. Depression that reached across the globe. Yet, his entire experience is missing. The highs and lows of any given year are missing. The daily swings, week after week, every year for forty years is missing. Which securities he owned, how much of each, the ones he was forced to sell, and other decisions he made because of all of it are missing. The same can be said for what that remotely feels like in terms we can understand.\nI can\u2019t add the daily swings Keynes put up with or what it felt like. So instead, I threw a table together showing what it would look like in today\u2019s terms, the swings in security values and total net asset value from one year to the next ( the UK inflation calculator helped do the math).\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Proper asset allocation should always involve establishing appropriate allocation constraints and carefully reviewing the results of any portfolio analysis tools that are utilized.\nRelying solely on one analytical measure, such as the Sharpe ratio, may give you an incomplete picture of the portfolio's risk or even drastically alter prudent asset allocations.\nWhile portfolio optimization can significantly reduce the riskiness of the portfolio, doing this may also steal your returns in the process.\nBackground\nPassive index fund investors, after selecting the most appropriate investment assets, must then turn their attention to the next most important factor contributing to investment returns: asset allocation. In my own portfolio, I periodically review the investments representing each individual asset class and make substitutions and/or changes as needed. However, after selecting the individual investments, I then focus on the weight that I will assign each holding.\nDuring this process, it is important to consider both the prior and expected return of each portfolio holding as well as the risk characteristics of the portfolio as a whole for each individual allocation setup. (For example, how would the return and risk of my 60% stock/40% bond portfolio change if I changed to a 40% stock/60% bond portfolio allocation?) I have found that, while analyzing these risk and return characteristics are important, prudent portfolio analysis demands that you do not rely solely on these calculations when constructing an investment portfolio.\nOptimizing Your Investment Portfolio\nI recently discovered the Portfolio Optimization tool on Silicon Cloud Technologies LLC's \"PORTFOLIO VISUALIZER\" website. Using this tool, I was able to enter my own Ivy League Endowment portfolio and manipulate the asset allocations to determine the risk and return characteristics of each variation.\nThe optimization tool also had several pre-made portfolios available, one of which caught my attention: Bogleheads Four Funds (you can find this portfolio, as well as the Bogleheads themselves, by clicking here). The asset allocations for this portfolio are shown below:\nAs you can see above, this is a broadly-invested, passive index fund portfolio consisting of U.S. equities (using Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund VTSMX as the anchor), international equities, regular bonds, and inflation-protected bonds.\nThe optimization tool offers several different options for comparing your portfolio to an optimized portfolio. In this test, I applied the option to find the \"Maximum Sharpe ratio\" to the Bogleheads' Four Fund portfolio. While the Sharpe ratio is a valuable tool and many investors rely on it to help them determine the risk vs. return characteristics of an investment, this is not the only data point that should factor into your investments decisions. To illustrate why the following graphic shows the resulting portfolio when our original asset allocations were adjusted in order to maximize the Sharpe ratio:\nThe original 50% allocation to VTSMX has been obliterated and an unreasonable and inadvisable weight of almost 90% has been assigned to VBMFX. Of course, a prudent investor would utilize the portfolio optimizer's constraint options to set minimum and maximum target weights for each asset class. However, in this example, these outrageous weights will suffice.\nThe chart below lists the resulting return and risk characteristics for the original Bogleheads Four Funds portfolio, the optimized Four Funds portfolio, as well as a third option which assigns equal weights (in this case 25% each) to the four asset classes in the original portfolio:\nThe variability of returns (listed on the chart as \"Stdev\" for standard deviation) drops over 4 percentage points by simply equally-weighting the original holdings. Also, quite dramatically, the variability of returns drops to 3.28% for the optimized portfolio (10% stock, 90% bond)!\nHowever, as is true with most investment situations, there is no such thing as a free lunch. On the next line down, we see that the expected return (ER) of the Maximum Sharpe portfolio is almost 2% below the ER of our original portfolio. If that isn't bad enough, the next line down is a perfect illustration of why financial ratios should not be followed blindly. In its best year (for the time period July 2000-March 2019), the original portfolio would have returned 28.64% while the Maximum Sharpe and Equal Weighted portfolios would have maxed at 8.25% and 20.81%, respectively. In this example, you are literally purchasing a reduction in risk by giving up almost 20% of the returns in your portfolio's best year.\nWould you be willing to trade 20% of your returns for a less-bumpy ride? Some investors would say yes. But for me and my long-term investing timeline, the answer is a resounding no!\nSummary\nWhile I have no doubt that the results provided by the portfolio optimizer are accurate, applying the Sharpe ratio optimization to the original Bogleheads Four Funds portfolio resulted in the following:\nGood: Drastically reduced the variability (standard deviation) of the portfolio's returns, making them more reliable.\nBAD: Provided an asset allocation that was inadvisable and would not meet prudent investment standards.\nBAD: Paid for the reduction in risk by giving up almost 20% of returns in the portfolio's best year.\nAs this example shows, relying on any single measure such as the Sharpe ratio may improve your returns but might also result in an asset allocation that is well outside of a prudent investor's level of comfort.

I had people putting their hands in my vagina without even introducing themselves.\u2019\nWhen I pushed the point, several of the mothers around the table became frustrated with me, saying it\u2019s \u2018not about how you feel, it\u2019s about getting a healthy baby\u2019 and telling me that I have no idea what I want because I haven\u2019t been there.\nForgive me, but isn\u2019t it a bit medieval that the options are healthy baby or retaining some control over how you give birth?\nOne woman who isn\u2019t being bullied into giving birth on anyone else\u2019s terms is the Duchess of Sussex.\nIn the last week we\u2019ve been told that she won\u2019t be doing the post birth photo shoot outside the hospital, \u00e0 la Diana and Kate, and that she\u2019s apparently passed over the traditional royal birth medical team for a female doctor, having said she doesn\u2019t want her labour run by \u2018men in suits\u2019.\nMeghan is not letting anyone tell her how she\u2019ll be giving birth \u2013 she\u2019s insisting on making her own choices, something which seems to make people extremely cross.\nThere will be no post birth photo shoot outside the hospital, \u00e0 la Diana and Kate (Photo: Anwar Hussein/Getty Images)\nI\u2019m not stupid. I, like most women, realise that labour isn\u2019t generally a fun experience. But is it really so unreasonable to expect decent treatment?\nMuch of the commentary around Meghan Markle\u2019s birth has centered on her being \u2018ungrateful\u2019 for the top tier care she has been offered, and critics have even dubbed her a \u2018brat\u2019.\nIf being a \u2018brat\u2019 is how you get full control of how you give birth, then sign me up. I\u2019m delighted to be a birth \u2018brat\u2019.\nIf you are not a birth \u2018brat\u2019, then your chances of getting the birth you want and deserve are pretty low.\nWomen are entitled to elective c-sections. They have the right to refuse induction, and to demand as much or as little pain relief as is safe to take.\nWomen should also have the right to give birth without experiencing birth rape.\nWhat is birth rape? Birth rape, or obstetric violence, is the term for when a woman is subjected to a non consensual vaginal examination during labour. The term was first used legally in Venezuela, when it was brought into legislation in 2007 to protect women giving birth. Within two years Argentina followed suit, with Mexico doing the same in 2014 \u2013 yet no such law exists in the UK. Jodie Gibbons, who experienced obstetric violence described her experience to The Sun, saying \u2018I begged the doctor to stop doing my vaginal exam, but he just ignored me. So I asked again, then again and even kicked at him to stop, but he wouldn\u2019t.\u2019\nWhat does it say about the state of birth in the UK that I\u2019m not even pregnant yet, and I\u2019m already worried about how I\u2019m going to be treated by the medical professionals who handle my labour?\nI\u2019ve already started coaching my husband on how to tell a doctor that I don\u2019t want an internal examination, and read up on my legal rights to a caesarean or to resist an induction.\nHaving someone penetrate your body without your consent is not permissible outside of the labour ward. How and why does it suddenly become acceptable when you\u2019re giving birth?\nAdvertisement\nThere is an expectation that we a woman should be so grateful to be in labour that her own comfort and bodily autonomy ceases to be a relevant concept. That expectation can absolutely go f**k itself.\nLabour is a painful, arduous and deeply sexist biological process. It is not a privilege, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to do it your own way.\nFor Meghan Markle that may mean having a female doctor and skipping the press junket afterwards. For some women it will mean a home birth, and for others a scheduled c-section.\nPlease stop laughing at women who express a desire to give birth on their own terms, whatever those terms are.\nLabouring women deserve to be treated as whole human beings, not as big sacks of baby making meat. If that makes them birth \u2018brats\u2019 then that\u2019s just fine.\nMORE: Meghan Markle \u2018shuns Queen\u2019s doctors\u2019 to avoid \u2018men in suits\u2019 delivering baby\nMORE: Meghan Markle \u2018won\u2019t pose on the steps after she\u2019s given birth\u2019\n", "label": "human"}

Marvel Studios / Disney\nAvengers: Endgame\nDirected by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo\nAnthony Russo and Joe Russo Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely Starring EVERYBODY\nEVERYBODY Classification PG; 181 minutes\nrating\nJust as in the best of comic books, there is genius, and then there is evil genius. Avengers: Endgame, the 22nd product to roll out from the Marvel Studios factory floor \u2013 a staggering achievement in corporate synergy and an everlasting testament to the persuasive power of cash-filled dump trucks over even the most pure of artistic souls \u2013 is most certainly the latter. The 181-minute epic is furiously smart and frequently witty. There are instances of indelible delight and glimpses of technical excellence. But the giant cosmic brain powering everything and everyone involved in making Endgame \u2013 that would be Walt Disney Pictures \u2013 is not using its brilliance for the betterment of art or society. The film is, in a very real way that is wholly absent of irony, as much an evil genius as its own central villain.\nFilms opening this week: The unstoppable Avengers: Endgame, plus Toronto\u2019s Hot Docs festival begins\nBefore the accusations of hyperbole and death threats start being tossed around, consider: The big baddie of Endgame, just as in the movie that preceded it, is a towering intergalactic purple warlord named Thanos (again voiced by Josh Brolin) who aims to extinguish half of all living things in order to deliver balance to the universe. Endgame, meanwhile, is a hulking, blood-thirsty beast of its own, created for the sole purpose of dominating the box office and vanquishing every other film in its wake. Thanos is presented as a mad titan, blind to the will of the little guy who wants to fight back. Endgame is just as eager to snap its fingers and make the competition disappear, but there are some crucial differences: It isn\u2019t blind, and there are few left on Earth who will fight back. Endgame knows exactly what it\u2019s doing to the culture. And we all, having followed Marvel\u2019s business strategy this far, will reward it regardless.\nStory continues below advertisement\nOpen this photo in gallery Endgame features a few moments of just-this-side-of-genuine emotion, writes Barry Hertz. Marvel Studios / Disney\nWhy the extreme cynicism? First, the film is simply not good. It is made up of many good parts, tiny moments of just-this-side-of-genuine emotion and the occasional joke that truly lands. Added together, these account for about one-fifth of Endgame\u2019s stupendously unnecessary running time. In recent interviews, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have taken pains to stress that the film is \u201cexactly as long as it needs to be.\u201d Any shorter, McFeely told Vulture, \u201cand it would have felt like we weren\u2019t honouring all the threads and franchises that are feeding into this climax.\u201d\nFeeding is an unintentionally perfect choice of words. Endgame isn\u2019t a movie in the traditional sense; it is a gaping maw intent on gobbling up the cultural conversation for the explicit purpose of fattening its belly. This crass quarterly-profit hunger isn\u2019t new to Hollywood \u2013 the entire studio system is built on such a philosophy \u2013 but the sheer scale of it is. Endgame cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make and market, relies on audiences having consumed a decade\u2019s worth of previous cinematic products with a religious fervour and has enlisted every talented performer you can think of (and a few more you haven\u2019t). But if you\u2019re going to go as unprecedentedly big as Endgame, then you best be more hugely and overwhelmingly entertaining than any blockbuster that has come before. You cannot be boring. And Endgame is, in its desperation to conquer, so very boring.\nThis is the part of the review where I would dive into the plot, but Endgame is not a story so much as it is a series of ostensibly BIG MOMENTS stitched together with sometimes sharp dialogue, sometimes engaging performances, and lots and lots of establishing shots. Disney is fully aware of the narrative landmines they\u2019ve planted here, with critics instructed multiple times by studio reps to avoid revealing almost anything about the movie. The warnings even come with a social-media-friendly hashtag: #DontSpoilTheEndGame.\nI\u2019m telling you here and now: Anyone you see using this on Twitter is not to be trusted. Not because Endgame isn\u2019t filled with \u2026 well, I suppose you could call them \u201csurprises;\u201d I prefer to call them \u201cugh, another thing,\u201d as in ugh, another thing that happens just for the sake of things happening. Characters move from one point to another and the film lumbers forward with a stubborn inelegance, compelled only by the pure physics of time itself. Yet none of this criticism matters. By contaminating the idea of merely describing what happens on screen, Disney has shielded itself in a pathetic, albeit maliciously clever, way.\nReview: Even by Marvel\u2019s own standards of mediocrity, Avengers: Infinity War fails\nTo Infinity War and beyond: All 21 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, ranked\nGame of Thrones guide: Catch up on Season 8 episode reviews\nOpen this photo in gallery The remaining heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are left to take a stand against Thanos in the wake of Infinity War's dramatic climax. Marvel Studios / Disney\nAnd I\u2019ll play along with the studio\u2019s game, because I\u2019ve seen what happens when writers defy corporate orders, and I\u2019m not remotely that brave. So, the bare-bones basics, which I\u2019m only writing about after consulting with the imaginary Disney PR rep who lives in my head: After Thanos wiped out 50 per cent of all life back in Infinity War, it\u2019s up to what\u2019s left of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes \u2013 Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and oh God, I\u2019m not going to go through the rest, you already know them all \u2013 to take a stand. How they decide to do so is, at least in the film\u2019s middle hour, clever. It is here that co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo are clearly enjoying themselves and letting their imaginations run wild. For a blissful 45 minutes, the movie turns into a reimagining of the entire foundations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as if the Russos were allowed to travel back in history and build a franchise that placed a priority on artistic vision, not marketing planks.\nCrucially, it is also at this point that Endgame feels, more than any other Marvel movie with the exception of Taika Waititi\u2019s untouchably entertaining Thor: Ragnarok, in tune with the delirious and wackadoo sensibilities of the comic books from which it sprang. Scenes speed along with a zippy momentum, and characters engineered to be staidly predictable are thrown for giant loops. Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth and even a small handful of superheroes who aren\u2019t men or talking raccoons (but only a few, and only in moments that are explicitly tokenized in a way that makes Captain Marvel seem enlightened) seem to be truly engaged with the material. It is, basically, damn fun.\nBut then one [redacted character] does [redacted verb], and then [another redacted character] shows up to [redacted verb], and the entire endeavour loses any sense of emotional stakes or general meaning beyond the deliverance of crass fan service and incomprehensible visuals. (For all the many millions of dollars and presumably billions of man-hours poured into it, Endgame is remarkably ugly to look at.) So even if I could muster the strength to defy studio marching orders on plot details, there is no point. There is little in Endgame that is worth spoiling, given how its core is spoiled rotten to begin with.\nStory continues below advertisement\nWell, okay, here\u2019s one: At the very beginning of the film, and its very end, Thanos (looking even more like a roided-out Shrek than in Infinity War) tells his foes that all their many struggles are for nothing: \u201cI am,\u201d he says, \u201cinevitable.\u201d It is the sort of evil-genius mentality that any right-minded hero cannot help but push back against with all their superstrength. Yet here, again, the film feels more closely aligned to its enemy than its heroes. The success, the pure cultural steamrolling of Avengers: Endgame, is inevitable. But it is a battle worth fighting.\nAvengers: Endgame opens April 25.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Dr. Asangba Tz\u00fcdir\nKonyak women ignites the real spirit of Hornbill festival\nMarking the end of the three-day celebration of the Aoleang-cum Mini Hornbill Festival which was celebrated under the theme \u2018Empowering Women for Cultural Heritage, around 5000 women from the Konyak community adorned in their colourful traditional attires performed a traditional dance in an attempt to enter the Guinness World Record. Such a record attempt which is said to have been on the cards since the year 2016 finally materialised on April 5 after perfecting the dance for close to a month.\nThe synchronised 5 minute dance which invoked blessings upon the community, people, fields and crops and their natural surroundings saw the coming together of women from 11 wards in Mon town representing more than 115 Konyak villages in Mon district with the message of solidarity and unity to the Nagas and to the world.\nStarting in the year 2000 coinciding with the Statehood Day, Nagaland Government desirous of promoting tourism embarked upon an ambitious project called the \u2018Hornbill Festival\u2019 tagged as the \u2018festival of festivals\u2019 to exploit the \u2018cultural heritage.\u2019 While the loss incurred over the years is huge (NPCC, who filed an RTI, disclosed that the public exchequer incurred a loss of Rs. 11 crore, 87 lakhs and 99 thousand during the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014), a misrepresented \u2018Naga image\u2019 is portrayed to the world. To suit the changing times and tastes, the cultural shows and the various events comes with a blend of tradition and a \u201cwestoxified\u201d modern.\u2019 Within this blending, a new understanding of \u2018Naga Culture and lifestyle\u2019 is presented to the outside world through \u2018texts\u2019 and \u2018images.\u2019 Further, the Hornbill festival has opened a window to the commercially escapist world of Naga culture which finds tilted towards \u2018deceptive style\u2019 and opportunistic capitalism including \u2018commodification\u2019 of humans. In this process, the Naga cultural \u2018narrative\u2019 gets fitted into the \u2018hornbill narrative\u2019, which is nowhere close to being considered as a marker of Naga cultural identity, and thereby a \u2018misrepresented real\u2019 is produced through the material display, so do the captured images for \u2018pleasurable consumption\u2019 of the \u2018others\u2019 which is more often used to reinforce stereotypes. More painful is the experience of not being able to place the Naga cultural past in context. Thus, the hornbill festival in its present avatar, does not serve as an imagery to reawaken their \u2018forgotten past\u2019 or \u2018unknown past,\u2019 more so the cultural heritage and value system.\nWithin this strain, the World record attempt dance goes much more beyond setting the record which is mostly for the books. In so doing, it has not only reawakened the traditional cultural heritage but the uniqueness, the beauty and the aesthetic and the moral values of Naga Culture. For once our Konyak women have given the right message to the Nagas and to the World about the Naga cultural heritage, the feeling of oneness, solidarity and unity. For sure, this exemplary dance will be the beginning of many good things to come for Konyaks and for the Nagas in general to set many \u2018undesirable\u2019 things in the right perspective.\nThe dance uncontaminated by popular culture, music and entertainment, has given birth to the true meaning and essence, and the spirit of Hornbill festival, and for which our Konyak women truly deserves to be called \u2018Ambassadors\u2019 of Culture and Champions of Unity.\nWith this record attempt dance and for the message it brings for the Nagas, Hornbill Festival has gone to Mon from Kisama and the real spirit of Hornbill is born there.\n(Dr. Asangba Tzudir contributes a weekly guest editorial to The Morung Express.

{"text": "Twitch has temporarily banned a Lithuanian streamer after she cosplayed the Apex Legends character Lifeline using blackface makeup.\nOver the weekend, Karina \u201cKarupups\u201d Martsinkevich was streaming herself preparing her Lifeline cosplay in Twitch\u2019s \u201cJust Chatting\u201d section to roughly 160 viewers. Martsinkevich, who had dyed her hair and put on a white shirt and surgical mask, then applied a dark foundation to her face to mimic Lifeline\u2019s appearance.\n\u201cOn my stream, I wanted to show the viewers, how hard is to prepare for a cosplay, how much time the make up, costume and another details can take,\u201d Martsinkevich said in an email to Kotaku.\nKarupups\u2019 image of herself cosplaying as Apex Legends\u2019 Lifeline (Photo: Karupups\u2019 VK page)\nThe final result of Martsinkevich\u2019s cosplay is what\u2019s commonly recognised as blackface\u2014when a non-black person attempts to caricature or present as a black person. It originated in the 1800s when white actors used shoe polish or burnt cork, sometimes on top of highlighting their lips or other features, to perform exaggerated and racist stereotypes of black people.\nMartsinkevich\u2019s stream was taken down before she could finish her cosplay preparation in what constitutes a direct denouncement of blackface on Twitch.\nAfter announcing her apparently 30-day suspension, Martsinkevich posted a YouTube video in which she explained that she was banned for \u201cengaging in hateful conduct against a person or group of people.\u201d She went on to contend that she \u201cjust wanted to be similar to Lifeline from Apex ... it wasn\u2019t meant to have [sic] a joke of anyone. It was just a cosplay, guys, for my favourite legend from a computer game.\u201d\nThe Twitch streamer says that she didn\u2019t mean for her cosplay \u201cto be painful for anyone\u201d and apologised to those who were hurt.\nTwitch did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn the cosplay community, blackface is extremely controversial and widely looked down on. White cosplayers of brown or black characters like Overwatch\u2019s Sombra and Michonne from The Walking Dead have been lambasted for the practice.\nWhile aesthetic fidelity can be a primary concern for cosplayers, altering racial appearance easily devolves into stereotyping and recalls the history of the practice. On top of that, black cosplayers have faced numerous barriers getting into the cosplay scene because, traditionally, there are comparatively few characters in video games, comics and anime who appear black or dark-skinned.\nAccording to several black cosplayers interviewed by Kotaku in 2016, they sometimes receive pushback and criticism for dressing up as characters who are not black.\nAfter her ban, Martsinkevich again posted the picture of herself in the cosplay on the Russian social media app VK. She added the caption, \u201cThank you for the enormous support. Thank you for not leaving me alone in such a situation.

Nearly 40 bicycles, more than 100 helmets and everything else needed to make the Bike Rodeos happen were gone in an instant.

Notre-Dame has always felt to me like a huge cat hunched on her island at the heart of the capital, watching over the whole city, her two bell towers like ears attentively pricked, her spire a stiffened tail\u2026\nStory continues below advertisement\nOr like a wonderful old grandmother whom you don\u2019t visit often, whom indeed you sometimes neglect but continue to love deeply. Some of her kids and grandkids have moved far away, forgotten all about her long history and rejected her values, but when she has a heart attack and they almost lose her, they realize how deeply they care for her and how much they count on her always being there. Rallying at her bedside, they look at each other and realize, hey, aren\u2019t we a wonderful family?\nThough a non-believer and indeed fairly averse to organized religion, I regularly enter churches, mosques and temples all over the world, valuing them as places set aside for sacredness, quietness, celebration, meditation, prayer, music. We\u2019re all creatures of symbol and story. We all tell ourselves tales about the cities we inhabit, stitch their monuments into our memories and make them part of us, no matter how much or how little we know about their real histories. Even the eyes and hearts of non-believers can cherish the grace of flying buttresses, Gothic portals, marble statues, rose windows, twisting staircases\u2026\nBut then the French President gets on the radio to say that rebuilding the cathedral is France\u2019s \u201cprofound destiny,\u201d whatever that might mean (\u201cHe needs the far-right votes next month,\u201d my son tells me), and on TV he announces (to the dismay of many in the know) that reconstruction will be completed in five years (just in time for the 2024 Olympic Games). And my heartbreak is swept away by a series of tales I want nothing to do with \u2013 tales of politicians, intellectuals, medieval historians, city officials, Catholics running off at the mouth about \u201cmiracles\u201d and \u201cwarnings,\u201d and I just want to shut off all the radios and TVs and go down to the Seine and walk around the cathedral from a distance and marvel at the trees at its side, whose fragile pink blossoms survived the raging flames.\nBut because I\u2019m a writer, because I\u2019m a foreigner, because my specialty is trying to put myself in the places of people who aren\u2019t like me, I try to be attentive to what I\u2019m not seeing, what I\u2019m not being told, what is not being shoved into my face but (on the contrary) swept under the carpet. I never forget, for instance, how privileged I am to live near enough to the Seine to be able to walk along its beautiful banks. I happen to be one of the two million Parisians who live in Paris proper. What does Notre-Dame mean to the five million Parisians who live beyond the ring road? Come to think of it, didn\u2019t see many non-Caucasian faces on the esplanade on Monday evening. Don\u2019t see many on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 any day of any week, except in lineups at the Pr\u00e9fecture de Police around the corner from the cathedral \u2013 immigrants (such as myself, for many years) hoping to get a permis de s\u00e9jour. And I can\u2019t help noticing that the world was far less upset about the timeless, irreplaceable artifacts destroyed due to the American invasion of Iraq.\nIt seems that since the fire, Victor Hugo\u2019s The Hunchback of Notre-Dame has suddenly climbed back onto the bestseller list. All profits will go to reconstruction, its publisher has promised. The novel had a huge impact when it first came out in the early 1830s \u2013 so huge, in fact, that it led to major additions being made to the cathedral in the 1840s, including Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s stunning spire.\nIt\u2019s a novel about outcasts. Quasimodo the hunchback, Esmeralda the little Gypsy girl, with her white goat, and especially the Court of Miracles, \u201cthe usual refuge of all those wretches who came to conceal in this corner of Paris, sombre, dirty, muddy, and tortuous, their pretended infirmities and their criminal pollution.\u201d Jesus, too (without whom, presumably, there would be no Catholic Church, and thus no Notre-Dame de Paris), always identified with the poor, the downtrodden, the hungry, the ill, the outcast. Today, central Paris has been cleaned up and the Court of Miracles has moved out into the banlieues. Are any of France\u2019s living novelists capable of making the fate of the new Mis\u00e9rables seem relevant to the rich?\nBut to return to the fire. The salamander, emblem of Francis I, who ruled over France in the early part of the 16th century, was believed to live in fire. Over the coming months and years, we might do well to remember its motto: Nutrisco y extinguo \u2013 feed the good fire and extinguish the bad.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Officers from Nottingham's Prostitution Task Force shared best practice and advice with overseas officers from Holland.\nThe task force welcomed partners from Assen - a city and municipality in the north east of Holland.\nAssen's municipality has recently drafted a new policy in relation to unregulated sex work in their city, particularly in relation to residential properties being used as brothels, and wanted to see how our team in Nottingham deal with brothels and the issues relating to them.\nOver the last few months the task force has been in e-mail contact with law enforcement officers and policy makers from Assen and this latest visit, hosted on Monday and Tuesday last week, was arranged as part of a broader, ongoing project.\nThe task force, which has been running since 2004, is made up of one sergeant, two police constables and a PCSO. Their aim is to crack down on the associated anti-social behaviour caused by sex work in the area, as well as safeguarding the sex workers and supporting them with the help of other agencies.\nSergeant Paul Whitehead, from the task force, said: \"It was a real privilege to be able to help and advise officers from overseas in how to implement their new way of working in Assen.\n\"Martin, their enforcement officer, followed our team's activities over two full evening shifts. We attended seven brothel premises with him and also took him to the Arboretum area on both evenings to give him an insight into the on-street sex trade here in Nottingham.\n\"This kind of visit makes me extremely proud of what the team has achieved over the last two years while I have been the supervisor, given that other countries have heard about our work and best practice and want to visit us.\"\nHe added: \"The day after our Dutch friends had visited, we welcomed officers from Bedfordshire Police to the team. They were interested in our work following a discussion at this year\u2019s NPCC conference in January and wanted to look at the work we do around on-street sex work and prostitution.\"\nJohn Killick, the Bedfordshire Police sergeant visiting the team, said: \"There's a lot to be discussed back in Luton and a lot of very good points to take back to our bosses. It was a great insight into the work of the team and the thoughts and feelings it has around the on and off-street sex trade.\"\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "I finished Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice earlier this week and had a fantastic time learning its combat and tackling challenging bosses. I\u2019m eager to play more and if I want to, I could start right over with New Game Plus.\nTaking that plunge, however, has me wondering about the experience I\u2019ll have. If the joy of Sekiro comes from overcoming challenges, will I have the same satisfaction now that I know what lays in store?\nSekiro\u2019s one of the best games I\u2019ve played in a long time, each new pathway revealing interesting secrets or leading me toward exciting swordfights. Even though I chimed in on the comments of my Kotaku colleague Joshua Rivera\u2019s article yesterday about easy modes to say that I think it would be fine for Sekiro to have one, it\u2019s also the case that, for me personally, the appeal of a FromSoftware game has always come from stumbling against difficult challenges and eventually overcoming them.\nI clashed against the final boss for a little over a day before I finally beat it. I even streamed some of my attempts live on Kotaku\u2019s Twitch channel. When I finally overcame the challenge and finished the game, the feeling was euphoric. So euphoric that I can\u2019t wait to play again. But as I sat down at the sculptor\u2019s idol in the Dilapidated Temple, I paused.\nThis is partly because there are still some lingering tasks left for me in the world. My initial playthrough was comprehensive\u2014I got the somewhat hidden \u201cReturn\u201d ending\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing left for me to wrap up. I still need to talk with Hanbei again and put an end to his story. There are a handful of items and upgrades that I could buy and carry into my new playthrough. And although I already took down a majority of the bosses, I know there are some rogue Headless and mini-bosses out there in the world that I could hunt down.\nIt might be nice to head into a new playthrough only after gathering some of their prayer beads and upgrading my stats, even if FromSoft\u2019s New Game Plus experience scales enemies to keep things difficult.\nStill, as I sit here, looking at the game on my TV, I keep thinking about what made Sekiro and, by extension, all FromSoftware games appealing to me. There\u2019s some lightning that I can\u2019t put back into the bottle\u2014the excitement of discovering the game\u2019s challenges for the very first time. Part of what I really loved about Sekiro was learning to grasp its combat system.\nIt\u2019s not too complicated, especially now that I understand it, but in my first time playing through the game, I experienced the satisfying process of going from newbie shinobi to veritable parry-queen. That learning experience is part of what made Sekiro so intoxicating to me. Going into a new game having already flexed those muscles means that a certain degree of challenge will be gone, as will the learning experience I loved from before.\nI\u2019m excited to tackle old challenges with the benefit of my improved skill, but it definitely won\u2019t be the same.\nI\u2019ll also have greater knowledge of the world\u2019s layout and won\u2019t get to enjoy the process of getting lost and stumbling into new surprises. I\u2019ll be able to explore more confidently, and Sekiro\u2019s world has enough branching paths that I won\u2019t completely recreate my journey from before.\nStill, though, I won\u2019t be as surprised by vistas or baffled by new enemies. Once you know a thing, some of the initial magic is lost. And while I am sure I\u2019ll still love playing Sekiro, it\u2019s definitely going to lose some of that mysterious lustre.\nAll that said, I\u2019ll almost certainly start my second playthrough this week, but I can\u2019t help but notice my hesitation to hit the X button on my controller and simply go for it. Sekiro\u2019s different now.\nIn a game built around learning and exploration, having knowledge radically alters the experience. Still fun, still sure to challenge me from time to time, but different. That\u2019s fine, but maybe I\u2019ll take a little break before starting things up again.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 Charles Van Doren, the dashing young academic whose meteoric rise and fall as a corrupt game show contestant in the 1950s inspired the movie Quiz Show and served as a cautionary tale about the staged competitions of early television, has died. He was 93.\nHe died of natural causes Tuesday at a care centre for the elderly in Canaan, Conn., said his son, John Van Doren. Funeral services will be private.\nThe handsome scion of a prominent literary family, Van Doren was the central figure in the TV game show scandals of the late 1950s and eventually pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to a grand jury that investigated them. He spent the following decades largely out of the public eye.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard to get away, partly because the man who cheated on \u2019Twenty-One\u2019 is still part of me,\u201d he wrote in a 2008 New Yorker essay, his first public comment in years.\nBefore his downfall, he was a ratings sensation. He made 14 electrifying appearances on Twenty-One in late 1956 and early \u201957, vanquishing 13 competitors and winning a then-record US$129,000. NBC hired him as a commentator.\nIn a February 1957 cover story on Van Doren, Time magazine marvelled at the \u201cfascinating, suspense-taut spectacle of his highly trained mind at work.\u201d\n\u201cJust by being himself,\u201d Time wrote, \u201che has enabled a giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol \u2014 of all things, an egghead.\u201d\nLater, as the triumph unraveled into scandal, he initially denied he had been given advance answers, but he finally admitted that the show was rigged.\nHe retreated to his family\u2019s home in rural West Cornwall, Connecticut, after telling a congressional committee in 1959 that he was coached before each segment of the show.\nAfter spending much of the 1960s and \u201970s in Chicago, Van Doren and his wife, Geraldine, returned to Connecticut, residing for years in a small brown bungalow on the family compound. They did some teaching but largely lived in semi-seclusion, refusing to grant interviews and even leaving the country for several weeks when Robert Redford\u2019s film Quiz Show was released in the fall of 1994.\nVan Doren refused to co-operate in the movie\u2019s making and declined to meet with actor Ralph Fiennes, who portrayed him in the film. Fiennes later told People magazine that after Van Doren brushed him off, he knocked on his door pretending to be lost so he could observe Van Doren\u2019s movements and speech patterns.\nVan Doren broke his silence in 2008, writing an account of his downfall in The New Yorker and how he finally had publicly admitted a half-century earlier that he was \u201cfoolish, naive, prideful and avaricious.\u201d\n\u201cPeople who knew the entertainment business didn\u2019t have much doubt about what was going on, although they didn\u2019t speak out,\u201d he wrote.\nIn light of the large profits the rigged game shows were making, he added, \u201cwhy would they?\u201d\nHe also disclosed that he eventually did watch Quiz Show and laughed at an insulting reference that a character made about him. He said he had been tempted to take a consulting fee from the producers, but his wife talked him out of it.\nVan Doren\u2019s family had a proud literary standing at the time of the scandal. His father, Mark Van Doren, was a critic, biographer and poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940. His uncle, Carl Van Doren, received a Pulitzer in 1939 for a biography of Benjamin Franklin.\nCharles Van Doren was himself a rising young academic at Columbia when he became famous on the quiz show. He went on to win $129,000 on the show after defeating Herbert Stempel, a New Yorker portrayed by John Turturro in the movie.\nStempel later went public and said contestants were fed the answers to the questions prior to the show. He said he was told to lose because the show\u2019s producers thought Van Doren had star potential.\nIn 1962, Van Doren and nine other winners from three NBC shows \u2014 Twenty-One, Tic-Tac-Dough and Hi-Lo \u2014 pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury that had investigated the scandal. They were spared jail terms by a judge who said the nation\u2019s scorn was punishment enough.\nAfter the scandal broke, Van Doren lost the $50,000-a-year job NBC gave him when he defeated Stempel. He also was dropped from the faculty at Columbia, where his father had been a professor for decades.\nFriends said Van Doren\u2019s family was shocked by his eventual revelation that he had been given the answers in advance.\nBucky Whitney, a longtime friend, recalled the family\u2019s shame.\n\u201cHis father took it real hard. The old man was never the same after that,\u201d Whitney told a reporter who visited Cornwall when Quiz Show came out.\nVan Doren later joined the Institute for Philosophical Research, a non-profit Chicago think-tank , and worked at Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years. Among his books were The Idea of Progress, a philosophical work, and A History of Knowledge; Past, Present, and Future.\nVan Doren and his wife had two children, Elizabeth and John.\n\u201cHe was a loving husband and a terrific father, and he\u2019s going to be deeply missed,\u201d John Van Doren said.\nIn West Cornwall, neighbours were protective of \u201cCharley,\u201d as Van Doren was affectionately known.\nWalter DeTheir, the proprietor of a store in Cornwall, said Van Doren was a quiet, shy man who came in regularly to pick up the Sunday New York Times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t friendly, he just doesn\u2019t have much to say,\u201d DeTheir said.\nIn his New Yorker piece, Van Doren said he liked to avoid \u201cpeople who say, \u2019Aren\u2019t you Charles Van Doren?\u2019 Well, that\u2019s my name, I say to myself, but I\u2019m not who you think I am \u2014 or, at least, I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "With veganism reaching peak popularity this year, many retailers and fast food chains have been rapidly launching their own respective vegan offerings, from meatless substitutes in the frozen section to vegan burgers making their way onto restaurant menus. So it might come as a shock that one of, if not the largest fast food restaurant, McDonald\u2019s, has yet to add a vegan burger to its menu nationwide. But one Change.org online petition is pleading to change that.\nTitled \u201cIt\u2019s Time For A Healthy, Meatless Option (Please!),\u201d author Kathy Freston started the petition seemingly five years ago, but it seems to have resurfaced recently, particularly following news of Burger King\u2019s new vegan Whopper.\n\u201cWith this petition I\u2019m hoping to bring a positive change to America with a mainstream meatless option at McDonald\u2019s!\u201d writes Feston, a healthy living advocate who has appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Oz and more. \u201cAdding plant-based protein options at McDonald\u2019s will appeal to workers out for a quick lunch, families with health-conscious members out to dinner, children on field trips, and anyone looking for something different than the current menu at McDonald\u2019s where even the french fries contain beef flavoring (they don\u2019t in Europe, incidentally)!\u201d\nSo far, the petition has garnered nearly 165,000 signatures, with a goal of reaching 200,000.\nIt\u2019s honestly perplexing that McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t added a vegan burger to its menu, especially since the vegan-friendly offering became a permanent menu item in Sweden and Finland back in 2017. So what\u2019s the hold up?\nFreston told Food & Wine via email that consumers are \u201ctired of being handed old-school choices\u201d and want cleaner options. \u201cOur knowledge of what goes into meat is evolving, and thus our tastes are changing along with that,\u201d she says.\nBurger King isn\u2019t the only fast food restaurant to feature permanent meatless menu items. White Castle began offering vegan Impossible Burgers in September, and Del Taco recently announced it\u2019ll begin using Beyond Meat crumbles at its restaurants nationwide, starting April 25.

{"text": "In this July 14, 2018 file photo, President Donald Trump waves to protesters while playing golf at Turnberry golf club, in Turnberry, Scotland. Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds on and around the golf course are the subject of a new book by former sports columnist Rick Reilly, called \u201cCommander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump.\u201d Reilly documents dozens of examples of exaggerations and underhanded play by the president. Reilly tells The Associated Press there have been \u201cdozens and dozens of people that can declare him guilty of cheating.\u201d\nColluding with Russia? The special counsel says no. Cheating at golf? Well, that's something else.\nFrom pulling a fast one on Tiger Woods to exaggerating his handicap, Donald Trump's alleged misdeeds on and around the golf course are the subject of a new book by former Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly, \"Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump.\" Reilly documents dozens of examples of underhanded golf behavior by the president, cheating he says has become legendary among golfers.\n\"In golf, he's definitely not exonerated,\" Reilly told The Associated Press. \"There's been dozens and dozens of people that can declare him guilty of cheating.\"\nOne infamous instance came in a 2017 round with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, who is the current No. 1 player in the world. The president's playing partner, Fox Sports golf analyst Brad Faxon, reported that Trump's transgressions included putting down a score that didn't account for two balls he hit into the water on one hole.\n\"You've heard so much about it, it's almost like you want to witness it so you can tell the stories,\" Faxon is quoted as saying.\nOutside of formal tournaments, golf is a game of honor in which individual players act as their own referees, keep their own scores and assess themselves penalties for rule violations. Trump's cheating, Reilly said, motivated him to write the book.\nSays Reilly: \"I don't know much about politics, but I know golf and it really offended me, not as a voter or as a citizen \u2014 just as a golfer.\"\nReilly quotes players who accuse Trump, his caddie and Secret Service agents of regularly moving his golf balls out of difficult lies. At Winged Foot Golf Club in New York, the only non-Trump property where the president is a member, Reilly writes, \"The caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him: 'Pele.'\" That's the world soccer star from Brazil.\nSports announcer Mike Tirico says Trump once threw Tirico's golf ball off the green into a nearby bunker when they played together.\nSome of the allegations aren't new. Boxer Oscar De La Hoya told the AP in 2016 that Trump cheated against him twice in the space of two holes. \"Yes, I caught him,\" De La Hoya said. \"It was unbelievable. But I guess it was his course, so it was his rules.\"\nTrump, by all accounts, is a good golfer, especially for his age, Reilly writes. But the 2.8-stroke handicap he claims is the product of manipulation. A handicap is based on a golfer's most recent 20 scores and allows players of different skill levels to compete fairly against each other. Someone with Trump's handicap typically would shoot scores about three over par. Despite making more than 150 visits to his golf courses since taking office, Trump has logged only one round in the online USGA Handicap Index \u2014 and a 96 at that.\nTrump's love of playing belies his past criticism of President Barack Obama's regular play and his own campaign declaration that he'd be so busy in the White House, \"I'm not going to have time to go play golf.\"\n\"It helps to know golf, because golf explains Trump,\" Reilly says. The president peppers his public statements with golf metaphors, tweeting in December about the Federal Reserve, \"The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!\"\nAnd Reilly contends Trump's early days on the course provide a window into his zero-sum world-view.\nTrump honed his game at Cobbs Creek, a public course outside of Philadelphia, which he later described as full of \"hustlers\" and where he \"learned about everything.\" Reilly describes it as the sort of course where \"everybody is trying to grift you,\" and where Trump learned \"I got to cheat them before they cheat me.\"\nBryan Marsal, the chair of the 2020 U.S. Open to be played at Winged Foot, told Reilly that Trump began one game with him as a partner by warning: \"You see those two guys? They cheat. See me? I cheat. And I expect you to cheat because we're going to beat those two guys today.\"\nTrump is hardly the first president accused of bending the rules at golf. Bill Clinton was infamous for his \"Billigans\" \u2014 taking do-over shots openly and without remorse. But Reilly, who's known Trump for decades and played with him for his book \"Who's Your Caddy?\" recounts Trump's score-altering and other schemes as \"so brazen you almost admire it.\"\nReilly, clearly no fan of the president, said he undertook the project because of Trump's \"whopper\" \u2014 repeated over the course of the campaign and in the White House \u2014 that he won 18 club championships.\nReilly could not corroborate a single Trump victory in a club championship, and found the president's tally includes at least one in which Trump never played on the course that day, another in which he counted the inaugural round at a yet-to-be-opened club, and 12 that were \"actually senior or super senior club championships.\"\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nReilly said he's issuing Trump a challenge to defend his reputation in a match on a course that he doesn't own refereed by officials \u2014 offering $100,000 to the charity of the president's choice. Reilly, whose handicap is a 4.8, says he's confident Trump \"can't cover that 2.8. No way.\"\n___\nAP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson contributed.\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "label": "human"}

Little introduces us to Jordan at two points in her life: the past, when she was still an optimistic but slightly dorky youth portrayed by Marsai Martin, and the present, where she\u2019s become an abusive bully as a result of having been picked on as a child.\nAfter being humiliated in front of the entire school in a flashback, Jordan commits herself to being as mean as she possibly can to everyone she meets in order to make sure they don\u2019t hurt her first.\nBecause she\u2019s brilliant and her talents as a boss (it\u2019s never really explained what her company produces aside from ill-defined \u201capps\u201d) are undeniable, she\u2019s risen through the ranks in her field. And all of her employees begrudgingly accept that their boss is a walking, talking HR complaint with an impeccable wardrobe.\nThe only real friends Jordan\u2019s got come in the form of her harried assistant April (Issa Rae) and HomeGirl (Tracee Ellis Ross), a HomePod/Alexa-like smart-home assistant Jordan invented.\nAs lonely as it is at the top, Jordan isn\u2019t particularly pressed with changing her ways because being a bully\u2019s largely paid off for her.\nShe\u2019s got basically everything she wants and Little wants you to understand that she\u2019d be perfectly fine if a little girl\u2019s magical curse never transformed her into a child.\nLittle isn\u2019t really a movie about Jordan learning all that much about herself, but rather about realising truths about the people around her.\nLittle isn\u2019t without its fair share of scenes that\u2019ll make you chuckle, but like so many films these days, it suffers from most of its best moments all having been crammed into trailers you\u2019ve already seen.\nIf, somehow, you manage to walk into a theatre having seen nothing of the movie, its humour\u2019s likely to be more than enough to carry you through the predictable plot, but if that\u2019s not the case, you\u2019ll find yourself perhaps smiling, but not outright laughing.\nIf you have seen the trailer, then you more or less know how the film plays out. Jordan runs afoul of a girl who seemingly has actual magical abilities, and wakes up one morning as a young girl again.\nThough April\u2019s willing to help her hide her secret as long as possible, child protective services make it clear that the young Jordan\u2019s got to be enrolled in school and, unsurprisingly, she has a difficult time fitting in.\nBeing forced to go back to the same school where she endured so many years of teasing and torment for being different puts Jordan into a position of vulnerability she\u2019s spent so much time trying to avoid, and emphasises the idea that the issues kids deal with aren\u2019t necessarily \u201ceasier\u201d than the ones adults deal with, they\u2019re just different.\nClapping back at a bratty child whose crowning achievement is making it into middle school is easy enough, but it doesn\u2019t really matter if said brat still has the ability to turn you into a social pariah in the place where you\u2019re forced to spend the bulk of your time.\nWhat Jordan comes to learn is that no matter how hard she tries to exert her will over her situation, the thing she\u2019s meant to come away understanding is that sometimes, the only thing you\u2019ve really got control over is yourself and that\u2019s what you have to hold on to.\nWhile Hall and Martin\u2019s performances as Jordan are both sharp and chuckle-worthy (save for one very distasteful transphobic joke casually dropped to emphasise how much of an arsehole adult Jordan is), there\u2019s a subtle unevenness between their deliveries that breaks the illusion of them being the same person.\nDifferent as Martin\u2019s energy is from Hall\u2019s, she\u2019s able to channel the swagger of an adult power player from scene to scene, but also telegraph the moments when a particular slight\u2019s cut Jordan deeper than she expected. Little also makes the solid decision of never letting Jordan fall into the trap of becoming too close with the kid friends she makes or forgetting that she\u2019s definitely still a grown arse woman.\nThough the experience certainly humbles her, she never loses sight of her desire to get back to living her adult life.\nApril feels like a character plucked from the background of Rae\u2019s HBO show Insecure, which is to say that she\u2019s charming and has excellent on-screen chemistry with literally everyone as she gets wrapped up in the wildness of her boss\u2019 magical transformation.\nThough she\u2019s sympathetic to Jordan\u2019s predicament, April also sees it as an opportunity to push for her own professional advancement during Jordan\u2019s leave of absence from the office, while Jordan can only see it as the end of the world.\nAfter years of building herself up big and strong, Jordan\u2019s right back where she started, and confident as she is, she can\u2019t help but fear that she\u2019s going to be stuck as a child forever.\nThe great thing about getting older is being able to look back on your younger self and knowing that you\u2019ve overcome whatever obstacles might have given you trouble in the past, but Little isn\u2019t about Jordan relearning this fact after becoming a kid again.\nIt\u2019s really just a straightforward story about how she comes to appreciate how much good she can do in the world by not following her own bullies\u2019 examples, and letting people shine when their moment arrives.\n", "label": "human"}

Every bit of blame for the Metro LRT mess and the endless negative aspects of other LRT lines falls squarely on the shoulders of Iveson and city councillors.\nWhy was it decided that a program Thales said had never been used before was the one the city elected to use? Why did the city make changes? What made council so confident that they ignored the warnings from Thales?\nIf Thales had such a bad reputation, why did council give the project to them? What kind of due diligence was done?\nTaxpayers will pay the millions to correct this boondoggle. Let this serve as a warning for continuing and planned LRT work.

It is puzzling how people could attack a well-respected, 30-year resident of our town all for the sake of political expediency.\nAre your so-called progressive beliefs more important to you than the respect and approbation that someone like Mr. Smith deserves? I wonder who requested the inspection of six years of past sermons to seize upon a few words (taken out of context) to be used in the court of public opinion.\nIt didn\u2019t matter what they found, as long as they found something egregious that would appeal to the politically correct crowd. It indicates the desperation of the current regime and in conversing with others in Drayton Valley, I can assure you that it is recognized as such.\nUnfortunately, your malevolent antics have just guaranteed a record turnout of voters in support of Mr. Smith.\nJudy Deol, Drayton Valley\nNotley uses debt wisely\nDebt is not something to avoid nor to take lightly. Using Visa to pay for a vacation when you can\u2019t pay it off in a month is bad debt. But taking out a mortgage to buy a house or a car loan so you can get to work is reasonable debt. Over a longer term, it helps accomplish your goals in life.\nBorrowing money to fund the twinning of the Fort McMurray highway is good debt. Building schools so kids don\u2019t have to be crowded into gymnasiums is good debt. Giving grants for industry investment in oil upgrading is good debt now, because it creates construction jobs when our oil industry is not working efficiently. Five years from now, we will have functioning schools, nursing homes and hospitals if we continue with Rachel Notley as premier. She is using debt well.\nFive years from now, oil and gas producers will also have choices if we continue with Rachel\u2019s leadership; they will be able to place their product in pipelines or in the upgraders currently being planned.\nWe will all be better off if we use debt wisely and choose wise leadership for our province.\nB.J.

He had nine surgeries before he could try to walk again and still feels pain when he jogs.\nBut he wants to continue to work on his physical comeback before making a final determination about retirement from playing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re exhausting every option we can,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI know it\u2019s getting close. I can\u2019t hold it hostage forever. And I don\u2019t plan to, but there are some things I need to try and do physically and see if it\u2019s possible. What we\u2019ve been doing rehab-wise and communication-wise with the franchise is we\u2019re going to give it a little bit of time to kind of see where we go, and when that point comes, I know I\u2019ll have given every single thing I had to do that. And I\u2019ll be comfortable any which way that it happens.\u201d\nThe Bears re-signed Miller in June and then placed him on the reserve/physically unable to perform list to allow him to rehab with the team and contribute off the field.\nFor the way he handled both tasks, his teammates voted him to give him the Ed Block award, which is presented annually to a player who displays professionalism, strength and dedication and is a role model for the community. The award benefits the Ed McCaskey Scholarship Fund and Maryville Academy.\nMiller, who signed autographs for fans before Tuesday\u2019s banquet, was his typically positive self as he talked about his journey and the impact his story has had on others throughout the country going through similar recoveries. He said he was honored to be recognized by his teammates but also noted how much he would have liked to play for coach Matt Nagy during the Bears\u2019 12-4 season.\n\u201cEvery athlete has a selfish side to them,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou see a guy like Coach Nagy come in and the things he has done, to be a part of that offense would be something so special. I would love to do that. I tell him all the time, I\u2019d do a number of things to be able to play football for that guy. It is bittersweet, but I understand I am blessed to be a part of it and still be able to be with the guys every single day, enjoy that part of my life.\u201d\nMiller, 34, still faces daily challenges in adjusting to what he said is his \u201cnew normal.\u201d\nHe went on vacation recently but finds he is more limited in his daily physical activity than he would like to be. And while he made the leap to jogging over the last several months, he still is dealing with nerve issues and pain.\n\u201cWhen I was (jogging), kind of behind closed doors trying to push a little bit, it hurts,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little bit of physical pain I\u2019ve got to figure out if I can handle. That\u2019s going to be a big hurdle in seeing where my body reacts physically. I haven\u2019t been able to go anywhere near to what I would do on a football field. \u2026 I know the fact I\u2019m here on two feet, to be able to stand here, is a blessing in itself. And if anything else could come of that, it would be icing on the cake.\u201d\nMiller entered the league in 2009 as a sixth-round draft pick by the Jaguars before joining the Bears in 2014, and he knows it would be strange to give up football. But he said he hasn\u2019t had conversations yet about staying in the game beyond his playing career.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this game of football forever, since I was a little boy,\u201d Miller said. \u201cTo have it not be part of your life at some point seems a little scary and probably weird for me. I\u2019d love to do anything and everything I could to stay around this game I love, but I\u2019ve got to figure out physically where I\u2019m going to be and see what I can and cannot do when that time arrives.\u201d\nckane@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @ChiTribKane\nZach Miller was, as he always is, introspective and hopeful on the anniversary of his horrific injury: 'You can find positivity in it' \u00bb\nAs Anthony Miller rehabbed in Memphis, 550 miles away from Halas Hall, the Bears were on his mind: 'Chicago hasn't seen how I can play yet' \u00bb\nBears will have a tryout for former AAF kickers Wednesday at Halas Hall \u00bb\n", "label": "human"}

Trump is heading to Minnesota to tout the 2017 tax law. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump suggested Monday that his threat to ship migrants to so-called sanctuary cities is taking effect, even though it remains unclear whether such a plan is feasible.\n\"Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!\" Trump tweeted just days after aides insisted the plan had been shelved.\nNeither the White House nor Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to requests for comment Monday. And it's unclear whether DHS has taken any steps to implement the controversial plan. Lawyers there had previously told the White House that the idea was unfeasible and a misuse of funds. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is already strapped for cash.\nSarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, had said during a pair of Sunday show appearances that the idea was just one option under consideration.\n\"Whether or not it moves forward, that's yet to be determined,\" she said on Fox, acknowledging that the idea had been rejected by DHS lawyers several times.\n\"The president heard the idea, he likes it, so - well, we're looking to see if there are options that make it possible and doing a full and thorough and extensive review.,\" she said on ABC.\nAt the same time, Democrats on Monday asked the White House and agency officials for internal documents on the administration's deliberations on its proposal to send detained migrants to \"sanctuary cities\" \u2014 cities and districts that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials and which are mostly Democratic strongholds.\n\"Not only does the administration lack the legal authority to transfer detainees in this manner, it is shocking that the president and senior administration officials are even considering manipulating release decisions for purely political reasons,\" read the letter, which was signed by three House committee chairmen.\nThe letter said the plan seemed aimed at targeting Democratic areas \"in a bizarre and unlawful attempt to score political points,\" citing news reports.\nThe proposal was rejected twice by administration officials, but Trump has defended the idea.\n\"The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities,\" Trump tweeted Saturday as part of his larger push to tighten immigration laws and try to stop the flow of migrants across the southern border.\nThe plan comes as the administration has said it's been overwhelmed by a flood of migrant families, largely from Central America, attempting to cross the southwestern border. The U.S. Border Patrol said the number of families apprehended in March, 53,000, set a new record, though Democrats say the administration is worsening the problem by aggressively detaining people caught entering illegally and limiting the number of applicants for refugee status who are processed.\nThe letter requests all relevant documents from Nov. 1, 2018, through Monday. It asks for them by May 3.\nThe letter was sent by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.; Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md.; and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. It was sent to Mick Mulvaney, White House acting chief of staff, and Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of the Homeland Security Department.\n", "label": "human"}

Augustin basket on a straight line drive.\nAdjustment wise, everything seemed so logical and so simple, on the surface, but desperation often brings out the best in a wounded opponent and the Raptors began Game 2 by throwing the first punch.\nEven with Leonard picking up two quick fouls, Orlando had no answer for the increased level of urgency the home side brought to the floor and Leonard\u2019s sheer brilliance.\nLeonard was spectacular and nothing the Magic threw at Leonard had any impact.\nIt was boys against men, a team happy to head home with one win.\nOrlando missed its first six shots, the Magic playing tentatively, far too passive and clearly outmatched.\nThe Magic\u2019s fourth turnover in under five minutes led to a Leonard basket and an 11-0 Raptors lead.\nGordon emerged as Orlando\u2019s best player in getting the Magic to within six points.\nThe quarter ended with the Magic trailing, 26-18.\nBy the break, Orlando trailed 51-39, a score the flattered the visitors considering how poorly Orlando shot the ball.\nConsider Gordon and Ross combined for 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting and then consider how the rest of the Magic players went a combined 3-of-24 to produce 12 points.\nHad the Raptors shot better from beyond three-point arc, the Magic would have been run off the floor.\nAs the game unfolded, the Magic did get run off the court.\nA lot was made of Kyle Lowry\u2019s pointless game on Saturday, but Lowry was active and effective with Orlando unable to corral the all-star point guard Tuesday night.\nThe Magic tried to get Augustin going on the first possession in the second half by running a high screen and roll.\nAugustin turned the corner, drew a foul and converted from the line, but it did nothing to get Augustin comfortable from the field.\nOn Orlando\u2019s next possession, Vucevic picked up his third foul and then committed a sloppy turnover on poor entry pass.\nThe Magic allowed the Raptors to go on a 7-0 run and suddenly trailed by 19 points.\nIt got worse and at some point the Magic had to be thinking of Game 3 and the shift in mindset it must embrace in the days leading up to tipoff.\nThe team\u2019s youth was exposed in Game 2, Orlando\u2019s inability to match Toronto\u2019s aggression so obvious and so problematic.\nFrom the opening tap, the Magic looked out of sorts.\nGordon and Ross gave the Magic somewhat of a chance, but Orlando needed everyone and so few, if any, elevated their game outside of Ross and Gordon.\nLeonard found his playoff edge and ferocity.\nIt remains to be seen if the Magic has an answer.\nfzicarelli@postmedia.com\n", "label": "human"}

I\u2019m not thinking about it right now.\u201d\nIonescu, who is eligible to be drafted because she\u2019ll turn 22 this year, is well aware that win or lose this weekend, the Ducks have a really strong team coming back next year and will likely be the favorite to win the championship next season.\nReaching the Final Four was a major goal for Ionescu this season after coming to the event last year to pick up an award. The Ducks, who face Baylor on Friday night, had fallen one win short of the national semifinals for the second straight year. She remembers the experience vividly.\n\u201cOh, yeah. I remember it all. I remember talking, it was just me and the coaches that were here,\u201d she said at a press conference Thursday. \u201cI told them we were going to come back here and we were going to come back as a team. It wasn\u2019t fun coming alone, seeing the teams you played, seeing the buses get escorted while you\u2019re standing on the street watching, because I remember that like it was yesterday. I knew that I wanted my team to experience the little things that I had experienced when I was here, getting my awards. Our coaching staff has been here, they wanted to bring our team. I think we\u2019re really happy to be here as a team. Yeah, I remember everything.\u201d\nThe All-American, who won the Wade Trophy, given to the best player in the country by the WBCA, has been the catalyst behind the Ducks meteoric rise the past few seasons.\n\u201cShe\u2019s defined our program since she got here. She\u2019s helping us draw record-breaking crowds at home and on the road,\u201d Oregon coach Kelly Graves said. \u201cObviously they love the whole team, but she\u2019s the one who made it happen.\u201d\nIonescu\u2019s play hasn\u2019t only been noticed by the fans, but also some of the best basketball players in the world. Kobe Bryant came to a Ducks game and talked to the team afterward in the locker room. Steph Curry gave her a shout-out after a Warriors game earlier this week.\n\u201cShe\u2019s an unbelievable talent and her team is blazing a new trail for her program. So why not go win it all?\u201d he said . \u201cShe\u2019s a legend in her own right for sure.\u201d\nThe fact Curry would comment wasn\u2019t a huge surprise because the two met in February when she drove to Portland, Oregon, to watch Golden State play the Trail Blazers. They spent 20 minutes after the game chatting like they were old friends.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a gamer, she\u2019s got crazy versatile skills, she just makes her teammates better. Prides herself on winning,\u201d he told the AP a week after the meeting. \u201cShe\u2019s got a great attitude and is a really down to earth person. I appreciated the interaction and conversation. She just likes to hoop. She has a bright future and has done a lot for the game.\u201d\nShe has always been a huge fan of his.\n\u201cIt was awesome. He\u2019s by far my favorite player right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe both lived in Walnut Creek. We knew some people who knew each other. We hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to meet each other. It was really chill.\u201d\nAt the end of the conversation the two took a photo together on Ionescu\u2019s phone. Curry then asked the Ducks\u2019 star for a photo on his phone, which he later posted on his Instagram page.\n\u201cIt was almost shocking when he handed his phone over,\u201d she said. \u201cI got thousands of followers off that post of his.\u201d\nHer play on the court has made Ionescu a transcendent star of college women\u2019s basketball the last few years. Whatever she ends up deciding to do when the Ducks\u2019 season is over will have the blessing of her coach.\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t talked about it much and I told her I support whatever choice she ends up making,\u201d Graves said.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Two related and disturbing facts emerge from the acrid smoke surrounding lead contamination at a local gun range. First is that officers of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and their families were put at heightened risk to their long-term health. Second is that, with even a little due diligence, it all could have been avoided.\nThat needs to be the lesson going forward, for Customs and police and any other public agency that needs to ensure that its members are proficient with firearms.\nAt the site in question, Niagara Gun Range in Wheatfield, the owners have said the contamination occurred in an area the general public did not use and that in the aftermath of the contamination\u2019s discovery, the range has been professionally cleaned. Going forward, the range\u2019s general manager said, periodic cleanings will occur.\nThat\u2019s appropriate, but why wouldn\u2019t such precautions have been a condition of doing business? Since it\u2019s a matter of public health, why didn\u2019t local government insist upon regular cleaning and public inspections?\nAnd, perhaps most troubling, why didn\u2019t U.S. Customs and Border Protection protect its own workers by insisting upon a verifiably safe environment in exchange for its business? Shouldn\u2019t that have been basic due diligence?\nA December inspection by a federal industrial hygienist found that the facility, where hundreds of Customs officials had trained for more than a decade, was heavily contaminated with lead, a potentially hazardous metal that was found even in the microwave oven and the coffee pot.\n\u201cWipe samples revealed widespread lead contamination throughout the facility including surfaces used for eating, drinking and hand contact,\u201d the report concluded. The potential for serious, lifelong health problems is plain.\nIn testing that followed, two officers were found to have unusually high levels of lead in their blood. They will go for additional medical testing. But that\u2019s only the start of the worries.\nOfficers with young children are worried that they might have exposed their offspring to lead by going home in contaminated clothing. That\u2019s potentially catastrophic.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lead poisoning can harm virtually every body system in children, including the central nervous system, kidneys and reproductive system. At high levels, it can cause coma, convulsions and death.\nEven low levels of lead in young children\u2019s blood can produce decreased intelligence, impaired neurobehavioral development, decreased stature and growth and impaired hearing, according to the CDC. And because there are frequently no obvious symptoms, lead poisoning in children can go undetected. No safe blood lead level has been identified in children.\nConditions were bad at the gun range, according to Paul Kwiatkowski, president of the union local that represents most local Customs and Border Protection employees. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even breathe when you were shooting your guns,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no filtration system whatsoever. The smoke was so thick, it was burning your eyes and choking you.\u201d\nIt is incomprehensible that, in one of the country\u2019s most over-regulated states and in a region where lead poisoning has been a chronic problem, such a level of contamination had even a chance to accumulate. This was a systemic failure: of the gun range, of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and of local public health leaders. The price of that failure is yet to be calculated but if the issues weren\u2019t plain before, they are now\nThe question going forward is, what is going to be different?\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Sobhita Dhulipala (left) stars as Tara Khanna and Arjun Mathur as Karan Mehra in Amazon Prime\u2019s Made in Heaven. The series is being billed as a groundbreaking Indian drama made for global audiences.\nSouth Asians, it can easily be argued, are global leaders of the wedding industrial complex. Winter marks the height of the region's annual wedding season. As temperatures go down, closets swell, and Technicolor tents unfurl. With the booming ranks of millionaires and billionaires across India, these spectacles have grown grander than ever. For evidence, look no further than Beyonce's private concert in Rajasthan in December for the nuptials of Isha Ambani, the daughter of the richest man in India.\nFor the unfortunate masses whose diamond-encrusted invitations to this year's wedding season were somehow lost in the mail, there's Amazon Prime's new series, Made in Heaven, a groundbreaking Indian drama made for global audiences.\nMade in Heaven is about two wedding planners serving New Delhi's elite and all their wedding spectacle needs. It's Amazon Prime's fourth original series for the Indian market, and in the four weeks since its release, the show has morphed into a bona fide cultural phenomenon among South Asians at home and abroad. The cast is stylish, the colors are exquisite, and the weddings themselves are nothing short of cinematic extravaganzas.\nThe series, delivered in a blend of English and subtitled Hindi, has already launched countless think-pieces and earned rave reviews from Indian critics. While seducing audiences with the undeniable exuberance of the parties, it reveals the broken and vulnerable men and women hiding behind all the gilded ensembles. It dares to look inside modern India's many closets, offering a piercing insider's portrait of a society very few journalistic books or articles on \"new India\" can capture.\nMade in Heaven is set in New Delhi, where the affluent and the politically connected expect nothing short of tulips flown in from Amsterdam and the finest Bordeaux wines for their grooms and brides. While the show offers the irresistible allure of that glamorous world, there's a bait-and-switch midway through: The featured wedding in each episode is seen through the eyes of two central characters, wedding planner Karan Mehra (Arjun Mathur) and his business partner, Tara Khanna (Sobhita Dhulipala).\nKaran is a gay man in a society that still largely despises his orientation, and Tara is an unhappily married pillar of the Delhi elite. While Karan leads negotiations with their clients in what remains a largely patriarchal culture, Tara is often looking out at her wedding designs quietly, hidden behind her designer sunglasses and severely tailored dresses. In an elegant series of flashbacks, the backstories of Karan and Tara are revealed, and it becomes clear the show is more interested in using the weddings to explore these characters than indulge in breezy wish-fulfillment entertainment.\nThe show is set against the backdrop of the campaign to decriminalize homosexuality in India, and the writers explore the self-hatred and homophobia that drives Karan's seething rage and loneliness. Tara has arrived at her perch among Delhi's upper class through marriage and deception, leaving her lower-middle-class family far behind as she's stuck in a perpetual state of impostor syndrome and buried shame. Tara gazes upon the emptiness that's now her reality. At various junctures across the nine episodes, Karan and Tara let their masks slip and reveal the pain they're concealing from their clients and themselves.\nThe show was created and mostly made by a team of female filmmakers. It is a provocative exploration of sex, marriage and love in a society still wrestling with how to blend patriarchal traditions with modern urban life. Tara and Karan often leave their client meetings in a state of confusion, left to plan spectacular receptions while grappling with alignments that are defined by dowries, dishonesty and manipulative parents who use their daughters as bargaining chips for business deals and political alliances.\nBy centering its story on two friends who are not romantically involved, the show is a far-cry from Bollywood's fairy-tale romances. It's ultimately a series about reconnecting with oneself, rather than living by society's expectations of what happiness looks like.\nFortunately, the narrative arcs also make for binge-worthy television.\nStreaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime recognize the sheer scale of the Indian digital market, and the insatiable appetite for storytelling in the movie-mad land of Bollywood. Made in Heaven succeeds at marrying the polish, bravado and experimental nature of the \"golden age of television\" with Indian stories. For now, such productions are still operating outside the purview of the conservative and unpredictable Indian censor board, which would never allow the sex, frank language and politics of Made in Heaven to pass so easily through its tentacles.\nThe real gift for viewers of in-house productions from Netflix and Amazon Prime is how they can be released and accessed around the world. These shows can be binged in high definition at the same time in New Delhi and Washington, marking a welcome \"diversifying\" of what's on offer to Western audiences. Ongoing debates over representation in the United States have centered on seeing brown, black and gay faces in existing American genres. To now have access to stories from elsewhere as distinctive, well-told and relatable as those featured in Made in Heaven hints at the sheer possibilities of streaming's multicultural -- and global -- age.\nWeekend on 04/11/2019\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "\u00d7 Diabetes drug has heart and kidney benefits, researchers find\nNEW YORK \u2014 A common diabetes drug has been found to lower the risk of kidney failure in a new study. The finding has raised some eyebrows since diabetes is a major cause of kidney failure worldwide.\nThe risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular-related problems was lowered in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease who took a daily dose of the drug canagliflozin as part of the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday.\nThe study was funded by the pharmaceutical company Janssen, manufacturer of the drug canagliflozin, which has the brand name Invokana.\nIn March, the company submitted a supplemental new drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration for canagliflozin to be used to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease and renal or cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\nThe study included 4,401 patients, aged 30 and older, with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Those patients were randomly assigned at 690 sites in 34 countries to take either canagliflozin or a placebo, from March 2014 through May 2017.\nThey were followed up with at 3, 13 and 26 weeks, during which the effects of the drug were monitored.\nThe researchers found that in the canagliflozin group the relative risk of death from renal causes was 34% lower, and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was 32% lower. The group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke and hospitalization for heart failure.\nBased on data in the study, the researchers estimated that canagliflozin treatment would prevent 22 hospitalizations for heart failure and 25 composite events of cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke among 1,000 patients.\nAs for harmful outcomes, canagliflozin has been found to increase the risk of having a lower limb amputation as a side effect, but the researchers saw no significant difference in the risk of lower-limb amputation between the two groups in the study. Rates of bone fracture, another known side effect of canagliflozin, were also similar in the two groups, according to the study.\nThe study also showed that risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening problem when the body starts breaking down fat at an unhealthy fast rate, was low overall but higher in the canagliflozin group.\nThe study had some limitations, including that it did not include patients who had very advanced kidney disease. Nor did it include patients whose kidney diseases were believed to be due to conditions other than type 2 diabetes. More research is needed to determine whether the study\u2019s findings could be generalized to other types of kidney disease.\nThis study has the potential to influence medical practice, said Dr. Mark Molitch, professor of endocrinology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new study but often has prescribed canagliflozin for his own patients.\nCanagliflozin, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes, belongs to a class of drugs called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2, or SGLT2 inhibitors, which lower blood sugar by causing kidneys to remove sugar from the body through urine.\n\u201cWith this whole class of drugs, we really do need to think about how we\u2019re using it, because of the heart benefits and the kidney benefits,\u201d Molitch said about SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\u201cThis class of drugs really has its primary action on the kidney, from a diabetes perspective. So normally we have lots of glucose \u2014 the main sugar that\u2019s circulating in the blood \u2014 and then the kidney filters that glucose. And so most of the time there\u2019s no glucose in the urine because the kidney reabsorbs all the glucose that\u2019s filtered out of the blood,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat these drugs do is that they block that reabsorption of glucose back into the blood from the urine. And so then you excrete lots of the glucose out into the urine.\u201d\nMolitch, a member of the Endocrine Society, added that the heart and kidney benefits described in the new study \u201care over and above\u201d the benefits of simply lowering blood sugar.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still not exactly sure what the mechanisms are that cause these heart and kidney benefits, but they are clearly not solely due to lowering the blood sugar level,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe heart and kidney benefits occur in patients with more advanced kidney disease, in whom the blood glucose lowering effects of canagliflozin would be minimal,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, on the basis of this study, we might use canagliflozin just for kidney benefits and possibly heart benefits while using other drugs to control glucose levels in patients with diabetes and kidney disease.\u201d\nThe effect of the drug \u201cwas quite rapid\u201d in the study, Dr. Derek LeRoith, professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said in an email. Leroith also is a diabetes guidelines chair for the Endocrine Society.\n\u201cThis trial was designed to include individuals who had diabetic renal disease, and as such, is the first example of a lowering of risk for kidney failures [as] well as improved cardiovascular outcomes,\u201d said LeRoith, who was not involved in the study. \u201cI believe the paper is extremely significant and will have a widely read audience with major implications.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "DEXTER -- Coach Tim Cain was finalizing summer plans for his Dexter boys basketball program when he was told he would not be returning next season.\nDexter Superintendent Chris Timmis called Cain on Monday and asked him to resign after four years as the head coach.\nCain said he was caught off guard by the decision after leading the Dreadnaughts to 42-43 overall record. His best year was 2016-17, leading the team to a 14-7 record and second-place finish in the Southeastern Conference White Division.\n\u201cIt is their prerogative if they want to make a change,\u201d Cain said Thursday of administration. \"It is just the way they did it probably wasn\u2019t the best.\n\"If you would have asked me Monday, I probably would have been more controversial. When you have time to reflect -- I'm more just sad I won't have another opportunity to work with the players. I hope they find a good quality coach, and they can finish their careers on a positive note.\"\nTimmis said administration reviews coaches at the end of every season. With the Dreadnaughts finishing 5-16 in 2018-19, he said the program was not at the level the district had hoped it would be.\n\"It is not just about wins and losses, but what we do want is programs to be run as smoothly and effectively as possible,\" Timmis said Thursday. \"Some of the things we looked at, we want the coaches to be involved in middle school programs and some other levels to see what's going on there.\n\"We want our programs and coaches to put on the best image we can at all times in front of our kids. We want the programs to look like they are growing and getting better and not regressing. We didn't feel like the program was going better. I wish Tim the best. I think he is a good guy and he really knows basketball.\"\nMeet MLive\u2019s 2018-19 basketball Dream Teams from Ann Arbor See which boys and girls basketball players had the best seasons in the Ann Arbor area.\nCain texted his players shortly after his phone call with Timmis and informed them he was stepping down.\n\"I was completely shocked,\" Dexter sophomore Colin Parachek said. \"I was sitting in the weight room and we (teammates) were all talking, and our jaws were just dropped. We weren't expecting it at all.\n\"We tried to stay positive in the moment and think of what could happen and what the options are, but we were all really upset and shocked to see coach leave.\"\nCain said his assistants also were let go.\n\"Coach Cain and I wanted to change the culture at Dexter, we wanted to compete, but more importantly, help mold young men and build relationships,\" Dexter assistant coach Jon-Lamar Hamilton posted on his Twitter account Thursday. \"To the players, thank you for believing in this staff and believing in me.\"\nMessage to Dexter Parents and players: we teach how to deal with adversity, attack it and don\u2019t let it stop you. 4years ago when coach Cain asked me to come coach at Dexter, not gonna lie I had my doubts lol, but I\u2019m thankful for you all embracing me like you have pic.twitter.com/3NmFmGuYnm \u2014 Jon-Lamar Hamilton (@CoachHamil10) April 11, 2019\nDexter graduated all five starters from its 2017-18 team and struggled this season playing in a conference that included Division 1 state champion Lincoln. The SEC White also featured senior-laden programs Ypsilanti, Jackson and Chelsea.\n\"We always said we don't want to have down years at Dexter,\" Cain said. \"We played a lot of underclassmen this year. It was a struggle, but I thought our development was fair.\n\"Our league it was insane. It was a really tough schedule, but the kids were still positive.\"\nAccording to Cain, he and Athletic Director Mike Bavineau traditionally met after the season, but never did after the team\u2019s district loss Feb. 25.\n\"In reality, we just made a decision to move in a different direction with the basketball program,\" Bavineau said. \"I think that is our main focus now, to find the best candidate to lead our basketball program and student-athletes.\"\nTimmis said the job posted Tuesday and an email was sent to parents Thursday regarding plans to fill the opening.\n\u201cThe Dexter high school and district administration is in the process of putting together a team to interview candidates for the coaching position,\u201d Dexter High Principal Kit Moran said in the note. \u201cThe team will consist of parents, community members, experienced coach(es) and school administrators.

{"text": "Guterres visit is the first time a UN chief has visited country since 2011 uprising\nBenghazi: The UN chief expressed concern Thursday about a possible major armed showdown over Libya\u2019s capital, urging rival factions to instead turn to dialogue as forces loyal to a self-proclaimed army commander captured a town near Tripoli.\nThe remarks by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres came during his visit to Libya, which began Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s the first by a UN chief since the 2011 uprising that toppled and later killed Libya\u2019s long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi.\nGuterres, who is to hold a presser in Tripoli later on Thursday, said on Twitter that he is \u201cdeeply concerned by the military movement taking place in Libya and the risk of confrontation.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no military solution,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOnly intra-Libyan dialogue can solve Libyan problems.\u201d\nBut on the ground, forces loyal to strongman Marshal Khalifa Hafter, who commands the self-styled Libya National Army that\u2019s based in the country\u2019s east, took control overnight of the town of Gharyan, 50 kilometres from Tripoli, without major clashes.\nIt\u2019s the closest Haftar\u2019s forces have made it to Tripoli and fears are looming they will march on toward the capital, setting the stage for a major confrontation.\nTripoli is under control of a weak UN-backed government and aligned militias, which are rival to the east-based administration and Haftar\u2019s army.\n\u201cI am sipping coffee now in Gharyan,\u201d Haftar\u2019s top aide Abdul Salam Al Hassi told The Associated Press over the phone.\n\u201cGod willing, we will enter the rest of the cities without clashes.\u201d\nHe declined to comment on the force\u2019s upcoming steps.\nSkirmishes were reported overnight in the mountain district of Al Assabaah, near Gharyan, in which two of Haftar\u2019s fighters were killed, according to the force\u2019s media office.\nHaftar\u2019s army has waged a military campaign, spreading its footprint from eastern Libya where it first battled mostly Islamist militias and Islamist groups, starting in 2014.

{"text": "\u00d7 \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019 may mean the end (or resurrection) for some Marvel characters\nFor Marvel Studios, all roads have led to \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d More than a decade and 21 films in the making, the fourth Avengers film finally arrives in theaters this month with almost impossibly high expectations \u2014 both for audiences and the box office.\nIn the build-up, we\u2019ve accumulated dozens of characters in the ever-sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, after the events of \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d \u2014 which saw the Mad Titan Thanos wipe out half of all sentient life with the snap of his fingers \u2014 their numbers are heavily depleted.\nFor the sake of the franchise, it won\u2019t stay that way, but \u201cEndgame\u201d has to live up to its high-stakes billing. This writer isn\u2019t out for blood, but deaths are all but guaranteed.\nSo who lives, who dies and who\u2019s coming back from the snap? Buckle up, because there\u2019s a lot to cover \u2014 from what\u2019s happening both on and off screen. Here\u2019s a non-exhaustive (but still exhausting) rundown of our heroes\u2019 chances.\nNote: This list includes spoilers up to and including \u201cCaptain Marvel.\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d had not been screened to the press at the time of writing and the blinkers are firmly on regarding set leaks and other online hearsay.\nAnt-Man\nCurrent status: Alive\nIs Scott Lang going to be the secret sauce in the fight against Thanos? We\u2019ve never really taken Ant-Man seriously (lord knows he doesn\u2019t do so himself), but \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp\u2019s\u201d exploration of the Quantum Realm and its time-bending properties might be the way to travel back pre-snap without the Time Stone. An added incentive for Lang to pull his finger out: the snap wiped out the Wasp, mentor Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne (the original Ant-Man and Wasp).\nDead or alive? Paul Rudd\u2019s character is a relatively new entry into the MCU. Not a dead cert, but he\u2019ll likely survive.\nBlack Panther\nCurrent status: Dead\nDo you really think Marvel is about to drop the superhero behind an Oscar-winning, $1.3 billion-grossing film after one solo outing? Kevin Feige announced, \u201cBlack Panther 2\u201d was happening back in March 2018.\nDead or alive? Wakanda forever!\nBlack Widow\nCurrent status: Alive\nBlack Widow was the Avenger that never got the standalone film they deserved (sorry Hawkeye). That finally changed in 2018 when it was announced that Natasha Romanoff would receive a solo outing, with subsequent reporting that Florence Pugh has joined the cast alongside Johansson. Whether it will be an origin story or post-\u201cEndgame\u201d is still unconfirmed.\nDead or alive? Killing off your lead before their first solo film would be an odd move, but if the \u201cBlack Widow\u201d movie is a prequel that would leave Johansson open to explore other projects afterward and have the last say in what has been a decade-long injustice. I\u2019m leaning toward death.\nBruce Banner/The Hulk\nCurrent status: Alive\nWhen we left Banner in Wakanda he was having a real Hulk impotence problem \u2014 kind of inconvenient for everyone. Banner/Hulk has been invaluable to the Avengers, but as a character, he\u2019s often worked as a foil within the group. With no solo outing under Marvel Studios announced, and the likelihood a number of his comrades will die in \u201cEndgame,\u201d you might think this is the end of the road for Banner. But Mark Ruffalo still has films outstanding on a six-movie deal he signed back in 2012.\nDead or alive? Going to survive \u2014 and hopefully, continue the intergalactic buddy road trip with Thor.\nBucky Barnes\nCurrent status: Dead\nExpect Barnes\u2019 death in \u201cInfinity War\u201d to be a motivator behind a self-sacrificing play from old friend Captain America in \u201cEndgame\u201d (whatever shape that might take). Barnes could well pick up the vibranium shield and become the new Cap\u2019 post-\u201cEndgame,\u201d following a plot line from the comics. (Huge hint: Sebastian Stan is reportedly locked in to a nine-film contract.) There\u2019s also the mooted Disney+ series with Falcon. Stan has also expressed an interest in the \u201cBlack Widow\u201d film. He\u2019ll be busy if that all comes to pass.\nDead or alive? Alive \u2014 and possibly with a few personality tweaks if he\u2019s to take up the shield.\nCaptain America\nCurrent status: Alive\nSteve Rogers came back from the wilderness in \u201cInfinity War,\u201d bearded and bad-ass. Now Captain America looks ready to lay down everything in \u201cEndgame.\u201d Chris Evans has dropped anvil-sized hints in interviews for over a year and seems to have already said goodbye to the character on Twitter. It feels like a done deal.\nDead or alive? The all-American hero is a goner. We\u2019ll miss you Cap\u2019.\nCaptain Marvel\nCurrent status: Alive\n\u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d just cruised past the billion-dollar club at the global box office and Brie Larson\u2019s take on spacefaring pilot Carol Danvers was a critical success too. \u201cEndgame\u201d is only the beginning, and there\u2019s murmurs she could eventually head up the Avengers. We\u2019ve only just started to see what she\u2019s capable of.\nDead or alive? You come at the queen, you best not miss. She lives.\nDoctor Strange\nCurrent status: Dead\nBefore falling victim to the snap, Strange told Tony Stark this was the only way; he had looked into multiple futures and seen doom in every other permutation. Being the raging narcissist that he is, don\u2019t expect any self-sacrificing moves from Strange, who only made his debut in 2016. There\u2019s also the small matter of a standalone sequel reportedly in development.\nDead or alive? The good doctor will return.\nDrax the Destroyer\nCurrent status: Dead\nDavid Bautista led the \u201cGuardians\u201d actors in their vocal support of James Gunn after his firing. Gunn is back at the helm, and expect Drax to survive \u201cEndgame\u201d and feature prominently in \u201cGuardians 3.\u201d Trivia: It\u2019s not going to happen in the Marvel Studios\u2019 PG-13 universe, but in one story from the comics Drax defeats Thanos by ripping out his heart.\nDead or alive? Alive. His reflexes are too fast.\nFalcon\nCurrent status: Dead\nThe Disney+ series with Bucky all but guarantees he\u2019ll be back from the dead and make it through \u201cEndgame.\u201d\nDead or alive? The second string Avenger lives.\nGamora\nCurrent status: Dead\nGamora\u2019s demise was a tough watch. Sacrificed by Thanos to gain the Soul Stone, if you didn\u2019t realize already, here was proof that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Killed pre-snap, but \u201cEndgame\u201d marketing art keeps her in the frame, suggests she can still be brought back to life.\nDead or alive? If anyone deserves to survive \u201cEndgame\u201d it\u2019s probably Thanos\u2019 long-suffering adopted daughter. Alive.\nGroot\nCurrent status: Dead\nBig call, but no character is more beloved in the MCU. Groot already sacrificed himself once at the end of \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and is only just returning to his normal size. No way they\u2019d off him permanently.\nDead or alive? Alive. There\u2019d be riots outside Marvel HQ.\nHappy Hogan\nCurrent status: Alive\nThe fate of Happy\u2019s employer Tony Stark is very much in the air (more of which later). If he does die, Stark\u2019s long-suffering friend and chauffeur would appear surplus to requirements. But he\u2019s right there in the \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d trailer, which arrives in theaters in July and, according to comments from producer Amy Pascal back in 2017, starts \u201ca few minutes after Avengers 4 wraps.\u201d\nDead or alive? Alive.\nHawkeye\nCurrent status: Alive\nAbsent in \u201cInfinity War\u201d because he was under house arrest (a lame excuse in my book), Hawkeye returned in the \u201cEndgame\u201d trailer with an outr\u00e9 haircut and world-weary scowl. What he\u2019s been up to is anyone\u2019s guess, but after two Avengers films in the shadow of bigger superheroes, will Hawkeye finally have his moment in the sun? Yeah, that could pretty underwhelming.\nDead or alive? This smells like a redemption narrative \u2014 I suspect Hawkeye\u2019s family might not have survived the snap. Given there\u2019s not many other places for the character to go, he could easily bite the dust.\nIron Man\nCurrent status: Alive\nTony Stark\u2019s first outing in 2008 was the cornerstone on which this entire cinematic universe was built. If that sounds like a eulogy, that\u2019s because it\u2019s supposed to. Robert Downey Jr. is out of contract after \u201cEndgame\u201d and let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s no shortage of wise-cracking egotists in the MCU ready to carry the torch. Will Stark really be able to just walk away from all of this unscathed?\nDead or alive? If it happens it will be glorious, tragic and (hopefully) delivered with a wry smile. But he\u2019s a prime contender to die.\nLoki\nCurrent status: Dead\nAn early victim in \u201cInfinity War,\u201d Loki never made it past the intro, never mind the snap. Intriguingly, one of the Disney+ series in development focuses on the loveable antihero from Asgard \u2014 with Tom Hiddleston to star, Disney have confirmed. What Disney hasn\u2019t confirmed is when it will be set. Marvel offered no comment to The Hollywood Reporter when sources suggested the series would have Loki popping up through human history like a god-level Forrest Gump. So it sounds like a prequel.\nDead or alive? The master of cheating death could feasibly do it again, but the signs say he\u2019s a goner.\nMantis\nCurrent status: Dead\nA latecomer to the Guardians clique, Mantis bit the dust in \u201cInfinity War.\u201d But there\u2019s no good reason for her to stay dead. Fingers crossed we get plenty more laughs from this intergalactic oddball in \u201cGuardians 3.\u201d\nDead or alive? Death would be a senseless move. Mantis should live.\nM\u2019Baku\nCurrent status: Alive\nCould M\u2019Baku become king of Wakanda with T\u2019Challa out of the equation? It\u2019s possible. M\u2019Baku hasn\u2019t featured in any \u201cEndgame\u201d trailers, but Winston Duke has confirmed he\u2019s returning. It seems unlikely Marvel will kill off the affable vegetarian, especially given the \u201cUs\u201d star\u2019s ever-rising profile.\nDead or alive? Alive.\nNebula\nCurrent status: Alive\nThanos\u2019 adopted daughter could make a big play in \u201cEndgame.\u201d Marvel aficionados will know that in one plot from the comics, Nebula managed to seize the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos and used it to undo his murders. She then went on a power trip and had to be stopped and imprisoned. We don\u2019t know if any of this will happen in \u201cEndgame,\u201d but if some of it does, Nebula could end up as collateral in restoring order to the universe. That said, there\u2019s rumors a Gamora and Nebula series is in early development for Disney+, and Karen Gillan has talked about \u201cGuardians 3\u201d as if she\u2019s involved.\nDead or alive? On the basis of her \u201cGuardians 3\u201d hints, she\u2019ll make it. But there\u2019s a huge case for her dying in \u201cEndgame\u201d otherwise.\nNick Fury\nCurrent status: Dead\nFury set the wheels of \u201cEndgame\u201d in motion when he dropped Captain Marvel a message on his pager mid-disintegration. He\u2019s been through the wringer, but every time Fury has come out swinging. So don\u2019t expect the small matter of Thanos and the destruction of half the universe to spell his end.\nDead or alive? Alive. He\u2019s in the \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d trailer.\nOkoye\nCurrent status: Alive\nNo one had Black Panther\u2019s back more than Okoye. Expect her to return with vengeance in \u201cEndgame\u201d to try and bring T\u2019Challa back from the dead. No word on whether Danai Gurira is confirmed to reprise the role in \u201cBlack Panther 2,\u201d but killing Okoye in \u201cEndgame\u201d would come as a shock.\nDead or alive? More alive than dead.\nPepper Potts\nCurrent status: Alive\nEagle-eyed viewers of the \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d trailer will have spotted a giant check from Stark Industries signed by Pepper Potts. I\u2019m not sure how long it takes for one of those to get printed, but remarkably Potts might outlive her maverick boss-turned-partner.\nDead or alive? With Tony Stark probably heading for the exit, is the MCU going to see its first conscious uncoupling? Pass me a Goop-branded hanky.\nRocket\nCurrent status: Alive\nA tougher call than it should be. Rocket has had quite the character arc since he was first introduced in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d and a self-sacrificing move \u2014 especially when it comes to Groot \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be out of the question. But there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll leave Groot without his translator, right?\nDead or alive? Alive and quipping.\nScarlet Witch\nCurrent status: Dead\nSnapped after watching Vision die twice over, but reportedly returning in Disney+ series \u201cThe Vision and Scarlet Witch\u201c. So this shouldn\u2019t be the end of the road for Wanda Maximoff.\nDead or alive? Alive.\nShuri\nCurrent status: Dead\nThe internet was shocked when Marvel released marketing art suggesting Shuri was the victim of the snap \u2014 it was the first we\u2019d heard of it. An off-camera death is a short shrift for a character that stole nearly every \u201cBlack Panther\u201d scene she was in. Don\u2019t expect her to stay out of the picture.\nDead or alive? T\u2019Challa wouldn\u2019t last two minutes without his little sister. She\u2019s going to pull through.\nSpider-Man\nCurrent status: Dead\nTom Holland delivered a gut punch of a death scene in \u201cInfinity War,\u201d with Peter Parker watched over by helpless mentor Iron Man. Expect Parker\u2019s resurrection to be a prime motivator for Stark.\nDead or alive? Not a chance. Unless Sony and Marvel Studios have played us all and \u201cFar From Home\u201d is in fact a prequel, flying in the face of all previous reporting.\nStar-Lord\nCurrent status: Dead\nWhen the third installment of \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d was in the doldrums there was a question mark hanging over the fate of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, but not anymore. The Guardians need their leading man.\nDead or alive? He\u2019ll make the cut, you big turd blossoms.\nThe Ancient One\nCurrent status: Dead\nDied in \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d but Tilda Swinton is reportedly among the cast of \u201cEndgame.\u201d Expect the Ancient One to feature in some form of flashback or time travel to impart some wisdom, but not to stick around beyond \u201cEndgame\u201d \u2014 she\u2019d just get in the way of Strange in future films.\nDead or alive? Dead.\nThor\nCurrent status: Alive\nArguably \u201cInfinity War\u2019s\u201d MVP, Thor levelled-up his weaponry and so nearly killed Thanos. Chris Hemsworth has said he\u2019s out of contract after \u201cEndgame,\u201d but after the roaring success of Thor\u2019s last solo outing \u201cRagnarok,\u201d it doesn\u2019t feel like the Norse god has run his course.\nDead or alive? Strong chance Thor lives.\nValkyrie\nCurrent status: Alive\nCritics agreed that Tessa Thompson knocked it out the park as warrior drunk Valkyrie in \u201cRagnarok,\u201d and there\u2019s plenty of room for this character to grow. Marvel Studios know an asset when they see one.\nDead or alive? Only just beginning to spread her wings. She lives.\nVision\nCurrent status: Dead\nWhatever lies beyond the mortal plane, Vision still probably has a killer migraine after Thanos ripped the Mind Stone from his forehead. His story arc has arguably run its course, but an upcoming Disney+ series alongside Scarlet Witch would likely make him indispensable.\nDead or alive? Probably going to survive, proving you can never keep a part-android, part-space gem down.\nWar Machine\nCurrent status: Alive\nJames Rhodes survived the snap, but as a long-term vet of the MCU and with associates likely to die in \u201cEndgmae,\u201d the next chapter for the colonel is murky.\nDead or alive? This could go either way. Assuming Stark dies, donning the Iron Man suit wouldn\u2019t be a big leap for War Machine. On the other hand, with no Tony Stark to keep in check, Rhodes loses some of his raison d\u2019etre.

Those reports say investigators have been looking into whether Zinke, who departed the agency in January, lied to the Interior watchdog.\nStory Continued Below\nOn Monday, Kendall announced she was launching an investigation into Bernhardt for several possible ethics violations.\nKendall will step down in May and take the position of deputy inspector general at Amtrak, Interior Office of Inspector General spokesperson Nancy DiPaolo told POLITICO. Kendall had reached retirement age and was stepping down voluntarily, she added.\n\u201cNothing nefarious at all,\u201d DiPaolo said. \u201cShe\u2019s just able to retire.\u201d\nInterior\u2019s investigations into Zinke are continuing, DiPaolo told POLITICO.\nKendall\u2019s position at the IG\u2019s office had briefly come under question last year after Housing and Urban Development Department Secretary Ben Carson sent an email to staff announcing that Suzanne Tufts, his own assistant secretary of administration, would take over as Interior\u2019s inspector general.\nThough Tufts never joined Interior's team, Carson\u2019s email raised concerns about potential political interference into the investigations Kendall was carrying out on Zinke\u2019s relationship with the then-chairman of oilfield services company Halliburton and his role in blocking gaming licenses for Indian tribes.\nInterior and the White House blamed each other for the fact that the HUD official was being considered to head the Interior office. In the end, HUD said Carson had been mistaken in his email to staff. Tufts eventually resigned.\nThe White House has picked Mark Greenblatt, who previously worked at the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General, to head Interior's watchdog. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has not yet scheduled a hearing for his nomination, and a committee spokesperson declined to comment on the potential timing.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Stress affects everyone, and it\u2019s not all bad. Without some positive stress, we wouldn\u2019t get out of bed in the morning, or run that marathon, or write the great Canadian novel. Still, the negative impacts of stress are well known, ranging from psychological issues like anger, irritability and loss of sex drive, to physical symptoms like chest pain, indigestion and even skin eruptions.\nMost studies show a higher percentage of women report being stressed, but men may simply be reluctant to admit it. Denying stress and holding it in may cause even more problems.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a magic button that could somehow clear away stress? I found something that claims to be just that, at my favourite store in San Francisco. Target Open House is a smart home showroom, where you can see hot new tech products that the retail chain might someday sell in their stores.\nThat\u2019s where I met Amy Serin, a PhD-holding psychologist from Arizona. She was demonstrating TouchPoints\u2122 \u2014 two small vibrating buttons that, she claims, \u201ccan decrease stress by up to 70 per cent in as few as 30 seconds.\u201d The underlying technology is BLAST (bilateral alternating stimulation tactile). You can hold the devices, wear them on wristbands or even put them in your socks to help you sleep.\nSerin is the inventor of the device, and co-founder of the company that makes and sells it. She was demonstrating it to a woman who said she freezes up with stress when she has to attend a certain business meeting. After trying the Buzzies, as they used to be called, she asked how to order some.\nThen it was my turn. Serin had me think about something that was causing me stress, and asked what part of my body I was feeling it in. Sure enough, after a bit of vibrating, I did indeed feel calmer and more relaxed, in all parts of my body.\nI wound up with a set to test out, along with pointers to some of the studies at https://thetouchpointsolution.com/pages/research. Various researchers report good results using the devices for anxiety, autism, irritability, sleep problems, PTSD, and even post-concussive syndrome.\nMy first brainwave was to take them along when I went to sea with the Royal Canadian Navy, since there have been suggestions that vibration devices can help counter motion sickness. But the seas were dead calm.\nThen I lent them to a friend with a teenage son who is on the autism spectrum. He gave them a try but found the noise too annoying. He also objected to the thought that the device was manipulating his brain waves, which is exactly what the company claims on their website, showing before and after brain scans with significantly reduced beta wave activity.\nThe device has three modes, blue for sleep, green for calm and red for anger. There\u2019s also a free app that allows finer control of the frequency, intensity and overlap, and provides pre-sets for things like focus, performance and craving.\nI sought out Jaideep Bains, PhD, professor of Physiology & Pharmacology at the University of Calgary. He\u2019s a noted expert on neurophysiology and stress, and a principal investigator whose research is highlighted at stressynomics.com.\nHis first reaction to holding the TouchPoints\u2122? \u201cCool toy, but it would drive me crazy.\u201d He acknowledges that the company has some very prestigious people on their advisory board, but objects to the characterization of the devices as being based on neuroscience. \u201cThey looked at beta waves, but beta waves happen in the cortex for a lot of reasons. They don\u2019t necessary have to do with stress.\u201d\nHe notes that much of their research results are subjective reports. \u201cThey\u2019re very careful in their literature to say they\u2019re not recommending this for any disease or any medical benefit. If this were to be thought of as a medical device, what you\u2019d need is a randomized trial. You\u2019d need cortisol levels, you\u2019d need autonomic outputs like heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and sweat.\u201d\nHe does agree with some of the material on the company\u2019s website, especially when it says that stress activates circuits in your brain over which you don\u2019t have control.\nAs Bains and many others have observed, there\u2019s a huge possibility of a placebo effect here. Indeed, that may be what happened to me, and to the lady in the store. We felt reduced stress because we expected to feel it.\n\u201cThat woman would probably be better off just going for a walk, and breathing deeply,\u201d says Bains, \u201cand removing herself from the stressful situation.\u201d\nOf course, a stress-busting walk isn\u2019t always an option. If you\u2019d like to try TouchPoints\u2122, they cost $159.99 US (plus shipping, duty and taxes) from the company\u2019s website. They do offer a 30-day free trial, though dealing with international returns might raise your stress level.\nYou could just wait to see if and when they make it onto the shelves at your nearest U.S. Target store\nDr. Tom Keenan is an award-winning journalist, public speaker, professor in the Faculty of Environmental Design at the University of Calgary, and author of the bestselling book, Technocreep: The Surrender of Privacy and the Capitalization of Intimacy.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "\u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d is the 22nd entry in the long-running Marvel Studios superhero saga. It\u2019s also the last of the \u201cAvengers\u201d movies, and you can tell because, if you wait through the voluminous end credits, you will notice that the movie just ... ends. No teaser for a sequel.\nIt\u2019s been well publicized that \u201cEndgame\u201d is the last of the line, so I\u2019m not spoiling anything here. But writing at any length about this 181-minute movie without detonating a minefield of spoiler alerts is beyond my capabilities, plus I wouldn\u2019t want to do that anyway. So I\u2019ll just sketch the premise outlined in its first 15 minutes or so.\nAt the end of \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d Mad Titan Thanos (voiced by Josh Brolin) acquired the six Infinity Stones that allowed him to wipe out half the universe, including a swath of Avengers. (Their rapid dissolution into dust heaps was the movie\u2019s most memorable visual effect.) Five years later, the surviving squad is a somnolent bunch licking their wounds until Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) rouses the troops to take a last stand against Thanos, who is fond of saying things like \u201cI am inevitable.\u201d\nIt was inevitable, of course, that this movie, which is projected to make more than a billion dollars worldwide, would get made. Given the fact that it\u2019s essentially a large-scale contraption for Marvel fanatics, it does the job well enough. But Marvel veterans Joe and Anthony Russo, who co-directed, and their screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, are not especially dynamic crasftsmen. Even though there are moments when the emotional connections between the Avengers hit home, for the most part the film is a moderately well-paced action comic saga with a sluggish third act. All the talk about these Marvel movies being the modern-day equivalent of Homeric epics and Greek mythology may indeed be true, but I don\u2019t think \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d will ever be compared to \u201cThe Iliad.\u201d\nDespite all the whiz-bang CGI effects, some more special than others, the moments I most appreciated in \u201cEndgame\u201d were the small-scale comic touches: a dumpy-looking Thor (Chris Hemsworth) trying to shake his sloth and return to glory; Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) being antsy; Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) trying to be kinder and gentler. Best of all is Robert Downey Jr. Amid all the hardware, he alone in the Marvel series has consistently given top-notch performances. His work in \u201cEndgame\u201d is extraordinarily moving and makes me wish yet again that this great actor would on occasion see fit to be great in a movie that doesn\u2019t require him to fill out a franchise. Grade: B (Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and some language.)\n", "label": "human"}

And they were like, 'Yeah, no, Sibel, not really. Your character will die in the fourth season.' I was like, 'Oh my God.' I was hoping, I was just trying to blackmail them.

They can love you, but at the same time, if you do something wrong, or your character is doing something wrong in their eyes, they can be really mean to you. I had both experiences.

I\u2019m Not in Charge of Health Care\u2019\nAttorney General William Barr took questions from Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla, about the Affordable Care Act during Tuesday\u2019s hearing in front of the House appropriations subcommittee. Barr was asked about the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to defend the law in court. (Published Tuesday, April 9, 2019)\nBarr wouldn't discuss the substance of the special counsel's investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but he did explain some of what to expect when the report is released: He said the redactions will be color-coded and accompanied by notes explaining any decisions to withhold information.\n\"This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,\" Barr said.\nCongress, the White House and the American public have been anxiously waiting for Barr to release the report since special counsel Mueller concluded his investigation and sent it to the attorney general more than two weeks ago. Justice Department officials are scouring the nearly 400-page document to remove grand jury information and details relating to pending investigations, among other materials.\nDemocrats say they will not accept any redactions.\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Democrats said they were concerned that a four-page summary letter of the report's main conclusions Barr released last month portrayed the findings in an overly favorable way for President Trump. The letter said that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates in the 2016 campaign, and that Barr did not believe the evidence in the report was sufficient to prove the president had obstructed justice.\nBarr said \"the letter speaks for itself\" and revealed that he gave Mueller an opportunity to review the letter but the special counsel declined.\nMueller Report and Border Control Looms Over Capitol Hill\nUltimatums being fired from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are setting up showdowns this week on two major topics: immigration and Robert Mueller's report on Russian election meddling. The Justice Department says a redacted version of Mueller's report should be released by mid-April. Meanwhile, the Trump administration says the president is serious about shutting down the border with Mexico over the number of migrants attempting to enter the United States. (Published Tuesday, April 2, 2019)\nRep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, said she was taken aback that Barr had reduced Mueller's report to a four-page letter in just two days. \"Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it's more suspicious than impressive,\" Lowey said.\nBarr said, \"I felt I should state bottom-line conclusions, and I tried to use special counsel Mueller's own language in doing that.\"\nAsked about reports that members of Mueller's legal team were unhappy with his handling of the report, Barr said he suspected any discontent may have reflected their desire to put out more information.\nRepublicans defended Barr, with Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt comparing Democrats' questions to theories surrounding President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. \"So many of the questions here today have gone toward a grassy knoll conspiracy theory,\" Aderholt said.\nAcross the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had no concerns with the handling of the report: \"I think it really comes down to a question of whether you trust Bill Barr or not. And I do.\"\nBarr said in the summary released last month that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, instead presenting evidence on both sides of the question. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that the evidence was insufficient to establish obstruction.\nBarr Releases Statement on Findings in Mueller Investigation\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the 2016 election determined that nobody from the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr. (Published Sunday, March 24, 2019)\nFacing the intensifying concerns from Democrats that he may have whitewashed Mueller's findings, Barr has moved to defend, or at least explain, his handling of the process since receiving the special counsel's report. He said in a March 29 letter that he did not intend for his brief summary of Mueller's main conclusions to be an \"exhaustive recounting\" of his work.\nHe is likely to be asked to further explain himself at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday, though it's unclear how much more he will say. At one point in the House hearing, he tried to cut off any more questions on the subject.\n\"I'm not going to discuss it any further until after the report is out,\" he said.\nBarr said he would elaborate at hearings scheduled by the House and Senate Judiciary committees at the beginning of next month.\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC 6 South Florida\n", "label": "human"}

Both storms produced widespread damage and loss of life.\nThe first tornado occurred on April 2, 1957 and hit Dallas. The tornado formed in southern Dallas county and moved north. In its path were the communities of Oak Cliff, Kessler Park and West Dallas. The tornado was on the ground for 45 minutes and passed only a few miles to the west of downtown Dallas. It was estimated the storm had winds of nearly 175 mph. Numerous homes were wiped off of their foundations and railroad cars were overturned. 10 people died and at least 200 people were injured.\nThe Dallas tornado was unique in that it was one of the first tornadoes to be filmed from several angles.

Diaz has never been on the injured list and has handled a heavy workload, including 73 1/3 innings in 2018, throughout his major-league career.\nThe Mets\u2019 thinking, according to the Mets, has more to do with making sure that remains the case. As a way to protect Diaz, they are steadfast in their refusal to use him 1) before the ninth inning 2) for more than one inning and 3) in a tie game on the road. (An exception: the playoffs.) Those conservative philosophies \u2014 more rules than rules of thumb \u2014 run contrary to Callaway\u2019s tendencies a year ago.\n\u201cHe had a lot of success in the role he was in last year,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cWe feel that him having that role for us \u2014 like he did last night, he came in and struck three guys out and looked electric \u2014 is going to be the spot we feel like we need to put him in.

That turned out to be even more complicated than expected.\n\u201cI carefully suggested to replace all the lights and bring it back to where it was before,\u201d she said.\nLED lighting technology, Frank said, has improved significantly since the work was installed in 2011.\n\u201cThe fixtures up there now are much better quality,\u201d she said.\nFrank based the work\u2019s colours and light patterns on the local landscape. Patterns include a diagonal bisecting the horizontal lights from top to bottom. Another resembles a gentle cascade of water running down the side of the building. A complete cycle takes eight hours.\nShe\u2019s brought the work back to where it was before it went dark \u2013 but with a few added features. She\u2019s added more colour layers, including three shades of blue to give the work more depth. She\u2019s added a shimmering effect inspired by sun light hitting the water.\nIf all goes well with the new lights on the east tower, restoration of the LED lights on the west tower will take place next spring.\nWest Pender Place was designed by architect Jim Hancock when he was with IBI Architects.\nFrank\u2019s public art on West Pender Place is among the art works featured in the Dutch artist\u2019s new book Lightspace 20 years. Lightspace includes all of Frank\u2019s work from 1997 to 2007.\nShe was in town to work on the light installation at West Pender Place and to hold a local book launch on Monday.\nAt 130 metres in height, the West Pender light work is Frank\u2019s biggest public art work. It was her first commission in North America.\nFrank\u2019s interest with light started with explorations into the reflective quality of pigments.\n\u201cIn essence now, I am still a painter,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the way I compose, it\u2019s all about colour and composition and saturation. It is just that I\u2019ve chosen light with my preferred medium to work with.\u201d\nFrank has a second LED light art installation in Vancouver. She designed the lighting at South Creek Landing, 2211 Cambie, on the west side of the street. The building is by Arno Matis Architecture.\nLightspace 20 Years is $85; a limited edition version is $680.\ntwitter.com/kevincgriffin\n", "label": "human"}

The owners of those wells will be notified, and provided with an alternative water supply.\nThe chemical is PFOS, or perfluorooctane sulfonate.

Previously, the state officials did not have information about this chemical, and set guidelines based on other chemicals.\n3M manufactured the chemicals starting in the 1940s, for use in non-stick cookware and stain repellent. It legally disposed of the chemicals in dumpsites in Washington County.\nIn 2004, traces of the chemicals were discovered in underground plumes of water around the dumpsites, impacting the drinking water of Lake Elmo, Woodbury, Oakdale and Cottage Grove.\nLarge doses of the chemicals cause thyroid problems, birth defects and cancer in mice, but the chemicals never have been proven to adversely impact human health in the levels found in Washington County.

The multi starrer is all set to release the trailer today and it is quite an anticipated one. The teaser and the songs have been breaking records on YouTube like no other Bollywood film and the star cast is thrilled to be a part of this magnum opus.\nWith Alia\u2019s career on the rise, after Kalank, she has three big movies in her bag. One of them is Brahmastra where she is paired opposite her beau, Ranbir Kapoor and the other one is Takht, a multi starrer yet again.

{"text": "For seven years, from the moment Julian Assange first sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, they have been telling us we were wrong, that we were paranoid conspiracy theorists. We were told there was no real threat of Assange\u2019s extradition to the United States, that it was all in our fevered imaginations.\nFor seven years, we have had to listen to a chorus of journalists, politicians and \u201cexperts\u201d telling us that Assange was nothing more than a fugitive from justice, and that the British and Swedish legal systems could be relied on to handle his case in full accordance with the law. Barely a \u201cmainstream\u201d voice was raised in his defence in all that time.\nFrom the moment he sought asylum, Assange was cast as an outlaw. His work as the founder of Wikileaks \u2013 a digital platform that for the first time in history gave ordinary people a glimpse into the darkest recesses of the most secure vaults in the deepest of Deep States \u2013 was erased from the record.\nAssange was reduced from one of the few towering figures of our time \u2013 a man who will have a central place in history books, if we as a species live long enough to write those books \u2013 to nothing more than a sex pest, and a scruffy bail-skipper.\nThe political and media class crafted a narrative of half-truths about the sex charges Assange was under investigation for in Sweden. They overlooked the fact that Assange had been allowed to leave Sweden by the original investigator, who dropped the charges, only for them to be revived by another investigator with a well-documented political agenda.\nThey failed to mention that Assange was always willing to be questioned by Swedish prosecutors in London, as had occurred in dozens of other cases involving extradition proceedings to Sweden. It was almost as if Swedish officials did not want to test the evidence they claimed to have in their possession.\nThe media and political courtiers endlessly emphasised Assange\u2019s bail violation in the UK, ignoring the fact that asylum seekers fleeing legal and political persecution don\u2019t usually honour bail conditions imposed by the very state authorites from which they are seeking asylum.\nThe political and media establishment ignored the mounting evidence of a secret grand jury in Virginia formulating charges against Assange, and ridiculed Wikileaks\u2019 concerns that the Swedish case might be cover for a more sinister attempt by the US to extradite Assange and lock him away in a high-security prison, as had happened to whistleblower Chelsea Manning.\nThey belittled the 2016 verdict of a panel of United Nations legal scholars that the UK was \u201carbitrarily detaining\u201d Assange. The media were more interested in the welfare of his cat.\nThey ignored the fact that after Ecuador changed presidents \u2013 with the new one keen to win favour with Washington \u2013 Assange was placed under more and more severe forms of solitary confinement. He was denied access to visitors and basic means of communications, violating both his asylum status and his human rights, and threatening his mental and physical wellbeing.\nEqually, they ignored the fact that Assange had been given diplomatic status by Ecuador, as well as Ecuadorean citizenship. Britain was obligated to allow him to leave the embassy, using his diplomatic immunity, to travel unhindered to Ecuador. No \u201cmainstream\u201d journalist or politician thought this significant either.\nThey turned a blind eye to the news that, after refusing to question Assange in the UK, Swedish prosecutors had decided to quietly drop the case against him in 2015. Sweden had kept the decision under wraps for more than two years.\nIt was a freedom of information request by an ally of Assange, not a media outlet, that unearthed documents showing that Swedish investigators had, in fact, wanted to drop the case against Assange back in 2013. The UK, however, insisted that they carry on with the charade so that Assange could remain locked up. A British official emailed the Swedes:\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare get cold feet!!!\u201d\nMost of the other documents relating to these conversations were unavailable. They had been destroyed by the UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service in violation of protocol. But no one in the political and media establishment cared, of course.\nSimilarly, they ignored the fact that Assange was forced to hole up for years in the embassy, under the most intense form of house arrest, even though he no longer had a case to answer in Sweden. They told us \u2013 apparently in all seriousness \u2013 that he had to be arrested for his bail infraction, something that would normally be dealt with by a fine.\nAnd possibly most egregiously of all, most of the media refused to acknowledge that Assange was a journalist and publisher, even though by failing to do so they exposed themselves to the future use of the same draconian sanctions should they or their publications ever need to be silenced. They signed off on the right of the US authorities to seize any foreign journalist, anywhere in the world, and lock him or her out of sight. They opened the door to a new, special form of rendition for journalists.\nThis was never about Sweden or bail violations, or even about the discredited Russiagate narrative, as anyone who was paying the vaguest attention should have been able to work out. It was about the US Deep State doing everything in its power to crush Wikileaks and make an example of its founder.\nIt was about making sure there would never again be a leak like that of Collateral Murder, the military video released by Wikileaks in 2007 that showed US soldiers celebrating as they murdered Iraqi civilians. It was about making sure there would never again be a dump of US diplomatic cables, like those released in 2010 that revealed the secret machinations of the US empire to dominate the planet whatever the cost in human rights violations.\nNow the pretence is over. The British police invaded the diplomatic territory of Ecuador \u2013 invited in by Ecuador after it tore up Assange\u2019s asylum status \u2013 to smuggle him off to jail. Two vassal states cooperating to do the bidding of the US empire. The arrest was not to help two women in Sweden or to enforce a minor bail infraction.\nNo, the British authorities were acting on an extradition warrant from the US. And the charges the US authorities have concocted relate to Wikileaks\u2019 earliest work exposing the US military\u2019s war crimes in Iraq \u2013 the stuff that we all once agreed was in the public interest, that British and US media clamoured to publish themselves.\nStill the media and political class is turning a blind eye. Where is the outrage at the lies we have been served up for these past seven years? Where is the contrition at having been gulled for so long? Where is the fury at the most basic press freedom \u2013 the right to publish \u2013 being trashed to silence Assange? Where is the willingness finally to speak up in Assange\u2019s defence?\nIt\u2019s not there. There will be no indignation at the BBC, or the Guardian, or CNN. Just curious, impassive \u2013 even gently mocking \u2013 reporting of Assange\u2019s fate.\nAnd that is because these journalists, politicians and experts never really believed anything they said. They knew all along that the US wanted to silence Assange and to crush Wikileaks. They knew that all along and they didn\u2019t care. In fact, they happily conspired in paving the way for today\u2019s kidnapping of Assange.\nThey did so because they are not there to represent the truth, or to stand up for ordinary people, or to protect a free press, or even to enforce the rule of law. They don\u2019t care about any of that. They are there to protect their careers, and the system that rewards them with money and influence. They don\u2019t want an upstart like Assange kicking over their applecart.\nNow they will spin us a whole new set of deceptions and distractions about Assange to keep us anaesthetised, to keep us from being incensed as our rights are whittled away, and to prevent us from realising that Assange\u2019s rights and our own are indivisible.

{"text": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 In March 2014, tragedy struck the Lindblad family when Lisa Lindblad was placed on life support as a result of brain cancer.\nFor a lot of families, knowing what to do next is almost impossible. But her husband, David Lindblad, knew what steps were next, thanks to his wife's advance directive she had filled out before she went on life support.\n\"For me, the advance directive made it so I knew that I was doing exactly what she wanted when she couldn't speak for herself,\" David Lindblad said in a video interview produced by the Huntsman Cancer Institute.\nTuesday, in honor of National Healthcare Decisions Day, Huntsman Cancer Institute officials urged patients to fill out an advance directive \u2014 legal documents that outline a person's health care wishes in the event they become unable to speak for themselves.\n\"We never know when something might happen where we won't be able to speak up,\" said Sue Childress, director of nursing for the cancer institute.\nIt's important to fill the form out before a crisis, Childress noted.\n\"When no one's sick, when no one's in crisis, when everybody can just talk about it, is a much better time to have that conversation,\" she said. \"Take your time filling out the paperwork and not feeling like you've got a timeline here, you know it's a matter of life and death situation.\"\nThe paperwork itself is about eight pages and starts with naming a trusted person who would be in charge of a person's medical decisions if they ever were unable to speak for themselves.\nDr. Jamie Brant, supportive care oncologist with the institute, encouraged healthy people to consider filling the form out in case anything happens.\n\"Even if you're not having anything done, just having these conversations early I think makes a huge difference,\" Brant said. \"Because it's really unpredictable.\"\nFor David Lindblad, knowing his wife's wishes helped bring him peace of mind when she died.\n\"That's the thing is that doing what we knew that she wanted leaves no regret. I don't have any of that,\" he said in the video. \"I mean, I know everything we did was 100 percent what she wanted from the time that she couldn't speak for herself till she died.\"\nOnly 37 percent of people in the U.S. have an advance directive, according to research published in Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed medical journal. Both Brant and Childress said they want that number to increase.\n\"I think it's just never knowing what the next day will bring, being able to be clear about what's important to you and what brings quality of life so that decisions can be made to align with that,\" Brant said.\nWhile filling out the form helps family members or caretakers through the process, it isn't a perfect system, Brant said.\n\"It's certainly not perfect even if you complete them, there's still tremendous grief with loss,\" she said. \"But knowing that you were able to do what your loved one wanted or would've wanted in that situation I think alleviates at least a small part of that\"\nThis was true for the Lindblad family. Per Lisa Lindblad's wishes, she was removed from life support. However, she didn't immediately die, and in her advance directive she had requested that in that scenario she would like to be taken home to live her final hours.\nHer daughter, Ann-Marie Lindblad, said in the video that because her family knew what her mother wanted, no one wasted precious time arguing over what to do.\n\"Nobody was fighting in the end, nobody was arguing if that was the right thing to do, nobody was, you know blaming anybody,\" she said. Instead, she said her family was able to enjoy her mother's last night alive and spend time with her knowing they had given her what she wanted.\nFor families or caretakers who are now in charge of medical decisions for their loved one, who have no idea what they would want, it can be extremely difficult for them, Brant said.\n\"(If) they've never discussed it and they really don't have a sense of what their loved one would want, (it) creates not only distress during that event but when and if the patient dies the grief that occurs afterwards can become more complicated with wondering if you made the right decision,\" she said.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "John Abraham, who was last seen in Romeo Akbar Walter, is all set for another action packed film Batla House. The actor recently spoke about why he decided to turn into production and how it has had an impact on him as an actor. According to what John revealed in recent reports, the actor asserted that his acting ability has taken a quantum leap after he has become a producer.\nJohn Abraham also reasoned about why he believes that becoming a producer has changed him as an actor wherein he stated that he never got to do films that he liked. He believed that as a producer he got the opportunity to do films that he genuinely enjoyed and hence the same reflects in his performance. He also spoke about how he brought a film like RAW because he was keen on telling the story.\nThe actor turned producer elaborated on the plans he has for JA Entertainment, wherein he insisted that the past five years have just been defining years for me and that he has been researching. He assured that from now on, he knows how to take the production house forward and himself as an actor. He is also keen on having interesting actors on board like Ayushmann Khurrana in Vicky Donor for his future endeavors.\nJohn Abraham further also stated that currently audiences\u2019 choices are being kept in mind before the producers invest in films. He reportedly stated that filmmakers are now avoiding to present crap to the audiences because they are aware if they don\u2019t like it, they would be throwing the same crap out of the window.\nOn the other hand, yet another aspect that John Abraham briefly touched upon in current reports is about action heroes. The actor mentioned that he is keen on changing the image of action heroes because he believes that our cinema only portrays them as six pack abs, bulging biceps and stunts. He also added that the action heroes here lack vulnerability and he aims at changing it.\nBesides Batla House, John Abraham will also star in 1911, which is also produced by the actor. It is a period sports drama revolving around football and will be directed by Nikkhil Advani.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Leaders of the Writers Guild of America have told their 15,000 members to fire their agents.\nMembers began sending the dismissal letters to agencies soon after the announcement that negotiations for a new agreement with agencies had collapsed.\nI've fired a few agents in my time. This one was by far`the easiest! Proud to stand with my union in changing a system that is corrupt, illegal and unfair to all of us writers! #ClientsOverConflicts #IStandWithTheWGA pic.twitter.com/gTe7Tgxfzn \u2014 Curtis Kheel (@curtiskheel) April 13, 2019\nThe unprecedented move came with the WGA\u2019s negotiating committee announcing late Friday afternoon that it had not been able to reach a deal with the agents to revamp the 46-year-old franchise agreement. \u201cSo there is no settlement,\u201d the committee said.\n\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d the committee said. \u201cIn a strike situation, we all know that we are to refrain from crossing the picket line or writing for a struck company, and we\u2019re asked to show our solidarity by picketing, which is the public and moral face of our dispute.\u201d\n\u201cIn this situation there are two actions required of all members: First, do not allow a non-franchised agent to represent you with respect to any future WGA-covered work. Second, notify your agency in a written form letter that they cannot represent you until they sign the Code of Conduct.\u201d\nThe failure of the WGA and the Association of Talent Agents over the past two months to reach a deal opens the door to a potentially chaotic landscape this weekend.\nRelated The WGA and ATA Need a Voice of Reason (Column) Signs of Solidarity and Strain Emerge as Week 2 of WGA-Talent Agency Standoff Begins\n\u201cWe are in total uncharted territory,\u201d one veteran manager said. \u201cThese things are relatively easy to get into but not out of. I predict this will go on for a couple of months at a minimum.\u201d\nThe two sides were due to hold their fifth negotiating session in seven days in an attempt to revamping the rules governing how agents represent writers. The last round of negotiations launched at 3 p.m. PDT \u2014 a mere nine hours before the expiration of the current franchise agreement. Negotiations cratered in about an hour and the WGA sent out an email blast to members at 4:38 pm.\nWGA West President David Goodman said in a lengthy response to the ATA Friday that the two sides have not closed the gap.\n\u201cAs I said, we granted the week\u2019s extension as a sincere effort to try to find a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is clear to us that we are not appreciably closer. We are willing to continue meeting with you when you provide a proposal that truly addresses our expressed concerns, but our Friday deadline has arrived and we are moving forward with the implementation of our Code of Conduct and the enforcement of our WGA Working Rule 23.\u201d\nThat rule prohibits members from being represented by agents who are not signed to a WGA franchise agreement \u2014 which expires at midnight Pacific time. The guild posted an extensive FAQ for members on Friday detailing how to fire their agents.\nThe WGA had said previously that it would require its members to fire their agents if they had not agreed to a new \u201cAgency Code of Conduct,\u201d which eliminates agency packaging fees and ownership in production companies, after the current agreement expires. The code was approved in late March by 95% of guild members who voted. Nearly all the agencies have refused to sign it.\nNot surprisingly, the agents blamed the WGA for the failure to reach a deal.\n\u201cThe WGA leadership today declared a pathway for compromise doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Karen Stuart, executive director of the ATA. \u201cAgencies have been committed to reaching an agreement with the WGA but, despite our best efforts, today\u2019s outcome was driven by the Guild\u2019s predetermined course for chaos.\u201d\n\u201cThe WGA is mandating a \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 that will hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function,\u201d she added. \u201cWe came to the negotiating table in good faith and put forth comprehensive proposals providing choice, disclosure, transparency, shared revenue and a significant investment in inclusion programs. Unfortunately, not to our surprise, the WGA did not accept our offer, did not provide counterproposals and refused to negotiate further. We\u2019re prepared to continue to fight for the best interests of writers and all artists.\u201d\nThere was no indication when negotiations might resume.\nThe WGA\u2019s no-compromise stance turned out to be more than the agents could accept. The WGA has been asserting that agencies taking fees from studios for packaging business and owning production affiliates are conflicts of interests to the agencies\u2019 fiduciary duties to their writer clients.\nAs for the WGA, the agencies did not move far enough. The ATA announced Thursday night that they had offered to share a portion of the back-end profits from TV and film packaging fees with the WGA with 80% shared amongst a show\u2019s writers not participating in the profits of the series and the remaining 20% invested in initiatives to foster inclusion of underrepresented writers.\nThe sides had been facing an April 6 contract expiration deadline, but an 11th-hour gathering on that day led to the WGA agreeing to a six-day delay in the implementation of the code, followed by four negotiating sessions on April 8, 9, 11, and 12.\nThe WGA\u2019s opposition to the agencies became galvanized in early 2018 as concerns arose over CAA, WME and UTA investing in production companies \u2014 essentially, placing the agencies on both sides of the table as producers while representing writers.\nThe WGA put the agencies on notice on April 6, 2018, that it wanted to re-open negotiations on the guild\u2019s previous agency franchise agreement with the ATA, called the Artists\u2019 Managers Basic Agreement, had not been renegotiated since 1976. That meant the AMBA would be extinguished in 12 months.\nWGA leaders have repeatedly accused the agencies of engaging in illegal conduct and warned several times that they have prepared a lawsuit against the agents.\nIn a letter published on March 23, the WGA announced that nearly 800 of its most prominent showrunners and screenwriters had signed a letter backing the WGA leadership in the dispute. Signers included Shonda Rhimes, Greg Berlanti, Seth MacFarlane, Jenji Kohan, Eric Roth, Barry Jenkins and David Koepp.\nThe letter was part of a push by WGA leaders to persuade members to vote in favor on the new Agency Code of Conduct. In the middle of the five days of voting on March 29, the WGA blasted Endeavor, the parent of WME, over a report that it was planning an initial public offering.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement that Endeavor plans to become a publicly-traded company only strengthens the call for the conflicted and illegal practices of the major talent agencies to end,\u201d the guild said that day. \u201cIt is impossible to reconcile the fundamental purpose of an agency \u2014 to serve the best interests of its clients \u2014 with the business of maximizing returns for Wall Street. Writers will not be leveraged by their own representatives into assets for investors.\u201d\nWME is part of the same holding company that owns producer Endeavor Content, while CAA supports production entity Wiip. UTA partnered with MRC last year to launch producer Civic Center Media.\nA definitive signal that the chances for a deal were vanishing came on Friday morning when the ATA warned the WGA against authorizing managers and lawyers to negotiate deals for writers in place of agents, telling them that doing so is illegal and that the ATA views the authorization as \u201cunfair and unlawful competition.\u201d It warned of unspecified \u201cappropriate action\u201d if the WGA continues to authorize managers and lawyers to act as agents.\nThe WGA responded with an accusation that the ATA was trying to bully managers and lawyers.\n\u201cThe Guild stands by its action in lawfully delegating the authority it has as the exclusive representative of writers under federal law,\u201d it said. \u201cThe agencies are attempting to intimidate attorneys and managers to stop them from performing work they routinely do.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "AI models are great \u2014 after all, they\u2019re at the core of everything from voice assistants to datacenter cooling systems. But what isn\u2019t great is the time and effort required to fine-tune them. The data sets ingested by production algorithms comprise hundreds (or millions) of samples and take powerful PCs up to weeks to process. New techniques promise to expedite model training, but not all of them are generalizable.\nIt\u2019s this longstanding challenge that inspired Omri Geller, Ronen Dar, and Meir Feder to found Run:AI, a software provider developing a platform that autonomously speeds up AI development. It emerged from stealth today with $10 million in series A funding led by S Capital and TLV Partners, bringing its total raised to $13 million following a $3 million seed round, which Geller says will be used to develop the company\u2019s product offering further.\n\u201cTraditional computing uses virtualization to help many users or processes share one physical resource efficiently; virtualization tries to be generous,\u201d he added. \u201cBut a deep learning workload is essentially selfish since it requires the opposite: It needs the full computing power of multiple physical resources for a single workload, without holding anything back.\u201d\nRun:AI\u2019s software, which Geller describes as \u201clow-level\u201d and \u201cclose to the metal,\u201d creates an abstraction layer that analyzes the computational characteristics of AI workloads and uses graph-based algorithms to minimize bottlenecks, effectively optimizing the workloads for faster easier execution. It also allocates them in such a way that all available compute resources are maximized, taking into account factors like network bandwidth, compute resources, cost, and data pipeline and size.\nUnder the hood, Run:AI mathematically \u201cbreaks up\u201d AI models into multiple fragments that run in parallel, Geller says, an approach that has the added benefit of cutting down on memory usage. This in turn enables models that would otherwise be constrained by hardware limitations (chiefly graphics card memory) to run unimpeded. \u201cTraditional computing software just can\u2019t satisfy the resource requirements for deep learning workloads,\u201d he said.\nDar and Geller founded Run:AI in 2018 after studying together at Tel Aviv University under Feder, who specializes in information theory and who previously led the exit of two startups. Dar was a postdoc researcher at Bell Labs and R&D and algorithms engineer at Apple, Anobit, and Intel, and Geller was a member of an elite unit of the Israeli military where he led large-scale projects and deployments.\nThey aren\u2019t the first to market with tech that can optimize algorithms on the fly \u2014 Ontario startup DarwinAI taps a technique called generative synthesis to ingest AI models and spit out a highly optimized, compact versions of them. But one investor \u2014 TLV Partners\u2019 Rona Segev-Gal \u2014 was convinced by the wealth of expertise in hardware, parallel computing, and deep learning Run:AI\u2019s team brings to the table.\n\u201cExecuting deep neural network workloads across multiple machines is a constantly moving target, requiring recalculations for each model and iteration based on availability of resources,\u201d she said. \u201cRun:AI determines the most efficient and cost-effective way to run a deep learning training workload. We\u2019ve seen many AI companies in recent years, but Omri, Ronen, and Meir\u2019s approach blew our mind.\u201d\nRun:AI has several international customers and says that it\u2019s established a U.S. office.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "* Wily leader managed multiple crisis during his rule\n* Bashir defied Western pressure\n* Bashir in \u201csafe place\u201d (Adds defence minister announcement, details)\nBy Khalid Abdelaziz\nKHARTOUM, April 11 (Reuters) - Omar Hassan Bashir survived multiple armed rebellions, economic crises and attempts by the West to make him a pariah before he was finally ousted as Sudan\u2019s president by the military on Thursday following protests against his 30-year rule.\nIn an address on state television, Defence Minister Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf said Bashir, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1989, was under arrest in a \u201csafe place\u201d and a military council was now running the country. Sudanese sources said Bashir was at the presidential residence under heavy guard.\nTens of thousands of people danced and chanted anti-Bashir slogans in the streets of Khartoum, a sharp contrast to the past, when he fired up crowds with anti-Western rhetoric, sometimes breaking into impromptu dances.\nBashir, 75, was a master at playing rival factions among security services, the military, Islamists and armed tribes off against each other. But he underestimated the anger of young Sudanese men and women demanding an end to economic hardships.\nHe ultimately faced almost daily defiance in towns and cities across Sudan despite a crackdown by security forces using teargas and sometimes live ammunition, in which dozens of people have been killed.\nAddressing soldiers in January, Bashir warned the \u201crats to go back to their holes\u201d and said he would move aside only for another army officer or at the ballot box.\n\u201cThey said they want the army to take power. That\u2019s no problem. If someone comes in wearing khaki, we have no objection,\u201d Bashir, wearing his military uniform, told soldiers at a base in Atbara, the northern city where protests erupted.\nLater in January, Bashir declared a national state of emergency that expanded police powers and banned unlicensed public gatherings. He told parliament to postpone, not cancel, constitutional amendments that would allow him to seek another term.\nBashir, who came to power as an obscure army brigadier, has long been both a divisive and pragmatic figure.\nSudan drew heavy criticism for providing refuge to Osama bin Laden. Bashir later tried to improve the country\u2019s image by striking a 2005 peace deal that ended more than two decades of north-south civil war.\nSince taking office in what was then Africa\u2019s largest country, he fought a protracted civil war with southern rebels which ended with the secession of South Sudan in 2011, and the loss of more than 70 percent of Sudan\u2019s oil.\nSudan has suffered prolonged periods of isolation since 1993, when the United States added Bashir\u2019s government to its list of terrorism sponsors for harbouring Islamist militants. Washington followed up with sanctions four years later. The protests in Sudan followed the success of similar but much bigger demonstrations in Algeria in forcing long-ruling President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to exit.\nIn the months before protests began in Sudan, people had already been struggling to makes ends meet.\nThe government had hoped for quick financial support from wealthy Gulf Arab allies after Bashir sent troops to Yemen as part of a Saudi-led alliance fighting an Iran-aligned movement, but help was slow to arrive.\nThe trigger for the wave of protests was a government attempt to introduce unsubsidised bread. The demonstrations quickly turned political, demanding Bashir step down.\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\nBashir was born on Jan. 1, 1944 to a poor farming family in Hosh Bannaga, a small village consisting mainly of mud houses and dusty streets on the eastern bank of the Nile River, some 150 km (93 miles) north of the capital Khartoum.\nHe has often played up his humble beginnings. In January, he repeated a story he told in 2013 of how he broke a tooth while carrying concrete at a construction site where he worked as a student to pay for his education.\nBashir said he refused a silver tooth implant when he joined the military because he wanted to remember that incident whenever he looked in the mirror.\nAs a young officer in the parachute regiment, he joined the armed wing of the Islamist Movement, which broke away from the Muslim Brotherhood and has ruled Sudan since Bashir took office.\nThe head of the junta that seized power in 1989, Bashir dissolved the military council in 1993 and ruled with an iron fist.\nBut it was Bashir\u2019s response to the insurgency in the western Darfur region that has come to define his legacy.\nFacing an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over the death of an estimated 300,000 people in Darfur, Bashir held on to power as a shield against a trial similar to that of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.\nDefying the ICC, Bashir continued to visit friendly foreign states as he tried to show he had not been cowed by the international arrest warrant.\nBashir has sought to play on regional and international differences to improve Sudan\u2019s standing. In 2013, he hosted then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad in Khartoum.\nBashir courted Turkey and Russia, at the same time as Khartoum stepped up security cooperation with Washington, hoping to speed up the country\u2019s emergence from decades of U.S. sanctions that were lifted in 2017.\nFacing the most sustained challenge to his rule yet, Bashir had counted on steadfast support from the security establishment he had nurtured for three decades to see him through.\n\u201cWe say to the youth, this country is yours, protect it, and if it goes up in smoke we won\u2019t be refugees, we will die here,\u201d he said in January, wearing white robes and waving his trademark cane.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "MANCHESTER: Romelu Lukaku called on Manchester United to play with \"arrogance and confidence\" against Barcelona as they seek to overturn a 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side face an uphill battle at the Camp Nou next week after Luke Shaw's own goal gave Barca a 1-0 win in Wednesday's match at Old Trafford.\nUnited rallied after that early setback and unsettled Ernesto Valverde's side, giving Lukaku and his teammates confidence of a memorable turnaround in Spain next Tuesday.\n\"We have to believe and have the desire and more quality than today,\" said the Belgium striker. \"Be better on the ball and then you never know what can happen in football.\n\"I don't think we played with the same arrogance and confidence on the ball (early on). Second half we tried and the first 20 minutes of the second half we were there.\n\"It's something we have to do for the whole 90 minutes over there and not concede a goal and score early.\"\nThat approach worked well at Paris Saint-Germain last month as United made Champions League history by becoming the first side to progress after losing the first leg at home by two or more goals.\nThe Parc des Princes triumph was the highlight of a topsy-turvy campaign for the Old Trafford giants, but even during the difficult Jose Mourinho era they managed to seal a last-gasp 2-1 comeback win at Juventus.\nAsked if those two matches will play on Barcelona's mind, Lukaku said: \"Yeah, but I don't think they will look at us. We have to look at ourselves, get a result and give our all, run as much as we can.\"\nWednesday saw United fail to muster a shot on target for the first time in a Champions League match since 2005, but there was some promising build-up play.\n\"Definitely (they are beatable),\" Lukaku added. \"On the day you can score from one chance and that's what they did today.\n\"There was a lack of concentration and they scored a goal and from that moment on we tried to control, but I think over there we have to do a better job and stay focused a bit more, we know they have players who make late runs.\n\"For us we have to go with the desire, be focused and when the chance comes, we have to score.\"\n", "label": "human"}

The bidding process for rights to the 2021-25 editions is currently in its final phase with the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which governs professional men's tennis, expected to announce the next host city in the coming weeks.\nSingapore's National Stadium was mooted as a possible venue, with ATP representatives visiting the Republic in January and given a tour of the 55,000-capacity stadium and the OCBC Arena.\nThen, Sport Singapore (SportSG) chief executive Lim Teck Yin had referred to the 2019 Miami Open as an example of how the National Stadium could be reconfigured to stage a tennis tournament. Last month's Miami Open was held at the Hard Rock Stadium - home of American football team Miami Dolphins - where a temporary court will be built on the field.\nThe Straits Times understands a delegation which included Lim, senior officials from the Singapore Tourism Board and head of Deloitte South-east Asia's sports business group James Walton, also met ATP officials in Miami in March.\nDeloitte UK's sports business group handled the bid process for Singapore. Walton declined comment.\nRelated Story Tennis: Singapore one of five cities on shortlist to host ATP Finals from 2021\nThe US$8.5 million (S$11.7 million) ATP Finals is one of the sport's marquee events. It regularly attracts about 250,000 spectators each year at London's O2 Arena.\nThe women's equivalent of the season-finale, the US$7 million WTA Finals, was staged at the 12,000-seater Singapore Indoor Stadium from 2014 to 2018.\nIt drew about 130,000 fans a year for the first two editions and 168,000 in 2017. That figure increased by over 20 per cent last year.\nThe Chinese city of Shenzhen won the 2019-2028 hosting rights and also doubled the prize purse to US$14 million.\nAmong the factors reportedly in Turin's favour was the Italian government's willingness to commit about \u20ac15 million (S$23 million) annually for five years to the ATP Finals and also the issue of scheduling and travel time.\nThe current ATP calendar sees players conclude their season in Europe. This year's penultimate Masters 1000 tournament is in Shanghai held from Oct 6-13, followed by the Oct 28-Nov 3 Paris Masters.\nThis season's ATP Finals is scheduled for Nov 10-17.\nShould the event move to either Singapore or Tokyo, it would mean players will have to travel to China, fly to France and then return to Asia.\nRegarding the news that Turin is strongly tipped, SportSG told The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 17) it will not comment on speculations and will wait for ATP's official announcement.\nTop players, including Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, had previously voiced their opinions on the future venue of the ATP Finals.\nWhile 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer has been in favour of it remaining in London, others like Djokovic have differing views. The world No. 1 said last November: \"I just feel this is a great leverage and opportunity to promote tennis all around the world.\"\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- It's been a puzzling and potentially dangerous safety hazard for days at a busy intersection in the Historic Northeast area in Kansas City.\n\"Yeah, they should at least fix it,\" neighbor Anthony Cordon said.\nHe's scratching his head. He can't believe that at least since Sunday, five days now, a manhole just down the street from his home near Independence and Ewing hasn't been covered.\n\"Look at that hole. The manhole cover just looks broken down there,\" Cordon said.\nFOX4's Robert Townsend spotted the broken off, rusty iron plate at the bottom of the manhole that's about several feet underground.\n\"Someone could definitely hurt falling in there and possibly get stuck in there,\" Cordon said.\nA spokesperson for KC Water said they placed two barricades around the manhole on Sunday because of repair work that's going on in the area. We're also told a utility company owns the manhole.\n\"I just don't have a clue about any of it,\" Cordon said.\nRight now, no one can say for sure how long the manhole cover has been off.\nWhat is clear is the safety hazard has worried neighbors, has created traffic jams and has caused loud bangs when drivers' tires hit it.\n\"That guy just hit it, the guy who rode by. He just ran over the hole,\" said a startled Jeff Shrout, who pulled up to the intersection.\n\"Somebody knocked over the two barricades, so I'm just gonna put them back around the manhole until the city or somebody gets here. That's bad. It's just not safe. They should put a steel plate down or just another manhole cover,\" Shrout said.\nJust minutes after Shrout positioned the barricades, the driver of an 18-wheeler hit both barricades.\nAn alert passer-by saw it, hopped out of his truck and quickly picked them up so the semi driver can get back.\nOn Thursday afternoon, FOX4 then called KC Water. About 30 minutes later, the water company's workers arrived, lowered a huge steel plate off a truck and covered the hole.\nA relieved Cordon is all smiles now that the safety hazard is no more.\n\"It took awhile, but at least they patched it up. It's a good thing and much safer now,\" Cordon said.\nIn the meantime, as of Thursday, KC Water and the city's Public Works Department were still trying to figure out what company actually owns the utility manhole and exactly what it had gone uncovered for several days.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The fighting game community has expanded over the last decade, to the point where its competitive calendar provides a constant stream of tournaments to attend and watch online. While this can be overwhelming at times, it also lets players gauge their growth on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. A Dragon Ball FighterZ competitor came face to face with his own improvement after becoming champion at last weekend\u2019s South Louisiana Major (SLAM), an event he just barely lost the year before.\nGlyn-Mikl \u201cDoza\u201d Mendoza is a fantastic fighting game player, with notable wins in BlazBlue and Guilty Gear. Like many of his fellow competitors, his focus shifted to Dragon Ball FighterZ when the game released last January.\nHe had his best showing in the game a few months later at SLAM 2018, placing second behind Jose \u201cScrawtV\u201d Ballestero, one of America\u2019s best Melty Blood and Under Night In-Birth players. Doza was obviously shaken up after losing to ScrawtV a year ago by the thinnest of margins: both players were down to one remaining character in the last game of the grand finals, and Doza was unable to seal the deal.\nSince then, both players have had sporadic placings in Dragon Ball FighterZ competition. With SLAM 2019 on the horizon, they were both odds-on favourites of the 33 registered competitors to make the grand finals at the regional event last weekend in Kenner, Louisiana. They first met in winners finals, where Doza handily sent ScrawtV to losers, and again in the championship match. As a local Louisiana player, Doza had the entire crowd behind him in grand finals, forcing Atlanta native ScrawtV to deal with the added psychological pressure. Still, ScrawtV managed to reset the bracket, thanks in part to his use of the overpowering Adult Gohan.\nThe grand finals reset was much of the same, and ScrawtV looked poised to take Dragon Ball FighterZ at SLAM for a second year after going up 2-1. With the audience cheering him on, Doza tied the match at two games apiece. In the deciding game, Doza isolated ScrawtV\u2019s Adult Gohan, crippling his team\u2019s ability to output massive damage at a moment\u2019s notice. With one final combo, Doza became SLAM 2019 champion. The gathered spectators rushed the stage to hug and congratulate the local player. Like last year, he remained in his chair, overwhelmed this time with joy instead of grief.\nDecided to visit home this weekend, the crowd has been fantastic. #SLAM2019 pic.twitter.com/oII0T231My \u2014 Jarious (@saykin__) April 7, 2019\n\u201cThis win meant a lot to me,\u201d Doza wrote on Twitter afterwards. \u201cLast year, when I lost Dragon Ball FighterZ at SLAM, was the first time my emotions took control in fighting games due to anger and frustration. This year they take control for different reasons. I won SLAM 2019 for Dragon Ball FighterZ! Thank you all for believing in me.\u201d\nSouth Louisiana Major isn\u2019t the biggest fighting game tournament around, but Doza\u2019s win was just as meaningful as if he had won the Evolution Championship Series. Losing in his home state last year dealt an obvious blow to his confidence. But in becoming SLAM 2019\u2019s Dragon Ball FighterZ champion, Doza now has a tangible example of his growth as a fighting game player, a notch on his belt that he can carry to the next competition.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Poor Marilyn Monroe. What did she ever do to end up the object of such absurd debasement in Anne Carson\u2019s \u201cNorma Jeane Baker of Troy,\u201d which had its world premiere Tuesday at the Shed, the new cultural center at New York\u2019s Hudson Yards? Carson\u2019s opaque new play with a score by Paul Clark is performed in the Shed\u2019s Griffin Theater, which has the immediate distinction of being one of the least intimate Off Broadway spaces in New York City. It seats only 500 but makes the Little Shubert feel downright cozy.\nNow for the other news. I attend close to 200 productions of plays, musicals and operas a year. Never have I seen so many walk-outs in 90 minutes (the running time of \u201cNorma Jeane\u201d) as I did at a preview of Carson\u2019s play. The impatience of the remaining theatergoers resulted in the collective mortal sin of several cellphones being lit up during the performance. Who can blame people for wanting to know when their 90 minutes of purgatory is up?\nCarson takes Euripides\u2019s tragedy \u201cHelen\u201d and puts Marilyn Monroe at the center of the battle, even though in \u201cNorma Jeane\u201d neither Helen nor Marilyn ever goes to Troy. \u201cIt was a cloud that went to Troy,\u201d we are told. Indeed, men throughout history have had a way of blaming women for everything. Carson\u2019s constant feminist refrain is \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster to be a girl.\u201d The line is repeated often as if to blot out Rodgers & Hammerstein\u2019s offensive \u201cI enjoy being a girl.\u201d\nAlso Read: 'Oklahoma!' Broadway Review: A Joltingly Dark Revival of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Sunny Classic\nBen Whishaw plays Marilyn/Norma Jeane, or rather he plays a young man in suit and tie (costumes by Sussie Juhlin-Wallen) who dictates a modern update of the Euripides play to a stenographer (Renee Fleming) on New Year\u2019s Eve, 1963. The two of them sit at desks in a very film noir office (set by Alex Eales, the minimal lighting by Anthony Doran) before Whishaw begins to dress up like Marilyn Monroe in \u201cThe Seven Year Itch,\u201d complete with her signature white halter-top dress and ukulele. Ukulele? Maybe Whishaw\u2019s drag persona borrows it from Sugar in \u201cSome Like It Hot,\u201d but then, inconsistency is Carson\u2019s trademark.\nWhishaw\u2019s young man first mentions Marilyn in her preproduction days on \u201cClash by Night\u201d where MGM is helping to wage the battle of Troy \u2014 even though RKO released Fritz Lang\u2019s 1952 classic.\nWhishaw often dictates that Marilyn \u201center as Truman Capote\u201d before imitating that writer\u2019s high-pitched voice. This Marilyn also has a young daughter, Hermione, which is also the name of Helen\u2019s long-lost daughter. Marilyn\u2019s Hermione lives in New York City, and occasionally Pearl Bailey makes an appearance there.\nAlso Read: 'King Lear' Broadway Review: Glenda Jackson Triumphs in Cluttered Mess of a Revival\nLess clear is a man named Arthur. Is this Arthur Miller? Even though Carson never gives the man\u2019s last name, I assume it is the playwright because Whishaw\u2019s Marilyn tells her psychiatrist that she isn\u2019t attracted to Arthur\u2019s buttocks; they remind her of an Asian boy\u2019s and her shrink is into Asian boys and maybe his (the shrink\u2019s) interest will rub off on her (Monroe) so she\u2019ll then be aroused by her third and final husband (Miller). Why does this strange interlude in \u201cNorma Jeane\u201d bring to mind Arthur Miller? Because in his play \u201cAfter the Fall\u201d the Monroe character accuses the Miller character of wearing tight pants to show off his butt to attract homosexuals. OK, you think of a better explanation.\nFleming\u2019s stenographer tells us that whenever reporters (male, most likely) did phone interviews with Marilyn, they always asked, \u201cWhat do you have on?\u201d and she always replied, \u201cNothing but the radio.\u201d Actually, Marilyn said that once: When asked \u201cwhat she had on\u201d for the famous nude photo shoot that launched Playboy.\nCarson plays slow and loose with the Monroe legend, and in press materials, she connects her subject to the #MeToo movement. #WhatAgain? is more like it. Why the playwright leaves out the Kennedy brothers is anyone\u2019s guess.\nAlso Read: Hannah Gadsby's Next Show About a Dog Named 'Douglas' Is Coming to New York\nPaul Clark has written some bluesy music for Fleming to sing, and she sounds ravishing \u2014 that is, when Whishaw\u2019s prerecorded speaking voice isn\u2019t competing with her vocals. Near the end of \u201cNorma Jeane,\u201d Fleming drops her stenographer role and essentially ends up writing the young man\u2019s play. Whishaw\u2019s Marilyn is now too zonked out on pills and champagne to make sense, which had never been the character\u2019s strong suit. Women (Fleming and Carson) are finally telling women\u2019s stories after Euripides, Arthur Miller, Truman Capote, Fritz Lang and a drag queen have made such a muck of them.\nWhishaw\u2019s imitation of Capote is very convincing. Regarding his Marilyn, she can best be described as Tony Perkins in a blond wig near the end of \u201cPsycho.\u201d\nKatie Mitchell directs the mass confusion on stage.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In this March 15, 2013, file photo, a Facebook employee walks past a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\nWASHINGTON (CN) \u2013 Executives from Facebook and Twitter defended their platforms Wednesday against claims they censor conservative voices, pointing to an internal study conducted this year showing posts by Republican and Democratic lawmakers were viewed at the same rate.\nInsisting the social media site doesn\u2019t take sides, Carlos Monje Jr., the director of public policy for Twitter in the United States and Canada, insisted to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that \u201cTwitter does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation whether it is related to automatically ranked content or who enforces platform rules.\u201d\nIn fact, Monje said, Twitter \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite platform \u2013 is \u201cactually very popular for conservative voices.\u201d\nOver five weeks between February and March, Twitter reviewed tweets by all members of the House and Senate and after controlling for factors like follower counts and response rates, there was \u201cno statistical difference between the number of times a tweet is viewed by Democrats or Republicans.\u201d\nTheir post performance was the same and the only reason why content was \u201cdownrated,\u201d Monje said, was because a significant number of that account\u2019s followers had a history of breaking terms of service.\nOnce the issue was identified, it was resolved typically with 24 hours, he added.\nNeil Potts, Facebook\u2019s public policy director who just a day earlier testified before the House Judiciary Committee about the rise of white nationalism and big tech\u2019s role in managing the spread of hate speech online, also assured senators on Wednesday that Facebook did not penalize users who espouse conservative views.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t suppress conservative speech,\u201d Potts said.\nInsinuations that Facebook uses an algorithm that captures words conservatives frequently use and then flags that user\u2019s account or removes posts are also completely unfounded, Potts testified under oath.\nCommunity standards guiding which content is removed from Facebook are broader than the guidance implemented at Twitter, he acknowledged, saying Facebook uses over 22 standards to moderate content.\nBut Facebook sees over a billion uploads a day from all over the world and this makes perfect moderation impossible, Potts said.\nTwitter, according to Monje, moderates 5 billion tweets every day.\nRepublicans on the committee were not alone in their frustration with the social media giants.\nDemocratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii expressed frustration that families of the victims killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting \u201cbarely had time to bury their children\u201d before conspiracy theories began to circulate online.\nRobbie Parker, whose child was killed at Sandy Hook just over six years ago, was also called to testify Wednesday.\nAfter the shooting, Parker went directly to Twitter and Facebook for help in removing posts accusing him of being a crisis actor and participating in a hoax.\n\u201cHe had to deal with people telling him his daughter didn\u2019t die and the shooting was staged as a way to confiscate people\u2019s guns. Until this day, if you Google Robbie, you are linked to videos claiming Sandy Hook was a hoax,\u201d Hirono said.\nA representative from Google was invited by Democrats on the committee to testify during Wednesday\u2019s hearing but the invitation was rescinded by Chairman Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas.\nGoogle intended to send Max Pappas, now the company\u2019s manager of external policy and partnerships, but Cruz confirmed Wednesday that Pappas\u2019 testimony was rejected because he was \u201cnot senior enough.\u201d\nBefore joining Google, Pappas served as an aide to Cruz from 2013 to 2017.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Google said Pappas was their \u201cmost qualified subject matter expert.\u201d Though the Republican majority would not allow Pappas to testify in person, Senator Hirono\u2019s request for Pappas\u2019 prepared testimony to be entered into the formal record was approved.\nCruz also had questions for Potts and Monje on shadow bans, a practice that Republican Representative Devin Nunes of California claimed in a recent $250 million defamation lawsuit against Twitter was a regular feature of the social media platform\u2019s operations.\nShadow banning is a process in which users are allowed to post online freely but their messages, after manipulation by the platform, are seen by no one else. Monje and Potts both denied the practice occurs.\nBut if a user\u2019s posts can be downgraded, Cruz asked, what is the difference between that and shadow banning?\n\u201cIf we have signals that indicate a person is being spammy, using multiple accounts to post the same thing, or they\u2019re using automated activity or it\u2019s abusive, or even if we\u2019re unsure if they\u2019re breaking the rules, we make it harder for the content to be found in search results and in conversations,\u201d Monje said.\nCruz also took issue with Twitter\u2019s assertion that it does not censor conservative voices by using an algorithm targeting words conservatives may use frequently online.\nDisplaying a poster featuring a snippet of a conversation allegedly captured by an undercover member of the conservative activist group Project Veritas with a former engineer for Twitter, Cruz read the engineer\u2019s statement back to Monje: \u201cYou look for Trump or America, or any of the 5,000 keywords to describe a \u2018redneck.\u2019\u201d\nMonje replied that the engineer was not representing Twitter but made the comment socially and was showboating, believing the undercover activist was interested in him romantically.\n\u201cWe never use political ideation. That was big talk by someone who thought he was on a date,\u201d Monje said before clarifying another Twitter-related quote Cruz brought up earlier in the hearing.\nThe statement was from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who in an interview with podcaster Sam Harris in February said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we can afford to take a neutral stance anymore. I don\u2019t believe that we should optimize for neutrality.\u201d\nCruz leaned on the statement as proof of Twitter\u2019s intent to harm conservatives but Monje said the quote was incomplete and the entire back end of Dorsey\u2019s statement was missing.\nReading from the interview with Harris, Monje quoted Dorsey\u2019s very next sentence: \u201cNeutrality is not what we\u2019re aiming for but I do believe we should optimize for impartiality. Neutrality is a lot more passive and hands off.\u201d\nWhile some may push for restrictions or forced equivalencies \u2013 standards mandating that platforms allow an equal number of posts on a contentious issue such as abortion \u2013 Senator Hirono warned against such a practice.\n\u201cThere are a lot of vile things on both of your platforms that I wish could be taken down\u2026 but short some kind of equivalency of the kind of content allowed online, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re supposed to be assured that there\u2019s no bias,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cBut if we were to limit comments to an equal number \u2013 you would push out a lot of posts that wouldn\u2019t meet that numerical equivalent.\u201d\nBoth Potts and Monje agreed that no forced equivalencies could be made if free speech and expression were to remain intact.\n\u201cThe algorithm allows for a free flow and if there are more pro-life posts, for example, so be it. If there are more pro-choice posts, so be it. We just want a free flow of ideas,\u201d Potts said.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Canadian businessman partners with Staples Canada on new office offerings.\nThese days, Joe Mimran isn\u2019t much of a doodler.\n\u201cI used to have a lot of doodling in my early days. You will see my notebooks were full of doodles. These days, I don\u2019t really have the time to doodle,\u201d he says with a laugh.\nWhile his latest collaboration, which sees him team up with Staples Canada, has plenty of notebooks for writing things down in, and yes, even doodling if you so desire \u2014 he isn\u2019t quite ready to launch a \u201cdoodling incubator\u201d just yet. In fact, doodling, may just be dead.\n\u201cYou know, the thing is, people don\u2019t use phones as much. I used to doodle a lot when I was on the phone. Right? You\u2019d be on the phone with people. And, today, you\u2019re either texting or emailing. You don\u2019t have that time when you\u2019re talking and aimlessly doodling. I think maybe doodling is going to become a lost art,\u201d he jokes.\nWhat the celebrated Canadian businessman and creative behind companies including Joe Fresh and President\u2019s Choice by Loblaws will be introducing, however, are chic accessories and accoutrements to make modern workspaces more functional, yes, but also fashionable.\n\u201cFor me, there\u2019s always one, two, three notebooks with blank, unlined pages. I need unlined because I will sometimes sketch something as opposed to just writing something. I love the quality of a good paper, I love the quality of a good pen. I still find it really important as an entrepreneur to write down my ideas to commit them to paper and to really have a goal and a strategy for how to get to my end point,\u201d he says of his own office essentials. \u201cAnd then, of course, I need all my power tools, which are of course my computer, my wireless speaker, my earbuds. Everything has to be Bluetooth and I need my power cords all done in a certain way.\u201d\nMimran was approached by the company to help revitalize its offering after Staples Canada was acquired by Sycamore Capital in 2017.\n\u201cThey asked me if I would be interested in working with them on product design, sourcing, working with their category teams and it was a super interesting project,\u201d he says.\nAfter reviewing in-depth research that was compiled from feedback of the office supply store\u2019s customers, Mimran and his team realized it was time for something new.\n\u201cThe consumer was looking for newness, excitement, collaboration,\u201d he says. \u201cOut of all that research came this new brand purpose for Staples, which is the working and learning company. And then, how does product and design play into that? And that\u2019s where we play a pretty significant role in really bringing the design focus and turning some of the more mundane views of office supply into a more fulsome assortment.\u201d\nThe resulting collection includes Joe\u2019s Perfect Picks, a curated offering of chic-and-functional workspace items ranging from notebooks to Bluetooth speakers. The initial release, he says, will be followed with a series of launches during the next 12 to 18 months that will feature \u201cdesign-led\u201d items for the modern workspace.\nWhile workspace design and office supplies may seem like a leap for the designer and Dragons\u2019 Den star, the move to create stylish lifestyle pieces at an affordable price point is very much in keeping with his influence in design, overall. For Mimran, it\u2019s not about how much something costs that\u2019s important \u2014 but rather how appealing the design is for a broader, cost-conscious consumer base.\n\u201cIt takes just as much time to design a beautiful, simple mug as it does to design an ugly mug. So, you have to ask yourself, why do people design so many ugly mugs?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the time, effort, the ability \u2014 and I think it\u2019s the care, the attention, the desire and the passion \u2014 all of these things. So, why should people be subjected to a bad mug or a bad basic T-shirt? You don\u2019t have to be.\n\u201cIf you take the time, you can produce something that is quite beautiful, and yet quite approachable. \u2026 And that\u2019s always the challenge: How do I do something that\u2019s beautiful, that\u2019s simple, approachable and is considered in good taste? Really, that has been my hallmark for years. And, it feels like I just keep getting drawn to that same sort of solution.\u201d\nFor Mimran, it\u2019s this design-cost challenge \u2014 not to mention the effort involved with adding an element of interest to otherwise unsexy office supplies \u2014 that he\u2019s happy to accept.\n\u201cI love the challenge of it. When I was challenged to try to create a line for a food retailer, people thought I was kind of crazy. But, there is a real challenge in trying to bring innovation and newness to what has been a pretty boring category. And that\u2019s what I love about it,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes, you get greater creativity when you are put in a box and are forced to come up with ideas as opposed to just having a freewheeling approach.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m also always very interested in retail innovation. I like anything that touches the consumer that has a design focus to it. Tomorrow, it could be pet accessories \u2014 I don\u2019t limit myself when I think about how to touch the consumer and how it relates to retail. Whether it be bricks and mortar, or whether it be online. And then, how does design impact all of those.\u201d\nIn the age of social media \u2014 providing an endless stream of images and inspiration at our fingertips \u2014 Mimran says consumers are hungry for well-designed items in all areas of their lives. Their offices included.\n\u201cThe advent of social media has made product really front and centre,\u201d he says. \u201cI think design today, and the access to great design today, is what\u2019s making design so much more critical. I\u2019ve always believed that design does matter and design can help make businesses better. And good design is good business. That\u2019s proven out by some of the greatest companies out there today.\u201d\nBut, his outlook on the future of design, in North America specifically, wasn\u2019t always so optimistic. In fact, Mimran recalls a time, not too long ago, when he wondered what the future of it would be; pondering whether or not people even cared about the way things looked anymore at all.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in design for quite a long time. And I\u2019ve seen how it has evolved. In the early days, I was worried about design. I thought, is North America going to become culturally deprived, from a design standpoint?\u201d he says. \u201cAnd yet, what we saw was that North America started to create a food culture that was very unique and to unto itself. It started to create a design culture that has really been built up over the years. So, this notion that perhaps we were going to slip into a world where people didn\u2019t care about design \u2014 it has actually gone the other way.\u201d\nAnd, he says, we just may have millennials to thank for that.\n\u201cMillennials today are very attuned to design. They\u2019re very interested in how things are made and where things are made. And how things are finished. I think that today, there\u2019s a sensitivity that there wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says.\nThe Gen Y group (those born in the early 1980s to the early 2000s) are also contributing to the evolving idea of modern office spaces and co-working environments, he says. Mimran pointed to the co-working space available in the Toronto flagship Staples store as further proof that, these days, an office can be anywhere.\n\u201cIt really speaks to how many people aren\u2019t working out of offices, per se. They\u2019re spending a lot of time in Starbuck\u2019s because that\u2019s where they can get Wi-Fi and drinks and a space to work in,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think that will continue to be a trend, particularly as more and more people become entrepreneurs. That, as more and more people have multiple careers throughout their one career. And I do think it\u2019s a way to network.\n\u201cToday, I think networking is a huge part of business. Collaborating is a huge part of business. And I think these co-working spaces are a very productive way of getting to that.\u201d\nAharris@postmedia.com\n", "label": "human"}

In New York alone, we\u2019ve had Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, and now C.C. Sabathia all announce at the start of a season that they will retire at the end of that season. Dwayne Wade and Dirk Nowitzki both had similar celebrations as they closed out their careers in basketball this month.\n\u201cI think I will go the traditional route,\u201d Manning said on Monday with a bit of bewilderment at the idea of orchestrating such a celebration. \u201cI thought that was a baseball thing. I know some basketball players have done it, but I don\u2019t see going out that way.\u201d\nFootball players rarely do. Tiki Barber may have been the last to announce his retirement from the Giants in mid-season back in 2006, and it wound up creating more of a distraction than a festivity.

So too did Michael Strahan and Rob Gronkowski.\nFigure on Eli Manning going out the same way he has played most of his career, with quiet dignity and professionalism.

{"text": "BRISTOL, Tenn. \u2014 Kyle Busch was in the race Sunday at Bristol Motor Speedway, so of course, he won.\nBusch grabbed his third Cup win of the season, eighth overall at Bristol, and 10th this year spanning all three of NASCAR\u2019s national series.\nThe victory Sunday came at the expense of his older brother, who lined up right beside him on the final restart but couldn\u2019t slow Busch\u2019s steamrolling of the competition this year. The Busch Brothers were first in line not to pit for tires during the 11th caution to set up a final shootout between Bristol\u2019s two winningest active drivers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome to be able to snooker those guys, get our win today here at Bristol. Love this place,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIt was fun to battle out the brother there at the end.\u201d\nKurt Busch is a six-time winner at the .533-mile high-banked oval and lamented over the P.A. system that he should have wrecked his brother for the win. The crowd roared and affirmed Kurt Busch\u2019s frustration with the final results.\n\u201cThat one is tough. I really wanted to beat him. I was going to wreck him,\u201d Kurt Busch said. \u201cFigure he could give a little love to his brother. I wanted that one bad. Feel like him right now \u2014 I\u2019m all mad because I didn\u2019t win.\u201d\nKyle Busch seems to win all the time this season, in anything he drives. Along with teammate Denny Hamlin, they\u2019ve given Joe Gibbs Racing five wins through the first eight races. If a Gibbs car doesn\u2019t win, then a Ford from Team Penske will, and that organization has the other three Cup victories this year.\nAnd the win was probably going to go to either Penske driver Brad Keselowski or Joey Logano until a late caution forced teams to gamble and go in for tires or stay on track and try to maintain their track position for the final 14 laps. The leaders \u2014 Logano and Keselowski \u2014 went to pit road, while Busch and his big brother moved to the front of the field.\nIt set up the storybook final ending on a weekend the entire sport has honored Hall of Famer Darrell Waltrip, the all-time winningest driver at Bristol with 12 victories. He used this venue to announce he\u2019ll retire as Fox Sports\u2019 lead analyst after 19 seasons, and his success at making this concrete jungle his playground was celebrated as Waltrip waved the green flag to start the race and was wired by the network to give his trademark \u201cBoogity! Boogity! Boogity! Let\u2019s go racing, boys!\u201d call from the flagstand.\nBut Waltrip barely had time to catch his breath before an accident on the second lap brought action to a halt. The crash collected Kyle Busch, damaged his Toyota and sent him to pit road for repairs.\nBut what was once Waltrip\u2019s domain now belongs to Kyle Busch, and not much can stop him these days, especially at Bristol.\nFitting, then, that he found himself out front in an entertaining, old-fashioned Bristol barnburner.\nThe race had 11 cautions, 21 lead changes and a very familiar face in victory lane.\nKyle Busch and his brother have combined to win the last four Cup races at Bristol, and Kyle Busch has 22 total wins at the track. But success is measured in the Cup Series, and Kyle Busch has wins to collect to catch Waltrip.\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t 12, that\u2019s for sure. So I got more to go. We\u2019re getting there and it\u2019s fun,\u201d Kyle Busch said.\nHARVICK PENALIZED\nKevin Harvick\u2019s car failed inspection three times before the start of the race to draw race-crippling penalties. NASCAR ejected his engineer from the event, forced Harvick to give up his 13th-place starting spot and drop to the back of the field and serve a pass-thru penalty at the start. It was certain to drop him several laps behind the leader immediately, but a caution on the second lap of the race as Harvick was on pit road mitigated the damage.\nHarvick had a myriad of issues during the race and at one point dropped four laps behind the leader, but he had scrambled to the lead lap for the final restart and managed to finish 13th \u2014 exactly where he would have started if his car had not failed inspection.\nALMIROLA OUT\nAric Almirola\u2019s race lasted just two laps before William Byron wiggled into him and sent Almirola\u2019s car into the wall. The damage ensured him a last-place finish after starting sixth.\nAlmirola chalked the incident up to second-year Cup driver Byron\u2019s inexperience and potential \u201cpanic\u201d when cars began to pass him at the start of the race. Byron started second on the front row.\n\u201cHe spun his tires on the start \u2026 and he just lost it,\u201d Almirola said. \u201cHe got loose underneath me, lost it and ran right into the side of us and wrecked us. Part of that comes with experience, I guess.\u201d\nUP NEXT\nAnother short track, Saturday night at Richmond Raceway.

{"text": "For some women, having multiple orgasms is the sexual Mount Everest of pleasure. However, Stella Harris, Intimacy Educator, Sex Coach, and author of Tongue Tied: Untangling Communication in Sex, Kink, and Relationships, tells SheKnows that multiple orgasms can be a bit of a misnomer. \u201cThe orgasms don\u2019t necessarily happen one right after the other,\u201d she explains.\nMultiples orgasms come in a variety of formats. For people with vulvas and vaginas, Harris notes that sometimes one kind of orgasm is one-and-done, but another may allow them to keep going. \u201cFor example, maybe someone can only have one clitoral orgasm but can have multiple internal (or g-spot) orgasms. Or vice versa,\u201d Harris says.\nMeanwhile, some people can have a series of less intense orgasms followed by a bigger one to top it off, explains Dr. Jess O\u2019Reilly, Astroglide\u2019s resident sexologist. \u201cOthers find that each orgasm becomes more intense, while others find that the intensity decreases with each orgasm.\u201d\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to experience multiple orgasms? But sometimes we can get so caught up in that goal that we don\u2019t enjoy the moment. \u201cThere is no right way to have an orgasm or experience multiple orgasms, so just do what feels good for you and enjoy the process rather than keeping count,\u201d says O\u2019Reilly.\nIf you want to try and pull off multiple orgasms, here are some tips to improve your Big O odds:\nApply constant pressure and stimulation\n\u201cMuch like the G-spot orgasm, it requires a consistent and constant stimulation to get closer to multiple orgasms,\u201d says Mackenzie Riel, sex and relationship expert for TooTimid.com. Riel suggests the best way to make the most of this would be to get yourself to orgasm, but as you start to come down from the orgasm, keep the stimulation going. \u201cIt will help keep you aroused as you reach for round two. Keep in mind that sometimes overstimulation will have the adverse effect of getting you to orgasm again. Listen to your body and try to feel it out; only you know what it takes to get aroused enough to reach climax.\u201d\nTry a new approach (or two)\nAlthough there are no moves or techniques that will guarantee multiple orgasms, O\u2019Reilly suggests considering these approaches:\nPress and Pulse: When you feel orgasm approaching, press your hand over your lips to cover the entire vulva. Pulse in rhythm with your orgasmic contractions and see if the contractions become more intense or multiply to prolong the orgasmic experience.\nBreathe mindfully: Exaggerate your breath. Inhale and exhale purposefully \u2014 as slowly and deeply as possible. As you near orgasm, you might be inclined to start taking quick, shallow breaths, but by breathing more deeply and being more mindful of your orgasmic contractions, you might find that they multiply. (If you want to learn more about breath and energy orgasms, check out the work of Barbara Carrellas.)\nChange techniques: If your first orgasm results from clitoral stimulation, switch to the G-Spot at the first sign of orgasmic contractions. Recent research suggests that exploring multiple regions of the body may be the key to multiples.\nPush through: When you reach orgasm, the head of your clitoris can become hypersensitive, so you likely avoid direct contact. But if you push through and keep stimulating the area with your fingertips, a toy, or your partner\u2019s lips, you might discover a simple path to multiples.\nGrab a vibrator\nUsing a vibrator can be more effective, if not the most effective way to have multiple orgasms. Vibrators provide constant stimulation, along with different patterns and intensities depending on what gets you closer to climax. \u201cYou can use a vibrator made specifically to hold against the clit, and perhaps insert a dildo, or do a twofer with a rabbit vibrator,\u201d says Riel. \u201cThese kinds of toys are designed to be more powerful than using a hand, so they are definitely a good way to get yourself more stimulated.\u201d\nStimulate both the clitoris and the vagina\n\u201cA blended orgasm is an action of having both a clit and an internal vaginal orgasm simultaneously,\u201d Riel says. \u201cWhen both are mutually aroused, the resulting orgasm can be extremely intense. With this intensity comes heightened arousal, which in turn will make it easier to have multiple orgasms.\u201d\nUse pornography or whatever turns you on\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be easier for you to have an intense orgasm if you have some form of stimulation that gets you aroused,\u201d Riel says. It could be your favorite porn clip or even a few pages of steamy erotica. \u201cExperiment and try to find what is that gets you going.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

Before that, it was a story about Buttigieg learning Norwegian after reading a translated book by a Norwegian author\u2014and wanting to read that writer's other work in their native language.\nFolds snapped a selfie with Mayor Pete Buttigieg on-stage in 2015. Ben Folds\nThose stories seem to be making an impression: The 37-year-old came in third in an Emerson poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus voters released on Sunday.\nFour years before he announced his candidacy, Folds could tell there was something different about the young mayor.\n\u201cThe thing that struck me about the audience was that Pete\u2019s presence didn\u2019t elicit the predictable \u2018political\u2019 feel that comes over an audience when they\u2019re confronted with a politician. Having a politician on is guaranteed to feel a little stiff and usually somewhat divisive at a concert,\u201d Folds said. \u201cBut this was more like having world\u2019s most beloved entertainer onstage. Lots of 'PEEEETE!!!' across all types, young and old. And he didn\u2019t take the moment to grab the mic and talk or linger on stage. Total class.\u201d\nMy friend just sent me a video of @PeteButtigieg playing piano for @BenFolds and it\u2019s... even better than I could have imagined? \u2014 Kristina Lucarelli \ud83d\ude11 (@KristinaLuca) April 2, 2019\nIt wasn't the mayor's first performance. According to his official bio, he is an \"active musician,\" who plays guitar as well as the piano, and he's performed with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. In 2015, Folds was performing with the orchestra in honor of the city's 150th anniversary.\nYesterday, Buttigieg tweeted the video of his duet with Folds, saying: \"That was a good day.\"\nThat was a good day https://t.co/adwbuvpshj \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) April 2, 2019\nThat show was the only one Buttigieg has played with Folds, but the two stay in touch with the occasional Twitter joke. And Folds said when he heard Buttigieg was marrying Chasten Buttigieg last June, he sent the couple a photographic print based on his song \"The Luckiest,\" which is popular at weddings.\nAs far as Buttigieg's 2020 run, Folds said, \"I think if he manages to bring people together the way I saw from the stage in South Bend, he\u2019s going to bring a great gift to the national conversation and its tone. \"\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Last night, the Academy of Country Music Awards audience was filled in on a secret that This Is Us fans have known for years: Chrissy Metz is too good of a singer to ignore. Before last night, Metz had never sung on live television \u2014 though her This Is Us character, Kate Pearson, has demonstrated her singing talents many times over. At the ACM Awards, Metz performed an emotionally stunning rendition of \u201cI\u2019m Standing With You,\u201d from her upcoming movie Breakthrough. And she wasn\u2019t alone up there: country music stars Carrie Underwood, Lauren Alaina, Mickey Guyton and Maddie & Tae all joined in on her performance, making it a truly unforgettable number.\nWhat do these stars have in common? First of all, they\u2019re all featured on the Breakthrough soundtrack (which is already available on iTunes, if you\u2019re impatient). Second, they\u2019re all musicians Metz has looked up to throughout her life. While chatting with PEOPLE on the ACM\u2019s red carpet pre-show, Metz gushed over the opportunity: \u201cAs a little girl, you always dream about something like this. But to actually do it and to hold a stage with these incredible women \u2014 Lauren Alaina, Carrie Underwood, Maddie + Tae, Mickey Guyton. Are you kidding? It\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\nMetz took to Instagram Monday morning to share her continued gratitude. \u201cSinging this song with such wonderful women, artists and this amazing choir was truly a gift wrapped in the most special of bows!\u201d she writes, before thanking her co-stars and the rest of the Breakthrough team.\nIf you\u2019re craving more of Metz\u2019s singing, Breakthrough comes out Easter 2019. Until then, we\u2019ll just have to content ourselves with re-watching old episodes of This Is Us \u2014 although, given the overwhelming reaction to Metz\u2019s performance last night, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if she picked up a few new musical projects this year. Maybe even (*crosses fingers*) an album of her own? A girl can dream.\n", "label": "human"}

It\u2019s not on the Upper East Side or Billionaires\u2019 Row \u2014 it\u2019s at 35 Hudson Yards, the tallest residential building at the just-opened megadevelopment. The residences begin on the 53rd floor of the 92-story tower, with views looking out to Hudson Yards\u2019 landscaped grounds and staircased Vessel, as well as the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline. (The under-construction Equinox Hotel is located below.)\nSales launched in March with prices from $5 million. The two- to six-bedroom dwellings run from 1,500 to 10,000 square feet. Great room ceilings reach nearly 11 feet high, master suites have large walk-in closets and the kitchens have cabinets that designer Tony Ingrao crafted in collaboration with Smallbone of Devizes.\nThe building, with architecture by David Childs and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, offers residents access to the 60,000-square-foot Equinox Fitness Club and Spa, as well as a SoulCycle \u2014 and 22,000 square feet of its own private amenities. The latter includes a fitness center, a lounge with billiards and a dining room with space for more than 50 guests.\nContact: Related Sales and Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, 212-385-3535\nThe Centrale\nThe Centrale, a 71-story tower that recently began sales (one-bedrooms from $1.82 million), may not be the tallest in Manhattan. But it\u2019s the tallest project in the portfolio of Champalimaud \u2014 Alexandra Champalimaud\u2019s design firm, known for kitting out the fanciest hotels in the world, which is handling the Centrale\u2019s interiors.\nThe team also includes developer Ceruzzi Properties and Pelli Clarke Pelli for architecture. Located at 138 E. 50th St., the Centrale has 124 condominium homes, all of which have 6-inch-wide white oak floors. Ceiling heights range from over 9 feet to 12 feet, and all living spaces have Nest thermostats.\nResidents enter through a discrete porte-coch\u00e8re leading into the Champalimaud-designed lobby. The Centrale additionally fits a private dining room, a gym curated by The Wright Fit and a conference room.\nContact: Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, 212-308-5050\nSkyline Tower\nEven though Amazon pulled out of Queens, the plans are still on for Skyline Tower, a 67-story structure rising up across from One Court Square \u2014 a k a the Citigroup Building \u2014 where the e-commerce giant was planning on having temporary office space. That height makes this building, which launches sales in May, the tallest residential property in Queens.\nGiven its size, it\u2019s no surprise 802 units \u2014 studios to four-bedrooms, with prices from $500,000 to $4 million \u2014 fit inside. Their floor-to-ceiling windows look out to the surrounding neighborhood, as well as Manhattan over the East River. Kitchens have quartz countertops and backsplashes, as well as Bosch appliances.\nAnticipating warm weather, 155 units come with private terraces. Elsewhere, owners will have 18,000 square feet of amenities at their disposal: lounges with billiards; an indoor pool; a fitness center and a business center among them.\nContact: Modern Spaces, 646-448-7100\nThe Park Loggia\nDeveloper AvalonBay Communities has a national portfolio of homes. And now, it\u2019s bringing its first-ever condo to New York City.\nThe Park Loggia, near Lincoln Center at 15 W. 61st St., launches in early May. Prices for the 32-story tower\u2019s 172 homes range from roughly $1 million for a studio to more than $10 million for a four-bedroom penthouse. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill has designed airy units with ceilings approximately 10 feet high. The two- and three-bedroom homes have private loggia outdoor spaces.\nPembrooke & Ives designed the common areas and amenities, which include a garden, a lounge with a dining room, plus music practice rooms.\nContact: Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, 212-698-1561\nRose Hill\nDeveloper Rockefeller Group, formed more than 90 years ago, is best known for Rockefeller Center \u2014 home to NBC and the famed Christmas tree. But only now is it building its first New York residential tower. The condominium, named Rose Hill, is located at 30 E. 29th St. \u2014 and gets its name from the erstwhile 130-acre Rose Hill Farm estate, whose grounds it stands on. The Art Deco-inspired facade is the work of husband-and-wife architects Nancy Ruddy and John Cetra (above, left).\nSales are set to launch in May, but prices aren\u2019t yet available.\nThe 123 residences span studios to three-bedrooms; many have private outdoor spaces. Rose Hill will sport a full package of amenities, including a health and wellness club with a 50-foot indoor pool, a residents\u2019 club with an observatory and a private dining room and a pet salon.\nContact: CORE, 212-433-3029\nThey\u2019re converts!\nThree old commercial buildings are being re-imagined with apartments.\nSociety House\nLiving in the thick of the newly opened Hudson Yards development will cost a pretty penny \u2014 a two-bedroom at condo tower 15 Hudson Yards is listed for $4.36 million. But a few blocks away from the action \u2014 think shops, restaurants and even the Vessel staircase installation \u2014 is more affordable condo project Society House. This office-to-residential conversion at 335 W. 35th St. launches sales this spring, with studios from $800,000 to two-bedrooms from $1.4 million.\nFeatures inside the 66 apartments include ceilings 8 to 10 feet high, updated triple-pane glass windows, and marble and oak touches. But the building, designed by Isaac & Stern Architects and developed by the TF Chen family, will also house the two-story TF Chen Cultural Center.

{"text": "Last week, I made my way to the Microsoft Reactor in San Francisco for the VR Arcade conference. I moderated a panel on investing in virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality. It was a far different environment for that kind of conversation than in 2016 or earlier.\nThe event itself represented a pivot. Since consumer VR hasn\u2019t taken off as much as expected, companies have shifted gears in augmented reality on smartphones or the VR arcade market. We are holding our own GamesBeat Summit 2019 conference on April 23-24 in Los Angeles at a \u201cmicro-amusement park\u201d dubbed Two Bit Circus. Such places are sprouting up all over.\nDo these VR arcades represent a good investment, or are seasoned investors looking into other opportunities. We asked that question on our panel.\nMy panelists included Stephen Saltzman, founder of Saltzman Strategies & Alliances; Yasushi Komori, a partner at the GFR Fund; Angelo Del Priore, a partner at HP Tech Ventures; and Amy LaMeyer, a partner at the WXR Fund.\nHere\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.\nImage Credit: Dean Takahashi\nStephen Saltzman: I first got into VR when I was at Intel Capital. I became managing director for VR, gaming, and location-based entertainment investments at Intel Capital. Starting in January, I became founder and principal and sole employee at Saltzman Strategies and Alliances, which is a consulting firm.\nYasushi Komori: I\u2019m at GFR Fund. We started looking into the VR area three years ago. On the whole, we\u2019re an entertainment technology-focused fund, so we\u2019re also looking into esports and other areas.\nAngelo Del Priore: I\u2019m at HP Tech Ventures, where we do VC investments for Hewlett-Packard. I focus on the AR, VR, gaming, and education spaces. Our last investment in the space was Mojo Vision.\nAmy LaMeyer: I\u2019ve been the spatial computing space for three years, first as an angel investor and now as a partner in WXR Fund. We invest in the spatial computing and AR spaces.\nGamesBeat: Can you talk about some of the more interesting investments you\u2019ve gotten into?\nLaMeyer: One that\u2019s somewhat potentially relevant to this space is Tribe XR. You can learn how to DJ in virtual reality. You have an array of equipment in the virtual space, and with that hardware you can actually DJ. They\u2019re working on other experiences as well, but they\u2019ve started with DJing.\nSaltzman: My last VR investment for Intel was SoReal. Sam Wong\u2019s been on a few of the panels at this conference. After spending two years analyzing location-based VR, I thought it was not only the most exciting approach, but also the smartest business model. It\u2019s showing th power of the founders, because of their position in the Chinese entertainment industry. They can get other people to build out their experiences for them.\nDel Priore: We don\u2019t actually announce a lot of our investments, because why would we want our competition to know? [laughs] Mojo Vision hasn\u2019t even announced what they\u2019re doing yet. But I would say that you can look at who we\u2019ve partnered with and get an idea of where we\u2019re going. We\u2019re ready to build another side of VR.\nImage Credit: The VR Fund\nGamesBeat: And you did invest in the Venture Reality Fund, right?\nDel Priore: Oh, yes. The VR Fund is amazing.\nGamesBeat: We\u2019re in the gap of disappointment or trough of disillusionment? One question is, how is today different from 2014 or 2016? What expectations should startups have when dealing with investors now?\nDel Priore: You\u2019re going to face some tougher, more pointed questions that go really in-depth about your business and the economics. How is it going to play out? I was a VP of biz dev at a startup, and I know the financial situation could change tomorrow, but I still, before I write that check\u2013I\u2019m going to go through line by line asking, \u201cWhat is the rationale for this?\u201d\nAn example I always use, say you want to sell to doctors at hospitals in the United States. Okay, how many hospitals are there in this country? How many doctors at each hospital? You have to be able to answer those basic questions. Once you have the money, you\u2019re in control.\nGamesBeat: Also why are you still investing in VR when you could be doing esports or blockchain games or other things?\nDel Priore: Well, we do other things too. We\u2019re corporate strategic, right? I need to make money and gain strategic insights and optionality. HP has a VR business where there\u2019s now a VP in charge of VR and AR. He\u2019s pointing me toward areas that are interesting, and I\u2019m going out\u2013from a strategic perspective, if you\u2019re an amazing technology with some IP or other thing that I don\u2019t have, because we\u2019re not all working 80 hours a week without layers of bureaucracy\u2013that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it. That VP wants us to double our share in gaming and double our share in VR. I can help him do that by investigating different companies in the space.\nSaltzman: For me, the big difference between 2016 and now is that the tourists are gone. If somebody is still investing in VR now, it\u2019s because they actually understand it. They\u2019re compelled by it. Whether it\u2019s entertainment or medical training or industrial design or architecture, anything where you have to think in 3D, it\u2019s more natural to do it in VR than it is with a keyboard and a mouse, flat out. The people who are still around and actively investing, it\u2019s because they understand it. They totally get it.\nWhat that means, with the tourists gone, is you don\u2019t have absurd deals going on at crazy valuations. A lot of startups think those crazy valuations were a good thing. They weren\u2019t. The protections, the downside protections built into those mean that you get washed out on the next round when you can\u2019t support the valuation that your Series A came in at. It\u2019s much healthier for the entrepreneurs as well, when you\u2019re in this kind of environment where people can pay a fair valuation and then grow organically and add value more naturally.\nKomori: As we all know, the market growth has been smaller than expected, but we\u2019ve seen some companies that have still been very successful. They tend to be the ones that have focused on building virtual worlds for entertainment, platforms that can bridge both PC and virtual reality. That kind of cross-platform entertainment seems to be where the market is going.\nLaMeyer: The other thing that\u2019s pretty obvious is that we\u2019re coming into the second generation of hardware. We\u2019re getting closer to a cost and a comfort level that can reach more of a mass market.\nImage Credit: Sony\nGamesBeat: How do you look at location-based entertainment and VR arcades as investment within this larger VR and AR space? It almost seemed like a lot of these sprung up as the pivot for the original VR companies. When consumer VR didn\u2019t take off as well as expected, people figured that the arcades would take off. What do you think about this space and that pivot strategy?\nLaMeyer: It\u2019s been a way to get more people to try virtual reality who hadn\u2019t before. Yesterday we were talking a bit more about different generations trying VR and having more fun with that. I\u2019d expect it to work in that way as well.\nSaltzman: One of the biggest aspects is, people who actually think they\u2019re in a VR business are going to fail. VR is a technology. Nobody successful was in the dot-com business. They were in the bookselling business or the travel business. If you understand the customer and what you can do for them and how that\u2019s genuinely helpful, that\u2019s great. VR becomes a tool toward doing that.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "When the first Avengers: Endgame trailer was released back in December, things looked pretty grim for Tony Stark. He was lost in space, recording his last words to Pepper Pots after the dusting of half the universe. It seemed that his fate would remain a mystery until Endgame was finally released on April 26.\nBut in subsequent trailers in the last four months, Stark's situation has looked better and better. Though we're not certain of the actual timeline, it appeared that Stark might have made it back to Earth.\nNow we know for sure.\nIn the latest teaser trailer released today, Marvel confirms that Stark makes it back to Earth after the dusting. We see him reunite with Pepper, look at an old photo of him and Peter Parker, and make a deal with Captain America to end the fight.\nThen, in the last moments of this teaser, we see what appears to be the core three Avengers\u2014Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor\u2014come face-to-face with Thanos.\n\"You could not live with your own failure,\" Thanos says in a voiceover. \"And where did that bring you?

{"text": "Christopher Nolan\u2018s new movie is shrouded in secrecy, so any bit of info, no matter how vague, is considered news. Robert Pattinson, who is starring in Nolan\u2019s latest, recently opened up ever-so-slightly about the project, proclaiming it to be one of \u201cthe craziest\u201d things he\u2019s seen in a while. That\u2019s not much to go on, but it\u2019s Pattinson\u2019s other comment that raises an eyebrow or too. According to the actor, Nolan\u2019s latest is \u201cthe length of three movies.\u201d\nPattinson\u2019s quote appears in AZ Central, where the actor was doing press for his latest flick, the sci-fi oddity High Life, directed by Claire Denis. Denis is just the latest in a long line of impressive filmmakers that Pattinson has worked worth in his increasingly strong career. \u201cWorking with these important directors makes you feel more secure in the choices you\u2019re making,\u201d Pattinson said. \u201cLike, I\u2019m doing a big movie with Christopher Nolan after this. It\u2019s the craziest thing I\u2019ve seen in years. It\u2019s the length of three movies.\u201d\nThere are two ways we can look at this quote. One is that Pattinson is being literal here, and that Nolan\u2019s new movie is at least six hours long, or maybe longer. While Nolan doesn\u2019t shy away from long movies, I seriously doubt that\u2019s what Pattinson is saying here. Assuming this isn\u2019t literal, the best interpretation is that Pattinson is saying the movie is so chock-full of ideas that there\u2019s enough material in the script to spin off into three separate movies. That would certainly make sense for Nolan, who loves labyrinthine plotting loaded with a plethora of ideas.\nIn any case, it\u2019ll be interesting to learn just what the new Nolan movie is. The fact that Pattinson calls it the \u201ccraziest thing\u201d he\u2019s seen in years is a noteworthy clue, because High Life is pretty damn crazy. I\u2019m not comparing Nolan to Denis, so please don\u2019t yell at me, Film Twitter. But if Pattinson really thinks Nolan\u2019s latest is crazier than High Life, then it\u2019s going be a crazy freakin\u2019 film.\nPattinson\u2019s comment about the scale of the movie is in line with previous comments he made about the script. \u201cI\u2019ve been a little wary of doing big movies for years and years, but there\u2019s just something about Chris Nolan\u2019s stuff,\u201d the actor said. \u201cHe seems like the only director now who can do what is essentially a very personal, independent movie that has huge scale. I read the script and it\u2019s unreal.\u201d\nNolan\u2019s latest, starring Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki and John David Washington, arrives July 17, 2020.\n", "label": "human"}

the lead was cut to just 10 late in the third term after Jesse Hogan scored his first goal for Fremantle and Cameron McCarthy booted two.\nHowever a horror defensive turnover from Reece Conca on the stroke of three-quarter time gifted Oscar Allen a goal, giving the Eagles vital breathing space they never relinquished.\nThe result was West Coast's eighth western derby win on the trot, helping boost its overall win-loss record to 29-20.\nFremantle's midfield copped a hiding in the absence of Nat Fyfe, with West Coast winning the clearances 39-26.\nEagles skipper Shannon Hurn won the Glendinning-Allan medal as best afield for his 32-disposal, eight-mark effort.\nJack Darling and Josh Kennedy booted three goals each, while the defensive trio Tom Barrass, Hurn and Brad Sheppard were supreme in combining for 33 marks.\nThe Dockers suffered a big blow early in the second quarter when key defender Joel Hamling suffered a game-ending concussion.\nDavid Mundy (36 disposals, 10 clearances) tried hard for the Dockers in a losing midfield, while Hogan finished with just one goal from his 13 disposals.\nFremantle's poor forward 50m entries and shoddy kicking on goal cost them dearly in the opening term as West Coast took control of the contest.\nMatt Taberner produced Fremantle's worst miss when he hit the post from his 20m set shot.\nGaff's class was crucial through the midfield and the pace of Eagles young gun Jack Petruccelle helped him score two early goals.\nTaberner kicked Fremantle's first goal of the match early in the second term but more missed opportunities allowed the Eagles to enter the long break with a 24-point advantage.\nFremantle finally found their range in the third quarter as Hogan and McCarthy came to life but Conca's late turnover cost them dearly.\nKangaroos clinch first win of the season over Crows\nA wasteful North Melbourne has salvaged its first win of the AFL season, edging Adelaide by 12 points to ease pressure on coach Brad Scott.\nThe inaccurate Roos trailed at halftime of Saturday night's Docklands clash but broke the game open in the third quarter, led by three goals in quick succession from spearhead Ben Brown, to post a 9.17 (71) to 8.11 (59) victory.\nIt was another sub-par performance from Adelaide, who surprisingly dropped star midfield recruit Bryce Gibbs and have managed just one win from four games.\nThe Crows went a man down late in the first quarter with Chayce Jones failing a concussion test after a late hit from Luke McDonald, who is certain to face match review scrutiny.\nOnballer Brad Crouch spent much of the second half on the bench after copping a stray elbow which left him bleeding heavily from the nose.\nAdelaide was beaten in the midfield all night but North's poor conversion kept the game alive until the hosts piled on six straight majors either side of three-quarter time.\nBrown finished with four goals, three of which came from debatable free kicks paid against Crows defender Daniel Talia.\nWhile the Roos appeared to have the rub of the green, the floodgates always threatened to open after a first half where they scored 3.10 from 33 inside-50s \u2014 twice as many as the Crows, who led by 14 points at the main break.\nWith the Roos squandering chances, Crows veteran Eddie Betts delivered a vintage performance at the other end after being held quiet in the opening rounds.\nThe livewire forward booted three first-half majors including a mid-air volley in the goal square and a trademark banana goal from deep in the forward pocket.\nAnother North loss would surely have intensified the pressure that was steadily building on 10th-year coach Scott, who swung four changes to his 22 after the Roos posted losses to Hawthorn, Brisbane and Fremantle\nThe Roos benefited from the return of Jed Anderson from injury and fellow onballer Paul Ahern, who was surprisingly overlooked in the opening rounds.\nAnderson gathered 19 disposals and seven clearances, while Ahern had 15 touches and six inside-50s.\nUnder-strength Tigers roar against Port Adelaide\nStar Richmond recruit Tom Lynch has kicked six goals to sink Port Adelaide in a thrilling seven-point AFL win.\nLynch led a Tigers side missing their \"Big Four\" \u2014 Dustin Martin, Jack Riewoldt, Alex Rance and skipper Trent Cotchin \u2014 to a 15.9. (99) to 14.8. (92) victory at Adelaide Oval.\nAfter Port controlled the first quarter, Richmond upped their pressure, pace and tackle count in the second to come within two points at half time.\nBoth teams kicked two goals from free kicks in the third quarter but the momentum swung Richmond's way after Lynch kicked two within seconds thanks to a free paid against Ryan Burton.\nThe Tigers hit the lead and two quick goals from Lynch and Liam Baker put Port on the back foot.\nThe lead changed hands four times during a nail-biter high-scoring last quarter, with Power rookie Xavier Duursma unable to convert a shot from close range shortly before the siren.\nPort Adelaide midfielders Tom Rockliff (38 disposals), Travis Boak (33 disposals) and Brad Ebert (23 disposals, two goals) were stand-outs for the Power.\nBut Richmond's youngsters stepped up when it counted, first-gamer Jack Ross particularly impressive with 25 disposals.\nFellow Tigers Brandon Ellis (28 disposals, one goal) and Dion Prestia (20 disposals, one goal) were among others to step up.\nThe win was critical for the 2017 premiers, who now sit 2-2 after a disappointing start to the season.\nEssendon tames Lions to hand Brisbane first loss\nAnthony McDonald-Tipungwuti has starred with a career-best AFL haul of seven goals for Essendon who have belted Brisbane by 47 points at the MCG.\nThe Bombers ended the Lions' perfect start to the season and squared their ledger at 2-2 with a 17.10 (112) to 9.11 (65) win.\nMcDonald-Tipungwuti kicked his seventh goal on the run just before the final siren.\nHis five goals up to three-quarter time were all from set shots.\nWhile it is the Bombers' second win in a row after a dreadful start to the season, the Lions have been dealt a nasty reality check.\nBrisbane had little in attack \u2014 Bombers key defenders Michael Hurley and Cale Hooker were outstanding \u2014 and the Lions could not match Essendon's run.\nMidfielder Zach Merrett also shone for Essendon and key forward Mitch Brown kicked three goals, while Lions onballer Lachie Neale continued his strong form.\nThe only negative for Essendon was a kick to the head for David Myers in the last term, forcing him from the field.\nEssendon monstered Brisbane early, kicking seven goals to two for a 30-point lead at the first change.\nAnother three goals to one put the Bombers 50 points up early in the third quarter and the game looked over.\nReturning from a calf injury for his first game this year, Hooker spent all game in defence and was solid.\nWhile Neale had 13 disposals in the first term, Brisbane looked listless overall and could not stay with Essendon.\nBut the Lions lifted in the third quarter, restricting Essendon to two goals.\nWhen Daniel McStay kicked a goal on the three-quarter time siren, Brisbane had kicked four for the term and reduced the margin to a gettable 36 points.\nEric Hipwood, quiet all day, put through another in the first minute of the last quarter.\nThe Lions had a sniff and attacked relentlessly, but could manage only two behinds.\nCam Rayner capped his dirty day when he fluffed a simple set shot, before Andrew McGrath kicked his second goal and Brown his third to kill off the game.\nMcDonald-Tipungwuti added emphasis to the win with the last two goals of the match\nGiants edge Geelong in a thriller\nBrave GWS overcame the early loss of co-captain Callan Ward to pull off a famous four-point victory over Geelong at Kardinia Park.\nWard left the match with a suspected anterior cruciate ligament injury just five minutes into Saturday afternoon's clash, but the gallant Giants dug deep to inflict the Cats' first defeat of the season \u2014 11.13 (79) to 11.9 (75).\nGeelong led by one point at three-quarter time and appeared to have staved off the gallant challenge when they edged to a seven-point advantage.\nBut Jeremy Finlayson kicked the last goal of the match after a courageous Harry Himmelberg mark.\nThe Cats kept coming but the Giants' defence, led superbly by co-captain Phil Davis, held firm.\nIt was a breathtaking finale to a game that started on a flat note with the injury to Ward.\nHe was helped from the ground by two trainers and later appeared inconsolable on the bench after emerging from the players' race on crutches.\n\"It's not great ... they'll do the [ACL] test but it doesn't look great,\" Giants football chief Wayne Campbell told Fox Footy at quarter-time.\n\"We'll obviously wait and see what happens after the game but, at this stage, it's not a great early diagnosis.\n\"He's gone to the rooms now and the doctors will look after him.\"\nThe Cats took full advantage as the Giants organised themselves in Ward's absence, Tom Hawkins' first goal of the day giving them a 20-point lead at the first break.\nBut they couldn't shake GWS, with Stephen Coniglio and Jacob Hopper working feverishly at the stoppages and Patrick Dangerfield and Joel Selwood not having their usual influence for the Cats.\nThe margin was 21 points at halftime after another late goal from Hawkins and reached a game-high 22 points soon after the restart.\nBut the Giants booted three goals in a row, including successive majors to Jeremy Cameron, to set up the thrilling climax.\nAFL ladder\nABC/AAP\nTopics: australian-football-league, sport, australia, vic, geelong-3220, nsw, sydney-2000, essendon-3040, qld, brisbane-4000, sa,

{"text": "It used to be that if you stayed off the street during the late night hours, you would be safe.\nIsn\u2019t that what we told our daughters?\n\u201cDon\u2019t be hanging out in the street all hours of the night because anything could happen.\u201d\nBut those rules no longer apply.\nYoung women, most of them black, are getting shot in broad daylight while going about their daily routines.\nOn Sunday, Antoinette Brown, 23, was fatally shot at 10:38 a.m. in the 8800 block of South Burley Avenue.\n\u201cShe was getting ready to celebrate her 24th birthday this Good Friday on April 19th. She was really excited. Now we are going to be burying her,\u201d her aunt, Deverne Staples, said Monday.\nBrown was a familiar face to residents in the South Chicago neighborhood.\n\u201cShe was definitely an awesome person,\u201d said Doryan Welch, the store manager at Save-A-Lot on East 83rd Street.\n\u201cShe worked in two other stores in the neighborhood and was very well known\u2026.Very.\u201d\nBrown was fatally shot during the time of day when worshippers would have been heading to church to observe Palm Sunday.\nThe young woman was dead at the scene when someone fired shots striking her in the head and chest. She was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of her parked car and was the only one in the car. Witnesses found Brown\u2019s body, but said they did not witness the shooting.\n\u201cThis is a huge tragedy. She was very bright and would light up the room with her smile. That was the biggest thing. She was a really well-liked person,\u201d Welch said.\nWhen I reached out to Brown\u2019s family on Monday, her mother was out making funeral arrangements.\nHundreds of condolences have poured in on social media.\n\u201cThis is a major shock to everyone. The whole neighborhood has been coming in. They are just grieving. Everyone is feeling the same. It is painful,\u201d Welch told me.\nThis fatal shooting is one in a string of shootings that have claimed the life of or injured young black women.\nOn Saturday night, another 23-year-old woman, identified as Destiny Nicholas, was fatally shot as she vacuumed her vehicle at a gas station in Chicago Lawn.\nNicholas was with a male companion at the time. He was wounded in the shooting.\nTwo weeks ago, two women were killed after leaving work at a Walmart in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood.\nBrittani Rice, 18 and Senobia Brantley, 19, co-workers, were sitting in a vehicle with a male friend when three men jumped out of a blue sedan and opened fire.\nNo one is in custody for any of these shootings.\nIt was tragic enough that so many young black males are murdering other young black men, but now female lives are also being wiped out.\nSome of us don\u2019t want to talk about that.\nI understand.\nIt is a lot easier to condemn abusive police officers than it is to chastise black people for participating in their own genocide.\nBut what do we tell our daughters now?\nBrown was doing what she needed to do to get ahead in life.\n\u201cShe was up for a promotion, and she worked two other jobs,\u201d her store manager told me.\nAnd yet, she could not survive the gun violence that stalks us.\nSo far this year, there have been 19 homicides of females in Cook County.\nIn 2013, 27 women in Cook County were homicide victims, 19 of them in Chicago.\nIn 2017, the number of homicide victims skyrocketed to 63 in Cook County, 52 of the homicides were in Chicago, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\nLast month, Dareyona Smith, 18, was killed in the 7900 block of South Paulina, when people fired shots from a passing Nissan.\nThe Rev. Michael Pfleger blamed a beef on social media for the violence.\nUnfortunately, most of these murders are unsolved.\nWe don\u2019t know if these women were targeted or if there are shooters roaming the streets using human beings for target practice.\nIt is frightening.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Welch said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Day Two.

{"text": "Juicy Landrum, #20 of the Baylor Lady Bears, celebrates the play against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish during the first quarter in the championship game of the 2019 NCAA Women's Final Four at Amalie Arena on April 7, 2019, in Tampa, Florida.\nBaylor lost a star player, then the rest of its 17-point lead. But the Lady Bears, led by the ever-poised Chloe Jackson, kept their composure.\nJackson drove for a tiebreaking layup with 3.9 seconds left, and that put the game into the hands of another tournament hero.\nNotre Dame's Arike Ogunbowale missed the first of two free throws with 1.9 seconds remaining, and Baylor held on for an 82-81 victory Sunday in the NCAA women's basketball championship game.\n\"They just kept doing what we've been taught to do, and that's guard people,\" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said. \"We just beat the defending national champions. That team is so good, so talented. You're going to see those guys play at the next level. Wow.\"\nBaylor was able to pull off the win without star forward Lauren Cox, who injured her knee in a frightening scene late in the third quarter. The Irish were able to rally from a 14-point deficit in the third quarter to tie it at 78 in the fourth. Jackson then scored a jumper from the foul line, and Jessica Shepard countered with two free throws to tie it, setting up the exciting finish.\n\"We had to do it for LC,\" said Jackson, who was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. \"She got us here. We had to finish the job for her.\"\nThe Lady Bears (37-1) won their first championship in seven years. Mulkey and Baylor have won titles in 2005, 2012 and 2019. The 2012 championship game also pitted the Lady Bears against Muffet McGraw's Irish in the last meeting of two female coaches for the title.\nThe Lady Bears were primed to run away with the game as Notre Dame struggled to score. But the Irish have a knack for big comebacks, doing it against UConn in this year's semifinal and against Mississippi State in last season's title game, when they rallied from 15 down in the third quarter.\nOgunbowale was instrumental in all those victories, forever becoming a part of the Final Four during last year's title run. She made a shot with one second remaining to beat UConn in the semifinals, then hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with one-tenth of a second left to top the Bulldogs in the title game.\nOgunbowale led the charge again Sunday, scoring 17 of her 31 points in the second half. That included a buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the third quarter, sparking an 11-0 Notre Dame run.\n\"It just wasn't meant to be. It's going to be a hard pill to swallow,\" said Ogunbowale, who finished with 155 points in the tournament \u2014 the fourth most all-time. \"But things happen. I had a fun, great career here at Notre Dame.\"\nIt helped the Irish that the Lady Bears had to play the last 11 minutes without Cox. She got tangled up with Kalani Brown on the defensive end and went down clutching her left knee with about a minute to go in the third quarter. The 6-foot-4 junior was crying in agony before they took her off the court in a wheelchair. Her mom was tearing up in the stands, and her dad had his hands over his face.\n\"I'm emotional for a lot of reasons, but mostly for Lauren Cox, and I'm so happy,\" Mulkey said. \"These are tears of joy, but they're also tears of thinking about injuries.\n\"The worst part of the game was Lauren Cox,\" she added. \"We had control of that game from the start to the time she went off the floor. We had to regroup. For us to win was a miracle in itself when you lose a player of that caliber.\"\nCox came back to the bench in the fourth quarter on crutches, with a big brace on her left knee. She was the first one to hold the trophy after the game.\n\"I'm one of the leaders on the team, so just to have my voice there (on the bench) and tell them I'm still OK, they told me they were going to do this for me,\" Cox said.\nMulkey was able to celebrate her third title with her family close by. Daughter Makenzie is on the coaching staff, and infant grandson Kannon Reid was sitting in the front row behind the bench. The trio had a special moment on the ladder as Mulkey cut the final piece of the net. She playfully put the entire net on her grandson's head.\nWith the game tied at 80, Jackson drove with her right hand and hit a layup that bounced off the rim before dropping in.\nSunday's game marked the eighth time in the past 20 years that there have been two women head coaches in the title game but only the second time since 2008. The last time was in 2012 with these same coaches. As of 2018, only 59.5 percent of head coaches in Division I women's basketball are female.\nThe victory broke a tie for third all-time between Mulkey and McGraw for career NCAA titles. Mulkey has three, placing her behind Geno Auriemma (11) and Pat Summitt (8).\nTIP-INS: The Irish remained at 999 victories in school history. McGraw has been the coach for 835 of them. ... The 11-point differential for the three games in the Final Four was the closest in the history of the tournament, topping last season's 15-point margin.\nSTRONG ATTENDANCE: Nearly 275,000 people attended the NCAAs, which ranked eighth all-time, including 20,127 for the title game. It was the highest attendance in over 15 years.\n\"We've had a really great championship. Our first and second round numbers is the best we've seen in 11 years,\" NCAA vice president for women's basketball Lynn Holzman said.\nThe regionals provided a strong boost. Portland, Oregon, a first-time site, averaged over 11,400 fans and will host again next year. The regional attendance was its highest since the NCAA switched to neutral sites after the 2014 season.\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "What happened\nShares of Amyris (NASDAQ:AMRS) jumped nearly 29% today, after the company announced progress in its efforts to repay convertible debt notes bearing an interest rate of 9.5% that were due today. The pioneer in synthetic biology told investors it expects to repay the notes with \"cash from a business transaction\" and a planned equity investment from Foris Ventures, a fund affiliated with Amyris director John Doerr.\nRepaying and retiring the notes in full will avoid significant stock dilution from the $57.6 million of original debt, which was scheduled to be payable in over 3.3 million shares of common stock. That's not much, relatively speaking, but considering Amyris has seen its share count explode from 25 million in mid-2017 -- following a 1-for-15 stock split -- to over 73 million today, investors are rewarding management for trying.\nAs of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the stock had settled to a 12.2% gain.\nSo what\nThe full details of the transactions and equity investments weren't disclosed, but a separate filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Foris Ventures is extending an $8 million credit facility in the form of a promissory note to Amyris. The note is due in six months and was accompanied by a fee of $1 million, equivalent to a 12.5% interest rate.\nThat still leaves Amyris in need of an additional $50 million to retire the 9.5% notes in full. It doesn't exactly have a lot of bargaining power. After all, it recently disclosed that it overstated full-year 2018 revenue by at least $12 million -- or at least 15% of the total -- due to miscalculated royalty payments. Investors who read SEC filings could have seen that coming.\nNow what\nMissing guidance by 58%, overstating revenue, taking out new debt to repay old debt: Amyris stock is surrounded by flashing red lights warning individual investors to stay away. While the company continues to walk the tightrope of debt financing, exchanging one form of debt for another, its future is completely dependent on its ability to commercialize products from its research and development projects. Its failure to do so to date shouldn't be taken lightly by investors. Expect the stock to remain volatile.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Smoke billows from the roof of the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Tuesday in Paris. Fabien Barrau/Getty Images\nAfter it had become apparent that the fire that engulfed the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Monday threatened to bring down the entire building\u2014as the vast amounts of wood in the centuries-old building ignited rapidly and at a height beyond the reach of typical fire fighting measures\u2014Paris Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told French media that first responders had focused some of their attention to saving the priceless art, precious artifacts and other items in the cathedral.\nNow it seems, based on reporting from French media, that that effort was largely successful. Hours after the fire started, we are only now getting an idea of what has been saved and what hasn\u2019t. Things are looking slightly better than initially thought for the cathedral, but the devastation was still profound. First the cathedral\u2019s iconic spire fell, then a significant portion of the roof collapsed. (\u201cEverything is burning, nothing will remain from the frame,\u201d a Notre Dame spokesman said at one point in the day.) The fire jumped to one of the cathedral\u2019s landmark rectangular towers in what seemed to be an ominous sign, but French authorities later announced that both the iconic towers had been saved and that the fire had been mostly managed. Here\u2019s what we know is saved and what has been lost from one of the world\u2019s greatest architectural treasures.\nWhat\u2019s safe\nThose looking for hope can take comfort in knowing the damage isn\u2019t quite as total as authorities at one point feared. While the true extent of the fire\u2019s damage can\u2019t yet be known (some photos from inside the cathedral appear promising), French officials say it appears the facades and bell towers and flying buttresses and much of the rest of the building\u2019s general structure have been saved. That\u2019s great news for obvious reasons. As Meredith Cohen, an art history professor at the University of California, Los Angeles explains, it is the building, rather than anything inside it, that stands as a singular symbol of Paris\u2019 history. \u201cThe cathedral is the artwork,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all the other works of art attached to church are different details of it.\u201d\nAccording to Cohen, the building, which was built over nearly three centuries starting in 1160 (there have been later additions and renovations), symbolically transformed the city into the center of European culture during the medieval period through its display of the new and innovative Gothic style of architecture and its singular architectural and artistic ambition. \u201cIt\u2019s the origin of our concept of Paris as a center of art and culture,\u201d she said.\nStatues and paintings\nWe know a set of important copper statues have been saved, as the Associated Press reported that ones representing the 12 apostles and four evangelists that graced the top of the cathedral were removed last week as part of the $6.8 million renovation project (now believed to be in some way linked to the cause of the fire) to the now-destroyed spire.\nWe also know firefighters saved a number of valuable pieces of art from inside the cathedral, as confirmed by the cathedral\u2019s rector, but we don\u2019t know yet which of those pieces were saved. But Cohen said she was slightly less nervous about the contents of the church because so many historically significant artistic works had already been destroyed or removed during the French Revolution. \u201cThey beheaded sculptures, altars were removed, tombstones were removed,\u201d she said. She noted that a significant choir screen and baroque sculpture above an altar remained. \u201cBut compared to what was there, there is little left,\u201d she said.\nThe bell towers and the bells\nIt seems likely that most of the bells were saved, given that the two main bell towers were preserved, though that hasn\u2019t officially been confirmed. The cathedral\u2019s main bell, a 15th-century bell called the Emmanuel bell, survived. The Emmanuel bell has marked some of the country\u2019s and the world\u2019s most important moments, such as the end of World War II and the Sept. 11 terror attacks.\nStained-glass windows\nFrench media reported Tuesday that Notre Dame\u2019s famous and awe-inspiring South Rose window, created in 1260, has survived. The cathedral has two other rose windows, also reported safe, and a large number of stained-glass windows of which their status is unknown.\nThe organ\nFrench media also reported Tuesday that the church\u2019s main organ, one of the largest in the world, did not burn but may have suffered some water damage. The Great Organ, replaced and updated many times through the years, is operated by a head organist, a position recognized around the world as highly prestigious.\nChristian relics\nFor the pious, it is likely the relics\u2014items the faithful believe to be physical remains or belongings of a saint or other holy figure\u2014that are more significant in the tally of items saved. In particular many religious Catholics will likely be relieved to hear that the Crown of Thorns, Notre Dame\u2019s most valuable religious item and a relic said to be the braided thorns placed on Jesus\u2019 head before the crucifixion, is thought to be safe.\nWhile NBC News has reported that the Crown of Thorns was housed in the now destroyed spire, a spokesman for the church said the relic had been saved, according to French media. The status of the other prominent relics, which include a fragment of the \u201ctrue cross\u201d on which Jesus was crucified and a nail the Romans used in the crucifixion, is unknown. The crown is only brought out for worshipers on Fridays during Lent and on Good Friday\u2014this upcoming Friday.\nThe cathedral\u2019s treasury was also saved, according to the cathedral\u2019s rector.\nWhat\u2019s lost\nThe spire\nThe dramatic and iconic spire, one of the more modern aspects of the cathedral, was built in the 19th century during a wave of enthusiasm for the cathedral\u2019s restoration in the aftermath of Victor Hugo\u2019s success with The Hunchback of Notre Dame. But Cohen says the public should not take any comfort in that modernity: art historians consider that another extremely valuable window into the techniques and styles of the time, and part of the layered history of the cathedral. \u201cYou can copy that, but you\u2019re faking history,\u201d she said.\nJoan Holladay, a professor of art history at the University of Texas, added that the many centuries of construction seen in the building are part of what makes it one-of-a-kind. \u201cUsing all these buildings together, you can put together a big picture of what gothic architecture was,\u201d she said. It\u2019s not just the individual periods seen in the architecture, but also how they fit together, that make the cathedral so valuable.\n\u201cThe Forest\u201d\nThe wood roof covering the stone vault, known as \u201cthe forest\u201d because of the vast amount of wood needed to build it, was largely destroyed. Part of that roof structure dates to the 13th century, and it primarily was made from trees cut between 1160 and 1170, according to CNN\u2014making it some of the oldest material in the building.\nWhat\u2019s unknown\nWe still don\u2019t know how much damage has been done inside the building. There are wooden pews and doorways, and plenty of other art that could be considered flammable. And we don\u2019t know how the building\u2019s exterior, with the famous Gothic sculpture work (notably, gargoyles), fared. We can assume that when the spire fell and the ceiling collapsed, it did some damage to the vaults and the floor of the cathedral\u2014again, damage to deeply historic masonry and design. Holladay noted that stone does not burn, but it does suffer in the heat, crack, and lose stability. So she worried about the sculptures on the west facade, with its life-size figures of saints, and older carvings in areas around the left portal.\nSculptures and paintings\nSome seem hopeful that much of the artwork inside the cathedral has been spared. There are more than 30 sculptures inside the cathedral, including one statue of Madonna and Child that dates back to the 14th century. There\u2019s a 1648 portrait of St. Thomas Aquinas and a 1716 painting called the Visitation\u2014one of six in a series depicting the life of Mary, the remaining of which were moved to the Louvre in the 1860s.\nWhatever is ultimately found as authorities attempt to take account of the damage in the days to come, it is already clearly devastating, as a building that has represented Paris\u2014and the center of European art and culture\u2014for 800 years has been hit with a near-fatal blow. But the structure remains. And French President Emmanuel Macron, in an address just before midnight in Paris, has vowed that the cathedral will again be displayed as a symbol of Parisian culture and history. \u201cI tell you solemnly tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will rebuild this cathedral.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It's easy to let retirement savings fall by the wayside when you're young and have more pressing matters to dedicate your limited financial resources to. Many 20-somethings, for example, put off retirement savings to build emergency funds or pay down student debt, while 30-somethings might delay retirement savings to buy homes or grapple with the ever-climbing expense that is raising children.\nOf course, waiting to save for retirement isn't ideal, because the sooner you start building a nest egg, the more opportunity you have to take advantage of compounding. But if you happen to reach your 50s without much in the way of savings, you still have a great opportunity to make up for lost time. That's because both IRAs and 401(k) plans offer a catch-up provision to older workers that allows for higher annual contributions than younger workers.\nFor the current year, workers under 50 can contribute up to $6,000 a year to an IRA. Those 50 and over, however, get a $1,000 catch-up that raises this limit to $7,000. The difference on the 401(k) front is even wider. While workers under 50 can set aside up to $19,000 this year in a 401(k), workers 50 and older get an opportunity to sock away an extra $6,000 for a total of $25,000.\nMaking catch-up contributions in a retirement plan is one of the most efficient means of compensating for a slow start to saving. Yet only 30% of workers over age 50 make catch-up contributions in a 401(k), according to investment banking company Natixis. If you're not one of them, and you're behind on savings, consider this a warning that you're making a huge mistake.\nWhat can an extra $6,000 a year do for your retirement savings?\nYou'd think that approaching retirement would light a fire under folks with lackluster savings to start doing better, and catch-up contributions are a great way to boost nest egg balances later in life. The fact that so few savers take advantage of this option is therefore concerning, but the reason might boil down to a lack of financial ability. After all, it's hard to scrounge up an additional $500 a month when you're dealing with mortgage payments, healthcare bills, and, depending on your circumstances, the costs associated with sending your older kids to college.\nOn the other hand, passing up the opportunity to bank an additional $6,000 a year might really hurt you in retirement. Remember, when you neglect to save extra money, you're not just missing out on that principal later on, but also, the growth it could've achieved.\nImagine you're 50 years old with the goal of retiring at age 70. If you were to sock away an extra $6,000 a year in your 401(k) over the next 20 years, all the while investing your savings at an average annual 7% return (which is more than doable if you load up on stocks), you'd add nearly $250,000 to your nest egg. That's a lot of potential retirement income to give up.\nIf you're having a hard time parting with that extra $6,000 a year, start making lifestyle changes that allow you to spend less. That could mean giving up a vehicle you can do without, cooking at home more often instead of dining out, and canceling services you rarely use, like your gym membership, cable package, or streaming plan. At the same time, consider getting a second job on top of your primary one to bring in some extra cash. Of the millions of Americans who have a side hustle, 14% do so for the express purpose of having funds to contribute to a retirement plan.\nRemember, the money you put into a traditional 401(k) goes in on a pre-tax basis, so by contributing an extra $6,000 a year, you'll also be lowering your tax burden during the latter part of your career.

{"text": "About 115,000 polystyrene foam cups and carry-out containers washed down Baltimore\u2019s Jones Falls last year \u2014 but that\u2019s only an estimate, because so many of them are reduced to fragments and tiny pellets by the time they float into the Inner Harbor.\nOne of the most common plastics, the foam is an intractable pollutant. It\u2019s ubiquitous but difficult to recycle. It continually breaks down into pieces but isn\u2019t considered biodegradable. It often picks up toxins in the environment, delivering them into the food chain when animals mistake foam pellets for food.\nThe solution, Maryland lawmakers decided, is to ban the substance, known colloquially as styrofoam. The state is set to become the first in the country to forbid restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores from using most foam products \u2014 cups, plates, bowls and clamshell containers \u2014 effective July 1, 2020. Violators would face fines up to $250.\nKim Hairston / Baltimore Sun Tom Anuszewski, general manager at Sea King Crab House and Pig Picker's BBQ, fills lunch orders. Most of the menu selections are packed in foam containers. The General Assembly passed a bill that will ban polystyrene foam. Alternative packaging could add significant cost. Tom Anuszewski, general manager at Sea King Crab House and Pig Picker's BBQ, fills lunch orders. Most of the menu selections are packed in foam containers. The General Assembly passed a bill that will ban polystyrene foam. Alternative packaging could add significant cost. (Kim Hairston / Baltimore Sun)\nThe move would put Maryland at the forefront of environmental policymaking, further expanding on what proponents say is the demonstrated effectiveness of local foam bans in places such as Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties. But it frustrates business owners like Eric King, who said the law would drive up costs at his restaurant and carryout business.\nAt Sea King Crab House in Ellicott City, King gives customers their leftovers in heavy-duty recyclable plastic containers. But for the carry-out side of the business, he said, foam containers are the only affordable vessels that keep steamed shrimp or French fries warm without getting soggy themselves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to drive prices up,\u201d he said, estimating an increase from 5 cents per foam container to $1 or more for plastic alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can just absorb.\u201d\nProponents say restaurants elsewhere have accommodated the bans without significant impact on them or their customers. Since Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties approved foam bans in 2016, no businesses have come forward seeking exemption, and stream banks have gotten noticeably cleaner, said Adam Ortiz, the former environmental director in Prince George\u2019s, who now holds a similar position in Montgomery.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a restaurant to make the case they need styrofoam when there\u2019s literally hundreds examples of other businesses that have chosen more sustainable products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen little to no styrofoam on the side of the road or in streams.\u201d\nMaryland could soon be the test case for whether an entire state can truly go foam-free. (Hawaii also was considering a statewide ban this year, but the legislature deferred the bill.)\nThe legislation faces a potential veto from Gov. Larry Hogan, who has not publicly taken a stance on it. A spokesman said the Republican executive was reviewing it.\nBut because a supermajority of the General Assembly approved it, any veto is likely to be overridden. The lawmakers and advocates who pushed for the foam ban are already looking beyond the governor, hoping the measure raises awareness about more than just foam pollution.\nDel. Brooke Lierman, a Baltimore Democrat who sponsored the proposal with Montgomery Democratic Sen. Cheryl Kagan, called the foam ban just a \u201cfirst step\u201d away from a throwaway consumer culture.\n\u201cMy hope is that people will realize, \u2018My streets are cleaner, our rivers are cleaner, I\u2019m not seeing this form of trash, and I don\u2019t even miss it,\u2019 and want to do more to eliminate single-use plastics from our lives entirely,\u201d Lierman said.\nMeasuring foam pollution is difficult, because about 95 percent of the material is virtually weightless. It consists of bubbles of air trapped within plastic. But environmental groups that clean it up from curbs and marshes say it makes up a significant volume of the waste bound for landfills.\nTrash \u201ctrawls\u201d around the Baltimore harbor routinely turn up hundreds of polystyrene food containers. Only cigarette butts outnumber the count of foam vessels captured by Mr. Trash Wheel, one of three waste collectors the Healthy Harbor Initiative operates around Baltimore.\nThe foam ban law seeks to combat that waste by outlawing polystyrene foam from eateries, grocery stores and hospital or school cafeterias. Any business considered to be in the \u201cfood service\u201d industry would be prohibited from selling foam wares.\nBut it doesn\u2019t banish all forms of foam within Maryland borders. Grocers still would be allowed to sell eggs and fresh meat, fish or poultry packaged in or on foam trays, though they could not sell foam cups or plates. The legislation wouldn\u2019t affect businesses that don\u2019t sell food, or regulate use of foam products in homes, other than restricting where Maryland residents and companies can legally buy those items.\nAnd the policy doesn\u2019t limit use of blocks of polystyrene foam used in packaging to secure electronics or other fragile products.\nPolystyrene foam product maker DART Container Corp. has distribution centers in Havre de Grace and Hampstead that contain stores of foam products that it sells to food-service businesses across the country, but won\u2019t be able to sell within Maryland once the law goes into effect.\nPaul Poe, DART\u2019s manager of government affairs and environment, said the company is hoping to continue talks with the Hogan administration to reduce the law\u2019s potential impact on DART and its 800 Maryland employees.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pulling up stakes or anything like that, but it was a bit of a disappointment that we couldn\u2019t have reached some kind of a deal\u201d with lawmakers, Poe said.\nFood-service business owners say rising packaging costs are only the latest burden Maryland lawmakers have delivered to them. Earlier during this year\u2019s General Assembly session, legislators voted to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 by 2025. During last year\u2019s session, they mandated businesses with at least 15 employees to offer at least five days of paid sick leave to part-time employees.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t absorb it all,\u201d said Wayne Resnick, president of Martin\u2019s Caterers, which employs 600 people across the state. \u201cWe care about all these things. We care about the people that work for us. It\u2019s just tough when all this stuff gets mandated within a couple years.\u201d\nBusiness groups, including the Restaurant Association of Maryland and the Maryland Retailers Association, have been leading the opposition.\nCritics also have raised concern about the cost to the public.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "By Guy Faulconbridge and Elizabeth Piper\nBrexit hung in the balance on Monday as Prime Minister Theresa May tried to coax the Labour Party into agreeing a divorce deal with a better chance of passage by parliament, ahead of a crisis EU summit where she will try to delay the April 12 departure.\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU has already been delayed once but May is asking the bloc for yet more time as she courts veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party wants to keep Britain more closely tied to the bloc after Brexit.\nMay heads to Berlin and Paris on Tuesday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron and will be phoning other leaders before setting out the case for another delay at Wednesday\u2019s emergency EU summit in Brussels.\nNearly three years after the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU, May warned that Brexit might never happen, but said that she would do everything possible to make sure it did.\n\u201cWe have been in touch with the opposition today and technical talks between officials will take place this evening,\u201d a spokesman for May said.\nLabour\u2019s Brexit point man, Keir Starmer, said earlier that May\u2019s government had so far not shifted from its red lines on Brexit and so no way forward had been agreed.\n\u201cBoth us and the government have approached this in the spirit of trying to find a way forward. We haven\u2019t found that yet. We will continue to do that,\u201d Starmer said.\nMay\u2019s spokeswoman said she wanted Britain to have an independent trading policy \u2013 something hard to reconcile with Labour\u2019s demand to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU \u2013 and that both sides would need to compromise.\nThe deputy political editor of the Telegraph newspaper, Steven Swinford, said Labour and the Conservative government were still discussing both a customs union and the idea of holding a confirmatory referendum on any deal they agree.\nBoth ideas are anathema to many in May\u2019s party, whose rebels have helped trigger three parliamentary defeats of the withdrawal deal she negotiated with the EU last year.\n\u201cWe all hope that these talks will produce a positive outcome. I\u2019ve said many times before, we can be more, much more ambitious in our future relationship with the UK,\u201d EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told a news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin.\nBREXIT DELAY?\nThe 2016 referendum revealed a United Kingdom divided over much more than EU membership, and has sparked impassioned debate about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and what it means to be British.\nYet, more than a week after Britain was originally supposed to have left the EU, nothing is resolved as May, the weakest leader in a generation, battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a profoundly divided parliament.\nEU leaders, fatigued by the serpentine Brexit crisis, must decide on Wednesday whether to grant May, who has asked for a postponement until June 30, a further delay. The decision can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states.\nWithout an extension, Britain is due to leave the EU at 2200 GMT on Friday, without a deal to cushion the economic shock.\nWhile the EU is not expected to trigger such a potentially disorderly no-deal exit, diplomats said all options were on the table \u2013 from refusing a delay to granting May\u2019s request or pushing for a longer postponement.\nBut May is boxed in at home.\nBrexiteers in her cabinet insisted on at most a short delay, while Mark Francois, deputy chief of the Conservatives\u2019 hardline eurosceptic faction in parliament, demanded she resign and called on the party to vote on forcing her out \u2013 even though there is no formal provision to do so before December.\nAs the crisis grinds on, one survey suggested that voters wanted a strong leader willing to force through reform of a political system that has been found badly wanting by Brexit.\nResearch by the Hansard Society found that 54 percent of voters wanted a strong leader willing to break the rules, while 72 percent said the political system needed \u201cquite a lot\u201d or \u201ca great deal\u201d of improvement.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "More than 3 million Americans live with disabling brain injuries. The vast majority of the individuals are lost to the medical system soon after their initial treatment, to be cared for by family or to fend for themselves, managing fatigue, attention and concentration problems with little hope of improvement.\nOn Saturday, a team of scientists reported a glimmer of hope. Using an implant that stimulates activity in key areas of the brain, they restored near-normal levels of brain function to a middle-aged woman who was severely injured in a car crash 18 years ago.\nExperts said the woman was a test case and that it was far from clear whether the procedure would prompt improvements for others like her. That group includes an estimated 3 million to 5 million people, many of them veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with disabilities related to traumatic brain injuries.\n\"This is a pilot study,\" said Dr. Steven Flanagan, chairman of the department of rehabilitation medicine at NYU Langone Health, who was not part of the research team. \"And we certainly cannot generalize from it. But I think it's a very promising start, and there is certainly more to come in this work.\"\nThe woman, now in her early 40s, was a student when the crash occurred. She soon recovered sufficiently to live independently. But she suffered from persistent fatigue and could not read or concentrate for long, leaving her unable to hold a competitive job, socialize much or resume her studies.\nShe and her family asked to remain anonymous, and the researchers did not reveal further details other than to remark on her improvement.\n\"Her life has changed,\" said Dr. Nicholas Schiff, a professor of neurology and neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medicine and a member of the study team. \"She is much less fatigued, and she's now reading novels. The next patient might not do as well. But we want to keep going to see what happens.\"\nA lack of research funding and interest has made that difficult, he added. \"We've not been able to do so because there's an incredible drag on doing anything for this population,\" he said\nSchiff and another team leader, Dr. Joseph Giacino, director of rehabilitation neuropsychology at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, presented the case at a brain-science convention in Washington, D.C., in an informal, public session.\nThe two collaborated with clinical centers at Stanford University and the University of Utah, and with researchers at the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Jaimie Henderson, a neurosurgeon at Stanford, performed the surgery, and the team is recruiting other candidates in the San Francisco Bay Area to see if the procedure is viable for other people with mild to moderate traumatic brain injuries.\nIn the surgery, performed last summer, Henderson threaded two electrodes into the thalamus, a switching center deep in the brain. Precision was critical. Before the surgery, the team did extensive work to identify specific regions in the brain that support activation of the frontal cortex, which is involved in thinking and planning, and the basal ganglia, which supports learning and memory.\n\"Operating on the thalamus is pretty routine,\" Henderson said in an email. \"This is a different target, though, and difficult to hit because of its size and shape. So a bit of extra precision is called for.\"\nThe electrodes were connected to a pacemaker device, implanted in the woman's chest wall, that produced active current for 12 hours a day, from morning to evening.\nThe woman improved gradually, and by three months was consistently scoring about 15 percent better than she had previously on standardized tests of attention, planning and executive function. She also reported 70 percent less fatigue on a standard measure, and no longer took daily afternoon naps, as she had before, the researchers reported.\nAt one point during her rehabilitation, the pacemaker accidentally failed, and her gains tapered off. Doctors quickly restored the current, and her ability improved.\nA Section on 04/14/2019\n", "label": "human"}

The fire, declared fully extinguished some 15 hours after it began, ravaged the 850-year-old building\u2019s roof and caused its spire to collapse.\nBut firefighters who worked through the night managed to save the Paris landmark\u2019s main stone structure, including its two towers. The cause of the fire is not yet clear.\nParis public prosecutor R\u00e9my Heitz said his office was \u201cfavouring the theory of an accident\u201d, but had assigned 50 people to work on what he believed would be a \u201clong\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d investigation. Other officials have suggested it could be linked to extensive renovation works taking place at the cathedral. Thoughts are now turning to how Notre-Dame will be rebuilt.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron vowed to reconstruct the historic building even as the fire still burned, while two French business magnates had pledged about \u20ac300m ($339m; \u00a3259m) between them by early Tuesday.\nHe announced a national subscription would be launched to raise money for the cathedral to be rebuilt. Offers of help with the reconstruction have also poured in from around the globe, with European Council President Donald Tusk calling on EU member states to rally round.\nWhat happened?\nThe blaze was discovered at 18:43 (16:43 GMT), and firefighters were called. The flames quickly reached the roof of the cathedral, destroying the wooden interior before toppling the spire. Fears grew that the cathedral\u2019s famous towers would also be destroyed.\nBut while a number of fires did begin in the towers, French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said they were successfully stopped before they could spread. By the early hours of Tuesday, the fire was declared under control, with the Paris fire service saying it was fully extinguished by 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT).\nThe pavements here on the Rive Gauche across the Seine are packed with people shuffling along, stopping to take photos or pose for selfies, staring over at the huge, grey bulk of the cathedral.\nPolice stop the crowds getting any closer, as firefighters use a tapering crane to inspect the facade by the cold light of day. The shrill whistles of traffic police cut the air as sirens of emergency vehicles pass mournfully through the hum of the traffic. But every so often, the birdsong reminds you it\u2019s spring in the City of Light.

Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Luxembourg Gardens, Euro Disney, they have a packed agenda of Easter holiday fun but they are solemn and respectful when they talk about the disaster. It\u2019s a sad moment for Dutch people too, they say. Everyone knows Notre-Dame.\nWhat is the damage?\nSearch teams had already begun assessing the extent of the damage when dawn broke over the French capital. The cathedral\u2019s blackened stone and charred scaffolding were revealed to onlookers for the first time.\nFire brigade spokesman Lt-Col Gabriel Plus said: \u201cThe whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more.\u201d However, it could have been much worse. Mr Nu\u00f1ez said that, had fire crews not entered the building, \u201cwithout doubt it would have collapsed\u201d, French newspaper Le Monde reported.\nPhotos appear to show that at least one of the cathedral\u2019s famed rose windows has survived, although there are concerns for some of the other stained-glass windows. Franck Riester, France\u2019s culture minister, warned that while the principal structure had been saved, the building was still unstable.\nMr Nu\u00f1ez said that \u201coverall\u201d, the structure was in good condition, but that \u201csome vulnerabilities\u201d had been identified in the stone vaults and the remainder of the building\u2019s ceiling. Experts have not yet been allowed on site to assess the damage, due to the dangers.\nWhat happens next?\nIndividuals and groups are mobilising to help rebuild Notre-Dame.

This is big news for vegetarians, of course, who need something to eat at a rest stop at 2 a.m., too, but also for Burger King, who could finally give vegetarians a reason to spend money at the chain, and for Impossible Foods, who has raised over $389 million in financing by betting big on their \u201cdisconcertingly beef-like plant-based meat.\u201d\nOf course White Castle has been selling Impossible Sliders for a while now, and Impossible Foods competitor Beyond Meat has a deal with Carl\u2019s Jr. for its own beefless burger, but there are a lot of Burger Kings in the world and a lot of hungry meatless Monday enthusiasts who want a quick bite.

{"text": "When an old person dies, a library burns to the ground.\n\u2014Variation of an African proverb\nIn the mid-1990s, Mrs. Irene Harrison (1890\u20131999) from Akron, Ohio, stayed in my bed-and-breakfast in Western North Carolina. On her last visit, Mrs. Harrison, daughter of famed tire entrepreneur Frank Seiberling, was 105 years old. She was a petite, gracious lady of the old school who proved highly entertaining on some occasions. Once when I was passing through the living room, she was discussing politics with her son. I paused to ask her to name her favorite president.\n\u201cRoosevelt!\u201d she exclaimed.\nI was stunned. Franklin Roosevelt was this stanch conservative\u2019s favorite president?\n\u201cTheodore Roosevelt,\u201d she said after a pause. \u201cHe was the best of the last hundred years.\u201d\nLater, I calculated that she was 18 years old when Roosevelt\u2014Theodore, that is\u2014became president. Given her father\u2019s many accomplishments, Mrs. Harrison probably met President Roosevelt in person.\nI heard several stories from her past, but if I had my wits about me, I would have sat this woman down, pen and paper at hand, and asked her scores of questions about history. Here was a woman who was 13 years old when the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, who was married by the end of World War I, and who lived through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression.\nWith her departure, at least in my case, a library had burned down.\nI did interview another centenarian, Miss Lindsey, who lived down the street from me. Though her life was not nearly as glamorous as that of the well-to-do Mrs. Harrison, she had many good stories about our town and about Mrs. Palmer, who had established our bed-and-breakfast as a tourist home 80 years earlier.\nThroughout this interview, Miss Lindsey remained calm, speaking in her soft, drowsy way. Only when I asked her what the greatest event in the town was for her personally did Miss Lindsey bolt up in her chair and cry out, \u201cIndoor plumbing! Indoor plumbing!\u201d\nHere was a lesson about human beings and history not commonly found in a textbook or taught in a classroom.\nOur ignorance of American history, or worse, our misperception of our past, is wreaking havoc on our culture. Many of us have laughed, sometimes sadly, at those videos on YouTube of young people who don\u2019t know the reason for the Fourth of July or who believe we fought the French in World War I. But the damage caused by ignorance runs much deeper.\nOur lack of enlightenment about the triumphs and sufferings of those who have come before us, some of whom faced far greater trials than we have, causes us to exaggerate our own importance and difficulties. Moreover, our benighted ignorance renders us more simple-minded in our approach to public affairs, more childlike, for it is children who live for and in the present.\nTeaching our young people their history, the cost and sacrifice of what it took to make our nation, is the solution to this problem.\nAnd here is one way to start immediately. You don\u2019t need textbooks. You don\u2019t need a classroom.\nYou just need an old person.\nHaving the young talk to the old can bring the past to glorious life. Whether it\u2019s Mrs. Harrison praising the Rough Rider or Miss Lindsey enthusing over toilets and showers, the past bursts into life.\nSome high-school students I taught in Asheville, North Carolina, volunteered for a project interviewing veterans in the local VA hospital. They came away from those interviews deeply appreciative of the sacrifices of some of these soldiers and much more aware of their country\u2019s history.\nAnother reason to ask questions of the old is regret. Both my mother and father have passed away. I know a good deal about their past, but wish now that I had taken a greater interest. The 14-year-old who asks her 80-year-old grandfather or 90-year-old aunt about their past may find a treasure beyond reckoning. And in the best of circumstances, what they learn will send them off to the history books to read about World War II, Vietnam, or the early history of rock-and-roll.\nAn immediate way to teach our young people history is to introduce them to elderly men and women, who can give them a perspective on history unavailable in any high-school textbook. In the case of Mrs. Harrison, for example, we are talking about a woman who remembered the Spanish-American War, who had lived through the Roaring Twenties, and who had lived during both the flight of the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk and the American landing on the moon in 1969.\nSo if we want to teach history and if our books are inadequate, then we should turn to the elderly. We allow our children to connect with the past. We give them the opportunity to share that past with their own children and grandchildren. Maybe we even teach them that the past is not as clear-cut as stated in textbooks or popular ignorance.\nWhen an old person dies, a library burns to the ground.\nWe need that library.\nHave your kids talk to old people.\nThis post, The Best Way to Teach History to Children, was originally published on Intellectual Takeout by Jeff Minick, a free-lance writer and teacher living in Front Royal, Virginia.\n", "label": "human"}

It was the second crash of a 737 MAX within five months, following a Lion Air crash in Indonesia.\nIn a clear indication of where Ethiopian investigators are focusing most of their attention, the report cleared the pilots of using incorrect procedures and issued two recommendations directed at plane maker Boeing and regulators.\n\"The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft,\" Ethiopia's Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said as she delivered the official report.\nA statement from the airline said flight 302 repeatedly nose-dived before it crashed, citing the preliminary report.\n\"Despite all their hard work and full compliance with emergency procedures, it was very unfortunate that they could not recover the airplane from the persistence [of] nose-diving,\" the airline's statement on Twitter said.\nMs Moges recommended Boeing review the aircraft control system and that aviation authorities confirm the problem had been solved before allowing that model of plane back into the air.\nThe 737 MAX 8 was grounded globally following the crash, which was the second deadly accident in six months involving the new model.\nBoeing responded to the report by expressing its \"deepest sympathies\" for the victims and families, and said safety was a \"core value\" at the company.\n\"Boeing's technical experts continue to assist in this investigation and company-wide teams are working to address lessons from the Lion Air Flight 610 accident in October,\" the company said in a statement.\nNot yet known if structural problem exists on MAX 8s\nEthiopian investigators cannot yet say whether there is a structural problem with the jetliner, based on flight and cockpit voice data from the fatal crash.\n\"We will analyse whether other problems were existing on this aircraft,\" Amdye Ayalew Fanta told a news conference, adding this would take between six months and a year.\nIn line with international rules on air accidents, the preliminary report did not attribute blame. Nor did it give a detailed analysis of the flight, which is expected to take several months before a final report due within a year.\nHowever, the report could spark a debate with Boeing about how crew responded to problems triggered by faulty data from an airflow sensor, particularly over whether they steadied the plane before turning key software off.\nFamilies of the 157 victims, regulators and travellers around the world are waiting for clues to the accident after the new Boeing jet crashed six minutes after take-off.\nThe preliminary report into the Lion Air disaster said the pilots lost control after grappling with the aircraft's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software, a new automated anti-stall feature that repeatedly lowered the nose of the aircraft based on faulty data from a sensor.\nBoeing said it had successfully tested an update of the MCAS software designed to reduce its authority and make it easer for pilots to handle.\n\"To ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again, Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 MAX,\" the company said in its statement.\nThe plane maker is the focus of investigations by the US Justice Department, the Transportation Department's inspector general, and congressional committees.\nInvestigations are also looking at the role of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US, which certified the MAX in 2017 and declined to ground it after the first deadly crash in October.\nThe FAA said in a statement that it is continuing to work toward a full understanding of what happened and will take appropriate action as findings become available.\nAP/Reuters\nTopics: air-and-space, accidents, disasters-and-accidents, ethiopia\nFirst posted\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Before meeting its end in a planet-circling dust storm, the Opportunity rover traversed nearly 48km over the perilous Martian surface. In some ways, we travelled along with Oppy thanks to the thousands of images it sent back to Earth. But what did Oppy\u2019s journey sound like?\nThere weren\u2019t microphones transmitting sounds the sounds of Opportunity or its partner, Spirit, but surely they must have kicked up a ruckus as their wheels ground over rocks and dry dust. Luckily for the curious among us, however, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California has rover testbeds, including a large area designed to recreate Mars\u2019 surface called the MarsYard.\nThere, engineering models of rovers traverse the model terrain. Together with the science of sound, we can figure out what the rovers sounded like, both on Earth and on Mars.\nOpportunity\u2019s cleated metal wheels, each with their own motor rolling 5cm per second over Martian rock, created the exact crackling sound you\u2019d expect from a metal-wheeled robot rolling over dirt. Meanwhile, the larger Curiosity rover presents an utter cacophony of screeches as its own metal wheels traverse the rocks of the MarsYard.\nBut there\u2019s a \u201cpretty big difference\u201d in the way sound travels through the air on Mars compared to Earth, Don Banfield, principal research scientist at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, told Gizmodo. Sound is just our brains translating vibrations in air molecules into more meaningful data, but how the sound travels is dependent on the air it travels through.\nMars\u2019 atmosphere is mostly composed of carbon dioxide, and is around 1 per cent the thickness of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which is of 78 per cent nitrogen, 21 per cent oxygen, and a trace amount of other stuff.\nThe difference in the component molecules\u2019 structures and the thickness of the air would produce two noticeable distortions to sounds once you\u2019re a few feet away from the rovers, Banfield explained. There aren\u2019t enough molecules to carry the highest-frequency sounds \u2014 the ones with the shortest wavelengths \u2014 so at farther distances you wouldn\u2019t hear sound with frequencies higher than 10,000 Hz, the pitches that give cymbals and bells their brilliant quality.\nOn the other end, the lower bass tones with frequencies around 100 Hz disappear on Mars, as some energy that would otherwise cause the wave to move forward instead is spent making the carbon dioxide molecules rotate.\nAdditionally, you\u2019re not just standing on Mars in shorts and a t-shirt \u2014 you\u2019d be bearing the winds, low-pressure atmosphere, and cold temperatures in a spacesuit. The sounds would be a bit more muffled.\nThough we\u2019ll never hear what Spirit, Opportunity, or Curiosity actually sounded like on Mars, there will soon be some experiments to measure sounds on the Red Planet. The InSight lander has already measured vibrations from the Martian wind, and the Mars 2020 rover will bring two microphones onboard so we can finally hear the wind, rocks, and grinding metal on Mars\u2019 surface.\nAnd who knows, perhaps one day in our lifetime, a human will get to hear those sounds directly.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Popular television serials make much of the fact that Akbar was illiterate; a term used recently was \u201cj?hil unpa?h\u201d (ignorant and illiterate).\nTrue, all early attempts to teach Akbar how to read and write failed. The historian Andre Wink describes the many attempts made to formally educate him.\nAs one story goes, the astrologically auspicious hour to begin instruction had been set at the exact moment the prince turned four years, four months, four days old. Akbar, however, never turned up.\nHis tutors failed spectacularly, or else taught him other skills. One imparted to him the taste for pigeon-flying. Another did his best and then went off to Mecca, presumably to expiate for his utter failure in educating a future ruler. His father Humayun, hoping to be of some encouragement, sent him Persian verses he had composed, but Akbar remained disinterested.\nBut while he evidently failed to learn to read and write, Akbar, like all Mughal Princes, knew languages such as Turkic, Persian and was instructed in the manners and customs of Hindustan. He underwent instruction in the liberal arts as well, for instance, taking drawing lessons from the Persian masters and was skilled in crafts such as carpentry. Moreover, like all princes, Akbar received martial training from a very early age and assumed military command quite early as well.\nAs a future ruler, he also imbibed the virtues of caution and the need to be equable under all circumstances.\nAbu al-Fazl ibn-Mubarak, nobleman and devoted friend, who was also Akbar\u2019s biographer, notes in the Akbarnamah how Akbar arrived at his judgments on cases brought before him, keeping in mind not just what the laws ordained but also eyewitness accounts, his own assessment of the information, and aspects like circumstance and physiognomy.\nAs for his sons, their rigorous instruction regime remained uninterrupted even by travel or their long campaigns. Mughal princesses such as Gulbadan, Humayun\u2019s sister, received formal literary education from especially appointed matrons.\nAkbar\u2019s \u201cilliteracy\u201d wasn\u2019t really unusual for its times. As Wink suggests, kings of medieval Europe were aided by scribes and officials. There are other theories too accounting for Akbar\u2019s lack of scholastic attitude in his childhood. Ellen Smart in her 1981 essay makes the case that Akbar may have been dyslexic, though there is little evidence or corroborating facts in support of this. Annemarie Schimmel suggests that the word \u201cummi\u201d sometimes used to describe Akbar is ascribed a different meaning in the Koran: an inspired mystic, or someone whose knowledge is divinely given and not taught. Abu al-Fazl, in far too cloying terms, described Akbar as having \u201cilm laduni\u201d (knowledge directly from god).\nThe Portuguese Jesuit priest and traveller Antonio Monserrate described Akbar as a man of \u201cexcellent judgement\u201d and \u201cgood memory\u201d, whose learning had been greatly accentuated by his ability to listen to others. In his own memoirs, Jahangir wrote that his father conversed, debated and associated with men of knowledge of every religion, especially with the learned and the pundits of the land and thus much became clear to him through this exchange with the wise. During Akbar\u2019s fifteen years at Sikri, religious debates were held every Thursday at the Ibadat Khana of Fatehpur Sikri.\nHis tutors failed spectacularly, or else taught him other skills. One gave to him a taste for pigeon-flying. Another did his best and then went off to Mecca, presumably to expiate for his utter failure in educating a future ruler. His father Humayun, hoping to be of some encouragement, sent him Persian verses he had composed, but Akbar\nremained disinterested\nA lot has been written on Akbar\u2019s memory, especially his aural ability to remember most things he listened to, and his sharp discernment and critical abilities. He remembered what was read to him, choosing of his own accord the books he wanted read. His memory in particular helped him decide the books he wanted translated and the paintings that were to serve as accompaniment.\nThe Ain-i-Akbari mentions that Akbar would have books read out to him every evening. He chose readers and those who called out the daily prayers, especially for their pleasant voices. Bada\u2019uni, the temperamental writer and historian who constantly competed with Abu al Fazl for Akbar\u2019s attention, wrote that his appointment as one of the emperor\u2019s chosen readers followed precisely because his voice had the \u201csweetness and the ravishing tones of a parrot\u201d. Readers would be paid according to the number of leaves they had read, as indicated by jottings, some made by the emperor himself, on the book\u2019s very last leaf.\nIn her book Art of Memory, Frances Yates has mentioned memory-enhancing techniques in use in ancient Europe; such mnemonics for instance imagined a certain place in the mind to store things to be remembered. While such a study hasn\u2019t been done in the South Asian context, developing memory was an important component of the early education system, and it wasn\u2019t just rote learning as such systems have been conveniently dismissed.\nUniversities in ancient India practiced and taught memory techniques. The criteria for actors as cited by the Natyashastra, included the possession of a good memory; travelling minstrels and bards needed one too, as they added to the stories in their repertoire. And while there were scribes to maintain records, officials and nobles were expected to have good memories.\nAkbar\u2019s love for books also led him to devote time to the collection of books in his library \u2013 one he inherited from his father and expanded substantially at Fatehpur Sikri.\nLibraries did exist in India despite the oral tradition of learning. Xuanchang mentions Harshavardhan\u2019s library, from which the emperor generously gifted him cartloads of books. There are historical references to libraries in Kashmir, Assam, and Pattan in Gujarat. Nalanda\u2019s famous library, the Dharmaganja had three separate buildings: Ratnadadhi, Ratnasagara and Ratnaganjaka.\nDuring the sultanate period, the collections of the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya and the Afghan noble Ghazi Khan were accessible to the public. Sultan Mahmud Begada of Gujarat had a library in his palace. In 1472, Mahmud Gawan, the noted vazir in the Bahamani kingdom, sponsored a college and a library with 30,000 books, and these later came to Aurangzeb during his Deccan campaign.\nBabur had a short-lived presence in Delhi and Agra, but he did have a library in Delhi, which included books brought from Farghana and ones acquired from India. Humayun set up his own collection in the Sher Mandal in the Purana Qila, actually built by Sher Shah. It was this collection that Akbar expanded, via acquisitions, translations, donations, and also legacies, as when he inherited several hundreds of Faizi\u2019s valuable manuscripts.\nThe imperial library, it is believed, was located in an immense hall on one side of the octagonal tower in the fort, and included even a section in the zenana. Women of the royal household had their own libraries. The tradition began with Gulbadan Begum and apparently continued until the time of Zeb-un-nisa, Aurangzeb\u2019s eldest child and daughter, who was also a poet.\nAkbar organised the library more systematically; its staff cataloguing and classifying the nearly 24,000 books in it. Vincent Smith in his book on Akbar says that his library had few rivals in the known world. Besides, the head librarian, called the Nazim or Mutamad, and his deputy, there were assistants who entered details of the books into separate registers for each subject, ranging from astronomy, music, astrology, to commentaries on the Koran, theology and the law.\nOther staff included scribes, calligraphers, book-binders and book-bearers. Manuscripts were encased in silk, bound with lacquer or leather, and richly engraved and inscribed. Books, according to Abu al-Fazl, were even carried during battle, for the army was a mobile camp.\nAbu al-Fazl mentions some of the works this library contained. Akbar especially took an interest in contemporary historical works, such as the Jama\u2019at Tawarikh, a book on the Turkish Mongolian dynasty. Baburnamah was a favourite. There were two copies of the Khalil wa Dimnah, works by the Persian poet Sa\u2019adi \u2013 the Gulistan and the Bustan \u2013 and also those of Amir Khusrau, such as the romance Duval Rani Khidr Khan. These were all lavishly illustrated, as was Firdausi\u2019s Shahnamah. A particular favourite of all Mughals was Jalaluddin Rumi\u2019s Mathnawi. Babur\u2019s father had rated it highly, and, later, Dara Shikoh copied extracts from it and Aurangzeb was often moved to tears when it was recited.\nAkbar\u2019s court also drew writers, and it was he who created the position of poet laureate. Ghazali Meshedi was the first, followed by Faizi. Besides Persian writers, there were also Brajbasha writers, especially in the Mughal court of his successors.\nThe maktabkhana, or translation bureau, was attached to the library, Akbar sourced texts from Sanskrit, Arabic and Turkish and had these translated into Persian, with several copies being made.\nHe picked books out of personal interest and those that he thought would be appreciated and read by many others. Akbar emphasised aspects of clarity and reason rather than convention or even morality.\nAmong the first books he picked was the Hamzanamah, an adventure tale from Persia. In 1574, Bada\u2019uni began work on translating the popular collection, Singhasan Battisi. As he narrates the story, a learned brahmin was first called on to interpret the book. Akbar liked the first leaf Bada\u2019uni translated and the latter went on to complete the book in 1581.\nThe translation of the Mahabharata as Razmnamah began in 1582.\nThe translation method saw a dual process: learned scholars rendered it from Sanskrit into Hindi and then it was rendered into Persian, as was described by Naqib Khan, one of the translators of this work.\nAkbar had a clear idea of the end objectives and basics regarding translations. As scholars have explained, he was keen on getting to the original meaning of the work and on making it accessible.\nOn one occasion, he upbraided Bada\u2019uni for some \u201cfalse\u201d, even \u201cbigoted\u201d imputation in his translation of the Mahabharata.\nTwo texts of the Khalil wa Dimnah were sourced and translated, one by Abu al-Fazl and the other, based on the Jain version called Pancakhyana, by Mustafa Khaliqdas Abbasi. As for his own life, Akbar commissioned Abu al-Fazl to write the Akbarnamah. This was heavily illustrated in 1586-87. A new set came up a decade later in 1596-97.\nUnder Akbar, the atelier attached to the kitaabkhana that housed scribes, painters and calligraphers expanded exponentially. In the time of the later Mughals, interest in painting spread to other regional kingdoms and to the provinces, and artists travelled freely, not attached to any particular court. They often also accompanied the king on his long campaigns.\nIt was the Hamzanamah that first Akbar had illustrated lavishly. The book was written on fabric, taking up 19 lines on one side. It had 1400 illustrations on the reverse side, so that the reader could still read while holding up the illustration for the audience to see.\nThe project began in 1558 and dozens of artists worked on it for 15 years. Fewer than 200 folios of the Hamzanamah have survived, some now in the V&A museum. In other artistic firsts in the Mughal period, artists appeared in paintings too, and portraiture especially was a new innovation.\n", "label": "human"}

REUTERS/Yara Nardi.\nBy Angelo Amante\nROME (Reuters) - The three metro stops serving the heart of Rome are shut because of decrepit escalators, a new blow to a city already struggling with a garbage crisis, potholed roads and tumbling trees.\nThe problem first emerged last October when an escalator collapsed in Repubblica station, injuring 24 people. Most locals expected the stop to re-open within days. Six months later, it remains closed. And this past month, worries about escalators closed two more city-centre stations.\n\"The impact on business and on the city's image is disastrous,\" said Valter Gianmaria, president of Rome's Confesercenti retailers' association. \"How can Rome compete with other European cities?\"\nAccording to the World Metro Database, Rome has one of the smallest underground networks of any major European city -- just 61 km (38 miles) of tracks. By comparison, Madrid has 293 km and London 402 km, Europe's largest underground network.\nTransport officials say they are trying to make the escalators safe. But they were custom-built, making spare parts hard to come by. The contract of the company charged with their maintenance has been cancelled and new technicians have been called in.\nRome's ATAC public transport company said it hoped to reopen the station next to the city's Spanish Steps in time for Easter. No date has been set for the other two.\nWhenever they decide to open Repubblica, it will be too late for Anna Janos, who will have to close her clothing store, \"Pontevecchio 69\", because turnover has plunged 50 percent since last October.\n\"People no longer come here to go shopping,\" said Janos. \"I took over this business in 2017, but now I'll find a job as someone else's employee.\"\n(Editing by Crispian Balmer, Larry King)\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Baltimore\u2019s acting mayor and several other elected officials said Monday that they view the Maryland Jockey Club\u2019s closure of nearly 7,000 seats at Pimlico Race Course as retribution for losing a legislative fight with the city about how to spend state subsidies on horse racing tracks.\nCity officials are demanding evidence of the safety problems that prompted the closure of the grandstand\u2019s seats and are sending building inspectors to assess what impact the jockey club\u2019s decision might have on other seating areas at the 149-year-old racetrack in Northwest Baltimore.\nThe jockey club\u2019s decision \u2014 announced Saturday \u2014 to shutter the oldest section at Old Hilltop came a little more than a month before the track\u2019s lucrative Preakness weekend and just days after Maryland lawmakers ended the 2019 legislative session without passing a company-backed bill to invest state funds at Laurel Park instead of Pimlico.\nOfficials with The Stronach Group, which owns the jockey club, said the decision was based on an engineering firm\u2019s findings they received in late March that 6,670 seats in the Old Grandstand\u2019s open-air section are \u201cno longer suitable to sustain that level of load bearing weight.\u201d\nSeveral elected officials said Monday that they want the company to release the engineering report and question why it did not notify state lawmakers about the findings before the General Assembly session ended April 8. The funding bill favored by Stronach did not end in defeat until that night, and the decision to close the seats was made a few days later.\n\u201cYou have a group that for 17 years has systematically disinvested in Pimlico and then, after the city folks who were negotiating during the session were successful, all of a sudden they have this emergency just shortly after the session closes,\u201d said Lester Davis, a spokesman for acting Mayor Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young. \u201cIt was questionable timing.\u201d\nDavis said Young, who is acting mayor while Catherine Pugh remains on sick leave, asked city agencies to look into the conditions at Pimlico.\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Housing and Community Development said the agency would examine whether the seating closure could affect the rest of Pimlico\u2019s ability to host tens of thousands of guests during next month\u2019s Preakness Stakes and Black-Eyed Susan Day.\n\u201cWe are now having our building inspection team request a copy of the engineer\u2019s report and conduct an inspection,\u201d said department spokeswoman Tammy Hawley. \u201cWe are also reaching out for the fire marshal\u2019s office on the matter.\u201d\nStronach officials said they would not release the engineer\u2019s report because they are still reviewing its findings. The company does not conduct annual engineering reviews of the structure, they said.\nBill Hecht, a Stronach executive, said the company commissioned the engineering report after the Maryland Stadium Authority\u2019s December study concluded that Pimlico \u201chad outlived its usefulness.\u201d\n\u201cWe felt it was important to learn the implications of that,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cAt the beginning of this year, we hired an independent engineering firm to do a thorough assessment of the facility. We received those findings in late March and have been determining the best way to proceed since that time. Our decision to decommission the seats was made late last week.\u201d\nHe said the legislative session had nothing to do with the closure.\n\u201cThis decision should in no way be interpreted as anything other than ensuring the safety of our guests and employees,\u201d Hecht said.\nThe company acted on the seat closure, he said, \u201cso that people who have previously purchased grandstand tickets can make alternative arrangements.\u201d\nDel. Sandy Rosenberg, a Baltimore Democrat, said the Old Grandstand\u2019s condition was a \u201crelevant fact\u201d that lawmakers should have been alerted to as debate over the funding bill continued after Stronach had received the findings.\n\u201cIt is curious that this was made public after the legislative session,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cWere 6,000 people put in harm\u2019s way by sitting in that grandstand before?\u201d\nA 2017 Maryland Stadium Authority report did flag the conditions. It also stated that the jockey club had conducted a review of the structure but that it did not release its findings.\n\u201cWhile the historic structure has renovation potential from an architectural/design perspective, the structural integrity of the plywood decking and exposed steel need to be assessed,\u201d states a \u201cKey Facilities Deficiencies\u201d section of the 2017 stadium authority report. \u201cThe facilities are in generally sound condition according to the Management\u2019s description of a previously conducted structural report.\u201d\nBut the jockey club did not provide the structural analysis to the stadium authority team conducting the assessment.\n\u201cIt is our understanding that the structure of all Grandstand/Clubhouse buildings are at maximum capacity,\u201d the stadium authority report stated at the time.\nThe stadium authority\u2019s report in December again raised concerns about Pimlico\u2019s overall conditions, but no city or state agency took action.\nA stadium authority spokeswoman said the agency \u201chas no ownership or operational responsibilities at Pimlico.\u201d And city building inspectors respond to complaints about possible violations of building codes and conduct inspections only when new permits are filed \u2014 including ones from the jockey club to build temporary structures during the Preakness, for which Pimlico hosted nearly 135,000 people last year.\nMike Hopkins, the executive director of the Maryland Racing Commission, said his agency \u201cwas not aware of any prior structural issues.\u201d\nCity, state and neighborhood representatives all said the condition of the Old Grandstand is evidence of how Stronach has favored the use of slots-funded state subsidies at Laurel Park. Over the past five years, the company has used 87 percent of $45 million in track-renovation subsidies from the state on Laurel instead of Pimlico.\nThey worry that the move to close the seats is the first step in trying to declare an emergency at the track that could allow the company to move all its operations to Laurel.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "More than a year after announcing a series of cross-platform integrations, Google and Dropbox have finally given a first glimpse of what a deep partnership between the two platforms will look like.\nPresenting at Google Cloud Next \u201919, Google\u2019s annual cloud-focused conference, Dropbox officially unveiled a new feature that lets its business users work with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides without leaving Dropbox.\nThe duo first announced the collaboration last March, so this has been a long time coming. In the intervening months, other facets of the partnership have borne fruit, including a Dropbox add-on for Gmail and a Google Cloud Identity plugin that allows Dropbox admins to leverage Google login credentials for business accounts. But the biggest part of the tie-up is undoubtedly the open beta launch today that will bring G Suite content into Dropbox, allowing users to create, edit, save, and share Google-format documents, spreadsheets, and presentations directly from within Dropbox.\nThis move follows a similar integration with Dropbox rival Box, which introduced a public beta of Box for G Suite back in August, before rolling it out more widely in December.\nSuch partnerships seem counterintuitive on the surface \u2014 after all, G Suite already comes with its very own cloud-storage service in the form of Google Drive. But the bottom line is, many companies subscribe to G Suite for organizational, communication, and collaboration apps such as Docs, Calendar, and Gmail, and prefer to use other cloud storage services. Indeed, it\u2019s not unusual for organizations to subscribe to multiple services for different apps, so by joining up in this way, Google and Dropbox can keep their respective customers happy.\nIn an interview with VentureBeat last year, Billy Blau, Dropbox\u2019s head of technology partnerships, said that more than 50 percent of Dropbox Business subscribers also use G Suite. \u201cIt really comes from the fact that we have a big overlap of customer bases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have hundreds of millions of users who have Gmail addresses and are also G Suite users.\u201d\nHow it works\nTo leverage the Google / Dropbox integration, you first need to opt in and connect your Google and Dropbox accounts. (It\u2019s worth noting here this integration will only work with a Dropbox Business subscription.)\nOnce in, you can work with G Suite content in pretty much exactly the same way as you would inside Google Drive \u2014 files can be created from scratch from the Windows system tray, Mac menu bar, or through Dropbox.com, while users across all Dropbox platforms (desktop, web, and mobile) will be able to search, view, comment, move, copy, and delete files. On mobile, users will not be able to edit files.\nDocuments can be made entirely collaborative inside Dropbox too, with the ability to invite users to edit and comment. Files can be added to a shared Dropbox folder for anyone to access, though they can also be shared on a one-off basis with a specific individual, without adding them to a shared folder.\nIt\u2019s also worth highlighting some potentially interesting use cases that are possible due to another update Dropbox rolled out a couple of weeks back. The company introduced a new search feature into its desktop apps, allowing users to search for documents by clicking the system tray in Windows or or menu bar on a Mac. This makes it possible to search through everything attached to a Dropbox account, even if it\u2019s not synchronized to the desktop, while it also enables users to search by text contained inside documents \u2014 not just in the filename.\nThus with G Suite integration, Dropbox users can now search through all their Docs, Sheets, and Slides files from the search field in the desktop app, and also use keywords contained inside the files to help them find specific documents.\nThis is a genuinely useful integration that will likely prove popular with millions of enterprise customers for both companies. And they can opt in to the open beta program starting from today.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "THE EDITOR, Sir:\nThe violent series of onslaught on the female population in Jamaica continues unabated. Seldom has a month gone by without reports of at least one woman losing her life to domestic violence.\nWhile the public reels under the nightmarish effect of these attacks, the electronic and print media seem to be relishing the opportunity to unleash a slew of sensational features upon an already-traumatised population.\nMedia houses compete for dominance, and it seems there is no limit to the extent reporters will go to serve up gripping follow-up stories without sparing thoughts of the implications of their interviews and reports on the family of the victims.\nFURTHERING ABUSE\nRecently, one story shared by a popular newspaper on social media drew the wrath of radio personality Kabu Maat Kheru, who expressed her disgust on that platform after multiple pictures of the 12-year-old girl, recently orphaned, were splattered over the pages of a popular newspaper. Kabu stated that by having the child\u2019s picture all over the newspaper, they were further abusing her. \u201cThe newspaper ought to know better, we should desist from sharing this article,\u201d Kabu wrote.\nDomestic violence is an insidious problem involving partners who are locked in a love-hate relationship. Generally, the male uses violence, or threats of violence, to keep the woman trapped in the relationship. Any real or imagined fear of losing his partner sparks violence, which can sometime end tragically for one or both partners.\nThe time is ripe for Jamaica to address this problem. it\u2019s not enough to merely highlight the incidents in flowery stories which play on our emotions.\nIn addition to producing these gripping stories, we should be rallying calls for the government to:\n1) Provide shelters where victims of domestic violence can be safely housed while they receive help, away from their partners.\n2) Liaise with the relevant multidisciplinary agencies to disseminate the relevant public education, utilising suitable outlets such as TV, radio, and the print media.\n3) Provide for the effective training of police personnel who will act swiftly and decisively when dealing with reports involving domestic violence; knowing quite well that in these cases delay can be deadly.\n4) Provide the name of agencies where victims of domestic violence can receive psychological help.\nDomestic violence not only impacts on the partners in the relationship. Studies show that children who\u2019ve been exposed to domestic abuse have an increased risk of becoming abusers, or victims, themselves.\nThe voice of the media is powerful; let\u2019s unite and make our voices heard.\nGEORGE N.

And so we will go into the Royal Commission, fully openly offering what we knew, what could we have done, along with the other security sector agencies.\"\nShe said she and the intelligence community were horrified by the attack.\n\"My heart goes out to those families... we've been deeply affected by what happened and working tirelessly since the attacks to to ensure that we understand the intelligence picture, support the police investigations and prevent copycat attacks.\"\n", "label": "human"}

He said he still has more to give and he'll give it to the Giants.\nHe seemed a little less certain about what will happen after football.\nManning, in a season-ending interview with Newsday as the Giants concluded their four-day rookie minicamp Monday, said that if he returns for 2019, he would be open to coaching someday. He did not make it very clear what career path he would take. He has not yet added football to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a college graduate.\n\"It's cool to think about,\" he said of coaching. \"I don't like to put limitations on things. I'll stay focused on this year and whatever comes after that depends on what I feel that year has to be. Do I feel like I still want to try and play in the league? Do I have the ability to compete and do this? Do I have the desire? I don't know yet.\"\nManning had a good part of the answer by the time he addressed his future. The question is what that future could be. He might still have the Giants in mind when he was asked what he wanted to give the franchise if he decided to end his career after 2019.\n\"I want to give it everything,\" he said. \"Hopefully for that means be on the field, hopefully that means behind the scenes and whatever it is that's going to continue to be part of the team.

I don't know about what you mean by that, but I don't want to get into anything like that.\"\nIf Manning is so intent on being defensive, he might want to watch what he says.\n\"You want to play as long as you can, but you have to be understanding of why they're doing what they're doing,\" he said. \"You have to know that you want to play that amount of years. I want to.\"\nNot that he'll play for the Giants, though. They know what they'll get from the quarterback.

When an older child turns to a younger child (or creates a devastating little secret by crawling under her bed, disappearing for hours at a time and wearing her out), some folks decide the best solution is to barricade every inch of their home with baby-proofing materials and hot glue. If baby-proofing material is all you can afford or really want, just ask your child for help and ask if there are any items she may be able to hide from you.

{"text": "We\u2019re in the midst of an information economy where information is power and where the volumes of data we generate are staggering. In the age of information overload, it is critical to be able to securely and effectively process, analyze and transform the enormous amount of data coming into the enterprises. Information is the key to understanding consumer behavior and preferences. Sustainability and solutions to national security are threatened by the enormity of this data in everything from water supply, to forest cover, to human life.\nAt the outset of any profound change, companies must be prepared for the repercussions in order to avoid chaos.\nPrepare Yourself\nNever assume your customers will pay your company to analyze the data that you generate. Many data analytics companies find themselves in the position of consulting with organizations they may not even be directly serving in order to make accurate decisions, which is a drain on both time and resources. Ideally, companies should seek out partners who want to aggregate and share data; you will find data analytics partners of most companies.\nSome companies are proactive and proactively seek out data partners to help them visualize, evaluate and effectively adapt to the large volume of data they generate. They cannot afford not to analyze their data because new technologies present powerful opportunities to consume a huge volume of data in a systematic and efficient manner.\nThoroughly Understand What Data Is and What Your Customers Want\nOnce you know which data to gather and which data to turn into intelligence, you still have to make sense of it. Be mindful of how you interpret and use data. Sometimes simple math, numbers and graphs don\u2019t help you understand things like probability, hazard, and hidden signals. The powerful statistical and machine learning technology that we have available today offers breathtaking possibilities to analyze data. Segment your data, and then analyze different streams of data to discern the trends, game changers and what you need to do in order to evolve the way you do business.\nFigure 1. Analyst analytics for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems allows data to be controlled and analyzed to automatize processes and plan and execute maintenance, upgrades and maintenance procedures for the entire enterprise\nTake Appropriate Action\nEven the best analytics can\u2019t make an organization change overnight. It takes some time to make necessary transformations. There is no such thing as quick results and quick learning; agility is only one of the effects. Adapting to the changing environment requires investments in new software and new processes. Develop a global capability and use smart software analytics to enable this investment to be even faster and more effective.\nThreats to Data Security\nIn today\u2019s world, with new threats all around us, organizations need to be extremely prepared and aware of the many ways that data is stolen and utilized by criminals. Until now, combating data theft was mainly reactive. But over the last few years we have seen a tremendous rise in the use of digital forensics, computer forensics and data protection and recovery solutions. Without digital forensics there is nothing to recover stolen data (just like there\u2019s nothing to police a room without a camera). Computer forensics, which looks for the evidence a thief leaves behind, makes it much more difficult for a thief to avoid detection or escape. Armed with sophisticated tools and data analytic knowledge, we are able to quickly figure out that someone stole your data. Tools like this have decreased the likelihood of data theft and fraud losses.\nJohn Holland, the founder of a new company Forensiq, offers an in-depth analysis of this issue. His focus is to prevent identity theft by analyzing data on a large scale using machine learning and algorithms. In a fascinating interview he talks about how we are approaching an information-intensive planet, and it is not just a question of deploying sensors and sensors. Massive amounts of data are coming from the cloud, the Internet of Things, machine-to-machine communications, the cloud, mobile devices, the cloud, and location based services (LBS). It is these systems, which produce large amounts of data at great speed, data we are faced with how to proactively manage (e.g. not send passwords to just anyone for use in a public cloud), more and more effective threat detection and mitigation, and how to use algorithms to make sense of these massive amounts of data.\nLike everything else in life, having the right systems and the right people in place are critical for success. At another step in that process is getting started, knowing what you\u2019re doing, and doing what you need to do to maximize your success. If you haven\u2019t begun, now is a great time to start.\nJamie Metzl is a Chief Strategy Officer at Metzl Media, a Washington, D.C.-based public policy and marketing consulting firm focused on sustainability and technology.

{"text": "PROVO \u2014 Allie Scott woke up Thursday to news that wasn't reassuring.\nHer first reaction was anger, so she feared that one of her friends might be harmed. She was assured that no one in the BYU dean of honor code office had even met the student, but that didn't placate her concerns.\n\"He's been in high school,\" she said of the student in question. \"Those questions are raising my ire. I don't know what's going on.\" Scott and hundreds of other BYU students and families anxiously waited for news of how a BYU honor code violation that came up last fall would end up. And for hours, no one, not even Dean Tim Montes, told them more than \"the matter is on hold.\"\nAnd now that the process is over, very little is known. Scott was told in a chilling email that \"his higher ranking official, included among those made aware of the matter, advised him to be patient, provide letters of reference, do well in school, and pursue some form of philanthropic work,\" and not \"to disclose more.\"\nScott said she is speaking out because she wanted to make sure what happened to her friend wasn't repeated.\n\"I want to see a code of conduct that protects everyone,\" she said. \"Students, parents, alumni, alumni families and the community.\"\nScott said she was told that no action would be taken against the student, and that she had to wait for BYU to do that. She said that she was unable to talk to anyone at the Honor Code Office about the decision after that email, and that she doesn't know where to turn now that they're shutting the doors to those who want to find out why he was admonished.\n\"If it's a mild violation, if it's one that's gotten no consideration, it will impact the person and their future,\" she said. \"I was hoping that they wouldn't wait till he was a senior before looking into it.\nScott, who came out as a lesbian when she was in junior high, said there are many BYU students who are concerned about what could have been done to their straight, Mormon friend.\n\"I've had people from all over the world reach out to me,\" she said. \"This is something that happened in September and we heard nothing until this morning. We were hoping that they'd hear from them before they took action.\"\nScott said BYU should take a measured approach when disciplining honor code violations.\n\"I don't think there should be a punishment that's solely based on one person's opinion of the community,\" she said. \"For me, I think there should be a private room that they can come into and talk.\"\nThe student that was admonished was originally reprimanded because his sexual orientation didn't align with the theological beliefs that serve as the foundation of the BYU honor code. It's not clear what changed in the administration's minds, but what Scott said seems to have happened is that the student has not responded to BYU's requests to change his beliefs.\nAt the University of Denver, where she studied for two years, there is a student code of conduct that acknowledges and supports students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning.\n\"A decade ago, BYU's integrity codes said that no one who is not faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ could be admitted into BYU,\" said University of Denver President Scott Scarborough. \"The University of Denver has strong values of supporting LGBT individuals who experience discrimination at the hands of church leaders and their subordinates.\"\nScarborough said he spoke with the student's parents and they assured him they would not impose a religious sanction against their son because he's gay.\nScott said she hopes the student feels the same way.\n\"He's an adult, he's a BYU student,\" Scott said. \"He deserves better treatment. This was a small way to bring awareness.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

It would have nearly 60 underground parking spaces, he said.\nThe proposed project also would include a two-story, 24,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market store at the southern end of the property along Brighton Avenue, according to plans submitted to the city.\nBut Justine Louzada of Millwork Renewals LLC, a real estate firm that owns an apartment building across the street from the site, said she isn't convinced.\n\"I am very concerned about how much parking this would use,\" she said. \"I'm just not sure this is the kind of project for the area.\"\nLouzada said she has no problem with the market, but is concerned about the total number of parking spaces the project would require.

This will help.\"\nLouzada is chairman of Common Council's Neighborhoods and Business Services Committee.

Louzada said residents were \"no longer interested in conversation\" about the rezoning.\nPaul Van Dam, president of the Aspirations Neighborhood Association, a longtime Near West Side advocate, said the area is not a housing neighborhood.\n\"It's one thing to have a price tag attached to things,\" he said. \"I think the issue is based on the way the city wants to run the neighborhood. It wants residential use and everything else has to go to the surrounding streets.\"\nThe project's developers say they will not reduce the square footage of some of the apartment buildings to make them residential. Hazelton said he has not made a final decision about whether he will lower the size of the buildings.\nThe proposed apartment complex will be the third large-scale project planned for the Near West Side in recent years.\nThe Piscopo Jr. Revitalization Project, which includes the as-yet unbuilt Piscopo Riverside Tappan Zee Bridge Food and Wine Market at the former Syracuse Police Academy at 551 Westcott St., won zoning approval last year. The project is on hold while the area's development plan is adjusted.\nMillwork Renewals has submitted plans to the city for a mixture of about 50,000 square feet of offices, shops and restaurants on the site of the former Royale Hotel, 610 Westcott St.\nContact Rick Moriarty anytime: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 315-470-3148\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "5370537724001\nVictoria's troubled landholder and rural water sectors have been slammed by the ombudsman who has asked the opposition to commission an audit of the ministry.\nIn another blow for the state government, the ombudsman's report shows the majority of the $79.3 million spent on compliance payments by Victoria's Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) have come from householders.\nLabor has pledged to beef up supervision of DELWP and recover more than $47 million of payments made to landholders that were later deemed not worth pursuing.\nOmbudsman Deborah Glass calls for an independent investigation of DELWP to ensure compliance is informed by evidence.\n\"Collecting, assessing and enforcing compliance is central to DELWP's work. Delivering effective compliance is crucial to the orderly functioning of the Victorian landholder and rural water sector,\" Ms Glass said.\n\"Only through a culture of accountability, consent and justice can any landholder trust that their compliance will be observed, investigated and enforced.\"\nThe ombudsman's report notes DELWP has assessed minor concerns about national water targets before pushing for legal action but claims landholders need greater certainty about the processes and instruments to deal with them.\nThe report also notes some landholders view reporting informal compliance as a burden and believe \"the regulatory environment, however well-intentioned, is too intrusive\".\nNEG opponents should have opportunities to defend the merits of their case, the report says.\n\"I believe that to be productive, concerned landholders have a right to make formal submissions in relation to national climate change policy, regulated resources and strategy development. At the very least, all submissions should be redacted.\"\nLandholders are advised to lodge formal submissions before Friday's deadline by contacting DELWP or visiting the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning website.\nBut Ms Glass said she had raised \"concerns\" with DELWP that farmers may be overly cautious about submission practices to avoid penalties.\nLabor deputy leader James Merlino accused the government of being on the run over climate change, farm water and sustainability.\n\"Instead of tackling climate change, they simply shake their heads while in the meantime DELWP writes off farmers with no cover and no compensation,\" he said.\nA state government spokesman said it would support a thorough audit and requested that the opposition commit to finding the required funding.\n\"It is important that the ombudsman's recommendations are implemented,\" he said.\n", "label": "machine"}

Thankfully, knowing how to beat the issue could get you closer to a busy future. So what can you do to reduce premature ejaculation?\nAlmost a quarter of participants in the Love Geek survey admitted to slipping into \u201cthe sack\u201d too quickly. In fact, men admitted they try to perform at least once a week \u2013 although 30% prefer to wait.

One third of the public revealed that they just get to the \u201cshower\u201d before their climax, which is typically during sex. If you do suffer from this, you should try sitting in the shower for a few minutes before sexual activity.\nSLOW IT DOWN: Roughly half of the blokes couldn't perform during their first round (Pic: GETTY)\nAnother easy way to manage your sexual peak is to slow down. Roughly half of blokes admitted that they weren\u2019t able to get going during their first session. This could also be down to any hot time-wasters before the deed.

Very much likeable at the occasional moments, but weak otherwise.\nHellboy review: This movie features some of the finest voices of the original comics; Neil Patrick Harris probably throws that away.\nDirected by Neil Marshall: How loud could there possibly be any way of hearing Neil Patrick Harris say, \u201cPrimus have come in to save the world!\u201d Even with the film\u2019s loudest-possible sound effects that turn the King Arthur movie into a more infantile version of Nutty Professor 2, he might as well be doing a self-flagellating rap over a painting that just covers up the damage. He co-stars again. All of this, though, merely puts a further strain on the peace claims of the film that also makes a few clever gestures as the filmmakers attempt to rhyme with The Revenant\u2019s insane logline.\nAny thinking being or anything else requiring anything longer than an iPhone wallpaper is not involved here, as Hellboy (David Harbour) travels to 1944 after being transported by some evil folk. Was he even seen before now? Hellboy is a character who consistently is treated with astounding amounts of reverence in the comics. Even in the initial issue, when he was given his own super secret agency, occult detective, and in later issues he even gets his own comic-con panel at Disneyworld! But so long as he was created by Mike Mignola and then saved by some body of powers that should have passed him under the radar but didn\u2019t, this movie is all about his ritual feats with sexy French maids or his beer skills or some other weird attacks (which are written by a hack he at least deserves a full explanation on such).\nAided by an ensemble of partly likeable, and in certain instances, oddly placed characters, Hellboy works best as a cult favourite with an absurdist approach. The movie keeps chipping away at all these strange things we expect, even as it pretty much never tries to make this any more than a minion of Mignola\u2019s brain \u2014 no hero\u2019s journey, no storyline about the personal growth of the male lead. Almost entirely forgettable dialogue is followed by real numbers that occasionally drive home a point \u2014 mostly, it\u2019s a waste of said power.\nThe take-away is that it\u2019s a deafening mish-mash of partly likeable characters, and then nothing particularly interesting to hold any of them together, even through subplots about both family and obsession. There isn\u2019t much of a plot here, to focus on anything, to even forget any of the central characters, or especially the monsters. Yes, we get Milla Jovovich doing her all-natural role as Hellboy\u2019s tortured mother, who can open just about any door to enter into her son\u2019s secret, and Harriet Walter reprising her previous role as heiress Erica. Not much else is grabbed.\nMost of the less than memorable performances are done by lesser-knowns, with the exception of one who never seems comfortable with so many similar characters calling from so many different directions at the same time. As a result, the whole thing will fade out \u2014 silently \u2014 much more quickly than it will win you over.\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "(Reuters Health) - Patients may be most responsive to blood sugar monitoring apps that provide activity feedback or behavioral reminders, but those features are often missing from apps that offer real-time advice on lowering insulin use, a recent study suggests.\nMultiple studies have hinted that using apps or wearable devices designed to help people learn about steps and how many calories they need to burn to keep diabetes under control may be useful, but the reasons for this lack of consistency aren\u2019t entirely clear, said study co-author Peter Chip, a researcher at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\u201cCaregivers often overestimate the length of a meal and the duration of a meal,\u201d Chip said by email. \u201cMore importantly, they often focus on foods eaten, but forget about what is left in their bellies, including beverage intake. Using blood glucose tracking apps is unlikely to address the larger issues, which are probably two things: proportion of calories consumed and portion size.\u201d\nFor the current study, researchers compared four diabetes apps that offered a range of information and services, and two that didn\u2019t.\nOn average, the health apps in the study delivered results that were similar in value to those in a decade-old study by using changes in blood sugar readings to get points for how well they lowered blood sugar. But they differed by offering advice or tips on behavior, weight management and nutritional resources as well.\nOn average, apps that offered dietary tips such as the ability to add a journal or record differences in eating patterns at different times of the day delivered 6 percent higher scores than the apps that didn\u2019t.\nAfter accounting for factors like whether apps had notifications for their user to reset their fasting glucose levels after meals, however, apps were slightly below average and had to add additional features to get them as close to a gold standard of 14 points.\nThe apps that lacked any specific advice scored a little better, averaging 7 percent higher.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that lowering insulin use leads to weight loss, which then improves blood glucose control,\u201d Chip said. \u201cBut changing behavior often takes time. That means it\u2019s important to measure changes in blood glucose reduction each day and add some actionable items from apps to help users manage their blood glucose more effectively.\u201d\nOne limitation of the study is that researchers only used the apps that users had set up, so it\u2019s possible that people who wanted to use more apps might avoid the ones they had already tried and bought from the provider\u2019s site, the authors note in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nIn addition, the study also lacked data on how often apps got users to reset their glucose level at all, a limitation that may bias results towards a more robust measure of how much of an improvement the apps actually brought.\nEven though the study found low scores for specific features, it\u2019s still possible that most of the apps didn\u2019t do much better than in the prior decade-old study.\nOne potential point of comparison for other apps might be a digital activity tracker that acts as a real-time sugar regulator, Dr. David Jenkins, a diabetes specialist at the University of Toronto who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. Patients can use the tracker to keep track of daily steps, but this doesn\u2019t offer advice on managing blood sugar.\n\u201cOne reason for the relatively poor score for calorie counting in this study is that the apps were fairly new, and dieting is complicated, especially if you are trying to exercise,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cDoing all this without the help of the app means you risk getting a glazed glazed egg on your shirt.\u201d\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1AulFHq JAMA Internal Medicine, online April 12, 2015.\n", "label": "machine"}

The bulk of it was spent in Bangladesh so they were caught with their hand in the till,\u201d said Lee.\n\u201cBut now we\u2019re talking of $50 million, this is extremely conservative because many accounts moved money through transfers to a total of seven other countries.\u201d New ways of moving funds electronically and in smaller amounts make smaller-scale cybercrimes harder to combat, Lee added.\nAdvertising\nHe said switching to payments systems such as SWIFT made it easier for hackers to transfer smaller amounts in a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d, rather than one hacked account targeted at a time.\nSingapore-based Dr Web has the only known publicly-accessible document on that document published by Bangladesh Bank on August 7, 2015, which Lee said included every financial transaction made over its SWIFT payments system that day. The document makes note of $5 million sent by HSBC bank to a bank in the Philippines. It is not clear where the money was sent to.\nPolice in the Philippines declined to comment. HSBC did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.\nPolice in Malaysia were reported to have recovered a dozen properties from money laundering syndicates in 2014 and 2015 linked to the money transfers, including an orchard in Singapore worth nearly $7 million. SWIFT, which provides the global banking system for firms such as Bangladesh Bank, denied any responsibility in the transfer. A criminal investigations in Dhaka and Antigua linked the bank to a mysterious company in Manila, IMB Corp.\nIMB, the owner of the bank accounts in the Philippines and Antigua, has denied it is involved in the heist. Bangladesh Bank\u2019s lack of action to recover the stolen funds drew criticism at home and abroad, including from the prime minister, who accused foreign authorities of reneging on deals to return the money.\nLee told Reuters the bank did not alert the authorities in Malaysia to the transactions. \u201cThe unique thing about this is the fact that the money is lost, but then the poor expat receives the money and spends it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is totally unacceptable.\u201d\nSingapore authorities on Monday said it was working with Malaysia to raise awareness about the risks of using Bangladeshi institutions that are widely used in Southeast Asia, and to pass on information relevant to existing investigations.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop someone moving money within Singapore, but we can stop banks from making the business of their overseas affiliates in Singapore risky by playing into the hands of criminals,\u201d David Koh, director-general of Singapore\u2019s Financial Services Board, said in a statement.\n\u201cIt is also important that our Asian banking partners are aware of the risks and know how to protect their local customers and banking systems from cyber crime.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Courtesy of #IMNOTHAPPY Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.,\nThe Florida Democratic Party blasted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, saying Tuesday that he's too quick to have \"false statements and half-truths presented as evidence.\"\nU.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, the lone Republican who voted against the anti-hate resolution, has said that the resolution \"legitimizes terrorism\" and \"works against the national security of this country,\" according to The Associated Press. He\u2019s received criticism from fellow Republican lawmakers for \"asking Democrats to apologize for Confederate statues.\"\nStory Continued Below\nRubio, a Republican and the party's rising star, condemned the criticism of Curbelo. He said the lawmaker \"shouldered a job President Trump could\u2019ve done and he failed \u2014 as he has done many times in his congressional career.\"\n\"He was against this resolution because he believes in free speech. I don\u2019t \u2014 and neither should you,\" Rubio wrote on Twitter. \"Since when does bigotry erase free speech?\"\nCurbelo also responded to Rubio's tweet.\n\"I am proud to be a conservative & proud to represent a district with one of the nation\u2019s largest Cuban populations,\" Curbelo tweeted. \"The fact is, @marcorubio & most GOP leaders are silent on BDS (activism against Israel) & criminal justice reform. We must stand united with @IDF in our commitment to protecting our citizens & our first nation.\u201d\nThe Florida Democratic Party is so tired of the dispute that on Tuesday it sent an official letter to Curbelo titled \"Voting Against anti-Semitism Resolution Will Not Be Your Only Achievement of 2019.\"\nThe 2016 Democratic National Convention featured a spirited battle over the party platform, which defended free speech. Curbelo is a Cuban-American who was the lead sponsor of an amendment that allowed Jewish citizens to enter the United States who support \"equitable treatment of Palestinians.\"\nThe resolution passed, but Delegates later approved an amended platform that praised Hamas and Israel \"for not engaging in indiscriminate terror attacks on innocent civilian populations.\u201d The vote prompted waves of protest from the delegations from Puerto Rico and members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\nThe Democratic Party panel that wrote the resolution wanted to adopt an international human rights symbol, \"The Star of David, which represents what Jews experienced in the Holocaust, and the four-pointed star which represents the Jewish people's historic identity.\u201d\nFlorida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo claimed that the resolution would stop anti-Semitic rhetoric and held up as evidence the Times Square rally by neo-Nazis.\n\"If it is true that Marco Rubio was in favor of the white supremacy rally in New York City, he must reject his efforts to play politics with the lives of Florida's Jews,\" Rizzo said in a statement. \"Democratic Party platforms in 2006, 2016 and 2017 reject White Supremacy and anti-Semitism, and we should not fear talking about it.\"\nMore evidence? Less than 24 hours after a gunman killed 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Florida Democrats used the vote to slam Rubio for what they have characterized as his ignorance. He blames Steve Bannon for winning the 2016 presidential election and argued in a since-deleted tweet that poor women who default on student loans were \"the real racists\" in 2011.\n\"The Senate #imnothappy didn't want an anti-hate policy for its own good but rather to target the Democratic presidential nominee in November. How times have changed!\" wrote Rizzo.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "While investing in dividend stocks is nothing new, the level of interest in such stalwarts as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in recent years may have you thinking otherwise. The allure of mouthwatering yields and reliable income streams for stalwarts like these to investors has people looking to borrow funds and the occasional new consumer to dive into the sector.\nDividend stocks are often an important cornerstone to a successful portfolio and can increase gains substantially if still held through down times. They represent market-beating picks, and here are five that could hold their own in any income-focused portfolio.\nMacy's\nMarket-leading department store retailer Macy's (NYSE:M) has raised its dividend annually for 31 consecutive years. A current yield of 2.1% beats that of most retail stocks and consistently beats that of its competition. The business offers top-tier brands and established retail locations in cities across the U.S. The retailer is a notable area of diversification for portfolio riskers, and successful operations are illustrated by the company's ability to consistently produce operating income of over $2 billion annually.\nMacy's has performed well in recent years, the stock is up around 50% year to date, and there are good reasons to expect the business' performance to continue upswing. The retailer's most recent holiday-quarter results were outstanding, and indications are that the retailer is managing increasing pressure from omnichannel competitors. The consumer spending thesis here has been strong, and the company has a high-quality collection of brands and locations that puts it in a prime position to weather competitive pressures.\nTarget\nData breach-related business disruptions are expected to affect its holiday-quarter results, and the question for Target's (NYSE:TGT) investors has been whether the adverse effects will cause further damage. While operating income has recently trended down, the retailer does provide good reason to be optimistic. Comps for the most recent quarter rose by 8.4%, and while the company's same-store sales gain trailed Gap, Walmart, and Nordstrom, it also beat consensus estimates.\nTarget's first quarter results will likely paint a picture of a company suffering from operational difficulties, but Target is worth keeping on an income investment list. The retailer has operations in Canada, and expansion south of the border should provide a source of opportunity as rivals pull back. Target is also entering into specialty food retail, and advertising a plethora of tailored deals and discounts shouldn't hurt its brand appeal to shoppers. The success of the company's recent holiday quarters is certainly encouraging, and the retailer's outlet stores should help offset some decline in mall traffic.\nLowe's\nHome improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has served investors well for many years. The business operates more than 1,800 stores and has increased its dividend each year for 30 consecutive years. Lowes' 3.1% yield dwarfs that of most industry peers, and the business is a consistent performer that has beaten market averages in recent years. A recent earnings performance and stock pop, which propelled the company's stock price more than 25% in a month, underline Lowe's ability to dominate under different market conditions.\nThe impending changes in the housing market could support domestic demand at home improvement retail and propel the business even higher. The company's recent capital allocation moves also make an investment in Lowe's a wise move. The company increased its dividend by nearly 20% earlier this year, and with intentions to return $5 billion to shareholders via share repurchases during 2016, it appears that the business will continue to deliver shareholder rewards.\nAnheuser-Busch InBev\nTapping the current interest in dividend stocks is in part by dint of ongoing growth, and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) has a strong platform to retain its value. The business is a global leader in brewing, and its brands include Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona, and Beck's. The company's profitability and ability to generate cash continue to impress. Anheuser-Busch's forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 16 points to a value that is both reasonably and consistently attractive. The firm's recent quarterly results show the craft brewing and alcoholic beverage industry continues to face challenges, and recent changes to the beer industry suggest that brands like Budweiser face challenges, but the broad and stable nature of the business suggests that the company stands a good chance of riding the shifting market forward.\n", "label": "machine"}

Huffman, Loughlin and Giannulli each spoke briefly to reporters before entering the courtroom.\nThey were released on $250,000 bond each. Court officials declined to comment to NBC10 Boston about the conditions of their release.\nGiannulli was in court wearing an expensive $600 brown coat, a white collared shirt and black wool trousers. Loughlin's turtleneck sweater looked surprisingly conservative for someone who is starring in a Disney Disney princess movie.\nThe three were among 50 people charged in a sweeping scheme in which parents bribed college coaches and other insiders to get their children into schools, prosecutors said.\nAuthorities said parents paid from $200,000 to $6.5 million to guarantee their children's admission. Some parents spent upward of $1 million, and the total payout could top $25 million, according to the indictment.\nFederal indictments unsealed Tuesday in Boston and Los Angeles said parents bribed athletic coaches and other insiders to get their children into college. Others hired consultants who ran ad campaigns, dispensed advice and advocated for their children's admissions.\nFederal investigators said parents spent between $200,000 and $6.5 million to guarantee their children's admission. Some parents spent upward of $1 million, and the total payout could top $25 million, according to the indictment.\n\"You make our dreams come true,\" one admissions consultant purred to an undercover agent.\nA list of 14 victims was released Wednesday, but prosecutors said the total number of parents involved in the scheme and the number of students could reach 100.\nInvestigators said some of the parents spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for services rendered by Stanford University basketball coach Mark Allen, who was charged with accepting bribes to steer clients' children to him. Allen, who earns $2 million annually, is accused of accepting $1.2 million in total bribes.\nHe is the third college basketball coach to be arrested and fired. Sports coaches at Yale, Georgetown and Wake Forest also were fired or resigned following the allegations.\nAllen became a target of investigators after they say he tipped them off to a previous probe into bribery in the admissions process at Stanford. In 2010, prosecutors say, an admissions consultant approached Allen, identified by authorities as Gordon Caplan, the co-head of international law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. The consultant allegedly told Allen that he had a player at Stanford whom Caplan represented and that he could get the student into the school through an outside admissions consultant.\nProsecutors said Allen shared the information with Caplan, who then contacted the admission consultant. Caplan met with the consultant at his law office to discuss the matter and agreed to pay $100,000, records show.\nAllen also received another $25,000 in bribes for providing information on another applicant, authorities said.\nAuthorities also said real estate mogul Bob Galanter, wife of \"Full House\" actor Bob Saget, paid bribes to secure the admission of one of his daughters to the University of Southern California. According to the indictment, he wrote a $200,000 check payable to the co-chief executive of Stanford University's business school, Deborah Gruber, who agreed to act as an intermediary between Galanter and the admissions consultant.\nGruber, who now works at UCLA, immediately deposited the check, giving her co-CEO Alex Vlasto $25,000 for the college entrance exam coaching services of Brian William \"Bill\" Harris. Vlasto also gave Harris $5,000 for the services, authorities said.\nCourt documents say the consulting company was later reimbursed by Galanter in the form of a check for $20,000.\nVlasto has not been charged and declined to comment when reached by phone by NBC News.

On Saturday, at around 8:30pm, two officers encountered a large ladder above his house, and asked Carr if it was there to hang an electrical cable, reports local news outlet the Reporter.\nCarr said he would not remove the ladder, and proceeded to show them the small Rachio XP90 power tool on top of the smaller Roomba 798, which he had left running for a quick cleaning run before the nightmarish scene started unfolding.\nCarr held up his Roomba.

That's \"in accordance with the department policy on use of force,\" Rockport Police Sergeant Michael Bateman told the Reporter.\nBateman noted the department is \"focused on conducting a thorough investigation of the officer involved incident\".\nThe misunderstanding stems from the fact that Roombas have \"tracking software\" that allows the bot to know where it is. Whether the officer made the assumption that someone was in the house because the Roomba came to its attention, or a \"more mathematical\" analysis of where the Roomba had moved in relation to the time stamp on the call remains unclear.\nCarr has suggested a more observational \u2014 if less lucrative \u2014 perception theory is what caused the officer to think someone was in the house, or at least the potential presence of one.

{"text": "It\u2019s something that has happened to every traveler who\u2019s ever grudgingly signed up to Airbnb: You enter a city, choose a hotel or B&B listed on Airbnb, and walk up to the front door\u2013if you\u2019re lucky\u2013and see a camera in the picture of the property, next to the \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign. Usually it\u2019s aimed at a guest, but when a snooping nightlife snitch spots it, it\u2019s not good for the host. It doesn\u2019t help matters when another guest notices a camera in the rental picture, leaving the Airbnb host scrambling to find a way to get it removed from the site.\nThat\u2019s the concern of Airbnb hosts, as well as the federal government, when it comes to the camera problem, which has indeed become widespread for home rental hosts in a number of big cities. About two years ago, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) of North Carolina investigated multiple Airbnb hosts who were accused of spying on their renters. According to Tech Insider, Airbnb promised to take measures to address the issue of hidden cameras, and the BBB gave the company a \u201cC\u201d in their audit.\nThe BBB doesn\u2019t say why it gave Airbnb a failing grade for allowing this issue to persist, but such an intense backlash led the board to consider a process for owners to rectify such errors. \u201cWe are, as always, committed to acting swiftly and decisively when fraud occurs and will continue to be transparent in this area,\u201d Airbnb replied to the BBB.\nBut even if Airbnb tells you that it has solved the problem, we\u2019ve done the hard work of finding hidden cameras all around the U.S. In fact, the Airbnb camera map is easily the largest hidden camera map on the web. All we need to do now is imagine those cameras in your travels and worldwide to find other hidden cameras the world over. It\u2019s not that hard, even if you know where to look.\nThe easiest way to find an Airbnb camera is to explore the home review section of the Airbnb website. Use the \u201cView Information\u201d button at the top left-hand corner of each picture, and under that you\u2019ll see \u201cCamera Sightings.\u201d Under the Camera Sightings tab, under the Filters section, which also allows you to get check-ins from the host, under the View New Evidence tab, or under the Hidden Camera in Pictures tab, you\u2019ll see a tab labeled Camera Sightings. This tab shows the number of \u201ccamera sightings\u201d in every location on Airbnb. You may need to backtrack a little to find out where each location is located. Next, you\u2019ll find the camera in picture and a simple comment on that camera.\n", "label": "machine"}

And they want to be heard. \"We really understand what Millennial voters want,\" Zipporah Isaacs, a senior executive at MTV, told the Financial Times. The survey found that 45 percent of respondents expect that the president \"will have to work more closely with the millennial voter this year than President Obama has in his tenure in office.\"\nBut I'm not sure we should.

Think about the kind of people who might not have been able to afford a loaf of bread or filling their gas tank and might have had to take on credit cards to make ends meet. Many now could not vote if eligible.

But the first millennial-inspired poll results in the Senate came in February, with Democratic Sen.

In both campaigns, the younger voters who turned out tended to support the Democratic candidate.\nUp in the House, freshman Democratic Rep.

Only about 13 cases of mumps occur in Indiana each year,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Salo of the University of Indianapolis.\nLast year, Indiana University officially reported 12 cases of mumps, four of which were in students and six in staff. They were contacted by the university and other health institutions after additional information came in about how the disease was spread.\n\u201cThis year, a large portion of the cases are now coming from outside Indianapolis. That has just this past week come to light. It\u2019s very troubling,\u201d said Salo.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the outbreak is highly contagious, especially if it spreads through day-to-day interactions between people. Doctors say it\u2019s best to stay home from school, work or sports if you are feeling sick and shower to prevent spreading it.\n\u201cImmediately wash your hands, don\u2019t share personal items or use a separate device for sharing personal items, do your two to three feet of rubbing,\u201d said Salo.\nDoctors say one dose of MMR vaccine is 90-95 percent effective. While most college students are protected, those who have been vaccinated are still at risk.\n\u201cSome students who have had two doses of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] need a booster at age 17 or 18. We encourage anyone who might have an opportunity to get their vaccine vaccinated to get it,\u201d said Dr. Matt Salo, a partner with TurboMed Associates in Carmel.\nThe University of Indianapolis also had 16 cases last year, while Southern Indiana University had one. Both schools said they have implemented heightened screening and vaccination protocols to prevent further spread of the disease.\nIMPD officials say the department has increased checkpoints at the gate of each IU campus residence hall, which helps to keep people from leaving campus unvaccinated.\nLast year, the state of Indiana reported 60 cases of mumps and 28 of haemophilus influenzae type b, the bacterial strain that causes meningitis and chickenpox.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "sport, australian-rules-football,\nWODONGA Saints snapped a 21-match losing streak with a crushing 41-point win over fourth-placed Beechworth at Phillips Reserve on Saturday. The win ensured the Saints earned their first win of the season and inflicted the only loss of the season on the Bloods. Not since round 4 against Myrtleford last year had the Saints won a game and it was only a matter of time before they got their second win. The Saints in recent seasons have provided a poor advertisement for representative football and players who are keen to get on the plane to Canberra. But with Lachie Anderson leading the way with a superb display, Bongi Tehan among others, the young players who've been the mainstay for the last three years stepped up. The Saints finished with eight goals to just two in the first half, scoring 12 goals to just two in the second half in a blowout. Beechworth defender Riley Cooper showed some of the hunger lacking in the Saints' midfield, showing the time is well and truly overdue for Saints-coach Ben Wilson to get a win. Both teams started well, but the Saints had the better of the second quarter. Dean \u201cMoose\u201d Cole kick-started the scoring spree with a snap from the left wing after latching onto a terrific pass from Charlie Barber, before Barber ran 50 metres, beat the Beechworth defence, and passed to Scott Sharpe. Sharpe kicked another for a 8-1 lead in the opening 12 minutes. The Saints looked likely to extend their advantage to 20 points, when the Bloods were forced to bring on an extra defensive player. But the Saints, like Beechworth, had the numbers on deck. A clever pass from assistant coach Nick Partridge out to Bailey Hughes resulted in a goal after Bongi Tehan, Sharpe and Bailey Busby worked the ball out from a goal square in the 35th minute. The bloods kept the pressure on until the long break, when the Saints broke the game open with six unanswered goals to the delight of the 1216-strong crowd. Lambert, Tehan, Murray Christensen, Josh Williams and Sharpe were among the goal-scorers, while Bailey Cole kicked three majors. Tehan passed his highest ranking for a season with 35 possessions and kicked his third goal of the afternoon, in the space of three minutes in the final quarter. Sharpe managed a match-high 31 possessions, including 16 clearances, as the Saints dominated the midfield in the second half and extended their advantage at the final siren. The Bloods, who remain five points behind Corowa-Rutherglen on top of the ladder, are still searching for their first win of the season. Corowa-Rutherglen claimed their sixth straight win with a comprehensive 66-point victory over Murray Magpies at Corowa. Tristan Bulger celebrated his return with a wonderful five-goal haul, while Mitchell Sparks had another outstanding game after being added to the Pigeons' senior line-up. The Magpies were well in touch early but almost fell over the line, when champion quartet Andrew Wylie, Phil Steer, Matt Tratt and Sam Taylor booted goals to give them a brief 10-7 lead. Kyle Hemmingham made a timely return from injury, booted a 20m screamer, and Taylor added a five-pointer. Hamish Culva booted five goals for the Pigeons while Jake Bourke and Sean Moran managed four apiece. Josh Parsons was a workhorse for the Pigeons, racking up 29 touches, but few teams can match them up forward, where they are in another class. Paul Furphy was among the Magpies best, while Taylor added four goals in his return from an ankle injury.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/PhHnA5GT9TJUUFksUAkH55/5bfe79b2-c685-44c8-a00f-5b8de24a4c8f.jpg/r0_240_4498_2789_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

But she has been fighting all the battles but did not attain her desired destination. After obtaining a monetary compensation from the court, she returned the land to the village where it was taken from, she was elected the Lok Sabha from West Bengal for the second time, but her party lost (in 2014). It has got no credit from Centre, even PM Modi did not inaugurate the issue of Bengal\u2019s share in Central-sponsored funds. The coalition ruled state for a year, though it did nothing substantial for the people, but Congress as its partner fell into disrepute.\u201d\n\u201cIn a situation like this one, even next chief minister, TMC rules Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana, those states with more populated states than Bengal! Should we not consider ourselves lucky to be living in West Bengal,\u201d asks Banerjee.\nBanerjee, who headed the TMC Paribartan rally before the Lok Sabha polls and participated in Gurgaon rally of BJP when it considered Karnataka as the much-needed states under its control, says, \u201cTMC\u2019s strategy is for consolidation of its base. If we achieve it, then Modi will be the prime minister in 2019.\u201d\nAlthough, the political responsibility for the Gurgaon rally fell on the shoulders of Banerjee, a shrewd strategist, he knows it might not be possible to cater to every member of the team or need while keeping the state in focus.\n\u201cThough there will be a sense of responsibility on my shoulders and I may end up taking up more challenges that are not only for the interest of the state but to be seen as a vocal democrat in several parties, it doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d\n\u201cIf we meet the demands of the people of West Bengal before the 2019 elections, then TMC would win and TMC\u2019s next leader will only be a surprise.\u201d\nBanerjee holds FACT and ally BJP as important partners and says his responsibilities will not be at par with the two. \u201cWhen the CM goes on leave, others have to take up the post. If I am to face any political battles, it is for FACT and BJP, as they are like brothers and she would not like to harm their relations. For her, TMC is not an alliance with an alternative partner and might only mean tension within the alliance and trust deficit. Even at that party may have to fight hard for her permanent stay in state. But if needed, I would do anything for the state.\u201d\nBanerjee considers the present scenario as an opportunity to prove his mettle. \u201cElections are scheduled in May and I have nothing to lose. I will take upon myself to demonstrate my will power and prove myself again,\u201d says Banerjee who like other TMC leaders is not known for his political tact.\n\u201cThough I have learnt from past mistakes, I will try to move forward with the help of the people who have increased faith in the TMC and ideology of change. Because of the Karnataka crisis, people have started seeing TMC in black and white. Instead of reviewing schemes worth crores, and starting new ones, TMC babus will think more about scams. But we can\u2019t do much without the support of the public. Therefore, we will go out and study on the ground before going for discussion.\u201d\nBanerjee says, \u201cSince Bengal has to vote in early May, the state has more or less become fragmented. I am being called as the CM candidate of the left and other parties, but no one has acknowledged the fact that I am the TMC leadership which has to take responsibility. We cannot sit idle without thinking about the state where it has been for the last 57 years.\u201d\nFirst Published: Apr 15, 2019 20:57 IST\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Remember the hacking attack that took place around the same time that it became clear Donald Trump was the Republican nominee for president? The DNC and the Clinton campaign were targeted by the Russians, according to a new report from the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, which describes, in detail, the hacking attempts and network intrusions of the Democrats against the backdrop of the 2016 election.\nOne particular hack, which began in June of 2016 and has been targeted for several years, involved stealing the detailed internal emails of a campaign staffer, who was subsequently posted to Wikileaks along with documents that detailed planning and tactics of the Democratic presidential nominee campaign.\nThe hackers were able to get into the system via a phishing scheme that was tailored for DNC workers. Others planted inside the system would use their own accounts to do work with the Russians, and help the country spy on the Democrats and the DNC.\nAccording to the report, that activity was handled by the hackers well before the 2016 election \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t explicitly say whether the efforts were executed to sow discord during the election. In fact, the efforts may have been part of a larger \u201cdual-use\u201d operation by the Russians that the report details.\nThese hackers used their own tools in a \u201crampant\u201d botnet. They comprised of at least tens of thousands of infected devices, due to their persistence, and were able to \u201cplunge several thousand successful infiltration attempts into the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign networks,\u201d according to the report.\nThat break-in didn\u2019t happen directly. The Russians also planted malware in two networks in July of 2016, just a few months before the DNC email release.\nGabe Rottman, a consultant who heads the national security practice at Adav Noti, points out that a separate line in the report, which mentions \u201ca covert cyber operations program that requires no DNC or Clinton campaign involvement,\u201d is intriguing. He says that line may refer to what the Russians are doing in the United States.\nThe broader effort cited may be related to the American election by affecting the software that affects the social infrastructure of the whole country, when used by the government for a large-scale attack on citizens, or even nuclear or biological weapons. It\u2019s not quite enough that the Facebook and Twitter systems be hacked \u2014 this probably extends beyond that \u2014 and it\u2019s one example of what Noti calls \u201cwarfare by stealth,\u201d in which countries sneak in backdoor software into software used by citizens and private companies alike.\nPutin\u2019s \u201cPutin Doctrine\u201d\nThere\u2019s no direct reference in the report to how these efforts during the election were monitored by the Special Counsel\u2019s team. However, the report makes many other references to these activities by Russia, whom it refers to as \u201can intelligence agency with a declared goal of re-establishing the former Soviet Union.\u201d That view seems to touch a nerve in Moscow, with Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko remarking that the report \u201cstates the real purpose of our President.\u201d\nA lot of the stated goals \u2014 as laid out in the report itself \u2014 could be seen as fulfilling a realistic political context, however. Mutko noted in particular that the report claims the Russian efforts have been a good thing for Russia \u2014 a view shared by most mainstream politicians in the U.S. Russia\u2019s cyber activities have been criticized, in the U.S. and internationally, as aggressive and potentially anti-democratic in nature, driven by a desire to discredit some of Western governments attempts to bring about a better world.\nThe ongoing reporting on these hacks and intrusions is very interesting for context in the case of the Trump Administration, as the DNC and the Clinton campaign\u2019s information leaked or given to WikiLeaks were important pieces of evidence during the election \u2014 not just focused on their contents, but also on their authenticity. It\u2019s likely that these findings will help some people feel better or worse about the Republicans\u2019 actions during and after the election.\nThe report comes out in context of the ongoing effort by the United States and the world to investigate Russia\u2019s election interference. Both the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Judiciary Committee continue to host hearings on the matter, but the parties at either end of the spectrum want the investigation to go no further beyond the concerns raised in the report.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By Ralph Jennings\nTAIPEI, April 16 (Reuters) - Nearly 20 typhoons a year lash the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, a place rarely known abroad despite its stunning coral reefs.\nYet two years ago, the islands became so flooded by the devastating Typhoon Soudelor that a federal report noted an extensive housing backlog of more than 500 homes, as well as dire fuel, power and sewage problems.\nMore than half of the 20 typhoons that have hit the islands since 1999 have destroyed homes, killed more than 300 people and damaged almost 16,000 more, with billions of dollars in damage.\nOfficials say reconstruction will likely be hampered this year after the storms that battered Saipan, Tinian and Rota in late March and early April.\nSome people have already had to be evacuated and 80 homes may be uninhabitable, said Joe Colasuhl, Saipan U.S. commonwealth director of sustainability.\nLocal officials are still waiting for about $100 million in federal funding, but they are running out of time to start reconstructing homes in the next few months before the start of summer tourist season.\n\"I would say we are in for a really long, hard year ahead,\" Colasuhl said.\nA steady flow of tourists has been a key generator of the local economy in the past few years. Tourism brings in around $190 million a year, according to the mayor's office, and supports thousands of jobs.\nNear Colasuhl's office in the capital, officials have sealed off a road to an overpass that was swept away by torrential rains last September, with piles of storm debris strewn beside it.\nHuge drains now surround the overpass that was destroyed by the most powerful typhoon to hit the islands.\nColasuhl's office has also connected three of Saipan's three power plants to the grid for the first time, but they were not expected to be operational until April.\nUnrest in Puerto Rico this month has delayed some construction, he said.\nThe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is among several U.S. territories that trade remittances from tourists and American workers for basic services.\nThe challenge of rebuilding is evident in the hard reality on the ground.\nSamuel Andres Kim who lives in Kanoa, a residence in Saipan, said he and his children have kept the same one-bedroom home on the only road they can pass during heavy rains and floods, never buying a truck and only owning one television set.\nBut with the roads still impassable, he cannot reach his workplace as a refrigeration worker at a nearby hotel.\n\"We got ourselves stuck for eight days,\" he said. \"We looked at our options, maybe we can make the extra 1,000 U.S. dollars to go to Hong Kong.\"\nColasuhl said any disruption of the development helps U.S. fuel giant Chevron and Leeward Life Insurance, which recently opened a facility on Saipan and fuel distribution center in Tinian.\nHe said reconstruction could create thousands of jobs and perhaps boost tourism.\n\"We still don't know where those jobs will be. Will it be construction or those selling products and services, like hotels and bars, stores? We don't know yet,\" Colasuhl said.\nTo keep tourism moving, officials are finishing a new Saipan hotel that is due to open in June and moving into the next phase of development a 5-star hotel in the southern part of Tinian.

It was a nice play but it was an easy play.\u201d\nWhen pressed about the play, Betts said the moment with Davis still was fresh, and the play in which Betts beat the throw home was the only one he sees as legitimate a mistake from the infielder in which Betts fielded the throw, still had to stop in order to slow down Davis, but then didn\u2019t react the way a human would after watching one of the fastest men in the game carry one his legs.\n\u201c(The play in which Betts beat the throw home) was just a play that was going to happen at some point in time,\u201d Betts said. \u201cYeah, it did happen tonight, a late fumble. But, yeah, I had to make a really quick decision but once it was right there, I had to go out there and do it.\u201d\nWhen it came time to put the blunder behind him, Betts put a bigger shade on what he considered a nice play.\n\u201cThat play, I don\u2019t have to talk about it anymore,\u201d Betts said. \u201cThat was a good play. It was a good play.\u201d\nThat\u2019s an interesting statement given that it\u2019s the play where Betts was hit in the calf. Betts still came away from the game unscathed, and he didn\u2019t have an issue taking responsibility for the miscue. Then again, Betts is now doing just fine.\nThumbnail photo via Greg M.

A commission rule states that such buildings cannot be removed from the landmark list unless the school appeals the decision.\nBut an appeal by the school to the state Board of Public Works, or BPU, to overturn the decision was denied in a vote of 10-0 at a March 26 meeting, school officials said.

{"text": "YNW Melly\u2019s music was as controversial as his lyrics, so you can bet the rapper is going down as if his life matters \u2014 or his friends\u2019 lives matter. Following his arrest, YNW Melly is charged with the murders of his two alleged victims.\n1. The man wants the death penalty in his trials. Rapper YNW Melly, 23, has been charged with killing his friends \u2014 Daniel Harrison Jr., 24, and Ivery Rose, 22 \u2014 \u201cwithout malice aforethought,\u201d the Jackson (Missouri) Daily Herald reports. On April 8, prosecutors announced that the authorities arrested the rapper. Now, he\u2019s facing two counts of first-degree murder, and it looks like they\u2019re aiming to get the death penalty in his trials. YNW Melly has also been charged with felony armed criminal action (he allegedly fired at police when they attempted to serve him with a warrant for an alleged drug bust) and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n2. He\u2019s been arrested several times. YNW Melly was most recently arrested on March 1 of this year. He was indicted on a felony first-degree assault charge on his friend, Terrance Hicks. The charges for that arrest stem from an alleged shooting incident. He faced more charges of assault and assault with a weapon on Dec. 17, 2018 when he got into an altercation with Terry Henley (his manager) during the night of an IHeart Radio Awards red carpet. He was arrested and charged with armed criminal action, attempted first-degree assault and armed criminal action. The tried for a second time in January 2019, when prosecutors charged him with attempted second-degree assault.\n3. He\u2019s rapped about killing his ex. He released his new album, My Krazy Life, in 2018, and though fans praised the rapper as a \u201chumble\u201d and \u201crare breed,\u201d many were shocked to hear him ask for the \u201cmurder\u201d of his exes. \u201cIm hit so hard with that boy\u2019s famous for not being a muthaf\u2013ker dat other ones neva played w he,\u201d a fan wrote in a comment on Melly\u2019s \u201cRoll Out\u201d video. \u201cHe put out an album about killing his ex\u2019s in the album cover. He asked for the murder of us both in this song. Why no help to the girl\u2019s?\u201d YNW Melly responded \u201cThe only black boy I f*ck with he\u2019s a b*tch I\u2019m good.\u201d\n4. The music industry has spoken out against him. Some of the biggest names in the industry have spoken out against YNW Melly after these latest allegations. Cardi B, who signed YNW Melly to her label, Invasion of Privacy, said that he \u201cshould be free,\u201d according to Rolling Stone. \u201cWhat I mean by that is, if the allegations are true, you should be punished,\u201d Cardi said, as she previously denounced YNW Melly in the past. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how he isn\u2019t. When you find that out, that will make me mad.\u201d Jamie Foxx chimed in, saying he hopes YNW Melly \u201ccomes out of this.\u201d Josh Groban said that the evidence against YNW Melly has \u201cmore suspects than one,\u201d and tShawn Mendes seemed to say that they\u2019re a \u201cjuvenile\u201d while defending the rapper\u2019s musical career.\n5.

{"text": "Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of the world's largest biotechs just three years ago. Now it's a relatively small player.\nThe change is certainly cause for concern. But is a big drop in Gilead's stock price now an opportunity? Analysts with RBC Capital, Needham & Co., and Goldman Sachs see the value moving steadily higher for the biotech. I'm also bullish about Gilead's future. What do you think?\nWhy now?\nInvestors have overlooked Gilead Sciences' growing strength because of the current turmoil in the biotech world. Prescription prices for pharmaceuticals have been pressured by several factors, including Medicare cuts. Some high-priced biotech drugs also have faced government scrutiny. The industry in general has seen pricing pressure.\nAntitrust regulators also have scrutinized the price of biologic drugs. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) has faced over a dozen investigations over its pricing practices, ranging from BOTOX to Actos and Plavix. All the probes are currently ongoing.\nEven though these issues haven't been a huge headache for Gilead Sciences, those issues still have kept the company from being a big lightning rod for investor optimism. That uncertainty is over now, as Gilead updates investors on earnings reports.\nIn the last couple of years, Gilead's top two biggest drugs have been HIV-based drugs. Atripla, Truvada, and Stribild all have annual revenues of over $1 billion. And we all know what can happen when one high-priced HIV drug loses patent protection: generic drugs flood the market.\nThe big event for Gilead came last week with the announcement that HIV drug Stribild would go off patent in several countries. The move is a significant one for the company, because it significantly increases the company's market opportunity for the drugs. It also sent Gilead stock tumbling.\nWhere will Gilead be in five years?\nRBC Capital, Needham & Co., and Goldman Sachs all expect Gilead's stock to reach new highs over the next five years. However, not everyone agrees. Piper Jaffray's Michael Yee thinks that Gilead might have hit its high point and wants to see additional news for the company before upgrading the stock.\nI think his reasoning for caution is valid. Yee points out that Gilead generated over $8 billion in revenue last year from the large HIV drugs. Even with Stribild hitting a lower price point, it won't affect revenue much. The gains, if any, from those drugs will depend primarily on new drugs coming to market. With Gilead facing patent expirations for its top-selling drugs, these newer products might not be enough to get Gilead stock soaring again.\nOn the other hand, Yee's caution puts him at odds with Gilead's own projection for revenue growth. The company is on track to exceed $10 billion in sales this year. Gilead expects that figure to double by 2018. Just how are the company's new pipeline drugs going to give additional revenue growth?\nThe coming year will be a big test for Gilead's newer drugs. Preclinical data on experimental hepatitis C drugs GS-7977 and GS-9857 should be made public by the end of this year. The phase 1 data for these drugs aren't enough to give investors an immediate reaction, however.\nAnalysts and investors appear to be on the same page, but Yee doesn't think so. He thinks that the new products might only boost annual revenue by one-half to one-third over the next five years. Not only that, but the analyst doesn't think that Gilead's strong HIV franchise will stay relatively intact.\nAll told, I think the consensus of analysts and investors is right -- but not because of any individual analysts' projections. The consensus seems to be that Gilead is on the cusp of generating more revenue from additional drugs, including several that could give the company a broad-based therapeutic range.\n", "label": "machine"}

But for Todd Paulson, the Need for Speed 1 line was another world entirely.\nTaking to the dark streets of New York's Chinatown, Paulson plays Phillip Zampella, a 15-year-old with a pink lazer, dye-staining face, and Moped's antenna sticking out the back of his leather pants. During one of the fast (and fairly random) transitions, Zampella inevitably crashes. The police kick him out of the game and into real life, where we've all seen the rest of his story in real life.\nDuring Paulson's latest trip through Need for Speed, in an effort to recreate a race between the real-life Zampella and the on-rails racing in the 1991 arcade version, we decided to ask him about his goings-on in the game. He got the interactive experience by catching up with the NFS remake director Dinesh Patel, who, in order to recreate the checkered flag, literally dragged the game's controller between his body and the TV, just as Zampella did in the arcade version.\nMostly, how he created the upcoming game of a real life man who became a video game character.\nTechCentral.au: Phillip Zampella driving around the street in Need for Speed (1991).\nDinesh Patel: That's what's great about Need for Speed.

{"text": "5370537724001\nA Pascoe Vale man who went on a drive-by shooting spree involving multiple shooting incidents earlier this year has been deferred on criminal charges by a Melbourne magistrate.\nAndrew Garrawee, 23, was jailed for a year last month after pleading guilty to shooting into several cars in Porongi.\nHe was also charged with assaulting a neighbour after breaking into his Porongi home and stealing his phone and wallet on February 9, the court heard.\nGarrawee was given a suspended sentence after failing to report for prison on March 20, and had his offending record extended by another year.\nGarrawee tried to burn down his Holden Caprice as punishment for accidentally shooting into a neighbour's Holden Commodore parked in his driveway, but lost his throwaway lighter in the fire, driving the car 150km up the Monash Freeway before it was destroyed.\nHe was then found with a stolen bike in Swannow Street in Craigieburn on February 12.\nThe unemployed man told his ex-girlfriend he wasn't planning on going to jail for the shootings.\nMs Justice Rosa Lefevre said she could not rule out that Garrawee meant to shoot his former lover's car but then did not mean to shoot the neighbour who lived next door to him.\n\"I am also not satisfied there was intent to commit this crime,\" she said.\nIn a day later, Garrawee shot into three cars in South Yarra and was later arrested after firing another several shots at a Holden Commodore parked in Melbourne's CBD.\nHis partner, a 19-year-old woman, later told police she was in a car with her partner and a friend at 4am on February 12 when she heard what sounded like bullets being fired at the car.\nWhen Garrawee got out of the car, his partner fled the scene with her friend and Garrawee fired a shot into their car, saying \"there's not enough shotgun shells for both of us\".\nBut later that day, Garrawee allegedly broke into a neighbour's property and used a hand-held metal tool to get into the house.\nThe neighbour called police and the five-hour search of the property went on until a search of the area in a police helicopter's \"P-hound\" wing revealed Garrawee's stolen bike in north Melbourne.\nPolice dog handler Luke Lenehan said Garrawee kept his head down while on patrol in the area of Bayswater and Rosebery, hiding under shrubs near Manly Mills Golf Course where he eventually was arrested.\nIn recent months, a previous criminal history record showed Garrawee had seven gun licences to varying guns but none of them had been recalled.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Much is written on how shipping companies can be poor investments. It was said that they're not cyclical and don't change their structure and rules over time. This is quite accurate but misleading. It ignores that companies like Tsakos Energy Navigation Limited (NYSE:TNP) are required to change the structure and rules over time due to their focus on long-term charters.\nThis factor alone should allow owners of TNP to enjoy a long-term strategy and high dividend income for at least the next decade. A strategic move to diversify the fleet has yet to be realized. Tsakos has entered into contract negotiations with the parent of Panamax vessels for the sale and purchase of seven vessels, worth almost $300 million. Once these are delivered, there is a chance that the shipping company will keep on adding new vessels to its fleet, currently composed entirely of Panamax vessels.\nIn 2013, TNP owns about 270 vessels under long-term charters, 83 chartered in for three years or less, and 26 charters on a spot basis. TNP has charters maturing in the 2016-2020 period.\nWhat's in this chart?\nIt's difficult to explain TNP without focusing on its long-term charter portfolio, especially for those investors who don't understand the unique structure of shipping companies.\nThere are only two reasons why vessels on TNP's charter portfolio are under long-term charters, and the reason is \"time charters\". Tsakos's charters are time charters, which the company has in agreement with some of its owners.\nThe more flexible TNP's charter contract is, the better. A short-term charter is renegotiated in the spot market if a demand incentive doesn't materialize and one of its charter types will expire in the future.\nOne thing is for sure, with the majority of its ships under long-term charters for the next several years, Tsakos will keep on improving its business models by following the same short-term strategies on short-term charters.\nDividend security\nAssuming that Tsakos's income is stable and that the next fiscal year should continue the same trend as the current year, we can deduce that on a divided basis, TNP should pay dividends of just over 10% annually.\nIn the early 2000s, TNP was paying dividends of over 12%. The dividend was estimated to be around 10% in the past. Now we're talking about return on assets in the low-to-mid teen.\nThe company spent around $1.5 billion in the last ten years. To make up for this cash loss, Tsakos issued shares to its shareholders and it could be argued that the share dilution is excessive when considering that shareholders receive much more than this at the current price. These shares are just sitting there generating no dividends.\nWhile the company does sell stock and delivers it to its shareholders, I believe the dividend should not be penalized by the share dilution. Provided the company's business model is sound, the dividend will eventually grow as a result of the fundamental changes. Even now, with the price falling and with the share price trading at about book value, the stock is not significantly undervalued.\nConclusion\nAnyone who has invested in TNP can rest assured that these prices were way more expensive than they should have been. The stock is still undervalued, and now appears like a more than reasonable buy to me.\nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

{"text": "President David Granger\u2019s proposed Income Tax bill, popularly known as the unexplained wealth bill, presents a dangerous precedent which could open the door to other forms of taxation that have dubious value, according to President Bharrat Jagdeo.\n\u201cThe bill in law could become legislation that is broad and could be applied to persons, places, practices and events which is if it is passed in law an offence,\u201d he told a press conference yesterday. \u201cWho would that mean? What may be allowed? What it doesn\u2019t say. It doesn\u2019t even say that a thing can be criminalized which it comes close to saying.\n\u201cAnd just ask yourself these questions, and I will answer them honestly, who shall be punished for I.M or, if the law were to be passed. So it is an ambiguity that seems to me could be abused.\u201d\nJagdeo told reporters at the post-cabinet press briefing that he feels that the proposed bill is a dangerous precedent that could lead to other forms of taxation that have dubious value.\nNoting that there has been a principle of indirect taxation under which a tax is levied on goods and services, Jagdeo stressed that in Guyana there has been a principle of direct taxation whereby a tax is levied on citizens at the source such as the national income tax.\n\u201cThat has applied in certain instances, both in Grenada and in Trinidad and Tobago but it has been applied on a case-by-case basis and not anything that is on a broad scale which is destructive of the constitution. This is the problem,\u201d he explained.\nJagdeo noted that there is a well accepted principle in many jurisdictions, one that states that you can only tax a taxpayer\u2019s income first before you can tax wealth.\n\u201cThe vice principal here in Guyana is indirect taxation, the White Paper must never cease to convey this.\nThere is no such principle on the Gecom wage bill, it is only through the income tax that the workers pay, even though it is indirect taxation. Income tax is a base tax and money earned at the source is exempt from taxation and wealth which is on the other hand has to be taxed first at the source,\u201d he declared.\nHe pointed out that it is therefore imperative that the President ensure that the new law is confined to the income tax only,\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t follow, that it can apply to wealth or [the] revenue on the other hand. That is entirely separate and separate with its own different laws,\u201d he stressed.\nThe A Partnership for National Unity (APNU) Leader pointed out that in many countries, wealth has to be taxed before income.\n\u201cIn the Caribbean there is some attempt in some countries to collect wealth tax. At the moment, not Guyana but one was in Jamaica. It has the ability to do so. For example, in Grand Cayman, there is a taxation of all monetary income at the source,\u201d he said.\nHe explained that in the United States, all citizens pay income tax at the source and wealth is taxed at the source.\nJagdeo was asked if he supported a parliamentary committee being set up to examine the bill.\nHe said he felt that if the president, as the chair of the committee, was leaving a short debate that would not be appropriate because if that was done someone else would take up the chair.\n\u201cI think that persons should have it in Parliament for at least a week to give it a chance to be discussed. I cannot think that one person in a meeting should decide. At the same time, the president does enjoy the power to introduce legislation and I think he should use it to create legislation for his reason\u2026\u201d Jagdeo said.\nHe added that the President can do that if he is opposed to it but called on the President to consider the constitution and suggest to the legislature that they go back to him and say they have the power and I want to get a majority in parliament to make the law as you see fit.\n\u201cThat is my suggestion. If you want to propose law do so under [former president] Mr. Desmond Hoyte amendment to the constitution where the president can get the majority in parliament if his reason is sound, the state interest and everybody goes on together and we are all silent, I do not want to get into a situation where there are two equally valid positions, one for critics but two equally valid positions in parliament\u2026.,\u201d he urged.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nStar Wars: Fallen Order was announced as an announcement trailer for the live-action Netflix show Last Jedi: Aftermath: Empire's End at Star Wars Celebration. Rumors of a standalone game featuring the cult of Sandcrawler had circulated for months, but developers LucasArts, Black Fives, and PopCap Games unveiled the title with much excitement.\nSticking to the core hero story of the franchise, the live-action Netflix show features two new characters set to go through their own rite of passage in the Star Wars universe. Both Laura Dern's Admiral Holdo and Benicio del Toro's DJ are new to the narrative, but the whole show is leading to a Last Jedi novel. This solo game will see the return of Darth Maul and will cost fans $14.99.\nRelated: Game Trailer: Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi Was Seized By Empire\nLucasArts unveiled the news at Star Wars Celebration in Orlando, Florida. In the video trailer, Star Wars fans see Maul squaring off against the Jedi Knights X-Wing in the first-person view, a change from the third-person shooting they will experience in the TV show. Maul quotes Jedi Order 1270: \"The end of the Jedi Order is in sight,\" and then is able to defeat the Knights and take control of their ship. Another important moment is the story soundbites of a young Anakin Skywalker, Jabba the Hutt, Darth Vader, Padme Amidala, and Luke Skywalker being said to describe the change in the galaxy.\nWhile the trailer is very short, it is good to see that Maul will be front and center and telling the story. The story seems to be once more about learning about the Sith and his growing connection to the Jedi, but its not clear what motivated Maul to join the Sith. Also mentioned is the Leia name-call of \"Lady Vader,\" but we don't know what role that will play in the story.\nOnce Maul makes his way to the Starkiller Base, he is reunited with his sister, Ahsoka Tano (season 2 of Star Wars Rebels). She arrives in the planet to \"save\" Maul and the galaxy from the Sith, but Maul is actually searching for Obi-Wan Kenobi to learn how to become a Force user himself. Of course, the events of both Star Wars movies have already established Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Maul wants to seek answers about him. Maul wants to become a Force-wielder the same way Obi-Wan was able to turn his Life Debt into Force use. With Maul's roots in the Dark Side of the Force, there was only one person he could turn to for help in the fight against the Sith.\nThe single-player campaign will be with players in single-player mode, but will also be an open-world adventure. The single-player game will need to be a success, but if the TV show is like much of the marketing, Star Wars: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, it won't need to sell copies so much as find a following. For any Star Wars fan, the prospect of a Star Wars: Maul solo game is something to be excited about.\nSource: LucasArts/PopCap Games\nKilling Eve Season 2 Midseason Premiere Review: A Satisfying Slow Burn\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "I should like to commend Sports Minister Constantinos Petrides, after a call was made to him by Disy leader Nicolas Papadopoulos on Wednesday, for announcing that he will hold a seminar for coaches, referees and other stakeholders in the sport sector at the Ministry next Monday, to discuss the situation of referees and, from there, decide how to reduce \u201ccorruption problems\u201d in football.\nThe idea of a seminar was to get the participants to \u201cadvise us,\u201d so that they could advise him as to how to improve the work of referees and \u201canswer to the concerns of domestic coaches.\u201d Having spent 10 years in charge of government anti-corruption measures, I certainly know how some of the representatives of coaches could tell the minister how to improve work of officials involved in match-fixing and organised crime. Petrides has probably learned the facts about match-fixing from other, anti-corruption wings of government, which are apparently more interested in probing a job seeker\u2019s CV than spotting fake multi-million contracts or stories of corruption.\nBut the problem, not mentioned in the minister\u2019s speech was the refusal of some councils to follow the ban imposed by the Internal Security Service on games organised by Football Supporters Clubs, which had threatened to deny itself access to public funding. That clubs, mostly consisting of Greek Cypriots, who did not register or take part in the leagues were benefiting financially from the government\u2019s generosity and other unofficial benefits was the issue.\nSport is an important service the government provides to all Cypriots, especially the young and the socially disadvantaged, who are deprived of football because of money. The government is obliged to respect the decision of the Financial Control Committee of the Internal Security Service on sport and its rulings, which, according to the minister, must be adhered to.\nThe fact the administration had enough trouble policing a problem which, no one was claiming to have been solved, should have alerted it to the real problem: it lacked the funds to clamp down on betting organised by the Daphni group, who are allegedly responsible for recent and suspected match-fixing by the football clubs.

On the same day, the authority released renderings of its plan to revitalise the Waterfront Mosquito Bug Drilling Section (WDB), one of the main facilities of the creek, in partnership with Skanska UK, a civil engineer company engaged in design and construction of projects for marine transit infrastructure in Dubai.\nAs part of the plan, the Authority's two branch metro stations on the water - Central Bus Station and Rashidiya Bus Station - will connect to the Sewage Treatment Plant, with two quality-conscious and functional laboratories, one at Central Bus Station and the other at the Rashidiya Bus Station.\n\"This plan is a response to the significant growth in visitor arrivals in the vicinity, and in fact the catchment area, of the Creek. This development is guided by RTA's strategic objectives to ensure that the waterway is navigable for all the intended purposes and is capable of providing sustainable and convenient transport modes for the increase in visitors, and accommodate the evolving requirements of the markets of Dubai Creek, these requirements are also reflected in the updated plans.\nThe upgrade plan is in line with the strategy of the Government of Dubai to transform the Creek from its current largely industrial set-up into a strategically significant waterway and a destination for all types of transportation modes. The design and construction of this facility was to ensure the environmental compatibility as well as raise the reputation of Dubai Creek as a clean, healthy, and leisure-oriented waterfront,\" said Hassan Ahmed Al Bastaki, CEO of RTA's Traffic and Roads Agency.\nHe stressed that the new facility will protect the surface waters of Dubai Creek from marine pollution as well as limit any potential threats to underwater ecosystem.\nAl Bastaki continued: \"At present, Skanska UK is undertaking the scope of work in collaboration with the government for revamping and redeveloping the facility. Following the tender, the design and construction contract was awarded to Skanska UK, who is providing technical expertise in terms of consultants, construction contractors, procurement and construction management services to achieve a high-quality construction and environment management.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "PUBLISHER: Amazon\nPRICE: \u00a311.99\nIt's easy to forget that this is a show about a teenager who can't read and doesn't know what \"incident\" (her description) means. So it's fair to say that Supernatural was always over-the-top when it comes to demon lore, even with its somewhat preposterous casting of Jared Padalecki as an angsty demon hunter who can apparently fall asleep with his eyes open. However, surprisingly it's still succeeded in frightening many who could often be forgiven for thinking demonic possession was a new 19th-century dailiness.\nFor Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, the problems presented by young witches in 19th-century America are given a relatively realistic flavour by Melissa Joan Hart, the star of Nickelodeon's Clarissa Explains It All. Here she is cast as Sabrina, a full-on 17-year-old who knows \"occult\" and \"goblins\", but most of all, as seen in a TV promo video for the show (above) and in several full-length episodes (below) in the boxset included in the box we've put together. It's a powerful watch which not only showcases the powers of Hart, her formidable co-star Ross Lynch and an impressive supporting cast, but provides humour too, something which lesser shows struggle to achieve.\nThe TV promo (above) that helped promote the show shows Sabrina as a woman who can not only explore her powers, but also use them to charm (below).\nThankfully, there's plenty more to enjoy here in the story of how Sabrina tries to integrate herself in the world of the living, particularly among her new friends at Baxter High, although the dangers that plague the town are equally intriguing.\nThat's despite the fact that the powers of evil appear to be the least interesting aspect of the show. The nuances of Sabrina's relationship with her coven (seen at the end of Episode 10) and the obvious affection between her and Rosalind (Alaina Huffman) are far more interesting.\nThere is definitely a lot to look forward to in seasons 2 and 3, in particular, as the audience gets to see Sabrina's supernatural powers in action, instead of just having it explained to her.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Mirrors, pen and ink; a hedgerow; a galvanized siding supply; a koi pond; colourful jute basket. None of these photos perfectly encapsulate a container garden. Take the simple box container, for example. In one container is a giant wire and foam big dumb snails. They are outlined in a clam shell. The rain water is bubbling around the snails below the box. The box has thick heatproof plastic pipes, attached to cardboard backing. The free-floating foam is the water that surrounds the snails. For every two people displaying the box to their garden, the park tree and walkway behind them also seem to be included. Even the elegant ornaments, chess pieces and turtle toy are supposed to be encapsulated in an entirely new environment. But they aren\u2019t. They were just lost in the movie. I started to wonder why? Why did the designers make the pot so ordinary? They offered shelter for a pretty much invisible action, but at the same time left a cozy contrast, look and feel between the resident plants and the tidy deck. There are many pieces of the photo that tell their own story of this design team. It appears that the concept team didn\u2019t even get the pond right. It was straight from the flume ride or the Rainforest Train. Instead of rain water running off from a beautiful garden, the waterfall cascade really rushes through the bottom of the box into some deep flat bottomed creek. When rain soaks the waste in it even the rain leaves a light spray. It is not gentle or quiet, or even clean. It is loud enough to make another wave, out of sight and out of mind. In the warped memory from the photo, it reads more like a third world third world I believe. If nothing is wrong, perhaps it is a misunderstanding. Then again, maybe the poor design is the inspiration for so many other images in my mind. The answer may lie in the five key parts of a container garden. Please don\u2019t let anything in the gallery be irrelevant or messy. It is with this ideal image in mind I have asked our bud garden masters for their suggestions on some of the things in the photo that may be contributing to our grid of confusion.

{"text": "The producers of the new Netflix version of \"The Crown\" are insisting they have plenty of discretion about how they create the fictional relationships between the two young British royals, Prince Philip and Prince Charles.\nBut the show's authenticity about social mores is subject to interpretation.\nThe new \"The Crown\" does give its royal protagonists at least one present-day match: A brassy flapper (North London's Emma Corrin) who turned out to be the early mother-in-law of future Queen Elizabeth II.\n\"I think she's brilliant,\" said Corrin, who learned of her audition while doing an hour-long solo show at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in August. \"I wasn't even aware she existed because I didn't know anybody in my life who knew anyone who was working on the show or knew the writers or anything. But I saw some pictures of her, and she looked incredible. She's fantastic.\"\nThe 29-year-old actress has been in starring roles on the stage and television for years, and she was up for \"Crown\" even before her Edinburgh show.\n\"It was just this wonderful phone call where they were like, 'We'd love to have you.' It was incredible,\" she said in a recent interview.\nThe show offers Corrin a rare chance to be both queen-to-be and a royal wife in one long-running TV series. And so the starlet has been asked to confirm whether her character really does date Prince Philip or whether she's merely Elizabeth's stunt bride.\nWhat remains most likely is that her character, Daisy, is destined to become the number-two center of power and influence at Buckingham Palace after Elizabeth thanks to the vicarious involvement of her equally \u201cbrilliant\u201d mother-in-law.\nWearing a vibrant peacock-print dress and funky pillbox hat, Corrin strode into an office where she played reporter Alan Yentob on a recent afternoon. When asked if the character Daisy had finally met her Prince Charming, Corrin was quick to dismiss it, before stating that her character actually gives Phil the boot.\nThat makes sense, considering how close Phil\u2019s wife, Lady Henrietta Mountbatten-Windsor, was to the real Diana, who left the princess. Mountbatten-Windsor was best friends with Diana\u2019s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and even married the tall, dark, and handsome Hugh Topham, Lady Henrietta\u2019s stepson, when he wed the sister of the future queen.\nThat, in itself, makes Corrin's new role all the more puzzling.\n\"People are always talking about the producers' restraint,\" Corrin said. \"But I think that any TV producer would be restrained, not because they want to be politically correct but because of the fine line you walk, and you don't want to step off that. So a lot of it is being guided by what's right, not what's right for you.\n\"People are always talking about their reluctance to bring these royal family members into 'The Crown.' But in the end, a lot of them don't show up. Because it just doesn't make any sense. It really shouldn't make any sense.\"\n\"The Crown\" comes amid a surge of royal drama, including \"Victoria,\" which star Jenna Coleman admits to being frustrated with because it ignores modernity.\n\"That series is very 19th century, and I don't think we're ever going to understand the lives of contemporary young people, and it's far too close to home to make that connection,\" she said.\nColeman remains certain about her own experience of Princess Diana in her final years.\n\"She had such a wonderful sense of humor and a commitment to being her own woman,\" she said. \"She was kind of self-aware and realized the absurdity of a lot of her own drama \u2014 because she also enjoyed a great deal of drama.

(Published Sunday, April 14, 2019)\nThere were also \"candy box\" photos from the medieval time period that were saved from smoke, along with most of the original texts of the Grail-themed university\u2019s Dramatic Arts Center building, well known for the annual, popular \"Cursed Disco\" extravaganza.\nBut there wasn\u2019t enough time to put out the fire and fears that it could spread throughout the entire historic campus, which is under threat of demolition, likely caused many people to call for an evacuation.\nThe university, however, decided to \u201crescue what we could,\u201d said Department of Public Safety Chief Brian White.\nFirefighters arrived and eventually extinguished the fire in an extraordinary effort involving more than 50 firefighters from four fire departments.\nThe Macario, the school\u2019s dean of admission and admissions counselor, and his family were among those who were treated by an emergency response unit on site for burns to the hands and face. They will be treated with antidotes, said White.\n\"Their hands are all the worse for wear,\" he said.\nThe school also expanded the safety perimeter of the campus and created new fire lanes through the mess of paper, books and other debris from the fire.\nNotre Dame emerged from its centuries-long Catholic affiliation on May 4, 2015, but students and faculty were required to work as Catholic priests in full accordance with the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Constitution on the \u201cJoint Mission of the University and the Catholic Church\u201d for five years.\nPreliminary reports estimate the damage at between $1.5 million and $2 million. Those reports do not include financial support from Benedictine monks on the campus who pray at the Chapel every morning.\nArchitecturator Larry Stone told NBC10 the fire looked like a bomb had gone off.\n\"We want to put out the fire, but we want to save as much as we can,\" Stone said.\nStone said many objects and piles of paper and other debris had not been burned and could be salvaged.\n\"That's always the struggle, but I think we're pretty lucky to have found most of the medieval society material and not this mess we have now,\u201d Stone said.\nThe church\u2019s curators have launched a forensic analysis of the material and digital analysis to find ways to preserve it.\nNotre Dame\u2019s centuries-old tradition of seeking forgiveness for its former priests continues with a new board of directors elected in February that include past and current alumni from Jewish, Protestant and Muslim communities.\nNotre Dame was contacted by Catholic leaders and Vice-Pope Joseph Martelly last week for an assessment of the hospital\u2019s conditions and possible modifications to ensure its \u201cdignity and pedagogy,\u201d according to a statement released on Sunday.\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC 10 Philadelphia\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) may have made a big blunder in buying billions of dollars worth of GM shares following bankruptcy. Not long ago I wrote about my short case on Berkshire Hathaway and how it just does not make sense for Buffett to purchase large amounts of the type of equity necessary to keep up a portfolio of businesses. Another example is his ever-growing stock portfolio in the REITs, an area in which he is still not interested. In my book, making high-priced investment decisions is most definitely not good for your business. As far as Metlife (NYSE:MET) is concerned, the financial conditions are much better than those when it was scheduled to go private.\nLanxess (OTCQX:LNXSY) is a German company that is a leader in synthetic rubber. They have assets around the world, and the biggest subsidiary is Johnson Matthey, an oil companies based in London and with an integrated business operating around the world. BRK.A owns 6.9% of Fennedon Capital Management, an asset management business.\nI think BRK.A made a bad investment in Suncor (NYSE:SU) and GEICO, as the former looks lost in the oil patch and the latter has struggled for years. In this article I look at how Lanxess could make Berkshire a very interesting holding. The entire financial sector in the U.S. is facing an exceptional amount of uncertainty because there are no signs yet if this will turn out to be a risk-taking or risk-management cycle. There are high expectations and maybe too many points of similarity between some investments the U.S. financial industry is pursuing. If Buffett is looking to make large bets on something, Linxess provides a great opportunity.\nLanxess is a market leader in rubber technologies, and is a pure play in the synthetic rubber sector. It is the main carbon dioxide provider to North America for fuel additive as well as for diesel-treatment chemicals. It is a supplier of fuels to North America, Western Europe and China, and one of the suppliers of nitrogen-based gas treatment to Oil Sands Countries - Canada, Venezuela, Mexico, Russia and Argentina.\nU.S. natural gas prices have recently started to improve. During the past decade, natural gas prices have fallen from $11.89 per MMBtu in 2004 to $3.05 in 2014. Since natural gas is the primary fuel source for U.S. energy production, an improvement in prices could improve net income of the company. Currently, U.S. Natural Gas prices are trading at $3.08 per MMBtu. The average price of natural gas for last 12 months is $3.48 per MMBtu. Based on those numbers, it would mean an improvement of 3.8% per year. Adding this to the annual improvement of 3.5% for the company is the potential increase in revenues, net income and EPS.\nTo develop a handle on the most important part of the company, look at the revenue of the U.S. gases, the largest of the company's business units. Revenues during the past 12 months have been $3.8 billion and the gross profit has been $1.0 billion. Since its inception, the company has not been able to produce its cash profits and no dividend has been paid for 20 years. It is the second largest pure play in the chemicals sector in the world, and the largest pure play in the U.S. While the margins are not identical, it is the only pure play in the U.S. that produces its own products. The company is able to produce the high-performance, high-performance end using natural gas, and produces only two types of latex materials, synthetic and renewable. The chemicals industry is an interesting one, and there are some mega caps in this industry and enough to support a research and development business.\nLanxess is the second largest pure play in the chemicals industry in the U.S. based on revenues. It is almost a monopolistic system of business and, in my opinion, has huge upside. I mean huge, but actually in the absence of hedge fund or other competitors, this firm should be able to grow tremendously. Although historically its growth has been going down, so in the future it should grow up and translate into a higher market capitalization.\nBased on an estimate of the annual EPS from 2012 to 2016, for this data, the share price should be worth $68.50, which would represent a more than 200% rise from the current prices. I hope to find out what the potential of this investor is in the future.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long LNXSY.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\nDENVER -- Supporters and critics of a proposed law to provide six weeks of paid family leave in Colorado gathered at the State Capitol on Wednesday.\nThough a paid family leave program has been passed by state legislatures in 40 other states, what is left of the proposal from last year stalled in the Democratically controlled House of Representatives.\nThis year, the number of weeks that can be taken on leave has been increased from six to 12 and the maximum wage workers must earn before losing their job while they are on leave has been increased from $9 to $12 an hour.\nThe bill is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Steve Fenberg and Democratic Rep. Joe Salazar.\n\"This is not a job issue,\" Salazar said. \"When you are caring for your children or other family members when you are on an extended paid leave.\"\nBut a handful of Republicans -- including Republican Rep. Jon Becker and Republican Rep. Andy Kerr -- urged a vote against the bill during the joint meeting of the Senate and House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs committees.\nBecker argued the bill is an ineffective method of creating family-friendly employment.\n\"With this program, just like an unemployment line, there is nothing to cover the cost,\" Becker said.\n\"Quite frankly, a program that takes away eight or nine weeks of work before you get any income in this state means we have an overwhelming amount of people falling below the poverty line,\" Becker continued.\nOthers were upset with how the bill was worded.\nThe bill requires companies with 25 or more employees, or businesses with more than 50 employees, to offer six weeks of paid family leave to employees.\nEmployees would not have to pay any of the health insurance premium costs, which totals $13 million for the state. Instead, employees would have to purchase health insurance from the Colorado Employee Health Insurance Exchange.\nState Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, argued: \"These are words from statute,\" Sonnenberg said. \"What it does not do is legislate, it does not legislate. It says 'we look at circumstances in this state.'\"\nSalazar attempted to change Sonnenberg's mind, but it was unsuccessful. Sonnenberg said he has no problem if the legislature passes an employment leave policy similar to their state's private sector.\n\"I am not a problem with expanding the time off when you need it,\" Sonnenberg said. \"I will support any workable and reasonable program that accomplishes that.\"\nSalazar and the other supporters, who included the Colorado Hospital Association, are confident the bill can pass. Salazar said the bill will take 24 hours to pass out of the chamber.\n", "label": "machine"}

And a whiff of the spirit is in the nose of the head football coach.\nIt's the smell of victory. And its official name is Ebonite.\nHead coach P.J. Fleck is the university's first distinguished alumnus. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 2010 and graduate degrees in psychology and business management in 2014.\nOn Tuesday, Fleck -- who has admitted to smelling good through high school, college and NFL -- disclosed the Gophers' second annual \"no-smell\" blue-blazer dinner, his brainchild after the 2016 season.\nHe recently introduced the concept to upperclassmen in a team meeting, informing them the spring practice on campus starts in 15 days. He detailed four pillars of this offseason, including having all assistants smell good.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go to the NFL, but I got a start (there),\u201d Fleck said. \u201cI got a start working for the Minnesota Vikings.

Three-day season ticket packages for that season are available for several Gophers football players, including Heisman Trophy finalist running back Rodney Smith.\nThe idea to get Gophers staff members and players together to talk about class is part of Fleck's version of team bonding. The goal is to get people to accomplish without being distracted from the actual work, Fleck said.\n\"We are a team, but our team means work,\" Fleck said. \"People \u2014 we don\u2019t always have to hang out on Monday through Friday. It is team bonding, but team bonding for us is not just by going to a Timberwolves game or theater. We also know what team bonding can do for you in terms of self growth, in terms of nutrition and preventing injuries \u2014 all those things.\"\nThe Gophers\u2019 practice schedule was unveiled Wednesday by Fleck. The projected 90-day season starts when the Gophers complete spring drills on April 22. The team breaks for the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., on Dec. 29. Then comes winter, and practices are back in action Feb. 1.\nFleck specifically picked the first-half of spring for practice and to recover from the days following the bowl. The start time for spring practice has yet to be determined.\n\u201cAt the end of spring, if you are right, you will be right,\u201d Fleck said, \u201cbut if you aren\u2019t right, you will get better, too.\u201d\nThe 2017-18 football schedule includes nine home games, with seven at TCF Bank Stadium and the season finale at Michigan State on Nov. 24. The Gophers also have one away game \u2014 a neutral-site contest against Oregon State at the home of the Minnesota Wild in St. Paul on Sept. 21.

{"text": "Some might think the solution to America\u2019s race-tinged race problem is to ban the twin evils of blackface and racism. Others might think the problem lies closer to home, among our fraternities and sororities. Indeed, their chapters can create a myriad of problems, but the simplest and most effective solution \u2014 to \u201cbrotherhood first\u201d \u2014 brings the most immediate and sustainable change.\nLast September, a nationally known fraternity from Penn State, Kappa Alpha Order, suspended its all-male membership following allegations that members had been hazing a black freshman pledge, who later committed suicide. Historically, police have reported hazing in fraternities to be common, often involving drugs, alcohol and violence. Traditionally, those who recognize the problem tend to take less drastic measures, such as \u201cblack riding with,\u201d where men stand apart with white fans from each other when they drink or walk.\nBut something completely different may be taking place today. These days, the heavily committed \u201cbrotherhood first\u201d fraternity sees hazing as a detriment to its own image. In a post on the Kappa Alpha Order\u2019s Facebook page, pledges to the fraternity are told to \u201c\u2026remove the eyes and ears of those attempting to lay the groundwork\u201d for \u201cwearing the [Alpha] order at an unfair or unsupportive critical or supreme level.\u201d\nPerhaps I am overestimating the desirability of white male front-facing friendship. But perhaps we don\u2019t have to turn from the outsized influence of co-eds to other bodies in college life. If fraternity houses and sororities, filled with ancient fraternity values and rituals, steer clear of hazing, they can play a crucial role in the safety and well-being of their social, academic and cultural brothers.\nA new fraternity, No Immediate Superior, will begin at Yale this fall. This nonprofit, Hoke, will operate with a distinctly different agenda than its alpha brothers. Hoke will offer Greek life post-hazing classes to students, foster a \u201chealthy and real\u201d black undergraduate experience, and promote black men (especially men of color) to leadership positions. In other words, the new organization, headquartered in New Haven, seeks to give in-house perpetrators a second chance. It supports the student-led movement to end hazing, and seeks to build new and better cultures.\nThis is nothing new. Since the 1980s, fraternities have been home to many groups founded with the hope of achieving greater black/Latino cultural cohesion. In 1965, Vice President Hubert Humphrey served as an advisory committee to the Interfraternity Council, inviting representatives from eight Greek organizations with \u201cprinciples of black male empowerment\u201d to a gathering at Penn State. A national fraternity called the Civil Rights Brotherhood was founded at Howard University to address the educational and career challenges of black students and alumni.\nAnd as a child, I spent time in and around Gwinnett, Ga., a largely black town near Atlanta where a woman named Liz Wagar created the GLBTQIA Alliance and the Accolade Foundation, a nonprofit that provided grants to support various black social organizations. Perhaps one of my favorite moments was after a conversation about how black people probably felt angry over the Hattie McDaniel ruling in 1940; some agreed, some did not, and some thought it was the right decision. She explained to me what she termed \u201cthe irony that one black person who was allowed to be an actor and a singer, but in the context of whom my parents loved to sit, sat for 12 years in that box seat.\u201d\nBlack sororities and fraternities can develop brotherhood first, be safe havens from violence, and foster newness and camaraderie in the diverse population. In our continuing quest to confront realities about race, we must engage in conversations with our neighbors, in our dorm rooms, on our campuses. We must not stand silent, pretending that one group, the members of a frat house, has nothing to do with our shared humanity. Fraternities should stop hatching conflicts, and instead welcome, respect and honor their brothers \u2014 both black and white.\nLaura Hollis is a former Harvard art history professor. Her recent book, \u201cThe Hate Race: Black Masses in North American Intellectual and Legal History,\u201d examines the racial \u201cinvolutions\u201d in North American intellectual and legal history.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Experts with the Canadian Wildlife Service are warning that warmer temperatures are prompting grizzly bears to escape the forests and move into central Alberta communities, where they\u2019re becoming more and more of a target for crime and attacks on people.\n\u201cClimate change is definitely playing a role,\u201d said Wade Sheridan, with the wildlife service. \u201cIn the past, central Alberta was relatively isolated, but now bears are urbanizing.\u201d\nBears are urbanizing in communities with people, but the concerns aren\u2019t just about bears getting too close to humans or food sources. Studies done by the wildlife service show a marked trend towards conflict between bears and people, including damage to trees, garbage bins and vehicles, as well as theft of birdseed, meat and other food supplies.\n\u201cWe know the human impact is significant,\u201d said Sheridan. \u201cThere are some landowners who think that they can manage the problem; they don\u2019t want them there at all.\u201d\nInvestigators are trying to figure out exactly why more bears are showing up in communities. Some theorize that they\u2019re getting more food and resources in the forests, allowing them to access greener territory where they don\u2019t have to worry about food sources at close range. Meanwhile, the snowpack is often melting earlier and later because of climate change, leading to more spring frosts that kill off the vegetation.\n\u201cTrees are warming up,\u201d said Sheridan. \u201cWith that, a lot of the higher-quality, nutritionally and otherwise, has to come out by melting the trees. It is part of climate change.\u201d\nGrizzlies are moving out of their natural ranges to the woods, where they find predators \u2014 particularly wolves and coyotes \u2014 who are more aggressive. It means the animals are now forced to hunt in more urban areas, which means there\u2019s less shelter from predators and less to eat.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of bears in urban communities,\u201d said Sheridan. \u201cBut the problem is even if they\u2019re inside communities, where they can have food and could be interacting with people, there\u2019s also the opportunity for somebody to steal their food.\u201d\nOne of the solutions to the problem is increasing management of dens, which means better monitoring of bears, and better ways to deploy rangers and wardens.\n\u201cThe challenges are finding bears, making sure they can be sustainably managed, and then managing them to find cubs and then on to a more sustainable environment,\u201d said Sheridan.\nCoun. Shane Keating believes government agencies need to tackle the problem by responding to the human element, such as making noise with sirens and flashing lights to wake up coyotes and wolves. It\u2019s also important to do a better job of monitoring the animals and telling people to stay away if they\u2019re near them.\n\u201cWe should really focus on what is that human element,\u201d said Keating. \u201cYou have to calm down the coyotes and wolves to get that to happen.\u201d\nBears are a natural part of the ecosystem, but Keating believes government agencies need to take steps to reduce its impacts.\n\u201c(But) I don\u2019t believe that we should be putting barricades and fences and dog run barriers in front of the animals,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in all this kind of aggression against the grizzly bears.\u201d\nkevin.martin@sunmedia.ca\nOn Twitter: @Kevin_MARTIN\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The video game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice takes place in a dystopian future where Earth becomes contaminated by radioactive chemicals, rendering all of mankind inhuman. It's a bleak subject, but for me, there's one thing that the game has going for it: irradiated Hyrule.\nIn the game, the magic is so concentrated that allies slowly start to deteriorate, losing skills and memories that they rely on to survive. Instead of calling the police, players are forced to take matters into their own hands, solving puzzles and confronting strange plot twists that they themselves can't see coming.\nThe combination of turn-based combat and puzzle-solving is a perfect match for darkness. The sounds of helicopters gently circling above, percussive screams of wolves, terrified text messages from friends \u2014 those are some of the sounds I used to memorise in Final Fantasy X. That entire game was bright and happy, filled with daydreams that my character never had the chance to experience and become a hero. They were temporary escapism from all of the endless war and darkness that came to define the series.\nI get chills when I'm reminded of Final Fantasy games, and I definitely did not enjoy Sekiro. The story was repetitive, filled with excessive silence and violence. The pacing is sloppy, and the story largely ignores the relationships between characters. The ending is absurdly abrupt, almost literally removing any forward momentum from the story (part of the game's unfortunate charm).\nAll of this is to say, Sekiro left me extremely unsatisfied. It took a lot of time to play the game, and by the time I finished it, I was almost ready to delete it. It felt pointless and repetitive.\nIt was sloppy, and the dialogue was uninspiring. It took me nearly three years of my life to finish it. I'll stick to more \"fun\" games now, and games that, while not perfect, still let me suspend reality and play alongside someone else.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "AP-BKN--NBA-Playoffs,1st Ld-Writethru\nA look at 10 things to know about the upcoming NBA postseason:\n___\nThe upset special: One of the biggest stories of the 2018 season \u2014 and the one everyone's looking for this year \u2014 has been the emergence of the Los Angeles Clippers' franchise players while replacing Blake Griffin with Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari. Harris and Gallinari each scored more than 20 points a game and the Clippers had won five straight at one point while Griffin wasn't playing. Now, they go back to the postseason as a No. 7 seed against a Spurs team hoping that third time is the charm.\nBETTER SECOND HALF: The second half of the regular season was a crapshoot for the most teams, and that's probably the case again in the postseason. The teams that went 28-14 or better in the second half were an average of .460 better in their second half than their first. Other second-half numbers were: Teams that went 8-20 went .349 better in the second half; teams that went 11-21 went .351 better; teams that went 19-22 went .371 better; teams that went 26-31 went .421 better; and teams that went 17-24 went .480 better.\nGAME OF THE YEAR? The Bulls had a chance at their second 50-win season in three years when they faced Indiana on March 12. But the Pacers closed with a 22-5 run and wound up winning 96-81. Chicago didn't have a winning record, and the game sealed a collapse that began when Dwyane Wade was traded.\nHOME-COURT ADVANTAGE: This is the eighth season in a row for which the No. 1 seed in the East has hosted Game 1 of a playoff series. Last year, the top spot opened at home for the Spurs, who lost their next two games while learning how not to be home-court kings. The No. 1 seed has hosted Game 1 of the East playoffs in six of the past seven seasons, with home teams winning seven of the nine games. The closest fit for No. 1 vs. 2 came in 2014, when the No. 1 seed hosted the series and also won it all.\nNO. 1 CLIPPERS?: Of the four No. 1 seeds, the Clippers might be the most vulnerable. Harris, Danilo Gallinari and Austin Rivers combined to lead the team in scoring in 36 games and also were mostly unselfish, making the Clippers easy to throw out against the aggressive coaching of Gregg Popovich.\nMILESTONE MODE: The Raptors, with Kyrie Irving, Jonas Valanciunas and Serge Ibaka, will chase the mark for most players to score 50 points in a postseason game. Toronto, Miami, San Antonio and Chicago had all had multiple players reach that number at the same time. With Irving, Valanciunas and Ibaka all in the playoffs, the Raptors also have the chance to join the Bulls as the only teams with 3,000 wins.\nDECISION MADE: All three matchups for the Eastern Conference semifinals have been decided before the opening tip, as has one matchup for the Western Conference semifinals: The Spurs-Clippers series will feature a pair of teammates who play on different sides in Davis and Gallinari.\nBACK FROM LONG REST: All three big U.S. sports teams play on Sunday for the first time since last May. The Yankees host the Twins, the Patriots host the Chargers and the Rockets host the Thunder.\n___\nFollow Tim Reynolds on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/ByTimReynolds\n___\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "You know, if you\u2019re 5-foot-11 and weigh 230 pounds.\nSuffice it to say, Kentucky pass rusher Josh Allen is no Mack. To say that Allen has size and speed is a bit of an understatement. In his first career game last September, Allen had four tackles for loss and two sacks as Kentucky took down No. 1 Florida in their conference opener.\nAs noted by CBS Sports\u2019 Kenny Beck, Allen\u2019s newest interview is his first since the NFL combine. In the interview, Allen expresses his desire to be the next Khalil Mack, which he said \u201cwasn\u2019t a set-in-stone goal\u201d for him, but he is prepared to work for it.\n\u201cThat was something I knew I needed to achieve,\u201d Allen said of being a prototype Mack. \u201cI know where Khalil\u2019s strength and mentality is.

The numbers Allen put up last season have put him in that class as well. He has a nasty streak, with the ability to use his length and athleticism to wear the offensive linemen down.\nHis size and speed allow him to pressure the passer and even possess the ability to knock down passes as well. Allen is projected to be a top-5 pick at the 2019 NFL draft, which is just a couple of weeks away. To ensure that he keeps his mind sharp, though, Allen recently started working on a serious level with Mac, the personal trainer formerly of the Chicago Bulls. Mack is just a couple of years ahead of Allen in his career with the Bulls. But to be a Bronks linebacker, he may need to stick to his new workout regimen.\nIf Allen\u2019s long, athletic frame is any indication, Mack will end up staying away from the Mavs just like Allen did, as Mack has signed a 5-year, $141 million deal to stay in Oakland. But for now, it looks like those leading the Mack train will have their own coach and won\u2019t be working at Quaker State (though some have since taken on the role).\nWhile Allen may have to work to shake off the new-found attention his size and athleticism have brought on him, his 6-foot-7 frame and booming 40-yard dash time will be putting a large target on his back next Thursday, May 8.\n", "label": "machine"}

The news comes just ahead of a highly anticipated announcement regarding the Republicans selection of their 2020 presidential nominee.\nTrump\u2019s announcement is expected to come Tuesday, although a date was not given.\nThe 58-year-old Cain was born and raised in Detroit and has just recently finished a three-decade long career in the commercial banking industry. He has served as a director on a number of Fortune 500 companies in addition to the new appointment. He was also a candidate for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, but lost that race to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.\nWhile he has served on several corporate boards, Cain is perhaps best known for his meteoric rise and fall in the GOP presidential race in 2012, when he soared to become a top contender only to fall off in a quick, drawn-out tailspin. According to one political researcher, Cain would have been the GOP candidate to beat if he had not dropped out so early on.\nThose who knew Herman Cain before he became an unlikely front-runner for the presidency remember the major political stunt he pulled by jumping in and out of some Presidential debates, \u201cpivoting\u201d at will as questions were asked by moderators.\nHerman Cain campaigning in Des Moines, Iowa, on August 15, 2011, two weeks before his presidential bid fizzled.

And if I take the bait, then it\u2019s gonna be the liberal media, not me.\u201d\nCain finished a distant fourth in the 2012 GOP presidential primary, receiving only 2.4 percent of the Republican vote.\nHe is Trump\u2019s second choice for the position of Federal Reserve President.

{"text": "CORVALLIS -- When Oregon State's Leandro Sosa bunted for a base hit in the top of the second inning Wednesday night at Goss Stadium, nobody really knew what to expect.\nOregon State had been getting pretty creative at bunt this season, one swing away from gaining an early lead. Sosa scored easily, and Oregon State suddenly found itself in a 4-1 hole.\nHis plucky approach led to a rare run for Oregon, though, as things settled down in a regular-season Civil War finale when Oregon (18-16, 8-11 Pac-12) rallied for a 7-5 comeback win to take two of three in the series and keep OSU's fading tourney hopes alive.\n\"That was a big run in the game,\" OSU coach Pat Casey said. \"We did some good things the way we wanted. We kept pounding the ball. That was good. You have to use the tempo in baseball, but that could've been a trend for the year.\"\nThe two teams entered the game neck-and-neck in a battle for the seventh and final National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association championship berth in the nine-team Pac-12.\nWith one game left in the regular season, the series winner clinches a berth in the conference tournament, regardless of which team finishes second.\nOSU led Oregon 2-1 in the ninth before the Ducks erupted for four runs. OSU pulled to within 7-5 in the bottom of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Logan White but pinch hitter Brett Thomas singled for the decisive run.\n\"The bottom of the ninth, you never know how it's going to go,\" Oregon coach George Horton said. \"Hopefully, the guys keep fighting and find a way to do it.\"\nA three-run first inning for Oregon had given the Ducks a 4-1 lead. Connor Seabold (8-5) lasted only four innings before walking T.J. Mittelstaedt on five pitches to open the fifth inning.\nOregon State's Nate Feketa came on and immediately walked Will Heeke. With KJ Harrison batting, Feketa gave up a two-run single. Pinch hitter Andrew Keesler hit an RBI single to make it 4-1.\n\"It wasn't necessarily my fault,\" Feketa said. \"I left a couple pitches out over the plate and they hit them.\"\nOSU strung together four hits in the top of the second, including a two-run double by Patrick Rodgers. The two-out rally had Oregon's second starter, Trent Boland, pulled. The Ducks brought in freshman Evan White (3-0) to face Sosa, whom Oregon State hadn't faced all season.\nThe Beavers have usually gotten the job done against White by hitting the ball to the right side with authority. Sosa took a ball and settled for a slow roller toward shortstop Rob Taylor, who made a nice play to get the final out.\n\"My motto is, 'Recreate the bomb,' \" Horton said. \"Last year we would've hit it hard and it would've cleared the fence. I thought we were going to be able to do it again this year. They laid off some fastballs, too, which was good. I know he's never faced Sosa, but it's pretty impressive to me.\"\nDespite allowing just six hits, Feketa took the loss.\n\"I thought he had pretty good fastball command,\" Casey said. \"Pitching in this league doesn't necessarily mean you have to pitch that well. Give Oregon some credit.\"\nTaylor took the mound to open the ninth and promptly got booted while trying to field a grounder by Taylor Kubitza. Feketa followed with a hit-and-run that David Forney couldn't handle. The infield drawn in, Sosa was greeted with a double and the tying run.\nAfter making a play on a bunt, Seabold walked Connor Hamlett to load the bases.\n\"I probably shouldn't have walked a guy, but the strike zone wasn't all there,\" Seabold said. \"It was like a lot of league games, where it was pretty much a changeup all night.\"\nIn the bottom of the ninth, Harrison walked to put runners on first and second. White came on and hit Feketa with a pitch. Harrison moved to third on the play. Dalton Glenn's bunt attempt for a forceout was too hard, which allowed Harrison to score the tying run. White intentionally walked Keesler to load the bases. Thomas eventually pounced on a fastball down the middle for the game-winning RBI.\n-- Bob Lundeberg for The Oregonian/OregonLive\n", "label": "machine"}

In the third and final part of World of Dance Season 3, the 100 finalists will compete to be the first ever top 10. But, each contestant must be the first three performers eliminated, so they\u2019ll also have to perform the best routine of their lives, however they may choose. Grace is ready to perform, but Michael fears he\u2019s been saved before. Grace says she feels super excited, but her dad is nervous. The solo performances will soon begin and the solo dancers are really stepping it up.\nAt the end of the show, the dancers are headed to San Francisco, where they will find out who is first to be cut from the season. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but are there even 100 of them? 100!\nOf the 100 dancers to compete for the top 10, the split is evenly split amongst three teams. Eric is proud that his sister Kit gets to finish it off after they lost a heated battle at last week\u2019s coach\u2019s house. Nick\u2019s team, Secret Kingdom, is the final team to dance, and he is nervous. He must be performing his best of his life now that he has the sense of urgency, he only has one more week to win the competition. The bottom two pairs are Derek and Adrienne, and Macy and Max. Macy dances to Drake\u2019s \u201cSigns\u201d while Max dances in a purple suit, his trademark costume. Macy\u2019s performance is always incredible and back to classic Max, but to be honest, it was his lower half that was lacking from his routine. If there\u2019s one choreographer that understands the female technique of dancing, it\u2019s Max and he knows it. He shakes hips on his stage! It was fiery and definitely not airtight, but he rocks his original style so fine. Macy however, sticks to Mandy Moore\u2019s choreography, a sweet and quirky theme. Macy lacked character and it\u2019s a shame because it would have been a great last dance. But, we will save Macy for her spot on the world stage. Bottom two teams were sent home, Derek and Adrienne, who both had stellar solo performances.\nAnd with that, it\u2019s your top 10! The groups are Chippendales, Seth and Sonia, Next Blue Lights, Jean Duce, Erotic School of Dance, Motocross Kids, Santos Grupo, You Eddies, Pura Vida Crew and the dancing twins, Trillenium.\nThe opening montage for the winner of World of Dance Season 3 is yet to air, but it will be a short but explosive opening.

{"text": "\"Crying,' she said, 'is not uncommon. It goes along with human development. It is not more important than not crying. It is as valuable in teenage behavior as ... mums are rich or dry and all kids are fat.' \" -- Winnie the Pooh, AA Milne, 1919.\nIt has not escaped notice that Kate Smith, whose voice so charmed Teddy Roosevelt that he summoned her as honorary representative of America to Winston Churchill's funeral, died this month at 91. She was a breath of fresh air in a media environment dominated by its male version. While men gabbed away on cable talk shows Monday on the obituaries being written of her, normally Mr. Stay in Your Seat rules.\nMs. Smith epitomized life on the edge. Her appearances on television were short -- about 10 minutes -- but real vignettes well worth appreciating. One is when she accompanied my father, Jerry Strauss, then deputy secretary of commerce, as they rallied President Franklin Roosevelt, on his retreat at the Arctic Circle at Charlevoix. Making all the right connections, she strolled to meet him at the door, and -- promptly, once he grasped the fact she was ahem, married -- he entered the cabin.\nMr. Strauss had a wife who was also president of Michigan State University. Their team, led by the Secretary of Commerce, could not get the team, led by Mr. Roosevelt, into the air on the day of Charlevoix as they needed to go from Ulan Bator to Whistler Falls. Their team, composed of companies from Washington, D.C., made a better mess.\nLater when Mr. Strauss' own marriage broke up, he and her were supporting each other through the hardest times. She received $7 a day on the show.\nBeing a woman on a popular Sunday morning talk show probably isn't worth a thing to most of those who make their living from movies, television, music and print journalism. Miss Smith obviously enjoyed it as did Mr. Strauss, whose own father, Arthur H. Strauss, was manager of the New York Times. He once said, \"All I ever wanted to do with my life was go out on a TV show called 'You Bet Your Life.' I told some boys of mine, 'Whenever you have that talk show, just come down and see me.' So I always did. Why not in the flesh? It never occurred to me to do this: 'Katherine do you have an ABC or CBS show you're going to try? Do you have one?'\"\nThat show included -- among other things -- a taping of Mr. Strauss' take on the Hindenburg disaster. He told the audience he was amazed at the number of men who had met and married women from the newspaper's newsroom where they had worked.\nIn a recent Washington Post column, author Carla Harris, whose \"Nuclear Mansions\" book was made into a 2007 movie with Katherine Heigl as Mrs. Smith, wrote, \"Kate Smith was a woman who defied all contemporary gender norms. The one-time syndicated radio personality was not just America's best-known pitchwoman for women's lib, but also, as Brooke Shields wrote in her new autobiography, 'that generation's Helen Keller.'\" She wrote, \"It was radio and television which taught girls and women not to be afraid of sex and equal rights. It was television and radio that broke down a generation's unspoken line: 'He is gay. She is a lesbian. It's your fault that you two are not married.\" The blacklisting of male entertainers for being gay has been a long history. It took television to break down the sexual double standard.\nMiss Smith became the first paid female star of a network game show. Ms. Harris quotes a historian who said as many as 800 radio and 60 TV shows had been hosted by women before America met Kate Smith, but that women's roles as pitchwomen, spokeswomen and simple everyday chatters had previously been a fireproofing of ideas. She wrote, \"Radio and television was the first chance the audience had to see that Ms. Smith, a self-confessed extrovert who had to keep up a family-oriented act day after day, didn't operate like some glorified bottle washer. That moment was an important break in the progress of women, and a watershed in Ms. Smith's career.\"\nCal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nMost currency analysts expect the euro to either rally or fall in the coming months as the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose policy is gradually dismantled.\nPolicymakers have repeatedly said the euro\u2019s appreciation since ECB President Mario Draghi ditched investor expectations of more euro-fueled stimulus in July 2013 is not a major concern.\nBut the single currency\u2019s strength is eating into Europe\u2019s exports and weighing on consumer spending, especially in smaller European countries that are almost entirely reliant on the single currency to fund their budgets.\nThe euro fell 0.2 percent on the day to $1.3787 EUR=EBS, not far from a 23-month low of $1.3780 hit on Thursday.\nAgainst the yen, the euro slid 0.1 percent to 124.09 yen JPY=, after touching 124.00 yen on Thursday, the weakest level since April 2012.\n\u201cDraghi has stated that he is not worried about the appreciation and is very comfortable with the situation, but even he would say he cannot say the same about deflation,\u201d Erkki Liikanen, a member of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council, said on Saturday in Finland.\nThe ECB is already in its third year of negative rates, and market traders bet the euro zone money supply, the lifeblood of the economy, will expand at only 0.8 percent this year.\nDraghi has said monetary policy will remain accommodative and that he did not foresee a currency war but his tone has not so far reassured investors in the euro currency, whose strength amounts to about 1.8 percent this year.\n\u201cThe ECB wants the euro to weaken, so ultimately they want a divergence between the real economy and the monetary policy. Ultimately investors need to shift out of the dollar and back into some of the cyclical currencies,\u201d said Ulrich Leuchtmann, chief currency strategist at Commerzbank.\nDraghi will also face questions at a news conference later on Monday, when the ECB may rule out further bond purchases after ending its latest programme.\nA rally in currencies like the New Zealand dollar EURZNZ=R and the Canadian dollar, which benefit from a lower dollar, could help weaker euro zone currencies as well.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Many investors over the past three years have flocked to the bullish thesis on gold by exploring its potential as an investment and store of value. However, many overlooked one of the most important requirements for an investment in the commodity: liquidity. In other words, investors had to have money flow into the commodity as well as out, or else the commodity would never grow.\nFor some gold investors, buyers were far and few between as the prices of commodities stagnated between $200 and $300 per oz, to which the gold bullion picked up. Today, however, there are signs that the gold bull could finally break out and show investors gold prices rising toward the area of $1,400 per oz by Q4. A bullish article in a recent report from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) highlights these developments.\nBofAML is a leading bank that represents the global markets and derivatives markets, has several investment funds and will be marketing their products to clients. Here is their bullish case on gold prices. The data is from their March 30 update to their gold indices:\nFor the first time in 7 quarters, gold prices are higher on a sequential basis. Moreover, for the 2nd quarter in a row, weekly dollar indices for the first time in 7 quarters are lower. Softer dollar implies gold is more expensive in dollar terms than it was. BofAML would therefore be allocating more capital to gold to hedge against the soft dollar.\nQ1 2011 was the strongest quarter for gold price since the second quarter of 2008. Egress volume against gold prices increased 9%. So a key indicator of new investment occurred as the gold price rose a 6% while $2 was reinvested back into gold. In aggregate, gold Egress volume increased 8% and represented more than 70% of sell volume. The biggest declines came from Europe (meaning hedge funds) who were selling because the price was rising and the security was becoming more expensive.\nThe BofAML analysts made a similar point about asset flows into the TMS (Total Money Market Debt) and U.S. dollar in their report.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "At Breitbart, Daniel Dale echoes the right-wing exploitation of AOC: She\u2019s \u201cheading down the Stephen Miller road\u201d by considering a position as vice president, Dale argues, since she isn\u2019t \u201cas clueless about policy as Rubio or Condi Rice was.\u201d The problem is that AOC was, Dale says, \u201cflip-flopping\u201d on the question of economic policy\u2014refusing to take a position on whether economic conditions ought to bring new immigration limits\u2014and displaying confusion, not ignorance.\nOn Twitter, AOC\u2019s supporters are quick to respond to the attacks by defending her and noting that her views on immigration policy are well known. A couple of hours after the Breitbart piece published, an anonymous AOC Twitter user called Pico Pixel wrote, \u201cI give AOC all the credit in the world for not finding it sexist to support border control and refugee protections, as it\u2019s been well-established she does.\u201d Pico Pixel went on to note that, to her credit, AOC thought Ivanka Trump\u2019s comments about asylum seekers were problematic, while Trump\u2019s own tweet about \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d was \u201cseemingly racist.\u201d\nBut there is a matter of principle here, too: Did AOC\u2019s hesitation about criticizing a Trumpian play into the right\u2019s caricature of the \u201cprogressive left\u201d as a place where \u201ceveryone from Emma Goldman to Ta-Nehisi Coates has come out to support \u2018economic migrants\u2019\u201d? Because there are progressives who do support economic migrants, and there are others who think otherwise. As the Houston Chronicle reported this past weekend, \u201cDavid Bositis, a political scientist at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies who has long studied Venezuelan migration, said [mainstream\u2019s] new immigration rhetoric is on-brand, and reflects the fact that Houston and the state as a whole already have opened their doors to Hispanics.\u201d Oftentimes, the dispute at play is something that AOC would know, even if her critics don\u2019t.\nWatching Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore discuss immigration in their new film, Battle of the Sexes, provides further insight into the debate itself. De Niro, playing Billie Jean King, casts the debate in the context of the Women\u2019s Marches: It is hardly surprising that Battle of the Sexes was made at this particular moment in history, De Niro makes his point, the black dresses come off, the match is on, and he finishes by applauding a woman for pushing past the barriers of her time to battle sexism.\nBut Moore\u2019s Addie Schultz, King\u2019s younger sister, lingers in the background, saying the exact opposite of what King says about women\u2019s fighting spirits. Moore\u2019s Addie argues that the fight against inequality is being suffocated by sexism. In watching this scene, I sometimes wondered how King and De Niro knew each other so well, and this got me thinking about how the Democratic Party as a whole has articulated and framed opposition to Trump and the GOP for so long. When Hillary Clinton tried to frame her own anti-Trump argument early in the 2016 campaign, she introduced, with great flourish, a framing device that put Trump at the center of the fight and ignored any other issues: \u201cI believe you are worth what the highest and best employer in America is willing to pay. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to stand up for.\u201d She was arguing that Trump, in the midst of a booming economy, was undercutting American workers.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Head coach Jason Garrett of the Dallas Cowboys walks out of the field with running back Joseph Randle after the game against the Indianapolis Colts at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Monday, October 21, 2013.\nA previous version of this post contained wrong player statistics for Joseph Randle.\nIn the Cowboys' interest in evaluating a player, they always go back to that first impression.\nWhen looking at the top backfield prospects heading into April's NFL draft, it would be easy to name Ezekiel Elliott, Dalvin Cook and Ronald Jones II as the three early frontrunners. But for Dallas, the draft isn't just about finding a backup for Darren McFadden and hitting home runs when it comes to grabbing a player. If you're the Cowboys, you may have to settle for moderate hits to hit home runs.\nWith that in mind, here are grades for the three top prospects from Day 2 of the Scouting Combine.\nJoseph Randle, Running Back\nRandle wasn't taken until the fourth round of the 2013 draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. He was coming off a season in which he had 169 carries for 572 yards and five touchdowns. His size will likely scare some teams off of him -- he's listed at a reported 6-foot-1 and 231 pounds. But the junior standout isn't afraid to go for the big play.\nRandle ended the 2013 season with 101 carries for 676 yards and 11 touchdowns. He did have three games in which he didn't register a single carry. In those games, he tallied just 35 yards.\nUsing data from Pro Football Focus, we have shown two guys who were runners first (and not only a rusher) in their respective seasons in college. In this article, we are showing three backs who ended the 2013 season in the top run/pass balance in their draft class.\nRandle was a first team all-conference selection as a junior in 2013. After running for 260 yards on 45 carries in 2012, he was a top prospect in this draft class.\nOf course, he recorded some 2-yard dinks and dunks in 2014, and we showed why we don't all agree with this premise:\nAfter breaking the 100-yard rushing mark just once in 2013, Randle slipped down draft boards.\nAfter putting up 30 yards on 19 carries in the 2014 Cotton Bowl, Randle's stock took a dive.\nEven though he has some durability concerns, that could be something the Cowboys look at on draft day.\nESPN's Todd McShay is putting together a Rookie Projection Report for Ezekiel Elliott, while Steve Palazzolo of Pro Football Focus gives the running back high marks.\nFollow John Owning on Twitter: @JohnOwning\nWhat To Watch\nVainko, DuBose considered Day 2 prospects here.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Shield star returned to RAW after being in rehab for an undisclosed condition, but his stock took a major hit when he was attacked by The Demon Bobby Lashley earlier this month in the ring with Sister Abigail. Reigns\u2019 knee was put in severe pain and he limped around in the ring for the rest of the show as fans started to lose hope in his ability to perform. Lashley KO\u2019d him and then the WWE Universal Champion attacked his former best friend Seth Rollins, who has returned to the ring with a knee injury of his own. But now WWE seems to be building up to a vicious feud between the two men and giving Roman more incentive to leave his job in front of the RAW crowds.\nFormer WCW star David Otunga hinted this on Twitter, when he quoted a message from former NFL kick returner Devin Hester, who wrote: \u201cA lazy player only keeps your job around him but the player who performs will always be rewarded and let go.\u201d Otunga replied saying: \u201cIf you can work harder, you\u2019ll get paid more.\u201d This suggests that Roman will head over to SmackDown Live following the Superstar Shake-up this month and go up against Kurt Angle for the Universal Championship.

Last week the WWE Universe also lashed out at The Big Dog when they declared that Vince McMahon should fire the superstar after he turned on his best friend, which also happened last summer.

{"text": "Dubai: Shabab Al Ahli Dubai\u2019s ambitions of playing in the league, the Super 4, in early May are set to take a hit, given the NPL decision by the Dubai Football Association (DFA) to extend the duration of the National Premier League (NPL) season by eight days to May 2.\nThe Dubai Lions\u2019 and Al Ahli\u2019s seasons which were to finish on April 30 have been extended, meaning they now play two games back-to-back \u2014 April 26 and 27 \u2014 but, from a Shabab Al Ahli perspective, the stoppage in games will represent a significant hindrance. While the team has just two remaining games in the NPL \u2014 coupled with two match-day appearances for Al Nasr in the Namibia Premier League \u2014 Al Ahli\u2019s most recent league campaign is now set to end on May 2, which represents a situation both teams will be keen to avoid.\nShabab Al Ahli had to withdraw from the Super 4 with two games to go after Al Ahli, beaten by El Jaish, advanced to the final.

{"text": "HBO\nGame of Thrones season 7 is inching up in popularity and perhaps doing that by stoking some people's need to subscribe to HBO's streaming service HBO Now, according to a report.\nIn the past few days, the hit show has made top charts on Adobe Analytics' site, which provides data on people's shopping habits on Amazon, making it the site's top-ranked video streaming and viewing, the Hollywood Reporter reported Tuesday.\nThe report follows a Vanity Fair article about HBO's on-demand plans, which led to speculation that the network might merge with rival Netflix, which is already in a regulatory hunt to acquire some 21st Century Fox properties, to save its DirecTV Now streaming service from extinction.\nNow playing: Watch this: HBO Now adds Starz for April\nIf HBO goes through with the merger, subscriber numbers and a possible drop-off in Game of Thrones viewership might be behind the move. HBO, which is owned by Time Warner and is behind such hit shows as Silicon Valley and Veep, has seen the biggest ratings decline in its history for Game of Thrones. Meanwhile, Netflix's out-of-home viewership has been steadily increasing for its original series, including last month's Black Mirror Season 3.\nData analysis from Digital Content Ratings shows how popular Game of Thrones has been. It comes at a tough time for HBO. The show's eighth season, which starts April 14, might boost customers' interest in HBO Now, which was founded in 2014 but debuted with original content only in 2016. The Series Channels segment of the Digital Content Ratings data shows that the first two months of HBO Now has cannibalized HBO's overall viewership. This represents a major downgrade from HBO's video streaming viewership in 2016, a run-up in popularity that coincided with Time Warner's October 2015 merger with Warner Bros.\nBefore Game of Thrones season 7 premiered last month, HBO Now added Starz, which gives a whopping 30 million subscribers in the US. The move pushed HBO Now out of bottom half of HBO offerings and may have had a major impact on viewership in the short term.\nIn the past two weeks, though, the chart above shows fewer people than expected are using HBO Now. The demographic breakdown for HBO Now's most recent data shows its users are only 84 percent male, down from 89 percent in the previous data. HBO Now users younger than 35 may also be having an impact on the data, as audience members between 35 and 54 look to Game of Thrones for guidance in setting up their expectations and watching expectations.\nThe most recent data indicates HBO users are 75 percent male. That's down from 83 percent in the previous period, and 85 percent in January, according to Data from HBO Now. HBO's audience is more diverse than on other video streaming platforms, according to Nielsen's data.\nAlso different from previous HBO data, HBO Now's most recent numbers have fewer 18- to 34-year-olds than its HBO Go service, which has a higher percentage of these viewers. On HBO Go, 49 percent of its user base is older than 35. On HBO Now, 38 percent is over 35.\nHBO Now and HBO Go are part of Time Warner's overall media empire, which has been rocked by scandal. Last week, the company's HBO head Richard Plepler addressed criticism of its handling of allegations of sexual harassment by having a naked bathtub photo of Bill Clinton go viral.\nFollowing the show's sixth season, 20-year-old Max Spiers accused show cast members of \"sexual harassment\" and \"misogyny.\" He shared a series of screengrabs that went viral, allegedly from HBO personnel, revealing incidents he claimed took place between actors, writers and crew members. Another intern claimed she was pressured into putting on a show of undress when she was 17.\nThe allegations come as HBO's parent Time Warner announced a gender pay gap scandal involving the same age bracket, which was rounded up by a worker for The Hollywood Reporter.\nThe company was up 8 percent on Tuesday but is down 4 percent so far this year. That follows Time Warner's 10 percent decline in value in 2016.\nIt's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

Marchand also has scored on the Minnesota\u2019s home ice three times, both coming during the 2015 playoffs.\nThe former Wild prospect didn\u2019t score in Boston\u2019s 4-2 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday night in Game 2 of the clubs\u2019 first-round Stanley Cup playoff series. He knows his teammates\u2019 skill does the talking, though.\n\u201cI can\u2019t let the crowd intimidate me,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cI know my guys will be doing whatever they need to do to score or play well in front of me.\u201d\nThe hosts look like they\u2019ll start Game 3 on Friday night in similar circumstances.\nMinnesota won the first game in this rivalry-rich matchup in overtime, but shut out the Bruins in Game 2 for the first time since 1977.\nThat may explain why head coach Bruce Boudreau was so terse with his expectations of his team.\n\u201cJust you know, game 3,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cYou got Game 2 to win, then Game 4, you got to win two to take it, then Game 5 you get home, the road team gets home, whatever. \u201c\nMinnesota has a 6-3 career playoff record at home against Boston and even more history with the Bruins having not won on any of their trips to St. Paul.\n\u201cWe play them four more times,\u201d Wild winger Charlie Coyle said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fun series.\u201d\nAnd whether or not it is going to feature Marchand \u201cin the middle of the night, pounding on doors.\u201d\nBruins head coach Bruce Cassidy said his team is prepared to play again Friday after stirring rumors with media that Marchand could be benched.\nGeneral manager Don Sweeney said no lineup change was necessary for Game 3.\n\u201cI do believe we\u2019re better than that game,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cYou have to accept whatever fate lays in front of you and it may not be good, but I really think we came back in the game (Tuesday night) and competed.\u201d\nThe Wild might also feel better about Tuesday\u2019s win after pulling out in overtime in Boston despite a struggling goaltender, it seems.\nDevan Dubnyk, coming off a 5-1 loss at home to Minnesota on Sunday, looked more like himself against the Bruins, making 32 saves with a nice kick save on a deflection of Marchand\u2019s shot that appeared to give the Wild the lead in the third period.\nHe\u2019s making $7.5 million per season to keep Boston goaltender Tuukka Rask rested for the postseason. The Wild have a young goaltender in Alex Stalock, who will likely get the start Friday in net while Dubnyk is on the shelf.\n\u201cDubnyk did his job tonight,\u201d Saint Paul\u2019s Dumba said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve seen all year, though, he\u2019s been good for us.

In the process, the bikes are assigned a \"key'' that will never be used until the kids are ready to ride.\n\"We look for independence to develop, and bicycles are an equalizer,'' Bell said. \"Kids who are learning how to drive don't just get a new car; they also get a new bike. I really believe they are a second parent.\"\nBell said he couldn't imagine the real cost on the kids if they didn't get the bikes for free. \"I think of the kids who would have none of that,\" he said. \"I've always looked for ways to go back to the core of what this is all about. It's always about kids.\"\nLast week, Bell reported that in the past 24 hours there had been a couple of BB gun incidents in front of White Mountain Elementary School. \"We've heard someone throw bricks and bottles over the fence in front of the school,\" he said. \"We want to make sure those rocks and bottles don't ruin our kids' ride to school.\"\nBell said the United Way provides the kids who need them free bikes, a helmet and sometimes even enough money to purchase the lock. \"We teach them how to ride, provide them helmets and lock it to the back of the bike,'' he said. \"It's about independence. What a gift.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

In a matter of days, they moved from Arizona to Kansas City and within 24 hours had everything stolen.\nThe Hoffs relocated to Missouri last week to be closer to their daughter, Monica Hoffman, who lives in Missouri. That move happened all right in front of their front door.\n\u201cWhen I opened the door, (there was) police lights. The house was yellow and red (in) police tape,\u201d Monica Hoffman said.\nNearly $15,000 worth of paintings, electronics, jewelry and clothes were gone in as little as 24 hours.\n\u201cIt was literally an act of pure evil. It really was. It was absolutely meant to make us feel like we had no value at all,\u201d Monica Hoffman said.\nThe family moved quickly before work on Friday, packing everything they needed in six boxes.\n\u201cWhen we showed up and opened all the boxes, we didn\u2019t have any clothes or shoes or purses. That\u2019s when we were scared,\u201d Hannah Hoffman said.\nThe Hoffs bought some clothes and belongings Thursday but quickly realized it wasn\u2019t enough. They didn\u2019t want to leave the house without anything in their possession.\nWhen Monica received a phone call from a friend asking her to come pick up some of the stolen goods, she arrived to the house within 45 minutes and immediately called police.\n\u201cThey asked to see everything that was in the house and one by one showed everything that was taken,\u201d Hannah Hoffman said.\nShe returned later with an officer and spoke with a detective who took down a police report. A similar report was made the next day by a stranger the Hoffs had dealt with earlier.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely something that if something like this was going to happen, it should\u2019ve been as planned and organized and confidential and not in plain sight of anyone,\" Monica Hoffman said.\nThe Hoffs quickly realized the house wasn\u2019t all that was in tact. The cabinets in the kitchen were all made out of cardboard and had liquid egg in them. The most surprising discovery was the backyard fence.\n\u201cWe saw the entire inside of the fence ripped down and paint scattered everywhere,\u201d Hannah Hoffman said. \u201cWe were left with a hole in the fence and it\u2019s not right.\u201d\nWhile cleaning up, they found the 16-year-old son had moved some of his stuff too. The man who police have identified as \"Daniels Doe\" has a warrant out for his arrest. Detectives have his address and know where he lives, but so far they haven\u2019t been able to locate him.\nThe Hoffs have received a few checks from generous strangers and plan to buy replacement furniture. They do have insurance, but not enough to pay for anything else.\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no telling what we would\u2019ve lost. I\u2019m grateful to the Lord that he protected us and let us get the clothes and shoes, but I just can\u2019t imagine giving that back and knowing the stuff that was missing. I feel like someone with a deep, deep vendetta just took it. I mean, I hate even going there. I can\u2019t even believe that.\u201d\nThe Hoffs have vowed to send the people responsible for the crimes to hell.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fly above all of this and there\u2019s no matter what happens this house is going to be OK and my parents are going to be OK and the rest of us. Because we\u2019re going to get our stuff back and it\u2019s going to be ok. I can\u2019t let this stop me.\u201d\nAnyone with information about Daniels Doe's whereabouts is asked to call the Crime Stoppers TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477.\n", "label": "machine"}

I think it just protects residents. It protects the integrity of the city and I know at the time of the ordinance the gaming machines were a large part of our gaming industry,\" said Kearney.\nBy law, gambling machines cannot be placed within a one-thousand foot radius of an elementary school or within 150 feet of the city\u2019s central library.\n\u201cWe have dedicated big boxes and courtyards next to schools and courtyards to my kids school,\" said Germaine McDonnell, who frequents Rutter's in Landisburg.\n\"Those machines, they are not playing things on the Internet or gambling,\" said Megan Kolb, who lives in the area and frequents Rutter's.\nRutter\u2019s found out after they pulled out of state gaming, the state offered to pick up the bill for a mill levy.\nA law that Rutter\u2019s President and CEO, David Rutter told FOX43 he didn\u2019t think was fair to the company.\n\u201cIt was actually a very unfortunate outcome for us and our shareholders,\" said Rutter.\nA setback many feel could cost their businesses in the long run, if the lawsuit doesn\u2019t go their way.\n\u201cIt was a really difficult decision. We love all of our employees. We have had a great experience here but we just have to follow the tax law of Pennsylvania and that\u2019s what we\u2019re following. I don\u2019t think it will result in a long-term effect on us,\" said Smith.\nRutter\u2019s also has 29 locations in Pennsylvania, including facilities in New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "For years, Dallas homeowners were allowed to reduce the amount of gas coming into their homes by tampering with their gas meters.

{"text": "The Elder Scrolls: Blades is a very nice mobile game and nothing you'd describe as a video game. At least, I wouldn't, until I discovered some of the hidden loot.\nThe free-to-play Elder Scrolls mobile game launched on March 20 in the Android and iOS App Stores. It's not really a full-fledged game or anything, but a special solo adventure in The Elder Scrolls: Blades' new social universe.\nFrom Dust is the game's beginning, an exploration and quest, a story that explores how other dimensional worlds might expand in the future, echoing the original creation of Skyrim as a story that grows with your area. Your hero Tamriel is then sent off on a four-player quest, collecting creatures and items to upgrade armour. Also skins, which is, you know, a real thing in these things.\nTidying is a big part of this, being able to toss around a powerful weapon armour after a single battle but item after item is collected, able to be curbed by crafting. Throwing something into a tower is one mode of earning emeralds, the game's currency.\nA tower does nothing when you stick it in the ground.\nMost of The Elder Scrolls games have a heavy reliance on World Coins as well, a currency earned during combat or fetching items from various worlds. KingdomsCraft 3: Kingdoms for Cards has played an important role in creating Lego Worlds.\nAs such, The Elder Scrolls: Blades should be much easier to pick up.\nWrong.\nThe reason is a perk shown to players if they unlock items before their 30-day trial run through the game, a trial time that I was happy to enjoy before I found myself mucking up The Elder Scrolls: Blades' special city of Hellas, the game's hub.\nThrough engaging in various story and quest events, players are granted a chance to unlock a bounty, which is essentially a time earned by any item or ability within the game, bought using loot packs.\nEach player has their own bounty, which is carefully locked away in a special place until they become obligated to loot it or play a custom dungeon in a different world.\nI'd conquered four dungeons of Cthulu, so I'd go back to Hellas, fight another monster and retry the quest. Then I'd go somewhere else, do the same and earn my reward.\nHellas is a truly breathtaking social and questing hub.\nThis guy spends a night there.\nThe reward, which ranges in difficulty, goes up to 25,000 Elixir or treasure chests, though there's usually something in there for each player, like a public quest with an opportunity to be called in by a party leader or find a relic scattered about on enemy fields.\nYou can kill enemies and find treasure to upgrade you weapon to a level that allows you to swap a few features, but most were left untouched except for the barrel that steals everything.\nThis is a place where they store the items you can't have. They have to. There are nowhere else to keep them.\nThis was not how I set my game up for a first night.\nI would have spent at least an hour wandering in Hellas trying to find this barrel, hoping to upgrade my gear and discover all these new creatures. Until I found that barrel. Or at least this one.\nBy exploring the world during a special bounty phase the barrel seems to hide in plain sight. I raided shrines and fought monsters before being contacted and invited back to Hellas where I unlocked it. Then I had to loot it.\nGuys, I'd let you earn loot twice.\nThis is why weapons are made to be retailed.\nAfter I renovated the barrel I saw another barrel hidden just outside of Hellas, which can be unlocked after 25 scrolls of Emerald, though better numbers earn you more loot and nicer armour. At least this one is not locked away in an insurance facility. That would be a waste.\nWhy is it that nearly every world in my favourite three-hour Elder Scrolls game is made to be looted, second by second, always looking for treasure?\nIt's infuriating, like a regular MMO that is impossible to love because it has loot crates to occupy players for over an hour.\nThe Elder Scrolls: Blades wasn't bad, but it felt like a deeply disappointing port. With such a beautiful, if slightly slow, game it was something I could have lived without. Alas I missed out, too far away and unable to secure a weapon that would have doubled my already-excellent armour.\nIt was a small lesson for me in what it means to love a game. Many times I could have done without the pillaging. But I could never say no to loot.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "I saw the statements stating I would be receiving a $3,000 refund next year due to my tax returns in 2014 being underreported. Is there any truth to this?\nI recently read an article in the paper saying many people will be receiving a \u201crecovery tax credit\u201d for taxes paid in 2014. In this article I had assumed the tax preparer or bank had sent my income tax to the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) using the so-called \u201csalary-tax-recovery\u201d scheme. I can imagine that many people will be receiving this refund next year and once again the refund will exceed $3,000.\nThis refund can be issued if you did not correct any errors on your 2014 tax return. The CRA issues this refund to correct errors in the tax returns you have paid and they will deduct tax you would have paid had they received the correct tax forms from you. Once corrected the refund will be refunded directly to you with your full 2014 taxes received.\nWhile this option is usually not used very often, this is one of the ways CRA uses to lower their tax bill. It is interesting how they chose the \u201csalary-tax-recovery\u201d system since this can result in an overpayment in taxes for some people. Many people who actually file their taxes under the salary tax recovery system often find the tax form required for an exact refund is returned incorrectly to them.\nThey will then file a corrected return if necessary to return the refund. For years over $1.2 billion in refunds have been issued to people in Canada who filed their taxes correctly and correctly filled out the self-assessment tax forms (alternative self-assessment), but were provided the correct form.\nSince I was not providing you with any information on your 2013 tax return, it is unclear if you will receive a refund from the CRA for your 2013 income tax return. Even though it is not unusual for you to receive a tax refund from them in 2014 and 2017, they also have annual limits as to how much you can receive, so I would not count on it.\nHere are some other points that can be noted on your 2014 tax return:\n\u2022 Do make sure you are in compliance on all previous years as it is helpful to check yourself.\n\u2022 If you are now claiming these refundable tax credits because you filled out those forms correctly, but not on other tax forms, make sure you have a documented explanation of these credits on your 2014 tax return.\n\u2022 Check your employment status and if you became self-employed in 2014, you may have to complete a new employment income form and income tax return.\nIf you qualify for tax credits, be sure to complete a new income tax return at the beginning of the tax year to report any changes. The net result of these two steps can save you money on your income tax bill over the next several years.\nThis column, written and published by Scott Hannah is available to any registered individual tax professional.

He's \"the ultimate hybrid explorer,\" Fox said.\nHave you always been the type of person who wanted to experience the unexpected?\nYeah, growing up [in Marlow, England,] . . . always wanting to go farther than you could imagine. To get out of my comfort zone, to even do things you\u2019d never go near. And now that I\u2019m the captain of an American version of \u201cYour Army,\u201d I\u2019m now up close and personal with the U.S. military. We saw some men, and, with the technology that\u2019s available to us now, I\u2019ve got them to show us what goes on behind closed doors.\nSubscribe to the Entertainment newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nWhy this new collaboration with Netflix?\nNetflix has a huge library of amazing content. We really believe that this is an incredible opportunity to offer an authentic interaction with fans. . . . Every week we delve into something totally different from the pop culture equivalent of reality TV.\nFrom learning to shoot a bow and arrow to eating bugs to going down a well (or a hole, in some cases), how does each episode differ?\nSome episodes are tribal jungle trekking, some are jungles, some are mountain climbing. And then you\u2019ve got some of the most extreme creatures that the world has to offer, whether it\u2019s a tarantula, a scorpion, a great white shark. It\u2019s truly diverse and it\u2019s now reaching a whole new audience of really cool cool people.\nDo any of these challenges have a nail-biting element to them?\nYeah, everybody\u2019s always talking about how there\u2019s no pain in the show and everybody goes off the deep end. In some episodes, it\u2019s something as simple as wearing these gloves on your right hand, only to be attacked by a tiger. No pain and no gain, that\u2019s what the term is.\nHow does your background as a British Army officer benefit you?\nGet out of your normal comfort zone, get a different perspective on what is normal, and then you realize that the good thing is we\u2019re actually mentally relaxed. You learn to listen and take in information \u2014 and you learn to adapt, every single step of the way. It keeps you alive in the wilderness.\nOne of my favorite clips is one where you and Andy Buckley go down a well together. What were the challenges down there?\nWe went in it once with rappel ropes, but it didn\u2019t really work out for us because Laura\u2019s already in my web of phlegm now and Andy\u2019s hobbling around on his belly. He found the pathway, and then he ended up in the water . . . You\u2019ve got to buckle your seat belt. Everyone wants to go with the flowing food. That\u2019s not the best place to be. It was a fun thing to do, actually.\nYou live in Southern California. Is the Long Island wildlife getting old?\nI think there are still some amazing animals that can be found along the entire West Coast and New York City. Some real incredible creatures that I\u2019ve seen, and I wouldn\u2019t have understood them if it weren\u2019t for the camera and my own body language to kind of show that these animals don\u2019t follow physical boundaries, they don\u2019t follow the local understandings . . . I think that they\u2019ve had some generations in that corner, but there\u2019s still some right around, especially in our warm weather months, for sure.\n", "label": "machine"}

The legislation also requires that users have to consent to receive marketing messages on other platforms, and is stricter on requests for traffic data \u2013 requiring users to consent before companies are allowed to monitor that traffic.\nWith data privacy so high on the public agenda, changes to the law have been brewing since late 2012 \u2013 and that was in response to scrutiny from the European Court of Justice on a failed attempt to put a stop to companies tracking and collecting so-called \u201cinformation exhaust\u201d \u2013 the sum of all information that computers throw out after a certain amount of time of online surfing.\nAfter a nine-hour debate, the parliament finally decided on Tuesday to go ahead with three changes to the original legislation: adding a right for users to protect personally identifiable information, give and receive notice at the beginning of a new service and a requirement that companies erase all user data once a service is stopped.\nThe Parliament also created the Fair Privacy Bill of Rights to hammer out a consolidated standard of Internet privacy, which the Council of the European Union plans to adopt in November \u2013 four months before the law goes into effect in January 2014.\nIn the meantime, the EU\u2019s information commissioner has expressed optimism that the various bills will improve the legal landscape for privacy protection in the European Union.\n\u201cThe legislative proposal of this week marks a new step forward in the protection of Internet users\u2019 data, which shall be protected in the EU when they avail themselves of services offered on the Internet,\u201d said EU Information Commissioner Viviane Reding. \u201cWe are paving the way to create a Digital Single Market which guarantees an unbundled, competitive market and strong protection of Internet users\u2019 data.\n\u201cAt a time when so many activities on the Internet touch upon personal data, it is clear that future legislative work will involve harmonizing the interpretation of law and new approaches to protection of personal data,\u201d Reding added. \u201cThe European Commission is committed to working closely with the Parliament and the Council in order to ensure the effective implementation of the digital single market and to ensure effective and sufficient privacy and security of data protection.\n\u201cThis new proposal also gives new rights to individual citizens to protect their personally identifiable information,\u201d Reding continued. \u201cI hope that these rights will be reflected in the Privacy Regulations adopted in the second phase of the legislative project. I also welcome the ambition of the European Parliament to continue the legislative work on enhancing the current jurisdiction of national data protection authorities.\u201d\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "sport, local-sport, sam jo, barmera, dr. daniel muir, wagga, leeton-whitton, leeton, wagga co-coach, chris morgan\nA scan on Brierly-Christ Church export Daniel Muir's collarbone will determine the full extent of his shoulder injury. Muir's season is in doubt following an accidental injury in Leeton-Whitton's 21-12 win over the Saints on Sunday. On-field doctors and other medical staff attended to the 23-year-old on the sidelines and Muir will undergo scans in the coming days to determine the extent of the injury. Without Muir at the Blues' Coo-Celly Oval, Wagga co-coach Chris Morgan co-captained the club. While Morgan and captain-coach Dan McDonald couldn't do much more to help, Muir's absence was felt by a significant margin. With Leeton-Whitton coach Craig Mellington away playing in Queensland, the Ty Barker-led Blues were the more physical side as they hung on for the upset victory. \"We didn't really have any chance if he couldn't go, he takes enormous time on the ball,\" Morgan said. \"We got some good looks at it but, it was touch and go. He touched it and it's one of those that's do or die. It's like a car crash, you just have to hope it's crash and not someone going down.\" The Blues did rely on some late heroics to hold on. Backrower Tom Welch was T-W's best player, an efficient attitude which won plenty of praise from Morgan. \"He is the reason we're here and you need that in defence, your little link men,\" he said. \"If they're being sick of a stop-start game, he has been the go-to guy. It's effort, it's effort and more effort but if that's what it takes to compete it, that's what we need and I've got to give him all the credit in the world.\" Despite Muir's injury, the Blues turned things around after a solid first half to power home. Muir made six tackles in the opening half, including two key fourth quarter tackles when the Blues had given up an early try. In the Dogs' 15th minute score, TJ Cordy intercepted a pass with 16 minutes left and then went in untouched. However, Leeton-Whitton held firm and Hodge with just a minute to go with Huberth Morriagi and Josh Les Jr to hand over the game winner. 'When you're in a bit of a slugfest, especially with our opponent, it's those days when we need the middle ... it was the opposite in a lot of our games this year, the middle fell away. \"The Bulldogs had plenty of midfield pressure, and we didn't respond. We talked about it at half-time and the third quarter and it was the same difference.\" Leeton-Whitton's turnaround after trailing 7-3 was credit to captain-coach Mellington and his players, much of which has been forgotten over the past month. Morgan believes the Dogs weren't as strong as they were in the first half. \"They probably beat us up early in the second half but they played really, really, clean footy. 'M' wasn't the best in the first half, he was probably better at the last but we need a lot of that out of him going forward.\" READ MORE\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/8tYDWUpBiaA8SfdG6xkddz/cd7ad16b-d19b-4bd8-afec-5e733a754070.jpg/r9_188_3439_2204_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

Salmon has been the star performer this season, clocking 14.61 seconds at the Gibson McCook Relays in February while Thompson's personal best of 13.66 seconds at the King's House Invitational in February was just two seconds behind the World Junior champion.\nSalmon and Thompson are joined by 200m sprinter Simone Facey, who won a gold medal at the recent ISSA Boys and Girls' Championships, and schoolboy sprinter Kevon Gordon, both of whom are expected to challenge for spots in the coveted Class One 100m and 200m relays at the Champs.\nEdwin Allen will have four other contenders for spots in the 400m relays. Tamara Smith and Miguel Francis will compete in Class Three, along with Kamau Smith in Class Two, and Catherine O'Neil in Class One.\nKamau and Francis will have the task of reviving Edwin Allen's Class Two and Class One 400m relay program which have faltered badly over the last couple of seasons.\nEdwin Allen now has the talent to defend their title for the third straight year, but before then, they will rely on having their entire squad overseas.\nOther schools expected to compete at the Penn Relays include St Jago High, who will have reigning World Junior 400m champion Jaheel Hyde among their ranks.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was stepping down on Monday, the White House said, a move the administration was already fortifying with the nomination of a new deputy that will likely trigger a change in the top three ranks of its Homeland Security team.\nNielsen had faced mounting criticism for the Trump administration\u2019s handling of a February migrant family separation crisis at the border. Under continued pressure, she offered her resignation several weeks ago, only to have President Donald Trump reverse course to keep her on board.\nOfficials said Monday that Nielsen would remain on the job until Trump has a successor. His team will begin preparing for the transition.\nTrump\u2019s proposed budget for the Justice Department earlier this year suggested more than $1 billion in cuts to the Department of Homeland Security, including the Border Patrol and its officers, ICE and its agents, CBP and other security assets, aviation assets and maritime assets, ports of entry and other assets. Some of the proposed cuts have since been reduced.\nTrump tweeted his praise for Nielsen, who often appeared taken aback by the controversy stirred up by his administration.\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that Kirstjen Nielsen is being nominated as our new Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Kirstjen has done an outstanding job and we are lucky to have her!\u201d Trump tweeted.\nTensions built between Trump and Nielsen after she ordered an end to family separations at the border in June. Instead, the policy produced tearful reunions and reports of traumatized children being sent away from parents. Trump later reversed course after an uproar.\nNielsen\u2019s replacement will bring considerable executive experience to the role. Homeland Security confirmed Monday it was backing Matthew Orwig, who served as undersecretary of Defense for policy in the first Bush administration.\nNielsen has faced criticism for both her handling of family separations and her public optimism as a child migrant crisis unfolded in the U.S. during her first months in office.\nIn her resignation letter, Nielsen said she was making the move with a heavy heart and \u201cgreat reluctance.\u201d Nielsen said she looked forward to continuing to partner with the president \u201cto ensure all those in our nation\u2019s care are protected and well cared for.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Over its objections to a proposal to raise the passing mark for secondary school students\u2019 graduation exams from 50 per cent to 65 per cent, the Opposition United Conservative Party says it\u2019s willing to reintroduce the idea.\nEducation Minister David Eggen originally introduced the original Bill 62 on the floor of the legislature in February as part of an effort to restore educational equity across Alberta, namely by increasing to 65 per cent the mark needed to graduate high school students from Alberta high schools.\nThen in March, after public backlash, he altered the bill to raise the passing mark to 50 per cent, and keep other provisions in the bill intact, such as preventing children as young as 13 from seeking public health care as part of their medical medical examination and requiring teachers to report alleged bullying to authorities.\nThe government has said it will consult Albertans on the finer points of the proposed changes and introduce a final version in the next few months.\nYet the bill, which must go through another reading and an NDP government vote, had already been given a public airing at public hearings. So while the amendments to the original bill have now been made, the UCP says it\u2019s willing to return to the legislature if it doesn\u2019t work out in the provincial government\u2019s favour.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard concerns,\u201d UCP education critic Sophia Mehra said. \u201cThis is an equity bill, and so it\u2019s not acceptable to only leave in the bill some pieces of legislation that we feel are not in the best interest of students \u2026 There are also some pieces of the bill that directly will make matters worse for young children, because they are unnecessary.\u201d\nMehra said the UCP made its initial proposal in the house so it could provide a legislative alternative. But it won\u2019t go back to give its amendment a hearing in the legislature if the government tables its final version of the bill in the coming months, she said.\nMehra said the UCP will likely return with its initial proposal if it believes the government amendments have made the bill \u201cunworkable\u201d for school boards and students.\nJason Sabourin, spokesperson for the UCP, said the government doesn\u2019t necessarily have to go back to drafting legislation as it does have the power to add to the bill amendments that it wants.\n\u201cWe would be willing to consider going back to the drawing board,\u201d Sabourin said. \u201cWe just need to let them know that if their bill really is so bad that they have to ask us, then they better craft it better.\u201d\nCody Willard, NDP member of legislature for Calgary-Elbow, called the UCP\u2019s original proposal \u201can all-party statement of opposition\u201d that the Tory government considered so offensive to popular opinion it modified the bill in March.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stand for anything,\u201d Willard said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see an opportunity to move the ball forward and provide a better alternative \u2026 (They) only wanted to highlight the divisions.\u201d\nWillard said the NDP had made its point of proposing the new graduation exam plan but maintained it\u2019s important to repair an education system that is widely perceived to be unfair across Alberta.\nAlberta Teachers\u2019 Association president Bruce Roberts said Monday he has been encouraged that the NDP appears ready to listen to feedback on Bill 62.\nRoberts said while he is happy with the changes to the original Bill 62, he believes the province\u2019s education minister still has the authority to seek advice from school boards and teachers on the finer points of the issue.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see a lot of people being happy with what\u2019s coming down the pike \u2014 particularly to the students \u2014 so I don\u2019t think that we should be presuming things are going to be OK unless we can prove they are not,\u201d Roberts said.\nAmber Abela, chairwoman of the Alberta Public School Boards Association\u2019s school leader and school accountability committee, said her group welcomes the government\u2019s intention to revamp a bill that has caused \u201cgreat division\u201d in society.\nBut as chief executive of the local Parent Centres of Alberta, Abela said she is worried about the long-term implications if the government does move ahead with Bill 62 changes, including whether schools will be able to certify their students\u2019 admission to Grade 12 without triggering a passing rate of 65 per cent.\n\u201cA higher percentage of students may graduate, and if that rate is 65 per cent, then that could have a significant impact on the student population that we serve,\u201d Abela said.\n\u2022 Email: mharris@postmedia.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The father who tossed his 4-year-old daughter off a bridge, killing her, as she cried and screamed is a convicted sex offender.\nA Florida judge on Tuesday ruled 39-year-old Frederick Tyree was guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his then-4-year-old daughter, Aliyah.\nIn making the ruling, St. Petersburg Circuit Judge Daniel Porter accepted Tyree's confession to police, which came after he held down his daughter's face so her breathing would stop and threw her off the bridge in December 2017.\n\"Your daughter deserves justice,\" Porter told him in court.\nHe immediately remanded Tyree into custody.\nFrederick Tyree Admits to Killing 4-Year-Old Daughter With Toss Over Bridge\nFrederick Tyree admitted to killing his 4-year-old daughter Aliyah with a throw from the Sunshine Skyway Bridge on Dec. 14, 2017. Now that he has admitted the crime, what is his next step? (Published Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2017)\nProsecutors said the case was a violent case of \"disgraceful abandonment.\"\nIt began before Aliyah's birth in January 2013, when Frederick, a bricklayer, told his wife he \"couldn't take anymore\" from his wife, Ranae Tyree, she told police investigators.\nIn the summer of 2013, Frederick gave Aliyah to his mother, who told police he'd previously been a violent drunk and impregnated her. A battle ensued, and Frederick eventually \"blacked out\" and left Aliyah with his sister, Ranae told police.\nRanae told detectives that she never suspected Frederick would hurt Aliyah, her second child and only daughter. She called Frederick \"monster\" and said Aliyah was \"strong as a bull.\" She said she was \u201cdistraught\" but never asked Frederick to return the child.\nBut Frederick took Aliyah to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in December 2017, according to court records. He told his wife to stay in the van, then gave Aliyah an ice pick, which he used to hit her a couple of times. Ranae said her husband admitted to her that the ice pick \"was to kill Aliyah.\" Ranae took Aliyah to a hospital, where she later died of trauma to her head.\nAuthorities say Frederick took Aliyah to the Skyway Bridge and threw her onto Highway 231. That's where he told police he took Aliyah's body, which he'd buried in a hole at his aunt's house. The next day, he said, he dumped her body with his mother in a ditch.\nFrederick asked his mother to come get him, police said. Hours later, Frederick called police to report Aliyah missing. Police investigators then found Frederick at the scene of the crime, with his clothing covered in Aliyah's blood.\nInvestigators interviewed Frederick several times, with his demeanor \"startlingly calm.\"\nHe told detectives that Aliyah \u201cwas a lot bigger than I\u2019m comfortable with,\u201d but he wasn't concerned as she lay injured. He told them Aliyah complained of a \"sore throat.\" Frederick said he didn't think her condition would cause her to die.\nTyree told police he had confronted Aliyah's mother over a briefcase he'd kept at the home, but he didn't have \"nothing he wanted from her,\" according to the detectives' notes.\nHe said he killed his daughter after the girl \"started acting like a grown up.\"\nFrederick was convicted in November of lewd and lascivious molestation and battery. Prosecutors will have the opportunity to recommend a punishment range, from 10 years to life.\nProsecutors have said they will not ask for the death penalty in the Aliyah's murder.\n\u201cWe are satisfied with the verdict, and recognize that the jury was a difficult one to reach,\u201d Pinellas County State Attorney Andrew Warren said. \u201cWe hope that they go through the process again to find a reasonable sentence that allows Freddie to atone for his actions while making it right for Aliyah\u2019s mother.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

Image Credit:\nProducer Ronnie Screwvala has said his stance on sexual harassment in the Indian film industry has not changed following complaints against director Apoorva Lakhia.\nLakhia has been accused of molesting actor Darshan Kumaar, in a case reported by Mumbai tabloid Mid-Day.\nKumaar has maintained that he was harassed during the shoot of a music video, which was being shot in Mumbai.\nLakhia responded to the allegations on Friday by saying that he will seek legal recourse for violating the contract of a brand he was associated with as an associate creative director. He also accused Screwvala of representing the interests of a film company owned by his wife, Vani Kapoor.\nThe director said: \"Had I known this was going to happen, I would have been wary and not made it to Mumbai. Lakhia Films is a small company with only 11 people. I do not have the resources and with this I and my team will finally complete B.R. Chopra's dream.\"\nFollowing the allegations, Screwvala said he stands by Lakhia but has not approached the Indian Media and Entertainment Association (IMEA) or the Maharashtra Censor Board for any intervention.\n\"In 2009, I made headlines by being the first producer to do something about sexual harassment. Whether Apoorva Lakhia faces a similar outcome, I do not know. I think he will have to take this on himself with his wife. But I stand by my stand,\" he said in a statement.\nHe said he had written an open letter to actors then on a platform like Facebook.\nThe agreement between Lakhia Films and B.R. Chopra Advertising is attached to the complaint that has been submitted with the Mumbai police and informed the police that Lakhia had directed his staff to take inappropriate pictures of Kumaar during the shoot.\nKumaar has alleged that the director touched him inappropriately and actually grabbed his crotch twice.\nThe police, however, have not registered an FIR.\nSince then, Screwvala has advocated for opening up film industry for women to file complaints on sexual harassment.\nMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had recently suggested an independent body with the mandate to probe sexual harassment, similar to the Bill passed in the US Senate.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Hellboy was rebooted into a movie that celebrated Neil Gaiman's iconic graphic novel series (while being painfully aware of the fact that fans of the original movies were probably in for a treat) and retained the subtle, funny references to BPRD and other paranormal horror stories. It was a weirdly wonderful movie, but it didn't have the freshness of the original.\nHellboy: The Final BPRD (Netflix) is a sequel that refreshes, rather than broadens, the canon, and that, in addition to being devoid of Neil Gaiman, is only marginally better than its predecessor.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nThe movie picks up with the bard-in-peril at the end of the last movie. Ron Perlman's Big Red \u2013 now in a rather over-the-top prosthetic wig with extra tattoos and gills \u2013 is on the run with the BPRD, who are mainly pissed off with him for whatever reasons.\nTim Blake Nelson's Nick Blood is more on board, having converted himself to the cause. He runs his own BPRD training academy in the tropical island hell \u2013 which is named after Hellboy himself \u2013 and tries to bring the returning loner together with the team of plucky ruffians.\nThe world is too messed up to rely on the BPRD to ensure order \u2013 pneumatic tyres, concrete, lightning and a bed bug plague are thrown around like candies, one of which Tulip is told is actually made from human brain matter.\nThe BPRD arrives in the form of Andrzej Sapkowski, an eye-patch wearing anagram who reveals that Hellboy was exiled from the land of the living because of his God-like powers. He went along to the city of San Francisco to return his knapsack to Hell before the beast was restored to goodness, and has turned BPRD agents into fringe cult heroes to star in his own monthly comics.\nIt's Peter Jackson who steps back in as our guide on our journey to Hell. The filmmaker behind The Lord of the Rings, King Kong and more shakes off his mid-career dalliance with Dolittle-style project marketing by introducing us to the character of Professor Broom, the gun-toting man in the muscle suit who was last seen assembling the crazy BPRD team and trying to convince Hellboy to join him.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nThe Monster-creature we meet in our brief encounters with Hellboy is one of Professor Broom's creations \u2013 made of rogue elements from San Francisco's sewers. He's a terrifying proto-Little Monster \u2013 but his power level is much higher than normal cavemen's, running to the stratosphere at speeds of 1,000mph.\nThat weapon-dyed shit monster is calling himself Ragnarok (the Norse god who leads the fallen giants to Glastonbury), and he's got a fiery axe he likes to abuse before going off and crushing everything that stands in his way. That's right \u2013 Hellboy is now the most powerful monster ever created and eventually gets some of the minds on the new team on board.\nTim Blake Nelson plays well alongside Hellboy's other new teammates: slacker Japanese bombshell Yoshida (Ken Watanabe), bumbling transvestite (Toby Kebbell) and neurotic tough guy Niles Caulder (Ian McShane). None are more of an undercooked supporting cast than the intrepid Vivienne (Mia Kirshner), who's underused in particular in the movie's climax.\nFrankly, there's a script problem at play here \u2013 the inside jokes of the first movie have given way to homogeneity. There's a lack of one-liner comedy, a lack of dark comedy and a lack of opportunity for the weird, psychedelic fun that defined the original films.\nThere's also an issue that holds the film back: fans of the original might go for this, or they might pass, but some may be put off by the fact that the movies never seem to want to go anywhere. All of the characters have their vulnerabilities that can be leavened \u2013 Nero, Grandpa Cakeman, Julie \u2013 and there's a few nice intimate bits here too.\nBut Hellboy: The Final BPRD has no desire to really leave the grasp of its past incarnation. It prefers to revel in Hellboy's status as a cult figure rather than connect to and parody the legacy of the original Hellboy.\nBut it leaves us with a hollow optimism and a lot of pent-up questions \u2013 like how can a demon exist in a world that needs him so desperately?\nGood question.\n4\nWatch the first Hellboy movie on Netflix right now.\n", "label": "machine"}

His top lieutenants appeared to align themselves with the bill.\nStory Continued Below\nBut by Monday, they had all switched course.\nOver the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney demanded the government halt new refugee admissions in coming weeks. They blamed the Democratic-led House for forcing the agency to take action in the first place.\nThe Homeland Security Department on Monday suddenly announced it would stop taking new applications for legal immigrant visas until Oct. 1, citing claims of \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d media coverage of the issue. Administration officials on Sunday and Monday also slammed Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for not coming to the table.\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nAnd as all this was unfolding, Trump led a high-level meeting at the White House on Monday to begin discussing his long-awaited proposal on an immigration deal. More than a dozen Republican lawmakers flew to Washington to help shape the plan.\nEven there, the president said little. He did not announce specific demands for the proposal, instead directing DHS and OMB to work through legislative approaches by Tuesday. The fact-finding session concluded with a huddle with members of his Cabinet and senior White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly.\nUltimately, officials said no one emerged with specific ideas to advance the proposal. And the plan itself remains unclear.\n\u201cThe president had three types of proposals,\u201d Kelly told reporters after the White House meeting. \u201cI think the president prefers a wall, I think he prefers physical barriers, I think he prefers some kinds of interior enforcement, some kind of guest-worker programs.\u201d\nPressed on the details of Trump\u2019s proposal, Kelly demurred: \u201cYou should ask him that. I just don\u2019t feel like coming up here in public the way this is being done does us any good.\u201d\nFor Republican members of Congress who last week flooded the White House with ideas for a package \u2014 and who now face an unexpected demand by the president to move the immigration needle \u2014 they were mired in confusion.\n\u201cMike Pence said in a recent interview that he'd see the president every day on immigration. This is not helping him or us,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who hosted a meeting with the White House on immigration last week. \u201cI'm sorry, but we need the president\u2019s advice and guidance and leadership on this.\u201d\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the administration was \u201cnot helpful at all.\u201d\n\u201cHere we are trying to sort out something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the President backs off on what he was saying a week ago. It\u2019s painful.\u201d\nSen.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) added. \u201cBut I also appreciate the unity among Republicans who agree that we don\u2019t agree on these two issues.\u201d\nBut other Republicans suggested a more cynical reading of Trump\u2019s latest maneuver.\nRep.

The key task for scientists, politicians and citizens is to confront the evidence before us and to unite behind a strategy that the world can unite against. There are solutions, policies and laws around the world that are working \u2013 but only if our collective will is united against them. We must all play our part to collectively focus all our efforts on these solutions, but at the same time face the reality that science is only one part of the system, and other key organisations \u2013 such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Geneva conventions \u2013 are based on other principles.\nDr Roger Cohen Researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development and member of the International Committee of the Red Cross\n\u2022 There is a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in understanding how we can prevent damage to the Earth system from climate change and biodiversity loss, according to Frances Crook in her letter.

The umbrella term for climate change is now \u201cclimate-induced\u201d impacts on biodiversity. The implications for conservation are incalculable. No one \u201cmoves heaven and earth\u201d to prevent biodiversity loss, human or otherwise. For example, 26,000 people die each year from malnutrition and lack of adequate nutrition, and the annual figure is expected to rise sharply in the 21st century due to climate change, hunger and related causes such as war and rising air pollution. Even though food production capacity is a valued resource, the carbon dioxide emitted by food waste in India, China and the UK alone is currently equal to deforestation in Mexico.

{"text": "DHAKA: A raging drug war in Myanmar is set to dominate talks with Bangladesh on Saturday as both sides review details of the first corridor that extends a swathe of countries over land to the Bay of Bengal.\nThe talks will take place at a joint Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and Border Guard Police (BGP) headquarters where there was silence in the corridors Friday as preparations were made to host the East West Road Economic Cooperation meeting.\nThe region, where drug dealers from Myanmar and drug addiction is rife, had been put into the spotlight by Bangladesh\u2019s vow to close it down before the end of June, 2018, a target which has been repeatedly missed since gaining traction in September last year.\n\u201cApart from drug trafficking, the biggest worry is to deal with human traffickers who are taking people from Myanmar to Pakistan,\u201d a BGB source involved in the process told Arab News.\n\u201cHeroin is also hard to come by in Bangladesh. We find it everywhere in the region,\u201d the source said.\nAccording to the government, according to international reports, some 3,000 Rohingyas have been killed in the ongoing crackdown.\nBangladesh currently has a commitment of 6,000 police men and 58,000 Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel manning more than 700 checkpoints along the entire border.\nOver 7.5 million people live in this four-island country, nearly 60 percent of them below the age of 18. Soaring poverty and drug addiction have a myriad implications for the already burdened government resources.\nThe biggest challenge to the security apparatus is the influx of Rohingya refugees living at the border. While BGB areas are supposed to take care of the Rohingyas, the cost has far exceeded the economic and social situation of the country, said police officials.\nThe locals are also skeptical about whether the Rohingyas living at the border are sincere in their desire to find safety and a better future.\nRanjan Batterjee, a taxi driver based in Bangladesh\u2019s border city of Rajshahi, told Arab News: \u201cAlthough the government is carrying out a number of development projects along the border, there are places where the land mafia don\u2019t stop violating customs and are taking advantage of the situation.\u201d\nThe Rohingyas have migrated to Bangladesh in large numbers since late June 2017.\nThe enormous problems faced by the security apparatus are largely linked to the drug trafficking problems along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border.\nYahya Akhter, a Dhaka-based political analyst and writer, said: \u201cThe fact that our local security agencies had failed to keep out traffickers within the country, in spite of close cooperation and coordination between the two countries, cannot be ignored. This gap opened the way for smuggling of drugs and human trafficking to neighboring countries.\u201d\nAt present Bangladesh stands at the middle of the drug war in Myanmar, and stands as one of the biggest casualties of the trade.\n\u201cMyanmar uses a lot of these men to help in its \u2018janmabhoomi\u2019 (headquarters) from their side of the border,\u201d a US State Department official told Arab News.\n\u201cThis serves as a big obstacle for us to be able to effectively manage the problem in areas bordering Bangladesh,\u201d he said.\nFormer minister Sadeq Ullah Khan is of the view that nearly 2,500 commandos dispatched from Dhaka to train border guards will be able to gather enough intelligence to tackle the problem.\n", "label": "machine"}

Three people were wounded in shootings, and another person was injured in a stabbing.\nThe most recent shooting was reported about 3:10 p.m. near the Kennedy. A 24-year-old man was walking in the far right lanes of the Kennedy when he heard shots and felt pain in his side and back, according to police.\nHe was taken to Stroger in stable condition, police said.\nAbout a half-hour earlier, a 27-year-old man was standing on the sidewalk in the 9900 block of South Carpenter Street in the West Garfield Park neighborhood when a gray SUV drove past and someone inside fired shots, police said. He sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where his condition was stabilized.\nEarlier, a 29-year-old man was shot in the buttocks on the interstate near 80th Street, but was able to walk to a nearby hotel, where he was taken to Stroger. In the other shooting, a 57-year-old man was walking in the 4700 block of South Halsted Street in the Grand Crossing neighborhood when someone shot him in the chest about 2:45 p.m. and took off on foot, police said. He later arrived at Stroger in stable condition.\n", "label": "machine"}

(Photo: AFP | File)\nThe president\u2019s powers have become increasingly onerous since Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who took office in 2014, swept to power in a military takeover after mass protests against the Muslim Brotherhood. His successor, as commander in chief of the armed forces, controls both the executive and the judicial and security bodies which include the country\u2019s military, police and general intelligence services.\nCriticised by the European Union, the United States and human rights watchdogs, the new decree extends the timescale for the presidential term by almost a decade to 10 years.\nThe new document also makes sweeping changes to Egypt\u2019s electoral law, giving the military, prosecutors and courts the power to decide whether to dissolve electoral alliances and parties.\nSisi\u2019s allies have defended the decree as a justified defence of state power, noting the new president has only one year left to serve, leaving an opportunity for him to lead Egypt for the next 10 years.\nCritics see the decree as a further consolidation of Sisi\u2019s rule, which has coincided with a crackdown on freedom of expression, a return to closed rule, and rising discontent.\n\u201cThe decree will give Sisi the time he needs to set the foundations for his third term as president without any other potential contenders,\u201d said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, an Egyptian columnist.\nControversies have piled up in the West over Egypt, with rights groups accusing security services of human rights abuses and NATO members, like the United States, uneasy with the new leader who rode to power in 2013 ousting president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.\nSisi accuses the Brotherhood of plotting to topple him, and has arrested thousands of its members, including three ex-presidential hopefuls, under a law that gives the security services a free hand to detain people for 72 hours without charge.\nSome Western nations are now looking to re-engage with the government under the new electoral law, in part to avoid risks from the Muslim Brotherhood, but the long-term response from the Western community is still unclear.\n\u201cSisi inherited a bad situation. The parliamentary election showed the public that they wanted change,\u201d political commentator Mohammed al-Gamal said.\n\u201cEgyptians made a decision that they are ready to change the current status quo in exchange for stability and that they want him to have more time to deal with the issue.\u201d\nLong tenure\nEgyptians went to the polls to vote in a parliamentary election in March 2015, when no presidential candidate openly announced his or her candidacy, but seven parties were formed and Sisi said he would stand as a party and campaign.\nHowever, he failed to win a simple majority and faced a runoff election against his opponent, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, in October 2015, when he was re-elected in a landslide.\nA presidential election was called that December, but the electoral law was changed to bar the political participation of anyone who had held public office before 2012. He did not run.\nThe new statute allows an individual who had held public office before the presidential election in 2013 to run, but for this to happen there is a condition that the president be elected at least once before.\nThe country\u2019s top electoral body can end party participation after three general elections, four municipal elections and six presidential elections.\nControversy also over recent laws that removed some checks on the security services, including the formation of commissions to oversee the rules for police work and the election laws.\nA recent amendment to the elections laws also changed the rules around voter turnout, which were originally intended to preserve the best interests of the population. The amendment now states that if fewer than 50 percent of voters turn out for an election, then none of the votes cast will be considered valid.\nCritics worry that the new constitution, passed in 2015, could do away with the possibility of a clear free election, thereby curbing civil liberties.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "news, local-news, cbb, manly, newcastle, hunter, Knights, injury list, team\nThe third slap from Clive Churchill Medal winner Chris Heighington was the last straw for the Knights to come unstuck in the 44-18 belting at the hands of Manly on Sunday. Four tries to 18-man comeback kings Clint Gutherson, Nathan Figallo, Peta Hiku and Amos Roberts inside the opening 24 minutes put the game beyond the Knights before half-time and turned all their energy to get the score back to match-point at the break. For the most part, the Knights looked like a group of players who had not had a hit out for four weeks before Sunday's clash. They answered some of their critics with a strong second half performance, but the fact the loss felt much worse at the final siren means the questions about their handling will not stop anytime soon. \"I can\u2019t defend our effort which was pretty poor,\" Heighington said. \"At least twice in the second half I thought we had things where we were controlling the game and looking like we were going to go over. We just couldn\u2019t finish it off and Manly had too much of a run. All credit to Manly today but we were just off with the decision making and outwork. \"We tried to play positive footy but we won\u2019t have a shot at being the top side until we put it in the right places more often. \"It was tough to take that most as we had just got ourselves back in the race for the six. I thought we gave it a shot, just not smart enough with the decisions for the two points. \"Up until that point, we still wanted to win as we got ourselves close but we couldn\u2019t finish it off. We had too many poor decisions and that\u2019s why it got away from us.\u201d Like last week's horror result at the hands of the Eels, coach Nathan Brown's decision to move Jack Cogger to prop up in his favoured lock position from hooker and move Cameron Ciraldo to centre paid off with his first try of the season. But Cogger's outing in the No 7 jersey should not be misunderstood as the longer term solution at lock. While he started brightly up the middle, dropping a high ball after a dropped Stu Hindmarsh bomb, he spent most of the afternoon in the forwards playing second fiddle to David Klemmer. The size difference between Klemmer and the 160-centimetre Cogger means the move makes sense at some stage given both have big and athletic edges to their game. Klemmer scored one of Newcastle's two tries when he accelerated from dummy half on 25 minutes to race 55 metres and pass to Ciraldo, who scored. Ciraldo claimed the Knights shouldn't have lost that match but was satisfied with the effort against Manly. \"We didn't throw the ball around enough today,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it's a one-off for our forwards and not the rest of the team. From the [last] Newcastle game, there was some really good stuff coming off the back of it. The forwards really stepped up and started to lay a solid platform for us and we gave ourselves a chance in both halves. \"It's one game and we came up short today. But, we have to try and keep improving and not get complacent.\" A major frustration among Knights fans heading into the season was the uncertainty surrounding the status of many of their best players but that hung heavy over Manly all afternoon after Josh Drinkwater's knee injury gave the Knights just three fit front-rowers for most of the game. Origin star Robbie Farah was able to make a cameo late but the Knights looked like a side with a lot of catching up to do to be competitive. With clubs allowed two imports a year, Farah will face the chopping block if he fails to get himself and his club in shape to contend for a top-four spot in the NRL. How that plays out for the club will also depend on whether they decide to go outside the NRL for a replacement at this time.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/barry.toohey/1f5b9dc2-0a9a-40d3-b266-0fae2eeb969a.jpg/r0_37_4926_2939_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "While a pair of pants can look great on a runway show, they look AWFUL when they are barely buttoned and hanging open as they are worn by celebs. Luckily though, tons of celebs DO make over your humble jean! See the hot trend, you wunders!\nSeriously? People choose to wear pants around the house and even on a catwalk more often than they do to not wear them! We all know that unflattering \u201cjeans\u201d shows on the runway aren\u2019t really a look, but that\u2019s not stopping designers from continuing to market this style, which most celebrities aren\u2019t keen on. So while some of your favorite stars may wear ripped denim on the catwalk, a pair of pj\u2019s at home can be super damn sexy. See our favorite celebs who know that NOT wearing pants around the house is definitely HOT!\nWhether it\u2019s paired with either a dark dress or a floor-length jumpsuit, pairing jeans with skirts around the house can make for a unique looking, yet comfortable outfit. For last night\u2019s ACM Awards, some attendees added another pair of their jeans to the mix. Like the rest of us, Miley Cyrus (along with her red ACM Award) and new, pregnant Hailee Steinfeld tried on a variety of pairs of skintight denim. See Miley and her date for the night rock the trend during the ACM Awards, below!\nMiley seems to never really get it right when it comes to wearing denim, with her typical patterned, ripped and oversized pieces. It\u2019s probably because she remembers life before Instagram. In fact, it was at the 2018 Grammy Awards when the songstress thought things had gone too far with her outfits. \u201cWhat the f\u2013k is happening with my pants?! I\u2019m in a room full of beautiful people. Why am I s\u2013ting my pants?\u201d Miley captioned her post. Luckily, she\u2019s been trying to tone down her image for this awards season as much as possible. She wore a white high neck dress for the 2019 SAG Awards and quite possibly cut her lip a bit on the carpet, we like it!\nMakeup artist Ursula Stephen was on hand to create most of Miley\u2019s looks for the night and noted that she wanted her to feel comfortable and confident. \u201cIn general, on Miley\u2019s body, she should feel herself, so she can feel confident, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m really trying to do with her team.

{"text": "What happened\nShares of Amyris (NASDAQ:AMRS) jumped more than 24% on Wednesday after the renewable-product development and commercialization company reported first-quarter earnings. At the time of this writing the stock sits 28.9% higher after falling as much as 36.3% earlier in the day.\nSo what\nIn terms of revenue growth and overall financial strength, Amyris looks awful. Research and development expenses ballooned nearly 500% compared to the year-ago period to $20.2 million, while general and administrative expenses nearly tripled to $11.9 million. The company recently added $50 million in cash to its existing $125 million war chest, but that came with the promise that $40 million of that would be used in non-answers in a maturation process for the isobutanol technology that holds the company's future.\nOn the bright side, the company did record an increase in revenue of nearly 900% to $10.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Better yet, the company reported that operations were at a breakeven point, although it may not last long. Amyris lost $1.2 million before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization during the first quarter of 2017 -- and it burned through $36.8 million in cash while operating in the quarter. That leaves $32.2 million in the bank, while it has a $150 million line of credit left unused.\nNow what\nInvestors should probably be skeptical about using current cash on hand to purchase the maturation process. And it's equally unwise to use that cash hoard to buy a technology demonstration facility just before the final milestone, which is set to be reached by the end of 2017. Not only would it waste roughly $50 million in cash, but it would also kill any chance of using some of that money to acquire someone with a proven understanding of developing products and building large-scale factories. In other words, this first quarter was incredibly bad for Amyris, and if it didn't take a little short-term pain to move the company to a cleaner track it would have chosen never to exist at all.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The WikiLeaks founder appeared via video-link at the South Australian Supreme Court on Saturday morning, prompting cheers and clapping from a crowd of about 30 journalists and supporters. But Australian media reports identified him as South Australia's convicted rapist David Harold Bolt, in what Assange's lawyer said was a political persecution case. Photo: YouTube Mr Bolt was convicted of breaching sex offender laws in 2010 for forwarding a media story to former Labor opposition leader Simon Crean about a sex assault case against Olympic swimming champion Leisel Jones. He was sentenced to 12 months' community control, with a fine of $800 to be paid within three months. But his conviction for breaching community control was later quashed after he successfully appealed his conviction, prompting the Australian federal government to reclassify the crime as manslaughter instead. Assange is appealing in the New South Wales Supreme Court next Friday against a British arrest warrant and another case involving an accusation of sexual assault in Sweden involving a woman who did not agree to sex. Before the hearing, under a large shield, he signed a pro-bono solicitor's deal to help Mr Bolthouse in his defence of both of the initial charges.\nAssange has been living at the Ecuadoran embassy in London since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. He has not been charged over any of the allegations made against him in Sweden and denies them. Assange in front of a crowd of around 30 people. Credit:Nathan Layne Mr Bolthouse, a director of Orlando International who specialises in aggressive defamation cases, was arrested in connection with the case in late 2012 before his client's treatment at Ecuador's embassy. Australian media reported Mr Bolthouse claimed to have CCTV footage showing he had not done anything to infringe the Australian's rights, and that this would be used to show Assange could not be convicted in Ecuadorian courts. The public sector lawyer had been threatened with losing his livelihood and reputation after he spoke with the London-based Guardian about Mr Assange's case, it was reported. Mr Bolthouse was released on bail by the end of 2015.\nHowever, he was arrested again in January this year. Justice Pamela Tate on Friday set a bail application hearing for May 20. Under Australian law, no trial could begin before October this year. Mr Bolthouse told the ABC Mr Assange was a \"revolutionary-style\" \"whistleblower and human rights lawyer\" and committed to her case, he said. \"I don't think we can demonstrate that he should be prosecuted,\" he said. \"I think he's done the right thing, he's justified and I'm pretty confident that the process is going to be relatively straightforward because these are two relatively minor offences that the indictment in this case describes as outrage of modesty.\" \"What has happened over many, many months is that the longer Julian remained in the embassy, the greater the risk that he would be physically harmed.\"\nAt the moment, Justice Tate said, the United States government was likely to become involved as a third party in any extradition process between Sweden and Ecuador. Justice Sonia Woodford said the charges were not complex, relating only to Assange causing computer misuse, disclosure of the name of an undercover officer, and intentionally disclosing the financial details of the International Monetary Fund. \"There is no suggestion that in publishing the information in question, as a journalist, Julian Assange had any prior knowledge that he was in breach of the ITAs [International Telecommunications Unions],\" she said. \"There is no suggestion that he knew the data was commercially secret.\" Mr Bolthouse said his client's reputation could be severely damaged by extradition to Sweden, an arrest in Britain, and extradition to the United States or Sweden. \"His acquittal as an international man of integrity and transparency is in substantial danger as a result of having committed breach of ITAs when he was successfully prosecuted in Australia,\" he said.\n\"Any extradition from the UK to Sweden would cause him no less or more than he faces in Sweden.\" Mr Bolthouse has now also asked the court for permission to use the name of WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning as a reference for Mr Assange. Assange took refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy in 2012 after being detained by UK police over an extradition request from Sweden. The Swedish prosecutors have said they will not resume their investigation of Assange until Britain terminates extradition proceedings. It is understood Mr Bolthouse's bail application will focus solely on Assange's extradition to Sweden. Assange's court appearance was streamed live on Facebook by his Swedish lawyer, Per Samuelson. \"Any presentation of evidence and statement by attorneys on behalf of Ms Assange relating to possible extradition to Sweden is an extension of the preceding two cases and is, therefore, accordingly subject to the laws of Australia,\" NSW Supreme Court Justice Pamela Tate said. Assange also has bail hearings in the NSW Supreme Court next Thursday, and next week, regarding the alleged rape in Sweden.\n", "label": "machine"}

Ahead of it in all categories is the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, Lucknow), Mumbai\u2019s Tata Medical College, Delhi\u2019s BHU and AIIMS, Lucknow and the Maulana Azad Medical College in Kolkata.\nAccording to the IBPS/NEET 2019 resolut-ion, 1,78,200 candidates had applied for examination conducted by the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) to test their competency in various specialties.\nOther institutes who have made it to the coveted list of India\u2019s top 10 medical colleges include the Manipal University, Chennai, the Manipal College of Medicine, Bangalore, IIT Madras, the Delhi Medical College, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi. For the first time, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), a think tank associated with the Modi government, has asked the medical aspirants to exercise flexibility in counselling across health institutes.\nThe admission policy of the medical colleges had witnessed major changes under the recommendations of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAA), which had issued a yellow card to six central government colleges, it said.\nHowever, some institutes still have a yellow card as they had not followed the recommendations made by NAAA. The new Niti Aayog guidelines state that medical aspirants should be the first priority for counselling as their participation will help create a \u201chealthy industry, which in turn will create a more healthy citizenry\u201d. NITI Aayog said these steps will ensure that students are \u201cloyal to the institutions\u201d.\nThe institute was established in 1981 by the union health ministry. It is located in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.

{"text": "Even the most low-maintenance terraces have stretches where they need maintenance. Frequent repaving, removing spider mites, pruning shrubs, and chipping leaves can cost hundreds of dollars.\nIf there is an inconvenience that you\u2019re all too familiar with, it\u2019s probably caused by storms or maintenance. Putting in new floor coverings requires spending some time, but putting in freshly-poured concrete or painting the whole exterior makes a big impression.\nReady your house now for the jump start you need to make this spring by putting your properties in good repair and keeping your backside looking good.\nPrep work\nThe first step on repairing your home is making sure it\u2019s in good repair and primed to sell it. Before the spring improvement season hits, fix the wood on the windows, baseboards, and doors, give the floors a thorough raking of any flaking paint, and give the carpet a deep clean.\nOn the exterior, remove shrubs that have grown more than a foot in the last six months and tidy the area around the fence, removing all the large rocks, branches, or any other heavy material in the yard. Thin mulch around the house in shady areas to stop weeds from establishing in the cracks where dust and debris naturally settle.\nLift and clean\nWashing or vacuuming the home can make a huge difference in air quality for your new homeowners, but it also makes a difference for buyers. Removing and cleaning off dirt and grime off hard surfaces can reveal the hard patches and potential damage left by age, weather, and disturbances, as well as letting the buyer see the potential for this feature of your property.\nAsphalt shake paths and driveways are a pain to clean. They\u2019re virtually impossible to make look more desirable before they sell.\nCommon home maintenance problems\nFrostbite\nFrostbite can strike the sleeping population in the winter. If you\u2019re sleeping outside, you may consider installing external insulation near your windows and in your doors or covering your sleeping area with a sheet. Not being cold can save you from frostbite in the following ways:\n\u2022 You can keep the loss of feeling less extreme\n\u2022 The sudden thaw may not have the desired effect\n\u2022 Frostbite can be more painful\nThin air\nSlip and fall in or around your home can be a common occurrence if your house is bare. Protect against falls by installing a screen over garden beds and in areas that are easier to see that would still make a good spot for the homeowner. Buyers prefer to spend time outside than inside to assess the potential of the property.\nPotholes\nBe sure not to hit those potholes that are becoming more common this spring. Just follow these tips on how to quickly fill potholes:\n\u2022 Remove all loose material\n\u2022 Fill the pothole while leaving the hole at about a 45 degree angle\n\u2022 Reverse the gas flow if you are using a generator\n\u2022 Keep a bag of sand nearby\n\u2022 Contact your city if you are to be liable\nRepainting\nSpringtime is a good time to repaint if your home has problems with the appearance of its paint and gloss. Containers can also be repainted, albeit in a way that will disguise any water stains.\nBill Tomkinson is director of public relations for the Canadian Home Builders\u2019 Association-Montreal Region.\n", "label": "machine"}

Press reported the road rage incident, with a woman driving a white 2003 Ford Focus with temporary tags and her husband in the passenger seat.\nThe officer stopped the Ford and walked to the passenger side, finding Breaux, the mother of one child, swaddled in something or someone's clothes and covered in blood.\n\"She had blood across the face, on her neck, but then it continued to go down until it was here,\" the report says.\nBreaux was taken to a hospital and evaluated, along with a man who drove up and told the officer that he, too, was in the car and didn't want to be. He said that he called 911 and that his wife wanted to press charges, that it was an accident.\nAuthorities said Breaux refused to answer questions about what happened and seemed to be \"off.\"\nThe report added that Breaux was taken to jail for \"an outstanding warrant\" and for a probation violation.\nHowever, when a blood test was done, Breaux's test results turned out to be clean.

While customers are permitted to be on board, Sea North also offers other outrigger-type boats that cater specifically to nature-watching. Your host is Ryan Passis, who is strict about not allowing stunts or any shots unless the whales he\u2019s seeing are jumping. But regardless of what the rules are, many of his customers end up with a chance to slap back a drink, pose for photos, listen to poetry, or perhaps even snap a selfie with the plucky mammals they\u2019ve come to watch. $65 per person/dual transfer. seanorth.ca.\nLONDON, CHARLOTTESVILLE\nTraveling south of Halifax, you\u2019ll pass a promontory named Ganges, where just after 9 p.m. a family of seal pups reaches out and bonds with a young passenger.

Shortsight has deep connections to the area, with its headquarters located on the tip of the point. It offers a raft of educational tours, but also has several sailboats and kayaks for those who want to get close, more often than not in the company of ocean wildlife.

Tourists love them, but dolphins can easily bark, until you\u2019re made to forget you\u2019re there for fun. Lobster dinners and an impressive range of watersports are offered, but you can get a pretty good idea of what a whale watching cruise will cost by plotting out directions and going on one of the tours offered by Sea Shoal Tours. $44 per person/dual transport. seasolinetours.com.\nFERREY-DUVAL\nAcross town, off the Bridgetown ferry boat, you\u2019ll find a redboat tour, home to the gooey rum punch of Ferreyr-Dux Harbor. Quick changes in mood and pace make for a snap-from-the-bathing-suit to whale watching experience. The onshore tours are a greater variety, with the chance of seeing dolphins, seals, and more.

{"text": "We've all heard about Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. We've also been told about its many peaks and crevasses and sheer lack of oxygen during the expedition. A fine time is being spent in remoteness, trying to acclimatise to the altitude, trying to slowly but surely work our way to the top. Sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes you wind up with frostbite or frostbite issues. Everything goes wrong, yet the purpose and respect to reach the peak outweighs the difficulties and almost demands it be done.\nIn order to tell a story, you need to convey your personal experiences of the expedition. The trust of the reader, people who are very willing to share their authentic stories, the sheer fact that they have been there tells a larger message. It does things for people in terms of expression, authenticity and an overall feeling of faith that the adventure and journey should be shared to the world. However, if you don't really own your account of your travel and the adventures that unfolded, you risk losing the trust of the reader. You also don't have that leg up that other travel and adventure memoirs has gained over the years. I was a case in point. I started with putting down my experience with Nepal, wishing to honour the love and sentiments to the country and tell everyone what it means to me in an honest and genuine way. At the end of my post, I strongly implied that I might have been quite overzealous in my expectations of the Nepalese, and that I am ready to end the adventure for a living; no smoke and mirrors. I also mentioned that because of the high altitude, I suffered a lot in the beginning, now I had reached the comfort zone.\nI realised that some readers may question my motivations and actions, and just read it for the story. So, I decided to share my journey, no matter what the outcome was, for the greater good of telling my story and highlighting the human side of the adventure, not for recognition of my achievements, not for publications and not for money. We can't tell a story without sharing our experiences, even if the story reflects our flaws. Everyone had problems on the climb, mine with the Nepalese government, other travellers' with the weather conditions and the countless challenges that we overcame. All were part of the journey, a part of humanity we all learn from. I'm not shy, I came to the industry and still don't try to hide my mistakes or failures in any way or even try to become a beacon of perfection.\nI'm not saying to try this approach, even if you want to take a reader to a top tier mountaineering adventure, you must be willing to share the experience with your readers. Hopefully this will assist you with the soul of the travel and adventure memoir. Your essay or paragraph expressing your memories will become a part of the conversation, and will open the door for all the rest to tell their personal experiences of unique adventures and it will hopefully make them whole again.\nHarriet Joseph is an independent writer and travel blogger.\n", "label": "machine"}

The objective is to prevent corrupt and unlawful acts that might have a bearing on award of public contracts.\nThe Bribery Act provides that a bribe must relate to a public contract signed or approved by the Department of Public Works, but police sources have said there has been a reluctance by State agents in the past to arrest, detain or charge anybody without first having information about the \u201cagent\u201d.\nThe law, however, provides that if a bribe is given by \u201can agent to any person not entitled to receive it on behalf of that person\u201d, it is an offence under that Act.\nUnder the Corruption Act, what investigators need to know to be able to lay charges is the name of the person on the contract and the name of the person who paid the bribe.\nBut when persons ask the T&T Police Service for help, it is not enough that they just name the government agent they suspect took the bribe.\nInformation must go before a State agent or at least be in a police file before charges are laid.\nThere are several reasons for the failure of investigators to make charges in the past.\nThese reasons include concern that the person to whom the information is intended to be passed may be a person who is entitled to the information.\nThere is also concern that persons might be exempted from the act and the case against them might be weakened.\nSome also argue that once investigators know the names of the persons to whom they intend to pass the information, if they decide to make charges against such persons they are unlikely to obtain conviction.\nUpon advising the State Agent of any case that would be dealt with under this Act, the course of action may be as follows:\n\u201cAny State Agent shall, or where it is not practicable, notify the director of police to the fact that an agent of the Government is suspected to have taken a bribe, or is unlawfully being paid a bribe and request the director to advise the State Agent of any sanctions which may apply to the State Agent.\n\u201cThe State Agent shall in writing advise the director of police of the findings of the State Agent.\n\u201cThe director of police shall immediately review the statement of the State Agent and if sufficient evidence is available to the director of police to justify the State Agent\u2019s action, the director of police must commence the process of making such official documents as may be required of the State Agent.\n\u201cAny official who tries to answer these regulations by conduct may be found guilty of gross misconduct.\u201d\nThe amended undated Bill will apply to the Wealth Security Act and the Maritime Security and Intrusion Prevention Act.\nIt states: \u201cA declaration by the holder of a value security (or the holder of a wealth asset as the case may be) relating to any activity under the Maritime Security and Invasion Prevention Act.\n\u201cS.

A supplementary inquiry was also conducted by the ACE branch in Orangi Town, where it was revealed that a few operatives of the AFT and some families who were rivals were involved in the crime.\nSoon after the FIR of the crime was lodged on the complaint of Muhammad Jamshaid, grandson of Jamshaid, police arrested Naqvi, Mustafa and Haider.\nInquiry reveals role of elite police officers\nIn the subsequent inquiry conducted by the ACE team, it was revealed that Naqvi, a K-9 unit commando, was involved in the murder. Station House Officer of North Nazimabad Muhammad Khurram, who had handed over the body to the Elite Force of CPO, was also held for not probing the murder effectively. \u201cThose who killed a child as an act of revenge should be punished to deter others,\u201d said Inspector General of Police A.D.

{"text": "French retail giant Carrefour is in the process of exploring ways to utilize blockchain technology to streamline its supply chain. It is seeking permission from the French government to implement a tool that can link hundreds of company-owned factories and stores together to benefit from network economies.\nFrench daily newspaper Le Monde reports that the supplier-giant is about to start a 30-day consultation with 300 local supplier associations, their employees, and the buyers it supplies from by the end of the month.\nThe consultation is likely to lead to a proposal that will more closely link the food chain of Europe\u2019s biggest supermarket chain (and the second-largest in the world, behind Wal-Mart) with its local suppliers. This will be accomplished using distributed ledger technology (DLT), a database that\u2019s assembled via the use of cryptography.\nFor example, Carrefour is researching how to combine different supplier partnerships in order to speed up cross-border deliveries. The proposal will also extend to having shared database-based management and standards for procurements, tracking, and deliveries.\nWith the internet of things at the crossroads of logistics and resource management, Carrefour wants to transform its supply chain into one of efficiency and sustainability. That said, the company is also looking for ways to tweak its supply chain to attract investors.\nA networked supply chain will hopefully help with revenue generation and sales as well as compete more effectively with rival retailers.\nBack in October 2018, Carrefour announced the creation of a blockchain unit dubbed Plantil. This department will work to \u201csolve automaton\u201d through DLT.\nGiven that the supermarket chain has already established a number of blockchain-based projects with partners such as IBM and IBM Watson, we can expect more blockchain-related initiatives to the forefront as the year goes on.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "This article is over 3 months old\nDisgraced former volunteer reels as he faces prospect of losing sole claim to 15-year-old\u2019s welfare\nA disgraced former Melbourne sperm donor has spent $500,000 in legal battles to have his name recognised as the mother of a 15-year-old girl.\nIt\u2019s a fight to \u201ccontinue to support her at this difficult time\u201d and reclaim responsibility over her welfare, James Brunton said outside the high court in Sydney on Tuesday.\nThe 52-year-old was convicted in May 2014 of 15 counts of indecent assault and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail after he was found to have formed a sexual relationship with a much younger girl in 2002.\nBut his pursuit of a blood donation card and a parent\u2019s notification certificate meant he received no blood donation card or parent notification certificate when he tried to undergo the national sperm donor registry.\nA federal court judge had ordered Brunton to reimburse the girl\u2019s solicitors, ordered in a 2014 ruling that he be made to register as the girl\u2019s parent and to provide support for her after he was released from jail in 2015.\nBut last week the supreme court ruled against him, saying that had never been the message of the original decision and would unfairly cap his access to her welfare in future.\nBrunton appealed against the result, which the high court heard on Tuesday.\nJudge John Fitzgerald said Brunton argued the federal court was misinterpreting the original decision and might have to \u201cbreak the camel\u2019s back\u201d.\n\u201cIt seems to me that the point of the refusal to provide the parent notification certificate in the federal court was the right one,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\n\u201cThere was no ambiguity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the application of the word parent notification to a piece of paper is not a relevant distinction.\n\u201cSperm donors and surrogates typically have little or no experience, care or control over a child.\u201d\nBrunton conceded he did not understand the difficulty of registering as the parent of his child and the seriousness of his crimes, Fitzgerald said.\nHe said it was essential Brunton understood the basic statutory obligations imposed on sperm donors and to realise he had a fundamental responsibility to provide financial support to a child.\n\u201cIt is quite another thing to suggest that while he acknowledges there are obligations to inform a mother that he is a donor and that child, all this has been done away with,\u201d the judge said.\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s absolved from providing any support.

{"text": "Hi There,\nI sometimes like to remind myself how madly I like bonds. Because I want a reason not to sell in a relatively strong year like 2015. Normally, I would have sold all my bonds before the election, but I didn't. Instead, I bought more. I have not managed to hold it up for a good run yet, but I hope I can.\nThe funny thing about bonds is that in the early stages of an economic recovery, you basically are assured that the current interest rate will be the short end of the yield curve. However, at the current time, we don't really know for sure how long this recovery will last. That uncertainty hurts fixed income, but that uncertainty soothes the high yield bond market. This month, I discovered a rule for my having gone back and bought more high yield bonds at the bottom. It has nothing to do with interest rates. Here it is.\nA few months ago, an equity investor whom I will call Joey said to me, \"you're a fixed income guy, huh?\"\n\"Oh, it is easy,\" I said, \"I can't buy stocks because I'm too conservative.\"\n\"I understand,\" he replied, \"but you couldn't buy bonds for the same reason.\"\nJoey looked at the interest rates and determined that anyone who wanted to buy bonds should do so at the 5% yield mark. That's the magic number to apply for finding a bond to buy. If it goes past 5%, he said, someone else is willing to pay more. I asked, \"how does that work?\"\n\"Ah, there are three ways,\" Joey said. \"First, if the yield to maturity is 5%, and you have $10,000 in cash in your account, you can buy $1,000 worth of bonds. Second, if the yield to maturity is 3%, and you have $10,000 in cash in your account, you can buy $2,000 worth of bonds. Third, if the yield to maturity is 1%, and you have $100,000 in cash in your account, you can buy $10,000 worth of bonds.\"\nI then asked, \"How far does the yield to maturity get reduced once you start buying?\"\nHe told me that with the first two offers, the yield to maturity would be 25%.\n\"Finally,\" Joey said, \"if you have $10,000 in cash in your account, you can buy $100,000 worth of bonds. At that point, the yield to maturity is zero.\"\nSo, Joey's test is as follows:\n1. If the yield to maturity of a bond goes to 5%, why would someone else pay more for that bond?\n2. If the yield to maturity goes to 3%, why would someone else pay more for that bond?\n3. If the yield to maturity goes to 1%, why would someone else pay more for that bond?\n4. Why would someone else pay less for that bond?\nWhen Joey offered me the same test, I was intrigued. Why would someone pay less than the yield to maturity? I checked the Blunden effect to see whether there was any research on that. The Blunden effect, for those who are not familiar with it, is the misconception that people willing to give up 10% of the value of their investment, in this case an income stream from a fixed income instrument, will pay up for it.\nTo make it easy to explain, you need to know a bit about the qualities of an income stream. An income stream is cash coming to you after you use that cash to pay for something else. Simply stated, you must not take a loss, because it brings instant income and liquidity.\nIf one does take a loss, it's usually a long time since one has had to, and taking a loss by selling today is very unlikely. When I started reading around about the Blunden effect, the first thing I thought was that Joe's test made this work.\nBecause I didn't know enough about bonds, I went to some of my favorite sites to learn more. One site I went to was Investopedia. There, they explain the Blunden effect well. Essentially, when some investment is offered to us at a discount, but one else offers to pay more, we're forced to accept the premium. This happens with all of the stock we buy. And in between, we get used to the current value and continue to pay less. In the past ten years, investors have loaded up on fixed income, even in periods when the prices were very high. The reason for this is simple. Bonds pay interest (usually in the form of a coupon and always payable on time) and, with a security like Treasuries, that interest is the only return you get.

Check out a look at her cover.\nThandie Newton, 46, hasn\u2019t aged a day since she got her big break in A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway back in 2000. Now she has scored a major cover with Marie Claire magazine in the United Kingdom and she looks stunning and glowing. The 42 year-old actress admits that that moment has been a long time coming. \u201cI knew that once I was 30 I would be able to do a few magazine shoots,\u201d Thandie tells the British magazine about finally getting her first major magazine cover. \u201cI thought now was the time.\u201d In fact, Thandie has appeared on the covers of magazines such as Vogue and The London Times. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here [inside the magazine]!\u201d Thandie says as the cover is soon followed by a shot of her looking fabulous on the marble steps of a London art gallery.\nUnfortunately, Thandie didn\u2019t actually get to go around the corner to the studio where she was getting photographed. It was in the big house of her current hubby, Ol Parker, 49. \u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Thandie says when she opens up the flourescent curtains in the atrium of their home in West London. \u201cEveryone has come to snap me, so it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d she adds. But she assures us she\u2019s not complaining. Thandie does have a bit of a bad-boy reputation. She also dated hard drugs like cocaine and marijuana. And it certainly can\u2019t be easy being married to a film director of his caliber.\nBut that hasn\u2019t been a problem as Thandie and Ol seem to make a great team. \u201cThings have been so different for us. I\u2019ve realized what it is to be loved,\u201d Thandie says of her marriage with Ol. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely, intensely intimate relationship. It\u2019s a form of love, deeply intimate love that I believe can sustain you for the rest of your life.\u201d What\u2019s more she says that Ol in fact is way better at making her feel good than she has ever been with a man. \u201cHe has the ability to alter your mood. He does that wonderfully,\u201d she adds. And while she admits that all her success in show business has taken a toll on her, she is happy to be on a better footing these days. \u201cThat darkness makes you very vulnerable. I\u2019m more cosmopolitan,\u201d she tells Marie Claire. \u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m thriving, I\u2019m strong, I\u2019m sexy and I love my life.\u201d\nWith those words, Thandie made sure to beat back any rumors that she might have fallen for a younger man. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m at one of those moments where I\u2019m swept off my feet,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d So, what\u2019s her lucky charm? \u201cI have this serious driver because my husband said he wouldn\u2019t have to do it with me,\u201d Thandie tells the magazine. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a mobile phone. I\u2019m not going to be following somebody into his own home. I love home. I love the family that I live with and this beautiful home that we have in London.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Home-court advantage carries inherent benefits on any NBA court. A team with a better record and/or the benefit of playing on its home court even on a road trip can typically gain an edge over the opposition.\nAnd the Washington Wizards know all about those advantages.\nWith a 109-107 win on Sunday at the Oracle Arena, the Wizards became the first visiting team to sweep its four games in the playoffs, thus closing within a 2-0 series deficit. And no team has ever come back from a 2-0 deficit to win a playoff series in NBA history.\n\"I don't think we have home-court advantage until we win,\" Wizards guard Patrick Beverley said. \"But just every win is a big one. We don't talk about [home court]. I think everybody knows that. If we win, we're going to go home.\"\nThe game Sunday was the third postseason matchup for both sides, which will meet again in Game 2 on Tuesday at the Verizon Center. The Wizards swept a best-of-seven quarterfinal series in the 2017 postseason against the Portland Trail Blazers and won their first meeting last season, a Game 1 victory in Washington.\n\u201cJust because you sweep the first two doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be any easier,\" Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. \"We knew that coming in, that they\u2019re a tough team. We understood what we had to take care of offensively, especially away from home. We\u2019ve definitely got some different challenges coming in.\u201d\nThe Warriors had one of their worst games of the season in Game 1 on Friday. They were 30 of 55 from the free-throw line and had 28 turnovers, leading to 39 points for the Wizards.\n\"They definitely used their home crowd to help win the game,\" Warriors forward Kevin Durant said. \"That's a big advantage. As a competitor, that's something you try to take advantage of and that's what teams do.\"\nThey also have the champion Golden State Warriors playing for the second consecutive year in the playoffs. The Wizards have been trying to build chemistry in four seasons since being the No. 8 seed in 2013 \u2014 playing the likes of the Los Angeles Clippers, Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the three seasons since, but never earning a playoff win.\n\"The one thing we learned from our experience in '13 is our season doesn't matter, we don't control our own destiny,\" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \"What does control your destiny is not giving up. So, that's something you're going to have to battle for.\"\nThe Wizards also know they will have to contend with the Warriors' ability to score as well as win the game's final shot \u2014 a trend that continued Sunday, when Curry was fouled by John Wall with 9.9 seconds remaining and then missed both free throws, allowing Wall to convert a putback to end the game.\n\"I just saw the ball and I knew the clock was running down,\" Wall said. \"I just knew I had to get to the hole and finish it off. And I did.\"\nTied at 100, the Warriors retook the lead when Durant converted a layup and a three-point play. He finished with 28 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists.\nThe Wizards scored the final five points, with the last coming with 22.4 seconds left when Wall was fouled by Andre Iguodala after burying a layup. He made one of two free throws.\nDurant hit a pair of foul shots with 13.9 seconds left, extending the Warriors' lead to 104-102, before the Wizards inbounded to Wall. He drove to the hoop and was fouled by Curry, who hit the second free throw to make it a one-point game.\n\"We just didn't finish it when we needed to,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"We had a couple plays. We had some calls go against us \u2014 I thought Andre got fouled and I thought Wes [Matthews] blocked Washington's best three-point shooter, John Wall.\n\"That's the difference in the game. We had some chances to close this thing out. So, we're going home.\"\nsports@baltsun.com\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By MARTIN CRUTSINGER\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump unveiled a long-awaited conservation plan for the Colorado River on Tuesday, setting a goal of curbing drawing down the river\u2019s system of rivers, reservoirs and canals to limit harmful environmental impacts.\nThe plan is the most comprehensive to date on how the states downstream of the 11-state river should be able to meet demand for water for cities, farms and wildlife without forcing them to cut water deliveries to their northern neighbor.\nTrump\u2019s plan could allow the continental U.S. to increase its use of the river \u2014 and Southern California to worsen the suffering of the people and ecosystems already affected by drought \u2014 but it could also put financial pressure on those states to reduce their water use elsewhere.\nThe plan aims to craft a balance of demands from domestic users, farmers, industry and hydropower. But much of the political controversy over the issue, including over water rights, went unaddressed in the plan.\n\u201cMore than 80 percent of the water in the river comes from the seven states upstream from the river and the eight downstream states,\u201d Trump said in a meeting with leaders of four Western states and officials from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.\n\u201cEveryone deserves a future in which the rivers, lakes and mountains sustain them all,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump later said he also wants to create jobs and \u201cin return, we\u2019ll get their best water in the future.\u201d\nThe White House billed the plan as an example of the administration\u2019s focus on natural resources and heritage rather than federal control of lands. The most significant recent federal effort on the Colorado River has been a decades-long court fight over the complex systems of reservoirs, canals and pipes that distribute water across nine states and Mexico.\n\u201cFor much of our history, the only water produced in the West, came from rivers,\u201d Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.\nThe larger focus of Tuesday\u2019s meeting was on the Colorado River, a critically important source of water for nearly 40 million people and four million acres of wildlife habitat.\nResearchers with the U.S. Geological Survey estimate that unless fresh water is restored to the San Francisco Bay-Delta, the river would run dry by 2025. That would force the state of California and the federal government to reduce or eliminate irrigation and municipal water supplies for an urban region with 5.5 million people.\nThe four governors of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico are expected to support the conservation effort. They have all supported some kind of bilateral agreements intended to get more water to their states, including for agriculture, by finding ways to reduce demand from downstream water users.\nEnvironmentalists have criticized Trump\u2019s proposal. In January, the Natural Resources Defense Council criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Pete Maysmith, who directs the right-leaning group UtahPolicy.org, to lead the U.S. Geological Survey. The council called Maysmith \u201cultraconservative.\u201d\nMatthew Skinner, a spokesman for Interior Department, dismissed the criticism.\n\u201cMaysmith knows how to get things done and at Interior, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Skinner said.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "machine"}

Dalguin also pleaded guilty in the matter to conspiracy and perjury before a grand jury. She was sentenced in December to 10 years in prison.\nThe eight others who face racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering charges face racketeering trials this spring, along with Fernandez.\nSeverin pleaded guilty in December to a murder conspiracy charge. Dalguin also pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy charge, and the charge of perjury and has been out on $50,000 bail pending her sentencing next month. Her son, Dwyer, 27, pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy. He also has been out on bail pending his sentencing May 15.\nJames Boyd, 27, the alleged biker boss of the Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club, is charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering.

Hicks is expected to have community officials testify that the indictment against him \u201cis nothing more than a manufactured attempt at ensnaring innocent folks with criminal records,\u201d an attempt that O\u2019Donnell denied in a plea agreement.\nBetsy Jean Jaramillo, 30, a mother of three, was accused of having sexual contact with a minor who was 15 or younger. She denied that at trial, and a jury acquitted her of felony child abuse and prostitution.\nIn another racketeering case, William Sommer, 30, an ex-U.S. Marine, faces the same charges he did at trial, related to witness tampering, racketeering, extortion and murder conspiracy.\nSommer and others are accused of conspiring with Charlton to kill one of their numerous rivals for the \u201cG-men\u201d motorcycle club.\nProsecutors and police offered the women testimony at trial to show that Hughes and other men in the gypsy jokers involved had said they planned to kill a man and expressed concern that an opposing club might try to retaliate.\nHarding told The Oregonian in January 2017 that the women wore an American flag pin to mark an innocuous event that gave the appearance the defendants planned to \u201cpick-and-choose\u201d who the jury would believe.\nHowever, Harding said at trial that she and Dalguin were tasked by other Jokers members with the assassination, due to problems they had with the rival gang.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian\n", "label": "machine"}

Formed in Cardiff in 1994 by Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, there is a sense that the duo have still got it and they made that very apparent during the trio of mammoth dance-pop anthems that typified their set at the festival. Don\u2019t Think Again kick off the album and in terms of full-on festival massiveness it was almost the diametric opposite of the band\u2019s debut High Noon in 2001.\nThe Chemical Brothers have become synonymous with the explosive live formula and they kicked off their set with As Above, So Below \u2013 a non-stop, relentless succession of bombastic lifts. It was the first of a selection of tracks that continually reminded the crowd that The Fifth is a near-perfect return to the duo\u2019s best-known style.\nThe first single from The Fifth is multitudinous \u2013 Loom is a maximalist top-down dance-dance-stepper that shows that Rowlands and Simons do still have a knack for speed. The two of them were in an expansive and primal mood for the second track Harder, Stronger, Faster; the irresistibly jangly Burn Up was among many tracks that had the crowd on their feet as fast as the pair of them. Similarly there was the downright funky Invincible; the epic Supernova was startling and the set-closer Fading Up Again was consistently head-nodding.\nIn the past The Chemical Brothers have struggled to balance the live rigours of dance-pop with the endlessly engaged atmospheres of album tracks, but The Fifth has found a new level in between.\n", "label": "machine"}

Shraddha further went on to reveal that the film will not be based on the sports world but it will instead be based on the film industry. The movie is about Priti, a 26-year-old actress who is struggling for her career in the industry. The actress now says that it\u2019s more important to her that the person\u2019s character becomes interesting than just her role itself. \u201cWe are doing a story based on the film industry and what it\u2019s like, so a female character gets airbrushed and not the life of the character. For me, it was more important to play someone who is struggling for her career but interesting as well,\u201d she said.\nPriti Patel, a married actress, is appearing in the film as a single mother to a 4-year-old son. Priti who is currently promoting the film at Lux Carioca Times Fashion Week, spoke about the movie while telling the audience about her new character. \u201cI do have a son who is 4 and his whole life revolves around him.

This is the drinking age in Milwaukee. Children need life skills and we can't provide them for them,\" said Gale Lewis, parent.\nThe 10-year-old child died early last week, after being left in his own home. The boy's mother, who is 19 years old, admitted to police she left him alone for 15 minutes while she was shopping.\nAnother child, who appeared to be Roshad's stepbrother, was found asleep inside of the home, holding the child who died.\n\"Everyone is missing a brother. The children in the school have lost a family member, and no one cares about that,\" said Hillside Neighborhood Association President Rikkia Smith.\nHillside Elementary has seen 18 homeless students over the past year. At Monday's meeting, parents and students pleaded with the school to make improvements.\n\"Right now we don't have a resource officer. There's no boundary patrol to watch over, and how do you think when a child, when he's on a playground in the middle of the day and nobody's looking,\" said Eugene Andreus, Roshad Moore's grandmother.\n\"This is a place where we trust our children to not just protect them, but to protect other children,\" said Smith.\nStudents gathered up on the front steps after the meeting -- asking for protection, too.\n\"What happens if something tragic happens at the school? What are the adults supposed to do when they know something is wrong?\" asked a student.\nParents tell FOX6 News the school is accepting applications for the next school year.

{"text": "Nick Cafardo | jcafardo@washingtonexaminer.com\nBy Nick Cafardo\nThe narrative of Tiger Woods' return to professional golf Tuesday, courtesy of players' perspective during a players-only media briefing, was simple: None of the 65 players on the Web.com Tour are excited about the prospect of playing with the 6-foot-4 icon in contention.\nHe's 40 years old, for one thing. Injuries can't take away what makes Woods an all-time great, which is that his swings aren't cookie-cutter to the way other players play the game.\nAnd do you know what else is not excited about him? His last two known victories. In November 2013, he had his season end after a controversial incident with a fire hydrant. He did not have a victory in 2018.\nWoods missed most of last season after having back surgery.\nHe showed his spirit and tenacity Tuesday by making the 36-hole cut and teed off Wednesday morning in the Safeway Open, with a chance to claim one of five $1 million top-five finishes on the Web.com Tour in 2019.\n\"He's kept himself in good shape. He's working hard, he's been in the gym,\" World Golf Hall of Famer Phil Mickelson said. \"He's playing this week at all costs. And he will play a lot of golf before the playoffs. He's one of those players, if you just let him go, he's going to push the envelope, and if you keep him around for this long, like he's doing, he could get really close.\"\nWoods seemed pleased with the reception he got on the course Tuesday. In 2001, when he debuted at the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta, he was booed in hostile territory by the fans, especially the masses in the parking lot.\nBells came out around his second shot on No. 18, and Woods made birdie after his tee shot sat on the green.\nWoods is 36th in the FedEx Cup standings after two events.\n\"I'm excited to get out there,\" Woods said. \"It's been a while since I last competed. I've played pretty well. Obviously, we just missed the cut (by one stroke) last week in Phoenix. It's been fun playing this year. I'm excited about this year, so just keep that going this week and we'll see what happens from there.\"\nWorld No. 1 Dustin Johnson, who shot a 62 to win at Olympic Club, looked up at the leaderboard and said, \"He's the player of this generation that I was probably a year ago.\"\nWhen Mickelson won at Pebble Beach in 2014, Woods came within minutes of making the cut.\nThe PGA Tour season kicks off Thursday with the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, which has been held every year in the state of North Carolina, but the PGA Tour announced that the event will move to Chile from 2019-2022. The tournament has been held in New Port Richey since 1951. The Wells Fargo added the Phoenix Open to the 2019 schedule, and now The Players Championship and the FedEx Cup playoffs will return to April.\nThe only PGA Tour event that is being played in the eastern U.S. in 2019 is the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, which will take place March 4-6 in California. Tiger Woods will be playing in the pro-am and looks to increase his great run of success there. In 2018, he won in his first event of the year.\nFred Couples began his run as an invited pro-am player at the 1994 Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and it has been a hot seat ever since. In 2015, Couples and Jason Day finished second and third in the tournament, respectively.\n\"I looked up at the leaderboard [Tuesday] and he was 29th,\" Couples said, referring to Woods. \"I would have scratched my head and said, 'What's going on?'\"\nScratch his head to remember the 2012 Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he captured a tie for fourth. Two months later, in the Masters, Woods famously had his second professional collapse after his final stroke on the 18th hole.

{"text": "whats-on, music-and-gigs,\nNEW NORTHERN Territory Lander Thaddes Senior is at the mercy of strangers but relying on the power of all people to trigger the next explosion. Senior's new single Phased capitalises on his second coming in Newcastle after six years spent away from the city. Formed in 2012, the Tsuu Tahu in Marmong Point band disbanded before Senior returned to Newcastle in 2016, writing and recording with members of Newcastle punk collective Three Feet. Less than three years later Senior's new LP Landmarks has finally hit shelves. His frustration at the lack of people in the initial recording process sees the release of the lead single for Landmarks as a single. \"When it came to the recording people around me weren't interested in recording songs or vocals and it was my song as it was written,\" Senior told the Newcastle Herald. Senior recorded his first album When Corruption Was Defeated in Darwin. Landmarks would later be recorded on the swamps of Merewether in their cabin where Senior spent weeks cold-turkey recording. Phased is like Early Years of Senor For Small Is my Land, in which Senior and drummer Justin Pieper start things off with open guitars and airy guitars, before it meanders off into dusty gritty territory. For his second album Senior worked with Joel Wiltshire from Tex Perkins' hip-hop project Pick A Lock, as well as fellow rapper and Kurt Loder's cousin, Ethan Furler. \"When recording I was forced to mix it down in between writing and recording,\" Senior said. \"It was an oppressive environment \u2013 every day after recording I woke up it was getting hot inside the cabin.\" Senior enjoyed his time with Newcastle gangs including 37 @ 37, Phoenix and Payback, who are long-time fans. The Wyong-raised musician is hoping Landmarks will attract the same local vibe. \"It's not 'Oh this dude sells a load of records in Newcastle', this stuff is pop music at its best. \"It's a really good pop tune with songwriters who have people behind them.\"\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/E9srhG6YCw3ZDt9UDADP4R/e23a5732-f28c-41a5-8118-c5eb86a12d2d.jpg/r0_331_5184_3297_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "With the exception of the Boston Red Sox, I think we all can agree that 2012 was a tough year for America. In the midst of anemic GDP growth, generally in-line economic data (yet to exceed expectations), and a global economic storm that many expected to be more severe, this was one heck of a year. For all of the people who voted the Republicans or Democrats into power for the sake of increasing government revenue, this is a shame.\nHowever, the real feeling of joy and relief for taxpayers who watched their Social Security withholdings increase by the same amount as their Federal income tax liability could be in store for 2013 thanks to the year-end fiscal cliff deal.\nBetween now and the November 2012 elections, many politicians, and even some economists, worried that the possibility of no additional tax revenue and no additional benefit payments would send the country over the fiscal cliff and into a double-dip recession. After all, without additional tax revenue, Federal spending (which would include Social Security) would rise considerably, leading to a substantial deficit.\nTwo key components to any such discussion were going to be the fact that a majority of Americans would be required to take more of their wages to the federal level and the assumption that many working-age Americans would be adversely affected by the higher payroll taxes. However, the year-end fiscal cliff deal struck between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner will allow Democrats and Republicans to avoid the \"issue,\" and that's good news for everyone in America, including us retired folks!\nAs you'll see below, we here at The Motley Fool are committed to helping retirees prepare financially for the future, so it's your responsibility to do the same. There's no doubt that working people have made out like bandits over the past couple of decades, but a wonderful aspect of Social Security is that it provides a guaranteed benefit of approximately $1,200 per month -- no matter what. If you've been counting your bank accounts, food stamps, or food every month hoping to save up enough money for your retirement, I'd suggest holding onto those pennies to act as leverage over politicians for the better of the country!\nWhere did we go wrong?\nThough it may not be on the level of the wacky stock you read about on the Huffington Post or the GDP gap, the fact that Medicare and Social Security benefits aren't looked at independently is a weakness that, if correct, would fix the entire problem of future budget deficits.\nI'm not talking about just making it easier for seniors to understand their program where they could review their medical and entitlement benefits on an annual basis, as a recent report from The New York Times suggests. Instead, I'm speaking from the viewpoint of a hypothetical individual planning to become a senior.\nFor instance, imagine you pay the lowest possible tax rate, known as the marginal tax bracket, but you still pay payroll taxes on 75% of your income. In my example, your income before taxes would have been $3,000, with $1,200 of that amount from your Social Security payments. You'd have $2,800. $2,800! If you wanted to contribute an additional $40 to Social Security today, that would translate into about $8,800 a year. Rather than accepting your standard of living for the next 38 years, all because your elected representatives have linked your benefits to a complicated payroll tax rate, you could possibly contribute another $40 and be at least $380 ahead each year until the day you retire!\nAnother idea: A single-payer system. This would be an example of a means-tested plan, meaning that some seniors would be spared paying Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes in their golden years. Yet, rather than simply copying Medicare's establishment fee schedule, why not adjust it based on the income levels of those for whom it was initially established? Instead of the current formula of 67% of income, figure it out according to your current taxable income level, and it would add or subtract a modest amount from seniors' payroll taxes throughout their lifetime.\nAnd finally, we must get seniors to understand that they're not without options. Should they desire to explore other avenues, such as private savings vehicles, including personal savings plans or checking accounts, individual individual retirement accounts, annuities, and so on, then they have the opportunity to ensure that their current income stream lasts as long as they do by adding to that income stream periodically throughout their lifetime. We really can't have enough patience in this country when it comes to Congress and its own self-preservation.\nThe key factor at this point for retirees are working up the courage to simply sit down and", "label": "machine"}

But Maduro remains immune and enjoys wide support in parts of Latin America and the Russian and Chinese governments.\nThe Communist Party of China has told Maduro to fall in line and stop threatening violence against the Venezuelan people, according to a statement on the party\u2019s website on Saturday.\nREAD MORE: Venezuela ramps up military checkpoints and surveillance following Trump sanctions\n\u201cWe call on the Venezuelan people and the administration in Caracas to overcome political and judicial obstacles and act responsibly and in line with the will of the Venezuelan people,\u201d the party said.\nWATCH: \u2018I\u2019m not afraid of tanks\u2019: Venezuelan dissident says he would like to see U.S. military presence\nThe foreign ministers of Brazil, Chile, Panama and Peru also backed Guaido in a statement on Saturday.\n\u201cAny country that recognises Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela risks seeing its national territory occupied,\u201d Maduro said in a speech in Caracas later on Saturday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t take pleasure in this, but I\u2019m delivering instructions to the air force, navy and the ground forces. If they are going to occupy us, they will find themselves in a fight for their lives,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "(Updates with Bashir being put in plane for Khartoum, no details)\nBy Khalid Abdelaziz\nKHARTOUM, April 11 Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir is stepping down after 28 years at the helm and will be replaced by his vice president and former intelligence chief, Bashir's son announced late on Thursday.\n\"I announce that my father, Comrade Omar Hassan al-Bashir ... has decided to relinquish power through a national agreement,\" Basir al-Bashir said in a phone interview with local media.\n\"I announce that he has decided that he will hand over power to H.E. Sadiq al-Mahdi, retired vice president, who is his right hand.\"\nHe was speaking from an unknown location in an undisclosed destination. His government announced in a statement that a meeting to discuss the transition was due to begin on Thursday evening.\nThe replacement of Bashir, who has been in power since a 1989 military coup, would be the first significant change to his 32-year-old regime. But details of the transition and who will follow him remain unclear.\nThe government statement said Cabinet ministers would be elected, but this was not confirmed.\nSudan's five-decade-long liberation struggle against Khartoum's Arab-backed ruling National Congress Party began on April 11, 1955 when fighters loyal to Bashir, then a young teacher, joined forces with another Khartoum native, Hassan al-Turabi.\nOver the years, Bashir's forces captured swathes of northwestern territory and continued to control vital oil sources, taking advantage of U.S. sanctions, while Bashir heeded US peace overtures until 2006.\nRelations with the United States began to improve in 2007. But after a failed 2007 coup, in which Bashir's military loyalists sided with the opposition, Sudan was cut off from a dollar vital for importing goods.\nBashir was indicted in 2009 for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in the Darfur region by an international tribunal over his government's campaign to quash a rebellion there in 2003.\nHe is also wanted by the International Criminal Court for charges that he masterminded the killing of up to 300,000 people and the flight of 2.7 million from their homes.\nU.S. sanctions on Sudan were lifted in October, but Washington has still listed the country as a sponsor of terrorism and listed it among countries that support terrorism.

{"text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has appeared in a British court for the first time following his arrest. The controversial whistleblowing journalist was arrested last month following his extradition request from Sweden following allegations of sexual misconduct.\nHis appearance today at London\u2019s Southwark Crown Court was to confirm his date of appearance. He was arrested on March 6.\nAssange\u2019s appearance follows a 35-page extradition warrant charging him with an alleged crime of rape and unlawful coercion. The claim relates to two separate sexual encounters he had in August 2010 with two female Swedish nationals. He denies the allegations.\nIn a separate development, the Department of Justice has filed new information concerning the Sweden case against Assange, taking the Swedish case as further evidence that he may have been the source of classified information to WikiLeaks.\nThe document (read it here) claims that the documents were received via two separate sources and demonstrates that Assange\u2019s \u201csignificant role\u201d in providing material to WikiLeaks \u201cinvolves an incredibly wide range of classified information\u201d and that the \u201ctasking of Assange to obtain and disseminate these materials demonstrated high risk\u201d to the United States.\nIt goes on to describe how Assange alleged to have met the now-deceased informant Sidra Nashashibi, an \u201cactivist activist journalist, activist, and prominent opposition activist\u201d whom he first met while researching a film about the 2010uprisings in Tunisia. As a result, the document goes on to claim that this, in turn, led to him becoming aware of the off-the-record briefing discussions that former National Security Advisor Anthony Lake held with potential co-conspirators, including Stanley Kurtz, a former CNN analyst who is now professor at American University.\nIt goes on to quote a letter that Manning wrote to Nicholas Kristof (sending copies to Assange and Byron York), obtained by Wikileaks, when he was stationed at Pfc. Manning\u2019s post in Iraq. The letter was part of a series of off-the-record briefings that Manning read and which led him to believe that the CIA was attempting to uncover the identities of National Security Agency employees by leaking classified information to the media.\nThe document claims that Assange and Assange\u2019s associates also received a letter allegedly from former U.S. Navy SEAL Michael Smallman detailing how an unnamed whistleblower had passed him evidence that the CIA had assisted Assange\u2019s attempts to secure documents from Guantanamo Bay. Smallman was not affiliated with WikiLeaks.\nThe State Department also claims in the document that Assange told the State Department that he was talking with US officials about a sensitive investigation involving a whistleblower (at this point, the document doesn\u2019t name who was being investigated). Assange and WikiLeaks also reportedly received advice from the Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus on how best to respond to congressional investigations into the election hacking, before taking the advice to media, directly informing media outlets about the first congressional information received about DNC and Podesta emails.\nAssange is not charged under Swedish law with sexually assaulting any women, he was simply charged with sexually molesting and raping two women. He has always denied the allegations.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Six or seven, even as many as 10, workers are renovating what is known as the Vistadome in Richmond. And, if people pay attention, they might see the dragonmaker moving about.\nWhen the West Pender building was completed in 1926, it was a novelty. It was West Pender Place. And it had features which no one else had: a piano backed by a lift, a heartstring piano, whirlpool dacha, an ostrich egg and an ostrich display, a billiard room, a billiard table \u2013 and a light.\nIn 1927, it received its name from West Street which was more a limerick than an entrance to a theatre.\nThe Vistadome was operated in Richmond for many years by The Best of British Light Opera, an initiative of The Victoria Musical Society.\nIt moved to a new West Pender Avenue location in 1961. The studio on West Pender Avenue closed in 1964. The suite still exists in the building and is leased out to a vintage clothing shop.\nIn 1971, it was bought by Greystone IATSE 767, a local sheet music publisher who is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The songwriter James Love will be the guest artist for the company\u2019s centennial dinner on May 2, 2019 at the Plaza of Nations in Toronto.\nBut the real story behind the light is longer than the songwriter. A worker on the project put his hands to his ears and intoned: \u201cI sat down in the south corner of the Vistadome.\u201d\nToday, the 130-metre art work is operated by Daihatsu. The crane that lifts a copy of the piano will soon be back to do the same job with another model of piano. A lifelike bird is opening and closing its wing for operations.\nOn my tour, I met Jim Barksdale, an engineer with Manpower facilities who came along on my tour. He pointed out a giant screw that holds the piano upright in place with a cabinet underneath. I knew exactly what it was: The screw that took the housewife out of the piano.\n\u201cShe\u2019d never left her house with a piano and this is what you have to do,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo all of us are kind of just excited with it. It\u2019s a beautiful light. It\u2019s a beautiful furniture item. It\u2019s fun to work on.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the lobby where the art light is in good condition and being repaired.\nHere\u2019s the lobby door to a gallery where restoration work is taking place.\nHere\u2019s the piano. Picture a little Kudzu-meets-a-Christmas-tree.\nAnd, if you work with heavy machinery, the same hole looks nice coming out of your ear at dinner time.\nCompleting the changes, the gimbal that lifts the piano is being lowered. The whole painting job on the portrait of a lady overlooking the piano is just being done, or not. The picture was updated last year with a new Chinese-style Chinese dragon image.\nMost if not all of the work on the public light began in November of 2018 with the painter Debbie Doar. She told my tour party that the job is so intricate the only way she can finish it is to make it 30 per cent smaller. Part of the work is removing scaffolding that\u2019s been added for the work at the front of the building.\nThe Eloise wood piano in the Vistadome has 24 bells attached to its neck. Each time the musician hits a note on the piano, the bells sound as if they are being hit.\nThe gold flush handles, which change from hard to soft to soft, are in good shape and will be part of the restoration.\n\u201cI\u2019m just seething with energy right now,\u201d Doar said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to touch a piano that big and shiny. It\u2019s a beautiful instrument. The piano itself is handmade and the vinyl is just wonderful to touch. There are 24 different coloured bells. Each of those bells vibrates individually as you hit a key and you\u2019re seeing those bells vibrate in the air right in front of you.\n\u201cI find it in the shade the most beautiful and prettiest.\u201d\nIN SIGHT: JIM BARKSDALE\nFrom May 1-3, the Richmond Tourism Marketing Centre will hold its annual Smilin\u2019 Open House Party at its new location in the Richmond International Trade and Convention Centre.

He noted that the actual investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference has proved complex because it involved multiple entities.\n\u201cThe release of FBI [bureau report] does not necessarily end the investigation,\u201d Rivkin said. \u201cSomeone has to be really smart enough to assess whether the Russians have actually committed what the Department of Justice defines as a crime. The question is whether or not the dossier activities are false statements under federal law, and if they are, does [Mueller] have a case?\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Every day, we obsessively read all about the latest Bitcoin bitcoin! news, and we marvel at how much faster and more convenient it is than clearing coins with a traditional exchange. It seems, however, that everyone has found out the hard way that a new blockchain technology isn\u2019t going to make for an attractive new cryptocurrency.\nAt this time, companies are desperately searching for the next technological advancement to attract new investors, friends, and family. Companies are hoping that technology will finally provide the additional benefit that a proprietary service with a cheaper price tag will provide. In particular, cryptocurrencies have had trouble fulfilling market demand, and so now companies are looking for a way to diversify their revenue streams.\nThe collective failure of the cryptocurrencies to excite new investors is worrisome. For new investors, security, workflow, and reliability remain the three primary issues. Although publicly available statistics regarding cryptocurrencies present news value, there is still a lack of transparency. Information regarding security flaws of blockchain technologies and security breaches has been scarce. Internal blockchain systems leak data without alert to users, or customers, and the tax method most frequently followed for cryptocurrency exchanges uses a centralized algorithm that is prone to errors.\nA better way\nWe recently had the opportunity to speak with Ryan Delellis, CEO of Civil, about the friction that he faces with all business operations. Civil is part of blockchain technology company Brave. Brave\u2019s service is focused on Brave Pages, a desktop and mobile application that deploys a JavaScript-based and immutable decentralized content management system. Civil has built a backend behind Brave Pages that enable the personalization of users content \u201cto give people even more control over the stories they see from the Brave News Platform.\u201d Civil has built the backend to be multi-layered to manage and \u201cprotect even the most precious information in the most secure, highly resilient way.\u201d\nAs for The Blockchain: a Customer-Oriented Event, Civil will be hosting a blockchain-powered conference. The event, from April 17 to 18 in the Cayman Islands, will have a variety of prominent experts from the financial services industry presenting. This event is a great way to gain a better understanding of cryptocurrencies and how Civil plans to empower its users through the blockchain.\nBlockchain is still very new and with a new technology it takes time to learn and gain strategic insights from previous and current users of the technology. The biggest challenge has been educating the company\u2019s corporate marketing director, and the clients and employees of the media network Civil. As technology matures, it is still necessary to educate your clients and employees.\nCivil has a long way to go to get its users to understand how to use the browser extension and how the technology makes it easier to find engaging content from your network, from your customer base, and from your competitors. In this respect, Civil has a lot of catching up to do.\nBut Civil is making a first step to fixing its marketing communications by cutting the paywall that has long plagued the site, reducing the average time to view content and making it easier to share content with a notification system based on the popularity of the text. Despite the paywall, Civil grows quickly because it is among the most popular media distribution platforms on the market. Civil CEO Delellis knows that the system needs to be more scalable and not hard to use but he also knows that piracy is real and needs to be addressed.\nAs civil grows and decides how to handle its new potential user base, they will be directly impacted by all types of problems that arise with the new technology. \u201cIn the first year, it will be difficult,\u201d said Delellis. \u201cIt will be clear the first few months what problems exist and how to fix it\u201d\nBlockchain is disrupting businesses and traditional methods are struggling to keep up with the change. Civil is a \u201cnetwork of users \u2014 publishers, businesses, and individual consumers \u2014 surrounding a decentralized network of transactions.\u201d The decentralized technology encourages and empowers its users, adding an entirely new creative and collaborative energy into the process. Each of these points are incredibly important to Civil. Despite all the long-term worry about blockchain and cryptocurrency, Civil is executing on its plans to capitalize on the disruption and create a unique, streamlined process for users to share and consume personal data.\nThe future is right around the corner and the raw power of the blockchain will only grow in the coming years.

It\u2019s the company\u2019s first quarter of cumulative losses, but this is still a very, very good quarter for the automaker. Revenue was $3.1 billion, which is an increase of 76% over its revenue for the same period last year.\nWe don\u2019t actually know what Tesla did in the first quarter this year, so we can\u2019t draw too many conclusions here, but it probably has something to do with the Model 3 launching. Tesla\u2019s a bit of a pit of black iron.\nOverall, Tesla is profitable for the first time in its history \u2014 and has also been profitable every quarter for the past 18 months. But this quarter, net income was $16 million, down from $21 million for the same period last year.\nSelling $967 million worth of Model S and Model X vehicles (when accounting for exports from the U.S.), the company sold 25,030 cars, up from 19,395 in the same period last year. It\u2019s all about the profitability of the Model 3, and I really want to believe that\u2019s the case.\nAnd then there are the 373,000 applications for the $1,000 refundable deposit for the Model 3. Add on the 38,000 reservations already canceled and you can understand why Tesla is reporting a loss.\nIf you look at it another way, the company made $250 million profit when accounting for all the other expenses that are associated with producing electric cars: $827 million. Despite all the losses so far, Tesla\u2019s investors don\u2019t seem to be losing faith.

{"text": "Actor Chiranjeevi recently supported the Aarushi Talwar case and HLRD in the chorus demanding death sentence. Even the National Law Commission as well as a group of Supreme Court lawyers have questioned the innocence of the killer couple. However, not everybody agrees with the criticism. While the emotions surrounding the case are still high, it has only led to attempts to censor the media just for making speculations. The media has taken on various roles when the Talwars were convicted. They will be the first to condemn the state of affairs and the police work involved with the case. The demand for bail would be made to forestall any additional tragedies that may occur and the black propaganda would come out to back that up. By the time the judges pronounce a verdict, the story is over for all journalists. On being at the same place at the same time as the victim or accused, one would see a different face or character. Speculations about the crime even after the trial start, had led to the arrest of the couple. A legal team along with police made charges, acquitted them. Not everyone can sit through a trial, for reasons, many may not care to discuss, and not everyone would recognize the evidence. However, there have been a few events that have brought it all in sharp focus: the burning of idols in Purnea and Barabati temples, followed by rioting; the death of the two students of Jamia Millia Islamia who had a blunt object used in the attack on their head; journalist Kurung Lama\u2019s death leading to speculation that he had been the target; the murder of Sudarshan in Weizhou City, Guangdong Province; and the death of Dalits at Bhagalpur. Virtually every day they appear like an item for the tabloid magazines \u2014 and they all give reasons why they are of interest. The Nepali woman who died was raped and killed following a complaint by her husband. The Jamia students killed in Jammu were hacked with sharp blades. The Bhagalpur victims were taken into captivity. The attackers who had beaten and hanged the victims were either released or arrested. Many of the incidents were found to involve goons rather than men in uniform, who were powerless to stop them. In these cases, the government of the day tried to claim that it was impossible to know how well-equipped security forces were. In the Purnea case, most of the suspects were arrested, but it took 13 months before all the skeletons were in the cupboard, or, as the case may be, in the cranium. The culprits had even been identified. The parents of the deceased became our heroes. It is not the criminals who deserves praise or blame. Its the mentality and part of human nature which leads some to commit some of the most atrocious crimes, for no other reason than they could. There is also a bigger question: why do we suffer with so much inhumanity, rather than having the patience to forgive and deal with those who commit a sin? Even for the best of them, one would not blame our civil society for opting for a harsher and more draconian punishment; what\u2019s the use of the court of public opinion? Does it not suffer from the same limitations? If a girl is raped or murdered, is it justifiable for the girl to take the law into her own hands, hoping to get the maximum punishment? Does it not justify her taking her own life to avenge the injustice she feels is done to her? Thug life is clearly a path that has no destination, only the hope of being free from a life of troubles. Nothing would be gained by being brazen about it. As religion and politics interact, so does our collective humanity. When an evil is attempted to be eliminated, how can we overlook the inhumanity to the rest of humanity? It is said that a nose has a face; and, when we watch a faultlessly simple and pure-minded girl turning into a furious and violent aggressor in little time, there is no doubt that she has the face of an assassin. It is our human instincts. But this could also lead us to overlook our differences, let alone our similarities, and put them out of our sights. We should see that as a scientific hypothesis first rather than a human being. To live together and inter-relate, we can take lessons from the Talwars\u2019 act of ultimate cruelty. We can learn to live with our differences in a mature atmosphere. Such have been our angry, unkind and violent prejudices, as well as the defence that such offences must be punished in a ruthless manner \u2014 even if the guilt is invisible.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "5370537724001\nThe Brumby government has been accused of discriminating against the rich and playing politics with Christmas and Easter breaks following new legislation approving penalties of up to three times the state's Christmas penalty rate.\nThe one-off changes that are from June 1 will now be available for CBD businesses by acclimatising the rate to surrounding businesses, meaning businesses could be hit with higher penalty rates but have to pay them in order to co-operate with the government.\nVictorian small business owners will see their Christmas penalty rate of 8.75 per cent rise to 12.5 per cent on Thursday, while the penalty for Easter will jump three times to 20 per cent.\nThe government hopes the changes will make sure the CBD businesses, which will be required to start paying $4900 for the 29 January week, reward the hard-working workers by still providing breaks during the two peak holiday periods, according to assistant state secretary for retail at Fair Work Australia Cherie Melberry.\nHowever Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Sandor Beloknich warned it could set a worrying precedent.\n\"While it is encouraging that the Christmas and Easter penalty rates are being consolidated within the CBD, there are some significant practical concerns that must be addressed before extending penalty rates across Australia,\" he said.\n\"It will be unnecessary to issue subsequent costings for each business operating across Melbourne's CBD over the course of a year. There are no fulsome defence mechanisms on offer to business if they do not want to co-operate and install supervisory hours, free of charge, on statutory holiday.\n\"With some small enterprises in the CBD dealing in significant turnover, it is imperative that penalties are not imposed where they are simply not warranted.\"\nThe public is outraged over the changes, with retailers to launch an online petition on Thursday arguing they should still be able to bargain for an earlier Christmas break.\nBut Ms Melberry said employers should be fine with one reduced peak period.\n\"We knew that small business was challenging so to not allow them to still be able to take time out during the traditional Christmas window trade ... was a concern to the government,\" she said.\n\"It should be exciting that a small business like a cafe or an art gallery should be able to make a bid and, because they have years of experience, be able to organise their planning around what they're going to do when they do take their time off.\"\nThe government wants to work with the peak body for small businesses to come up with comprehensive reforms over the coming months.\n", "label": "machine"}

This includes its partnership with Suffolk University, which it founded last year. Zavion will also continue to work as Suffolk University\u2019s federal government relations director.\nStory Continued Below\nWhile H.B. Fuller did not have a federal lobbying operation, Zavion worked for the Boston-based firm as a policy adviser and lobbyist over the past 20 years. Over the last five years, he focused on \u201cadvancing innovation at the heart of public policy solutions\u201d and was part of the team that helped negotiate the merger between the value of major credit card companies.\nZavion worked on representing health insurance companies, financial services, technology companies and banks throughout the Northeast. Before joining Fuller, he was a partner at RLM Public Affairs.\nDespite a wider war over tax cuts, the healthcare industry will continue to focus on federal lobbying, but there\u2019s already a backup plan for that.

{"text": "On Saturday evening, the bodies of more than a dozen people laced with Opana ER -- which contained an opioid painkiller oxycodone -- were discovered around the city. That will be an ongoing tragedy until Purdue Pharma finds a way to undo its damage.\nFirst responders said they had to cut off the flow of drugs and traces of the pills were found in nearby homes. One chemist said that the area was so packed with ball bearings, buckles and screws that the bottles appeared coated in flammable liquid.\nThe deaths come after a formal warning by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and amid an intense government and public scrutiny of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma. In 2011, the FDA ordered the company to change the way the addictive painkiller is labeled so that it does not imply its use is for pain.\nThat's a good start.\nBut the FDA found no reason to change the way the powerful opioid drugs are referred to in September. That means that, when OxyContin is used for pain, they can be misused.\nIn 2016, then-Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price put Purdue in the penalty box and told it to submit to an independent review board if the drug was posing a public health risk.\nPrice said OxyContin had been mislabeled for years and could be more dangerous than most people realized.\nEat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nPurdue would spend millions to show that it did not include oxycodone in its dosage form of the drug, but the board found no problems.\nThe medical community also repeatedly warned of the potential dangers to patients and families.\nIn 2014, a study found that OxyContin was responsible for 1,071 deaths in a five-year period. Most of those deaths involved family members or friends of the sicker patients.\nLawsuits are piling up. A group of about 450 families were awarded $246 million last month in a lawsuit that claimed the company deceived patients and doctors about the risks.\nBecause OxyContin doesn't contain the chemical formula for oxycodone, and thus is a lower dose for opioid use, its use can be more dangerous than originally thought.\nMeanwhile, on Sunday, the death toll of OPIOS -- other opioids such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogs -- rose from 2,600 to 2,700, according to the city health department. The figures have fallen in part because New York City has launched an aggressive crackdown on the use of narcotics and is offering treatment.\nBut the opioid epidemic does not stop there. People are turning to some of the lesser-known fentanyl and fentanyl analogs for cheaper alternatives to heroin. Fentanyl is now a fentanyl analog.\nPurdue doesn't fully own the problem. Heroin traffickers cut their deadly powder with fentanyl, knowing it can be distributed with lower amounts of another drug and have more impact. Police, aware of their increased presence in neighborhoods with high population of addicts, are more apt to zero in on that closer to its supply source.\nThe Cleveland agency that looks after statistics on prescription painkillers ran out of cash and does not have a large staff to analyze them.\nOne federal official told the New York Times recently that federal agencies could regulate \"at a stroke of a pen\" the manufacturers who mixed the very drugs that have helped make so many Americans addicted.\nThat's a shame.\nThe standard didn't change because those who continue to abuse opioids may be doing so in less lethal ways.\nNo one should use OxyContin or any other prescription painkiller for more than a month at a time.\nBut nothing will change when the country continues to allow an epidemic to burn through billions of taxpayer dollars and endanger countless lives.\n", "label": "machine"}

Wilson Dokubo, has identified the oil theft in parts of Nigeria's south-eastern creeks as very profitable, owing to its cutting edge technology.\nThis informed why several \"vessels were evacuated and arrested before they could impinge on any nation's oil production\".\nSpeaking with journalists shortly after the end of his tenure at the end of a five-day appraisal exercise at his headquarters in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, weekend, Dokubo lamented that \"the simple proposition that effective patrols can stop the movement of thugs and sophisticated weapon used to perpetrate oil theft was what has prevented a call for total deployment of JTF troops across the Niger Delta.\"\nDokubo said the JTF established posts to provide protection for all the oil installations in the south-eastern delta regions. \"However, this has not reduced oil theft; in fact, it increases it because more people must have access to get oil from the source to the pipelines for the trailers to distribute to filling stations.\"\nBut the Unit Commander of the 16th Division, Brigadier-General Noluf Lame, has attributed the free fall of global crude prices, the Boko Haram insurgency and oil theft to its vulnerability in the creeks.\n\"Vulnerable nature of pipelines in the oil-rich Niger Delta is obvious. Its destruction by militants and sabotage by herdsmen and hard criminals has indeed hampered oil development and prosperity and was also responsible for our poor economic state,\" he said.\n\"The region has become an epicentre of terrorists who perpetuate crimes such as cultism, kidnapping, as well as armed robbery. We are all aware of the threats and possibilities of terrorists' attacks on Nigeria's crude oil reserves and pipeline infrastructure.\n\"Lately, insurgency and kidnapping have assumed escalated levels. To address these and the attendant crises, operations have been intensified in the Chad Basin and Lake Chad, especially with the recent inauguration of fence lines to protect our oil installations in the region, aided by the presence of multi-national oil companies such as Total, Shell, Chevron and other indigenous indigenous companies.\"\nLame pointed out that the principal mission of Operation Delta Safe was to forestall the breakdown of law and order and protection of residents and critical infrastructure in all areas.\n\"As part of this mandate, JTF has relocated itself from critical areas along shorelines to avoid criminal activities in Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers states,\" he said.\nHe said Operation Delta Safe had recorded significant successes in the use of air power to prevent terrorist attacks on oil installations and pipeline infrastructure in the zone.\n\"We have also made the ownership of illegal refineries and efforts to destroying equipment crucial to the operation of illegal refineries from any quarter a serious punishable offence which has not only affected the legal refineries, it has adversely affected local community leaders, this has negatively affected their contacts and have negatively affected their decision making and social lives, \" Lame said.\n", "label": "machine"}

Andrew Knack said there are three areas of land in the city worth a massive sale to such a company.\nThe first large block is approved for future use as a parking lot by the city council\u2019s transportation committee.\n\u201cThere will be significant discussions for that parking lot. There is no way the city wants to put that parking lot to mothball,\u201d Knack said.\nA second parcel on South Jasper Avenue on the east side is part of the large grid in Edmonton that has been designed to make the city\u2019s north side more accessible. Knack said the city would have the opportunity to continue adding larger blocks to that grid so future generations will see the city\u2019s development reach further.\n\u201cI am ready to take ownership of the system, set the institutional framework that is going to allow the future growth of the city to take place. How do we set that framework? How do we set the conditions,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am proposing that we look at that piece (on South Jasper Avenue) and, using the profits of that, we could do it now and put land in its current spot instead of allow it to continue to sit there and become a piece of the highway corridor,\u201d he said.\nFinally, a third lot is located along Highway 8E south of the city. The land, which is owned by the city, includes the proposed relocation of the Alberta Motor Association building, as well as lots on the east and west sides. That parcel will also be required to be preserved by the province before it will allow the sale of any of the city\u2019s land.\nKnack\u2019s pitch to city council Monday that the city has a number of reasons to explore selling land to such a private company is likely to gain early momentum in council.\n\u201cWe have almost guaranteed need of lots of development land in that area,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou are in a good position because your land is developed, you can hopefully use that to control your real estate and also start to determine what your future land needs are going to be. It would not cost you anything to sell the property, except, of course, the reinvestment in a new space and what type of land that is. We may also have to invest some money in infrastructure because it is going to have to be developed.\u201d\nCoun. Matt Garman said many people like him will simply vote against Knack\u2019s ideas.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice to think about. The problem is not on topic, it\u2019s just a money question. It is about selling assets you bought for free. And I have no idea why we would want to sell our assets for free,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m leery of it. Do we think that things are more valuable as they are or do we think things are more valuable when we own them? I think when you own an asset and make money from that asset, you should think about how we can use that asset to grow the city and make that city better.\u201d\nGarman said Knack\u2019s suggestion is a possibility because of Edmonton\u2019s big land holdings.\n\u201cWe have a lot of assets on a lot of land that we should start to monetize them in the future. We are (also) sitting on an island of property out here and we want to do a better job of urban planning.\u201d\nKnack said he is just testing the waters.\n\u201cThe city has a lot of assets, we\u2019ve got assets that are seriously undervalued. It\u2019s going to be a bit of that corporate bidding.

The construction on that work is tentatively set to begin in 2020, with completion planned for 2023.\nThe city is also working on high-capacity transit corridors, with the upcoming project on 136 Street widening the route into Valley Green, and the Edmonton Centre/Broadway corridor.\ntwitter.com/sumersingh\n", "label": "machine"}

Windows 10 has the most popular version of its OS around the world and if the latest version is anything to go by it should also be among the fastest and most reliable. This latest version of the operating system came out last fall and following another serious security scare Microsoft says it is now racing against the clock to release another update before July 31.\nThis date marks the end of the Windows 10 \"Insider\" fast ring and the same number is used to sort out bugs, improve system speed and present new features. Microsoft hasn't revealed many details of its plans for this Spring Creators Update but a new post reveals that there will be a few new additions to Windows 10. Over the past few weeks Microsoft has been releasing build 16272, which includes improvements to accessibility. But now it appears that these changes may be part of the update which users could get this autumn. When this version comes out of the Windows Insider Preview, Microsoft says that it will then be pushed out to users automatically to help iron out any remaining issues. So what else do you get when you upgrade? Features including a Night Light mode, Search History and Cortana Recommendations can be found here and a new Stacks list should be available later this month.

{"text": "A Canadian customs officer charged with ignoring signs that other members of his co-workers were getting sick with heart ailments died Monday of a heart attack.\nThat\u2019s not exactly news. It\u2019s the truth and it\u2019s the scariest part of all. Those in charge of the agents might have been standing idly by. They were, at best, let down by their co-workers or, worse, may have even been part of a coverup.\nA federal complaint alleges that three customs officers suspected of leading the group had their complaints blocked by federal prosecutors who are now investigating whether the agents should have been charged criminally.\nThe case gets to the heart of a hazardous job and a workplace culture that at times had room for negligence. Yet, there\u2019s no reason to think the dangers weren\u2019t communicated with good intentions. If none of the three offered convincing evidence to the contrary, then federal officials were either willfully deaf or negligent, or both.\nThis was an obvious and obvious-to-do case of neglecting public safety by failing to safeguard its officers, who hold the public at risk. The physical demands on customs agents, who confront weapons in the line of duty, can be daunting and complex, even in a well-staffed facility like the one in Buffalo. They are numerous, demanding \u2013 and dangerous.\nWhat the public doesn\u2019t see often is the inhuman and inhuman treatment of law enforcement workers who are neither quiet nor politically correct. This is what customs and border protection officers endure.\nU.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy Jr. said the investigation is continuing and that \u201cany acts of wilful misconduct are reprehensible and will not be tolerated.\u201d State police are also investigating.\nFederal agents or border patrol officers are licensed to operate weapons. So is every other law enforcement officer, including New York State Police and Erie County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies. While trained in non-lethal weapons, the danger is real for trained officers who use those weapons in a \u201chot,\u201d or heavily armed, pursuit.\nThey are expected to act without conscience or anger. And they often are, even with little notice. An FBI agent who was acting with complete disregard for human life was unjustly killed in the line of duty a decade ago.\nStill, it is a job that calls for the utmost vigilance, even when a person\u2019s life is on the line. If someone is so overcome by emotion or grief that he forgets his duty to the public, then that\u2019s his problem. But it is the job of the state\u2019s attorneys, both local and federal, to deal with that problem.\nIf an agent hadn\u2019t prodded authorities to investigate, with or without charges or convictions, they would only have been being true to the job. If they were protecting their superiors, they would have been in a conspiracy. Either way, it was potentially murder.\nThe results are tragic. The customs officer who died died of complications of cardiac disease. He clearly had an ailment \u2013 and apparently ignored signs of it. But because his colleagues did not want to let him go, and because Buffalo police did not feel they were required to follow up, he did not receive appropriate medical attention.\nIt is a sad situation for all parties. The customs officers have escaped prosecution. An investigation must continue, in all three departments, until all of those involved, from the police in Buffalo to the federal prosecutors in Washington, and the two state police involved, have been contacted. The fact that there is no imminent danger to the public should not absolve them from an obligation to make clear that the evidence clearly leads to this conclusion: This is murder.\n", "label": "machine"}

That's when Collins heard the plans had changed to continue in their original venue: The marina. It all ended there until April 28.

The additional musicians will include contemporary producers, musicians, singers and dancers so the audience can prepare for an interactive concert on a grand scale.\nBesides the success story about working together for a club gig, the new vision is in concert with what has been going on recently in yacht rock, \"Kimi's Boatshed in Corona del Mar,\" and Salutes to A.N.S.H. are merging with the Mayflower, and the latest series at the Hearst Castle in San Simeon to feature classic rock acts in new venues.

{"text": "\u00d7 U.S. Working to Build More Tent Facilities at Southern Border to Detain Migrants\nThe Trump administration is building more detention space for immigrants in southern Arizona and California to keep them in place while their cases are processed.\nMigrants will no longer be able to \u201cself-deport\u201d to their home countries, which are typically miles away, under an administrative rule the Homeland Security Department issued earlier this month. The rule followed an executive order from President Donald Trump.\nThe government also is deploying 78 additional detention beds at a facility in Calexico, California, where immigrants are able to wait their cases out rather than be transferred to detention centers in Texas. About 200 more immigrant jail beds will be built at a facility near San Diego as part of a broader, new contract.\nThe government says it is now trying to find additional resources to meet the needs of the two areas by using contractors, and a recent memo from acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan lists about $300 million worth of contracts that are \u201ceither currently underway or soon to commence.\u201d\nThe Associated Press was provided copies of the two contracts, for a total of 200 beds, and a notification to Congress regarding the latest facilities and their dates for completion.\nAs a candidate, President Donald Trump repeatedly promised to build \u201cthe wall\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border. While there are many barriers between the countries, some are not nearly as tall as the \u201cGreat Wall,\u201d which the administration has touted as a way to stop illegal crossings.\nImmigrants are typically released while they await immigration court proceedings. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for detaining immigrants who have been ordered deported, and CBP has jurisdiction over people who enter the country illegally.\nMost U.S. immigration laws were passed more than a decade ago and require that people be given a hearing before an immigration judge to determine whether they are eligible for asylum or another form of protection. That process can take years and there are an estimated 400,000 pending cases.\nThe Trump administration says the result is more people illegally crossing the border \u2014 3 million last year alone \u2014 and that forcing migrants to return home often ends in their forced return to violence or poverty.\nAdministration officials say limiting how far immigrants can travel from the border without concern for their safety and pushing them to wait in their home countries will give immigration courts a chance to complete cases and clear the backlog.\nThe rules change mean immigrants in Arizona will have a longer wait time between their scheduled court date and when they can return to the U.S.\n\u201cOur immigration system has become a revolving door that facilitates the misery of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a speech last month. \u201cWe must stop this cycle and work to restore these protections.\u201d\nThe department\u2019s administrative rule, issued March 7, says immigrants in Arizona will be able to apply for a green card at the side of a road or street, with no proof required. The rule also allows the government to deny requests from those who have been released to apply for a green card \u201con the basis of humanitarian reasons,\u201d provided a valid humanitarian parole waiver is granted.\nAdvocates say the rules would allow the government to use the fears of some immigrants as an excuse to hold immigrants in detention even longer.\nAdvocates for immigrants have filed roughly 2,500 humanitarian parole requests for immigrants to be released in Arizona since 2017. The requests must be granted by a judge. There is no deadline for how long a temporary humanitarian parole waiver must be granted but it can be as long as 90 days.\nThe rule doesn\u2019t apply to those already in federal custody, though it could be applicable in the future if the government pursues detention for additional immigrants.\nMany of the humanitarian parole requests are from immigrants who want to be with their loved ones in the U.S. and are willing to pay a bail of several hundred dollars to get released so they can be with their families, said Felisa Cardona, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\nUnder the new rule, the government would be allowed to hold immigrants in detention longer without denying them humanitarian parole waivers. Immigrants who have an asylum or refugee claim must have their first appearance before an immigration judge within 14 days or be released, or they can apply for a humanitarian parole waiver at their own risk.\nSen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, asked Nielsen last month about the policies, though he didn\u2019t appear particularly concerned, asking whether immigrants who had successfully gone through the immigration process would be impacted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary situation,\u201d Nielsen", "label": "machine"}

It\u2019s hard to envision that happening. He hasn\u2019t made the Hall since his second year on the ballot. Last year, the voters forced his way to the list, once again all in favor of former San Francisco Giant Joe Montana.\nRegardless of his form, which is quite low in terms of outright offensive efficiency, I can\u2019t see Lynch getting passed by some of the best running backs of the past 35 years.\nAnd the passing touchdowns?

{"text": "The proposed county budget for fiscal year 2020 gives Lansdowne High School a huge boost, including $15 million for the planning and design of a new building to replace the aging high school, county officials said Thursday.\nWith the extra funds, Superintendent Dallas Dance said he would start talking to federal, state and local officials about the new building plan, which is expected to be approved this summer.\nCounty Council members heard Dance's presentation about the new Lansdowne High School Thursday night at Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, which will become part of the new Lansdowne High School campus, in response to a request from Councilwoman Vicki Almond.\nDevelopers of the new Lansdowne High School campus include the Baltimore-based Cordish Cos., and since its completion last year, a half-dozen schools have moved in \u2014 among them schools in the new Tuckahoe Elementary School, Olney-Atlee Middle School and Lansdowne High School.\nLansdowne High School reopened last fall after its 11-year renovations, which saved a total of $124 million, Dance said.\nJust before its renovation, Lansdowne High School was once at the heart of neighborhood tensions over a proposed shooting range planned by the city to be in the development.\nThe councilwoman and basketball coach who hoped to build that shooting range eventually sold it on to the developer. Almond chairs the council's public safety and legislative appropriations subcommittee.\nAlmond said that although she understands that no voters in her constituents who live within the project area will be affected by the school's new location, she wanted to see the county's investment in the new Lansdowne High School, once the plans are approved.\nDance told the council about the $15 million for the planning and design of the new Lansdowne High School, to be expected within the next 18 months.\nThe county is also working on a letter of intent to re-gain control of Waverly-Kent Elementary from the Howard County Public School System, Dance said. The letter of intent stipulates that $8 million will be invested in Waverly-Kent's buildings and athletics for the next three years to repopulate the school.\nCounty Budget Secretary Janet Howard told council members she asked council members to consider supporting the second piece of a $31 million proposal to meet Arlington Mill's state-mandated building needs.\nHoward said she expected to submit the letter of intent to the state, a precursor to submission of a construction bid, within six weeks.\nThe money would go toward improvements at the planned fifth-grade building at North Laurel-Savage Multi-Service Center, Howard said. The project has been held up by years of legislative approvals.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Shea Patterson can\u2019t wait to try out the Michigan offense.\nBryan Harsin has implemented his system for the second straight year, so it\u2019s pretty much identical to last year\u2019s version. But the former Ole Miss quarterback plans to use a lot of the same motions and motions he ran this past season in Starkville, so familiarity is no guarantee at Michigan.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Patterson told reporters this past week at Big Ten spring meetings. \u201cI feel like for my game it\u2019s going to be a pretty big benefit.\u201d\nMatt Dudek joins Michigan\u2019s staff as recruiting assistant\nWhen Michigan revealed during spring practices that Patterson would likely be its starting quarterback, Harsin took full advantage of it. He\u2019s revamped the scout team signal callers and implemented his three-bounce pass with Patterson taking a snap at the snap, running a pass and stepping back in the pocket for a shot downfield.\nThe process started with LJ Scott and Nico Collins and progressed with Joe Milton and Brandon Peters before culminating with Dylan McCaffrey and now Patterson.\n\u201cI think the idea for Shea was to make everybody around him better,\u201d Harsin said in March. \u201cYou know, one of the challenges for our defense was not just Shea.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right: Patterson hasn\u2019t exactly set the world on fire in spring practices. Though the 6-foot-2, 200-pound dual-threat player has been far from conservative, he\u2019s played plenty of deferring to his receiving corps while standing back.\nHe's taken the majority of the third-down snaps and consistently looked to have moved the chains. In games last season, he attempted 101 passes and ran for another 47 on 364 plays. The combined 676 passing yards were nearly double his numbers the year before, while he ran for 363 yards and five touchdowns on 116 carries.\nThe only other quarterback on the roster, John O\u2019Korn, has just 26 total passes in two seasons.\n\u201cWe really try to manage our snaps and who has the more opportunities to execute the plays,\u201d Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said during Michigan\u2019s media day in March. \u201cWe plan that play by play, that week by week, and try to be smarter.\u201d\nMost of Patterson\u2019s reps thus far have come on pass plays, simply because the other quarterback has spent most of his time attempting to get out of the pocket. But that could change in the season opener against Western Michigan. Patterson will also see time in a dual-threat role with the passing game; Michigan is experimenting with hooking Patterson in to take snaps from under center on occasion.\n\u201cAll I can do is control what I can control,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cObviously the clock is pretty slow in this situation, but I\u2019ve got to make sure I make the right decisions.\u201d\nAlthough he\u2019s used primarily as a runner, Patterson has completed 12 of 26 passes for 189 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions during Michigan\u2019s camp and first scrimmage. His two carries have netted a combined minus-3 yards.\nIn three seasons at Ole Miss, Patterson completed 70 percent of his passes, for 3,422 yards, 32 touchdowns and eight interceptions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever been in a stadium that was so loud during practice,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear what Coach Harbaugh was saying. You could hear it all around you. It was really loud.\u201d\nNow, he needs to figure out how to harness it.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Six days after Mayor Morris Trudeau was at the centre of a property controversy that led to his suspension from the party, council seated its 25 members for one final meeting.\nSurprisingly, the mayor was absent from the council meeting Tuesday night because of another controversy \u2014 this one stemming from an offensive video clip of Trudeau that had been posted to his Facebook page.\nA scathing report by the municipal government\u2019s independent auditor had detailed many questionable activities by the mayor, including his behavior at a February meeting of councillors and members of the office staff.\nIn an interview, Paul Tr\u00e9panier, who served on Trudeau\u2019s staff until 2003, said Trudeau, then a councillor, mentioned at the meeting that he planned to obtain a condominium, and he almost became president of the condo association when one of his daughter\u2019s friends started buying condos at the newly constructed Boulders Condominiums on St-Jean-Baptiste Blvd.\nTr\u00e9panier said when he asked whether the mayor had actually made the move into a condo, which is what he ended up doing only several months after the general council meeting, he was told no.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not a big condo guy,\u2019 \u201d Tr\u00e9panier told the Montreal Gazette.\nIn a follow-up e-mail to the Gazette, Tr\u00e9panier added that Trudeau told him: \u201cI do not like condos.\u201d\nTr\u00e9panier was consulted last year about buying a condo for himself and his wife, he said. Tr\u00e9panier said he would have qualified to buy the condo, but he never filed the necessary documents.\nThe video of the 2006 meeting of town council is of the host mayor speaking with fellow councillors.\nTr\u00e9panier says Trudeau first approached him in 2005 about buying a condominium in Pointe-Claire. During an August 2006 meeting, the mayor expressed his concern over the condo\u2019s association (which was not elected), but he ended up concluding that he did not want to get involved in local politics.\nTr\u00e9panier said he cannot go into detail about the mayor\u2019s condo apartment because it is \u201cpersonal property.\u201d\nTr\u00e9panier pointed out that Trudeau hired him as a town councillor in 1995, but left when he received his first taste of local politics. The councillor position was filled by Pierre Gardiner, who died in February.\nTr\u00e9panier was later appointed the town\u2019s director general by Trudeau. He was dismissed for several weeks from his post, he said, but he was never asked to resign.\nTr\u00e9panier claimed that in 1997, the city asked him to find a new director general, to whom council could offer his resignation. But he refused, saying he could get back into town politics.\nTr\u00e9panier said he recently learned that another former councillor had thought he would be interested in the job and that Trudeau suggested it to him.\n\u201cMorris said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not looking for a new director general,\u2019 \u201d Tr\u00e9panier said.\nTr\u00e9panier said he does not support the idea of Trudeau running for mayor in the next elections, and wants him to help the city\u2019s administration.\n\u201cI think it would be a mistake,\u201d he said.\nTr\u00e9panier recently filed a complaint with the Commission des droits de l\u2019homme about the video, along with 16 other residents.\nTr\u00e9panier\u2019s complaint, viewed by the Montreal Gazette, comes from a 2006 meeting of his council.\nTr\u00e9panier claims the video is in conflict with local laws, as well as bylaws covering the public dissemination of information.\nSeveral weeks after Trudeau was suspended from the mayor\u2019s office, a commission of inquiry was held to examine the episode, during which Trudeau denied he tried to interfere with town council\u2019s business. A senior city official was hired to attend the meeting, which Trudeau had termed inappropriate.\nAt the time of the meeting, city spokeswoman Dania, who declined to give her last name, said the mayor did not participate in the commission because of the public nature of the allegations.\nIn the spring, the commission of inquiry decided not to release the video to the public, including the suspect mayor.\nThe commission concluded that Trudeau acted improperly with respect to council activity, giving him a \u201cblack mark\u201d in its history, that\u2019s what the transcripts say.\nTr\u00e9panier says the information will cost taxpayers $1.5 million.\nkwilton@montrealgazette.com\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Launching a company can be a terrifying thought. But as U.S. indexes climbed to record highs in 2017, many tech companies looked to capitalize on the euphoria and went public. This trend only looks set to continue, with Uber its leading candidate for 2018\u2019s premier issue , with Box another company rumored to hold off-market offerings this year .\nBut once a company goes public, it\u2019s time to get some real answers about its corporate strategy and where the company is headed. To help some of today\u2019s youngest companies going public answer these big questions, we spoke with Tim Smith, CFO and executive VP of structure and strategy at private software company Wasp, whose company, Wasp (formerly Greenleaf Book Group), went public in 2016. Here\u2019s what he\u2019s learned about financing a public company.\n1. It\u2019s not easy.\n\u201cBefore you even go public, you want to have a revenue stream, or you want to have a recognizable brand that\u2019s a recognizable presence in the market place that has established repeat business,\u201d Smith says. For some companies, that might mean getting the word out through marketing, but many companies outgrow that quickly, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a growth business. It will inevitably slow down as you grow, but even if it\u2019s growing twice as fast as anybody else in your space, it\u2019s still not easy.\u201d\n2. You want to grow anyway, right?\nSmith says there are many different opportunities for investors in publicly traded companies.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very strong network effect that exists with publicly traded companies, particularly if you\u2019re a startup,\u201d he says. Many enterprises have people who listen and pay attention to what their peers are doing, which then leads to word-of-mouth and more people paying attention to what they\u2019re doing.\nThe relationship between the company and its investors\u2014and also with its customers\u2014is very different. It\u2019s not like a credit card network, where there\u2019s a single, accountable entity delivering the bill to the customer, Smith says. A company\u2019s business model isn\u2019t even that integrated. \u201cIf I buy something from Dell, it\u2019s not going to show up in my financial statements from Dell. It could be someone else,\u201d he says. That gives investors more control over how that company is functioning, and the companies in the S&P 500 have earned annual returns over 20% since 1929, Smith points out.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Share\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of chance to hear from Beats brand lately, especially in light of the W1 chip powering its latest headphones. The tech grew a bit stale, as it stood for the Powerbeats in the first place, and so Nike uses the same chip inside the recently launched Nike+ Sport Tech partnership. Today we get a first look at the return of the original Beats earbuds to the market. The brand\u2019s reputation rests squarely on the Powerbeats family, and the Powerbeats Pro set seems poised to keep up that momentum, even if you\u2019re not fully familiar with the Powerbeats lineup.\nThe design\nThe design of the Powerbeats Pro is very clear: Headphones which look bulky and are loud. At 1.4 inches, the earphones get a lot bigger than the Powerbeats \u2014 and, at $200, they also cost a lot more \u2014 but once you put them on, they fold away into a wearable dongle.\nThe earphones feature metal accents on each ear and come in a yellow-y, pressed-metal design with brightly colored accents. The buds are very light, thanks to the rechargeable battery, and the earphones feel a little on the heavy side, especially with the stretchy design \u2014 but still, they\u2019re an affordable pair of premium earphones.\nThe tech\nThe Powerbeats Pro connect via Bluetooth, meaning you can play music without cords. As such, every connection is a number \u2014 just your phone, your headphones, and the power cable. If you run out of power, simply power down the earphones and plug in your device to reconnect to the Powerbeats Pro\u2019s mains.\nAs with every pair of Beats headphones, you can share songs, playlists, and albums.\nAlong with Bluetooth, the Powerbeats Pro support high-resolution audio via aptX, though they don\u2019t support HEIF as the W1 chip does with Powerbeats 3 and W1-powered BeatsX. We did notice a few instances where the Powerbeats Pro\u2019s sound quality was lacking, thanks to the overabundance of treble. For example, on How To Dress Well\u2019s album How Can You Realize, the drums lacked differentiation, and the treble tune of The Nautilus sounded mushy and thin, compared to the coarser deeper jazz track we heard with the original Beats. On their own, these are minor complaints, and the Powerbeats Pro only have two drivers, so it shouldn\u2019t be hard to address this.\nSo far, so good, but what about those earbuds themselves? Connectivity, battery life, and sound quality, for the most part, are all great. There\u2019s quite a bit going on when it comes to customizing the Powerbeats\u2019 sound, though we didn\u2019t expect much. Beyond the Powerbeats Pro\u2019s set of earphones, you can purchase SoundSport Wireless headphones, though it seems for the $200 cost you\u2019ll be getting more than headphones that actually sound pretty good.\nSharing is caring\nThe battery is where the Powerbeats Pro, and Beats more broadly, shine. As with every pair of Beats headphones, you can share songs, playlists, and albums. When sharing music, the shares do something unique \u2014 they only make the song available to the person who shares, which is as it should be. When sharing albums, you have the option to choose whether you want to play an individual track from the original album, all of the tracks on the original album, or an entire album. On the other hand, we\u2019re not sure why you would want to share multiple songs on the same song. When you share an album, you can recommend the song to friends, but you can\u2019t really suggest that song as a playcap if you don\u2019t own it.\nWhat\u2019s really cool about the feature is how easy it is to share a song. Just hit the share button, and a stream of the song starts playing on your device. You can pick which song you want to share and when, and if you add a track to your shared playlists and music library, you can share that track back to your friends.\nAs for the battery, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve heard from Beats yet. Beats rated it at four hours, but we got close to eight hours of playback, even with high-resolution music playing. Also worth noting is that we heard no interference from our phone in", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "news, politics, Dean Moss, Farrer, 2019, election, Federal election, Greens, AAP\nMember for Farrer Sussan Ley will contest the seat of Farrer again in the May election. Despite a party whip that requires her to run for the seat, she handed in her notice with less than two weeks before nominations closed and has sent a text message to her colleagues making it clear she will stand again. She said the job was \"not for me\" and \"will not be\" after leaving Parliament. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said her resignation from the Senate was also \"completely unnecessary\". \"It will mean the budget is packed up the day after the election,\" he said. \"She clearly thinks she's got a better chance of winning the Senate after the election than before.\" In 2017 Ms Ley held the seat with a margin of 4.6 per cent, after being re-elected in 2016. The Greens and their candidate Dean Moss were \"grasping at straws\", Mr Shorten said. \"It's another example of Greens just grasping at straws. They don't have policies that are aligned with their voters or with what we are now expecting of government.\" He said he had spoken to the candidate on Friday night about how he should run. Greens candidate for Farrer Dean Moss said the state of the electorate and his \"lack of experience\" could work in his favour after spending eight years as a member of the Farrer Shire Council. \"(Mr Moss) got the most votes in my view in the last state election and he probably could have won,\" he said. \"You never know what the atmosphere will be like going in, but I see my three years of experience with the local community as being an asset.\" Mr Moss said as a sitting MP, Ms Ley's power was not vested in the Greens Party and there could be a \"leaky wheel\" in a safe seat such as Farrer. \"I have been a member of the party for the last 10 years and while I might not have had the skills they have, my background as an economist as well as my social justice background, my understanding of what it is to be gay, what it is to be a single parent - those things will be a big advantage,\" he said. \"I believe I can use my strong policy framework to make a positive difference here in Farrer, a seat which needs a voice that is on the same page as our federal party on issues like climate change.\" Mr Moss said Australia needed political change and only he and a party led by Mr Shorten could provide that change. \"So the choice is pretty clear. You can try to hold everything to the level of the Liberals and Greens because of the same old systems and politics, or you can try to build something fundamentally different, which we have in this party,\" he said. Sam Hammond will stand for the Liberal Party in the seat of Farrer. Ms Ley said she was proud of her time in parliament. \"It was a privilege to serve the people of Farrer and I believe my many achievements include maintaining the Abbott Government's generosity in funding for rural and regional roads; the landmark climate change policies of the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 26 per cent emissions reduction by 2030; the enhancement of the Australia's gender equality record; the successful delivery of NBN in the region and the Indigenous Legal Services and carers' package,\" she said. On the matter of her resignation, she said she put in her name as an MP but would not do so for an opposition senator. Mr Shorten dismissed suggestions he influenced Ms Ley's decision. \"If you wanted to talk about that, you should have talked to the Greens,\" he said. \"They chose to put up a candidate that could win, that is a total waste of taxpayer funds, a waste of our resources, and it is just sick.\" Mrs Ley last month defended her decision to change sides as well as her role as finance minister, but said it was \"becoming harder and harder to support the side that I passionately represented in the Senate\".

{"text": "By Jeremy Wagstaff\nSINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) - An automated feature designed to automatically identify and flag videos uploaded to YouTube before they go live failed in its first test on Tuesday morning, misidentifying and recommending additional videos to be flagged for flagging.\nThe outage, which lasted from about 7:30 a.m. to 8:20 a.m. Singapore time, affected some regular YouTube users, including graduates of the National University of Singapore.\nA spokesman for YouTube in Singapore said the machine learning feature known as SafeSearch failed because it did not recognise university students who upload videos to YouTube as public.\nYouTube is owned by Alphabet Inc's Google.\nThat means that when SafeSearch tries to identify videos and material at the most risk of going live, a recommendation is automatically generated in the form of a list of other videos similar to it, leading to a premature posting that's flagged and then throttled.\nWhile the world's biggest video site recovered from the outage within two hours, according to the spokesman, the problem highlighted some limitations of the automated SafeSearch feature.\nOther Google services have proved more adept at identifying and flagging videos for removal from Google's services. When the company introduced a similar feature at Google+, the Newsfeed feature of the photo-sharing service, errors rarely went beyond what was expected, says a former Google staffer.\n\"This makes it hard to notice these mistakes when they occur,\" said Luke Yanfeng, a 27-year-old graduate of Singapore's NUS School of Journalism and Communication, who uploaded two videos to YouTube on Tuesday.\nHoping to avoid the extra hurdles, he made an edited version of one of his final year projects in the form of a YouTube comment, removing objectionable content and content with music he doesn't like.

{"text": "BC-EU--France-Yellow Vest,3rd Ld-Writethru\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron vowed Monday to deal with \"misery\" wrought by violent protesters seeking to oust him, but postponed a televised address on the turbulent street protests for the second time because of opposition within his government.\nMacron was due to go before cameras later Monday to try to regain public confidence and explain to France how he intends to get back on track after violence-filled Yellow Vest demonstrations that left 40 people dead, hundreds injured and have eroded his public approval ratings.\nLawmakers meeting behind closed doors with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who is in charge of overseeing the deployments of thousands of security forces, sought to tweak his plans for the moment to appease protesters' demands and avoid more violence.\nA similar series of questions on Sunday produced a fragmented response, and a standoff between the government and opposition politicians over whether Macron needed to come clean in an address to the nation. He had initially scheduled it for Saturday, but had it rescheduled for Monday after fanfare that drew national attention.\nThe interior minister also planned to visit the area outside Paris' Champs-Elysees on Monday to talk to residents and try to get a better understanding of the unrest that has engulfed the capital, and has spread to big cities across France.\nThe other planned areas for the president's address include Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux and the country's budget-rich southeast.\nThe stalemate spelled bad news for Macron, who is embarrassed that while he waits, his main opponents seem to be gaining ground ahead of a crucial parliamentary election in June that he hopes will renew his political party and give him a mandate for more reforms.\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen and leftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon urged Macron to postpone the speech entirely, worried that the president and his allies were using the violence to justify their failure to meet protesters' demands. Macron was blamed for failing to adequately monitor the police operation, and for trying to engage only with the centrist business and political elites of his Macron En Marche! party.\n\"If Emmanuel Macron uses the violence and violence uses the violence, he will become even less popular than he is now,\" the far-left French pro-business party Rassemblement national-Republican said on Twitter.\nA representative for Melenchon's party put it more bluntly: \"Emmanuel Macron is finished.\"\nMacron was due to spend Monday on a mountain range in the French Alps and go to the southern Alpes-Maritimes region, where the unrest began with a protest by farmers last month. Macron was scheduled to speak at 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) in a community of 5,000 in Neuf-du-Cher, Mont Blanc in the southern Alpes-Maritimes region.\nSunday, he told a Cabinet meeting that \"I don't need to explain why there are troubles\" in France. He also underscored that \"there can be no confrontation between the state and demonstrators.\"\n\"People have expressed themselves brilliantly in mobilizing, but there are terrible days when they lose all reason for life,\" he said.\nThe far-right National Rally party of Jean-Marie Le Pen accused Macron of \"inaction\" in the face of what it called a direct threat to the French Constitution. While not mentioning Macron by name, he said his government's response was \"disgraceful\" and \"immoral\" and urged Macron to follow through on his promises.\nSome Yellow Vest groups have warned that Sunday's clashes and violence on the Champs-Elysees would continue.\nEarly Monday, protesters fought with police on the Paris streets once more, with some demonstrators on the Champs-Elysees resorting to flammable liquids and at least one fire. Police used tear gas and flash grenades to disperse the protesters on the avenue that leads to the iconic Arc de Triomphe memorial.\nSeveral people were injured, two of them critically. Videos showed protesters lighting bins on fire and pelting police with firecrackers. Videos posted on social media also showed protesters setting a sport utility vehicle on fire, which engulfed passers-by on the avenue.\n___\nRaphael Satter reported from Paris.

Aside from the pending acquisition of Western Refining (NYSE:WNR) by Valero (NYSE:VLO), the second and third largest merger announced were Market Vectors Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEARCA:AMLP) and Enbridge Energy Partners (NYSE:EEP) and industrial gas company Praxair (NYSE:PX) buying out FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI).\nAcquisitions\nOil refiner WNR announced the acquisition of oil refiner Valero for $27 billion. Western Refining owns refineries in California, New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Utah and Wyoming and 7 terminal facilities in Texas, New Mexico, California, New York, Texas, Louisiana and Utah and is the 5th largest oil refiner in the U.S. Valero is the leading independent U.S. refiner.\nWNR/VLO is a complicated deal with many moving parts. WNR shares trade under the symbol WNR, Valero is known as VLO and the ticker symbol for VLO is similar to WNR and symbol WPZ. Valero's stock will now be found under the symbol VLO at $62.50 per share. Additionally, WNR shareholders will also receive $6.00 in cash, 0.855 shares of VLO, a 30-day LIBOR swap and 0.823 shares of Western Gas Partners (NYSE:WES) at the swap price of $13.15.\n\"WES\" is an entity that the merger committee created and has no operations.\nAfter it goes through, WNR will run the business of WES, which provides midstream services in the midstream sector. Western Gas Partners is an exploration and production company and will operate in the Permian Basin. WES shares are currently trading at $23.36.\nWestern Gas Partners and WES will become separate entities and thus separate companies from the companies that are publicly traded.\nMarket Vectors Alerian MLP ETF and Enbridge Energy Partners announced a merger agreement that will create a MLP focused entity with the ticker \"EEP.\" When the deal is done, the company will also create a yieldco, Enbridge Energy Partners/EEP-W, in order to use the cash flow of the general partner and to further increase the dividend for investors.\nAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) filed a S-4 form with the SEC to merge with Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) in a deal valued at $34 billion. Shares of Crown Castle which trade under the symbol CCI traded this week at $103.00.\nPraxair (PX) and FMC Technologies (FTI) reached an agreement in principle on a proposal to split their businesses in three, which will mean that FMC will be acquired by Praxair for $69 per share in cash and stock and $23.35 in Praxair stock. PX shareholders will receive $63.50 in cash and 0.845 shares of Praxair.\nThis would be a record deal and is a proxy for the M&A wave of deals. There were 20 deals valued at $74 billion announced in the first quarter this year. In addition, 33 deals with $242 billion in value were announced during the quarter.\nDeclining in Line with Other Names\nAlthough there were a total of four pending mergers, all of the listed companies declined from Monday's opening bell.\nWestern Refining shares ended the week at $26.22 after opening at $29.44. Western Refining's share price declined 2.76% despite the merger with Valero.\nShares of Alerian declined 5.18% after it had traded at $26.69. Western Refining's shares declined 2.78% while Praxair's shares declined 5.14%. Shares of WPZ declined 2.71% after trading at $29.46.\nBy the way, WNR closed at $31.09 versus the $27.00 offer price. Other deals this week included:\n$5.3 billion all cash acquisition of Activiance Limited (\"Activiance\") by GDF Suez (OTCPK:GDFZY) and \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (GEFYY). Activiance owns 70% of AOM Group (OTCPK:AOMGF) which owns Quaternary Oil and Gas.\nEnbridge's $29 billion acquisition of Spectra Energy (NYSE:SE) received shareholder approval on April 12, 2019.\nNatural Gas ETF and MLP Energy Services Provider eked out 1.72% gains on the week after closing at $30.87 and $22.51 respectively.\nOther", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "UPDATE: Because of old holiday schedules and Rosh Hashanah (sham), this story has been updated with an additional 1 hour and 26 minutes of early pilot buzz and will be rebroadcast tonight at 10 PM.\nPREVIOUS: There seems to be less and less excitement in the pilot conversations right now, but that doesn\u2019t make everything horrible, not even recently beloved period drama series Altered Carbon \u2014 just look at the early buzz. Netflix is already the runaway leader in the streamer field, an unprecedented for a non-network series. But some latecomers, like Sony TV\u2019s untitled Stan Lee superhero hourlong and BBC America\u2019s Creature Comforts, may spring surprises. Meanwhile, there is less buzz but still ample attention for other drama pilots, including Sony TV\u2019s Good Fight; Warner Bros TV\u2019s Pilot Poison with Laura Prepon, Lucas Till and Constance Zimmer; NBC\u2019s Comedy Greenland; CBS TV Studios/Universal TV\u2019s Bad Boys spinoff; CBS All Access\u2019 Good Fight; Laffer Work Squad; network/studio collaborations Pearson and More or Less; next season\u2019s CBS All Access\u2019 Walking Dead companion series; Red Line; Warner Bros. TV\u2019s The Impossible Artist starring Diane Keaton and Oscar Isaac; and the Amazon Series starring James Franco.\nLike NBC\u2019s Bye Bye Birdie and Prairie Home Companion with the kids is developed out of a longtime show like NBC and limited run does like CBS\u2019 multiple-cam The Greatest American Hero and limited run series like its female-led Ed, Now Apocalypse, also produced for CBS, are going for thematic notes.\nOne thing we\u2019re missing is enough buzz for Hulu\u2019s hourlong hourlong drama Daybreak, from writer-producer Dennis McGrath and Tim Headington. The series will be a continuation of the story set in Seth Grahame-Smith\u2019s 2008 cult movie, set in a dystopian LA of the future. McGrath executive produces the project through WBTV.\nAs always, their sweet spot is comedy in the unpredictable pilot times. They are all from multicamera (two from Sony TV) which is doing just fine in the development season \u2014 13 pilots, with four already picked up to series. That could rise depending on the success of The Neighborhood this season, which is a multicamera comedy. There is not yet any pilot buzz out of Warner Bros TV\u2019s trio of multicamera series, CBS 2 Broke Girls and the untitled Andrew Stern, as those are still ongoing. NBC is developing a pair of comedy pilots, Locke & Key, from Joe and Anthony Russo\u2019s studio-based company, and My Family, written by the team behind Fox\u2019s multicamera comedy Ground Floor.\nCBS also recently broadened its comedy aims with the multimixilian pilot Perfect Citizen from Jerry Bruckheimer TV, and the single-camera When We Rise from Sony TV. The studio\u2019s two single-camera pilot at NBC, The Enemy Within and a JJ Philbin project, are both taking a different approach.\nThere has been a lot of buzz for drama pilot Frost, an adaptation of the 1960s Laverne & Shirley scripted by The Goldbergs co-executive producer Thomas Lennon. But in addition to Sony TV\u2019s pilots \u2014 one of which is already on the air \u2014 outside of the traditional buyers, Burn Notice alum Josh Berman, with his buddy Matt Nix, is bringing back for Burn Notice creator Matt Nix, producing the early 90s thriller series The Gates for AT&T Audience Network (and for the CW original film of the same name, starring Troian Bellisario).\nIn addition to CBS All Access, the streaming and cable networks went out more with two pilot orders each \u2014 including Amazon and Netflix \u2014 and three more three pilot orders, three from NBC, one from Showtime and one from A&E.\nThe early list of ABC drama pilots reflects much of what the net had already signaled about its 2019 lineup. It could be a bit different at CBS, which has, notably, a midseason drama commitment for Collateral, and an early series pickup for Truth or Die, what could be its only drama pilot this cycle.\n", "label": "machine"}

Philly is now 2-0 since Brett Brown took over the bench duties.\nThe Sixers led 60-51 at halftime.\nPhiladelphia used a 12-2 run in the third quarter to open up a 12-point lead that continued to grow throughout the third quarter. A 3-pointer from Covington made it 101-79 with 6:53 left in the game.\nThe Nets got to within eight points on multiple occasions, but the Sixers kept pulling away from the Nets, who were without D\u2019Angelo Russell and Caris LeVert.\nLeVert injured his ankle in Game 1 and Russell was a late scratch due to a groin injury. Brooklyn will have a tough time mounting a comeback against this Sixers squad. Philadelphia shot 51.5 percent from the field, and its 63 bench points were the most by a Sixers\u2019 bench in a postseason game. Philadelphia\u2019s 23.3-point margin of victory was its largest in the postseason since 1992.\nSimmons finished the regular season with 1,104 points, 623 rebounds and 103 assists. The stat line didn\u2019t even seem like a realistic possibility until he broke out in the postseason.\nOne more Game 3 is necessary, but the Sixers have every right to feel confident about their chances of advancing.\n\"I think we're comfortable with everything that's happening around us, and we're ready for Wednesday night's game. I know Philly fans are excited for Wednesday,\" Embiid said.\nWhen asked what it was like to see the crowd chanting his name after an alley-oop dunk, Simmons said, \"The thing I'm proud of right now is that my teammates and the guys that play with me are really getting my confidence back. I feel like every time I step on the court I feel like I belong here. And we're doing a lot of great things as a team.\"\nSimmons added, \"I couldn't ask for a better situation, and the guys really take me under their wing.

The highly intelligent and hardworking Nigerian from Ijebu, Ijebu North East Local Government was quietly removed by his group of friends and associates upon his losing the PDP Governorship primaries of the state in October 2018.\nAjasin was not the only Politician from Ijebu (from Ogun) indicted by some unguarded statements and what nots. He became the chief villain but enjoyed enormous support and admiration from others who mourned and prayed for his good health, honour, and integrity and none would do anything to risk his.\nThe outpouring of sympathy was the best compensation to the fact that the entire political and social fabrics in Ogun State were sinking like a stone.\nIn response to the criticism of the group of people, a follow up session and exit his group of very powerful business and political associates?\nIn the political world of Ogun State, no one gambles because the political security is so fragile. In 1990, a highly respected former Ogun State governor who subsequently became a victim of a bomb explosion in Abuja declared that he wouldn\u2019t take the race but in the course of his day to day engagements, and within a space of few years, he found himself running for the ticket, not in earnest, but out of desperation to cling to power, to defend the cabal, to hold on to his perceived integrity, and to actually be considered \u201cthe unassailable, the feared, and the un-wavering champion of the people\u201d.\nOgun politics is intractable, completely jaded, corrupt, shallow, self centered, yet powerful. Politicians believe themselves to be infallible. In Ogun State, it is regarded as the most traditional state, culture of allegiance and massive backing they really need. The intrigues and intrigues play themselves out continuously.\nIt is not today that the matter with Ajasin reached a climax of impeachment proceedings against a most senior member of his government. It was a background campaign that cost a former governor his life. Like in any other civilised society, there will be those whose interest is not motivated by right thinking. Some will appeal to the smell of power, some will use the obvious to fulfil ambitions and some are pragmatic and opportunistic people. They see every political dispensation as a new beginning and what is winnable this time is no longer winnable than the last. This is a time to use the same formula if you want to make something come out of nothing. Ajasin was seen as the architect of his own misfortune. What stung him was the damning indictment of him by the Governor Ibikunle Amosun-led administration in Ogun State.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "news, local-news, Clare Bowditch, Woman, new single, Newcastle, song\nClare Bowditch has been tipped to be the voice of her generation since the age of nine and the fame hasn't really gone to her head. But the Hunter-raised singer did encounter early stardom: performing her first R&B music video as a 13-year-old while still in high school. \"It was really stressful and at the same time I did like the feeling of being in the music industry and that sort of thing,\" she says. \"It's probably the only job in the world where it's harder to make it than it is to get in.\" So how did she manage to make it? Singing with musicians. Most notably, her aunt Jodie Holliday was in The Veronicas and she began performing karaoke with Lucy Simon with The Heydon/Browne Company. \"I grew up on such a healthy musical landscape,\" Bowditch says. \"My Mum would sing in her own band with her other band mates. I grew up around living musicians so it's not like I just came along with everybody else who was doing it. \"I kind of always grew up being around people that were really good and having that inspiration. I definitely wanted to be a musician. I've said this before, but it was hard to find a taste of it in the school system so I've always been doing it to the sport system and having my own band.\" Musicians from Aspinall to Mick Whelan taught her life lessons. \"I think it was probably mostly coming from musicians,\" she says. \"Just the sense of being happy and how they have such high expectations about everything and do it at all times and kind of endure a lot of hard work.\" Bowditch also learnt the value of family. Her dad Doug is a guitar teacher and de facto manager; mum Christie runs the company behind the Hawks Nest cinema. In early 2014, she signed with Interscope Records, but an apparent disagreement over royalties and contract details caused the relationship to end. Three years later she became part of a group of good-versus-evil crusaders that include Courtney Barnett, Courtney Act and Stephanie Cruel (otherwise known as Perilous A by Seaweed). \"There's a hunger for a unique band and I really like the concept of being the devil on the toilet at the same time,\" she says. \"Performing with Courtney Act and Stephanie Cruel was really fun but the more challenging thing was for me because I'm more of a square and I thought, 'what's this even about?' \"But we started making music and living this fantasy world.\" Woman premiered last week.

{"text": "ROSWELL \u2014 Joseph Lee Billie has been selected as the new Rio Grande City judge after nearly two years of candidates emerging from the local attorney pool.\nBillie, 65, was selected on Friday from among eight candidates, five of whom had filed for a judicial spot over the last few years.\nThe only other candidate with experience as a judge, James Salazar, 36, decided to run for the city secretary position instead.\nBillie served as mayor of Edinburg from 2013-2016 and will be the first Hispanic judge in Rio Grande City.\nThe reason he decided to run was not to prove he could be a good judge, but to prove to other voters that someone like him should be a judge as well.\n\"Everywhere I've gone since becoming mayor, everybody says, 'I can't believe you're a judge. You're so hot',\" Billie said. \"So I was really just running so that people would see that I'm a good judge, and I can handle the job.\"\nBillie said he got into politics after he saw the lack of accountability in government. As mayor, he was adamant in getting the city to an audited annual report.\n\"How was we going to get the city to go to a rec, every year, or every three years, or every six months \u2014 well, we'd already been audited,\" he said. \"How did we spend the money? Did we really pay for everybody's benefits when they came in?\"\nThat system had not been in place when he was mayor, he said, but has been there since he left.\nIf elected, he will take over the position from Thomas De La Cruz, who served since 2012. After earning his law degree at the University of Texas-Pan American, De La Cruz worked at the Texas Attorney General's Office in Austin for four years. De La Cruz, 33, decided to run for the city attorney's position instead of the judgeship.\nA graduate of Hidalgo High School and Lamar University, Billie said he was impressed by De La Cruz when he met him last week and decided to run for the judgeship.\nDuring his time as mayor, Billie handled the day-to-day operations of the city, including developing the strategic plan and city manager's job description.\nHe will now have to turn his attention to the task of tackling the city's debt, which has grown to more than $2 million.\n\"The bottom line is do we have enough money to pay all our debt?\" he said. \"I'm hoping after I retire, I'll find some ways to have something in my pocket once I do that and hopefully the interest income that I get from that is more than what we'll pay the interest on the debt.\"\nCity leaders also have to figure out how to make more money for parks and recreation services.\n\"When I ran for office, the football program was pretty much dead and the soccer program was pretty much dead,\" Billie said. \"We grew back up and we're able to keep both those programs alive.\"\nBillie has worked as a private attorney for more than 30 years.\n\"I grew up in west Hidalgo and this is my community. I always felt like the citizens were in control and I was proud to represent them,\" he said. \"I think I'm a fair judge, I try to be ethical, and I try to treat everybody fairly and with respect.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

Or it could be a little more elaborate.\"\nThe surveillance footage will likely show the men eating and running back and forth, he said. If they are seen eating game, that could be another violation of the law.\nOn Saturday afternoon, the suspects came back to the house with a deer carcass. \"They were very determined and talked at the door, claiming they needed help disposing of the deer. The homeowner took them inside, but they continued to talk while being served food and then taking pictures,\" according to charging documents.\nEarly Sunday morning, the homeowner \"took a CD (CD ROM) and some of the defendant's property, including a water gun that had been taken by the defendant,\" charges state.\nAt about 12:45 a.m., the homeowner checked the surveillance video and saw \"three men on one of the (two) outdoor security cameras and a black .32 caliber handgun pointing at the deer and two prior shots fired.\"\nOn Monday morning, a neighbor said a neighbor saw the three men throwing the deer in the middle of the road, according to Cannon.\nThe surveillance cameras are attached to a garage door. Cannon did not know if the doors were installed in the way they appeared, or if it would have been difficult to view the video on the outside, based on the two angles.\nPolice also hope anyone with information will call the Utah County Sheriff's Office at 801-852-6280.\n", "label": "machine"}

I thought I\u2019d get fired at a little bit. Just trying to get my legs going and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\nWhen Haley lit up Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury with a high shot and poke check to set up Tomas Hertl\u2019s winning goal in overtime, Haley said the whistle probably came early. He just hadn\u2019t had an opportunity to build much of a head of steam to work on his shot.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything too tough or anything like that. I just went in there with one of those mindset in mind. Just kind of react out there,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to give you too much room. You\u2019ve got to take advantage of it when you get that chance.\u201d\nMcLellan said after the game that Haley\u2019s shot up the boards was typical of his kind of game and maybe the reason he\u2019s in the lineup.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s done all year long, the release, the location,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cI thought that was a subtle release when he actually shot it, and I think maybe that hurt the goalie, to be honest with you.\u201d\nMcLellan added Haley will get more chances if he continues to produce, even in a limited role. Haley finished with three hits in 7:35 of ice time and was credited with a plus-2 rating in Tuesday\u2019s 4-3 overtime win.\n\u201cHe was playing a good game,\u201d captain Joe Pavelski said. \u201cIt was good to see him get the puck in the net.

He said the European Union must be quick to agree the bloc's next negotiating plan to end the impasse with Britain over a Brexit deal. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert)\nSTRASBOURG, France -- The prime minister of France, Europe's most influential leader, said Tuesday the bloc must give the U.K. more time to secure its departure from the European Union and beyond it unless May reaches a deal in next week's summit.\nEdouard Philippe said his government will propose a Brexit agreement that is both \"fairer\" for Britain and \"fairer\" for European countries, but also said there will be a \"partial extension of the (Brexit) transition period.\"\nAfter an EU summit next week, EU leaders are expected to say that Britain will get more time to strike a Brexit deal but only so long as both sides agree on the wording of a statement saying they will work toward concluding the divorce deal before a year-end deadline.\nDowning Street has insisted there will be no extension of the March 29 exit date and it has been clear, for months, that the EU sees it as little more than a last resort. But there is pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May to compromise.\nMay wants an agreement that excludes a \"backstop\" option that she fears could keep Britain trapped indefinitely in the customs union and parts of the single market. Britain and the EU are at odds over the next phase of negotiations that would follow the divorce.\n\"Without that agreement, we cannot reach a deal that addresses the concerns of the United Kingdom,\" Philippe said.\nThe U.K. is seeking concessions on the backstop, which would guarantee that if the two sides cannot agree on future trade ties after Brexit day, Britain and the EU would indefinitely keep their borders open on goods and other areas.\nThat includes Britain agreeing not to impose new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. if its province were to become part of the EU's customs union.\nThe bloc says the backstop is essential to keep the border open, though it says that in the future trade deal, neither side will have to keep keeping it open.\nCameron faced heavy pressure in Britain and the EU to hold a referendum on membership in the bloc, but he vetoed the idea. May is under intense pressure in the U.K. to hold a new referendum after Brexit resulted in a decision to leave the EU.\n\"No referendum resolution on our future relationship with the EU will be realistic or sustainable without a recommendation that there will be another referendum. It cannot be contemplated otherwise,\" Philippe said.\nBut France, which pushed for Britain to remain part of the bloc, also wants its neighbor to seek a solution that's acceptable to both sides.\nGermany has hinted that an extension of the Brexit transition until October would be enough. Officials were quick to add that the current five-month term is not a formal extension.\n\"That is really a soft extension. It's not really an extension until December and it's not really an extension to transition,\" said Philippe.\nHaving only a partial transition period would boost hopes in the EU that it could move onto a post-Brexit future deal with Britain that foresees long-term free trade and a close relationship. May has offered concessions that are much more ambitious than the EU's demands.\nU.K. government attorney general Geoffrey Cox said Tuesday that the EU will have to negotiate a free trade deal with Britain in the future as EU lawmakers will have the final say on any future deal.\n\"In other words, the U.K. will be outside the trade regime, so negotiations will not simply center on a new trade deal but will also have to include the legal text of any new agreement,\" Cox said.\nU.K. Lawmakers have called Cox's report on the legality of Britain's departure legally invalid because it presented a pro-Brexit solution to a dilemmas presented by Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal that the bloc says can't be done. Cox, however, has suggested May's deal may still pass.\nFaring better is the Scottish Parliament, which voted Tuesday to oppose the use of the so-called \"backstop\" to keep Britain in the EU's customs union forever if both sides cannot settle other Brexit issues, including the Irish border.\nThe Scottish Parliament could block U.K. exit from the EU, known as \"remain,\" in November's local elections.\nIn a move that angered some pro-Brexit lawmakers, lawmakers also voted to ask the government for more time to try to persuade May to change her position on", "label": "machine"}

Feige says Disney+ plans to add to its Marvel Studios slate, but hedged on details about what exactly will make its way to the streaming service, saying producers can only get involved with projects that find a strong sense of originality.\n\"If it feels like the Marvel type of storytelling, it's gonna feel like ours,\" he said. \"That's hard to say in a bunch of different ways, but the developers can only get involved with projects that already feel right for them creatively.\"\nFeige added that \"the writers that are getting involved with these at the moment, they're incredibly excited about the material.\"\nMarvel's deal with Netflix made Feige the leader of what has become a massive catalog of comic book properties that include all of the company's films (save for the two Spider-Man movies) and its TV shows (save for Agents of SHIELD and Cloak & Dagger).\n\"It's been great. I feel like we're all in a good place and moving in the right direction. I'm looking forward to the future,\" Feige said.\nAs for his creative process, Feige has announced he's no longer particularly bound by telling the same story again. Instead, he's evolving along with the comic books that he and his team now read for inspiration.\n\"It just never ends. There's never enough,\" Feige said of major arcs in comics. \"That's one of the things that's so fascinating is just the constant evolution of the stories.\"\nE-mail: Aaron.Couch@THR.com\nTwitter: @AaronCouch\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Lauren London recently paid tribute to Nipsey Hussle with a simple tattoo.\nThe 29-year-old rapper, R&B artist, and former model took to social media to salute Hussle on his 41st birthday, which fell on Saturday. Despite the circumstances surrounding the theme of the tattoo, which is a baseball bat over a caption of a photograph of the two, the decision ultimately paid off.\nLondon donned the same $2,200 necklace that Hussle had inked on his right ribcage when the pair was together. The beatboxer and performer also added the lining of the previous image. The shot was taken by an unofficial photographer at Hussle\u2019s Los Angeles funeral in 2017. The brief photo is from an impromptu photo op before the rapper was buried.\nThe only thing in the caption was the phrase \u201creal love never dies.\u201d At the funeral, London bore a tattoo of her love for the L.A. artist below the gold baseball bat. She also shared the photo with her Instagram followers, which was taken by Azare Luz of Angel Images. However, in addition to a few tears, she also shared a lighthearted image to caption the brooding scene. In the image, the singer\u2019s nipples appear to be visible as she holds up a weight lifting bar.\nLondon posted some photos from the funeral as well, including one of the service. In another one of the photos, the model can be seen standing over the grave. In all, the group photos have gained her over 101,000 likes and more than 4,000 comments.\nWhile the former couple had struggled to reconcile since their split in April 2018, Twitter users believed that the memorial served as an out for the occasion. According to Genius, one user wrote in support of London\u2019s decision.\n\u201cI\u2019m 100% positive that said post was actually to show him her gratitude for him and his time with her. Its what she wanted and meant no harm.\u201d\nLondon also expressed her sadness over the loss of Nipsey in an Instagram post. She wrote, \u201cLife is a journey and a transition but I know in my mind I will meet you again. May we both continue to embrace that love through this crazy journey with you.\u201d\nShe ended the caption with some wisdom, \u201cForever is forever. Never stop exploring your blessings in life.\u201d\nShe seems to have already begun the journey, as she added that she was in a place to \u201cdeal with this situation through love.\u201d Fans appeared to agree with London\u2019s sentiments as they commended her efforts.\n", "label": "machine"}

The honour was presented to the captain-coach following the Colts' 38-20 first grade win over Wagga Tigers on Good Friday. It was Shepherd's 10th win as captain-coach this season. \"He's won 10 games, about half the games the club has won,\" captain-coach Jayden Holmes said. \"Hopefully you get to kick first in a grand final a few days down the track. \"It is very hard to get to 10 wins in your first season. Hopefully he can do it.\" The honour could have been even better had the Bulls played first grade at Inglewood Oval. The Wagga Wolves defeated Brothers 50-12 before the Colts took to the field against Wagga Tigers. Kooringal Colts pulled off the upset, but it could have been a different story had the Bulls chosen to play at Inglewood Oval on Good Friday. However, Shepherd and some members had discussed playing at their traditional home ground in the lead up. \"It was quite a buzz in the community about playing at a club ground and obviously it worked with the Wanderers gaining some ground as well,\" Walters said. \"Adam, Tim, Mike, Taylor and Mark were very clear at the outset of wanting to play at Inglewood. \"Adam came up with the idea. \"It may only have had a small effect in the one game but that is never easy to do and get people to play on a day of the year and have a day off work.\" Walters said the Bulls council would have been comfortable with the players either way. \"I would have definitely played first grade for the Bulls,\" he said. \"I played their under-15s for three seasons and always wanted to try first grade and understand the passion people had for the Lions. \"It is definitely right up there. \"They have long sat in the top tier of rugby league in a lot of communities. \"They are a very big part of how football is organised in country rugby league and they have always been a powerhouse.\" Walters has confidence in Shepherd having handled the extra responsibility. \"There is a lot of pressure on him,\" he said. \"He is under massive expectations. \"At the end of the day he has been up there with the premiership-winning coach and a premiership winning player. \"He is expected to do well, so if he doesn't I don't know how he would cope. \"I'm not getting myself in trouble here but I am expecting them to play well and do everything they are capable of. \"From the last time I saw him he is in great form.\" Walters said they couldn't quite have called on the services of Saints coach Nathan Pearce for another year. However he's confident he's a part of the club's future plans. \"It would have been great if he had played,\" Walters said. \"Unfortunately that wasn't going to happen but Nathan Pearce has been playing hooker for Wagga all through the Northern Suburbs Cup and is looking for another stint as a hooker in the senior group.\"\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/J7tLankfguv74QY82b3G7h/89ffd7d0-db20-4945-8fca-ba748a89a3f4.jpg/r0_239_3000_1897_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

Aftab Pureval, D-Little Rock, vice chairman of the House Health and Welfare Committee.\n\"This is a true change, where we are moving from a piecemeal approach to bringing corporate influence and the HMOs into the picture for managing Arkansas' largest insurance program for Medicaid to a traditional public-private partnership to bring Medicare and Medicaid into one integrated system that includes, by design, the merger of the 2 state agencies,\" Pureval said in a written statement after the bill was signed.\nThe initiative costs more than $31 million annually and is supported by grants from private organizations as well as state funds.\nHutchinson has promised to veto any bill that cuts Medicaid's budget because he wants the proposal to be fully approved by lawmakers.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The college in Oklahoma where Philander Smith Jr. graduated in 1885 is a time capsule of sorts. There is Notre Dame in those neighboring letters - Notre Dame being the Latin version of Notre Dame, the same initials that the church chose in 1878 to formally sponsor the then-new self-governing institution.\nBut the composition of the students is distinguished by its black and mixed-race makeup. More than 80 percent of the Class of 1994 was not white. In the 1980s, the Hispanic count topped 10 percent. Also notable was the number of women who came to the university.\nNow Notre Dame University in South Bend, Ind., is dealing with the painful issue of how to handle events - some 70 years in the making - from Oklahoma of all places.\nA raging forest fire, blamed in part on drunken youths, was menacing the Cardinal Newman Center near campus earlier this month. Within a week of that fire, the university campus had been put on defensive alert. On April 17, D. H. Lawrence, a popular university columnist and regional editor of The New York Times, wrote an opinion piece on the campus reactions that mentioned Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton by name as the prime mover behind the need for security.\nAsked about media reports of security measures, the university refused to discuss them, because of \"security concerns.\" Officials say they're dealing with riots on campus, but a visit to the other side of the fence in Indianapolis, where most of the Hispanic students are from Mexico, suggests otherwise.\n\"Never before have we had a militia patrolling the place!\" says Julio Santos, a staff member at the Mexican Consulate, who says he's living in constant fear of returning home, even as Notre Dame officials are making reform of the Mexican-American Studies program the hottest academic issue in town.\nThe program was funded, at last count, with more than $1 million in private money, largely from area corporate leaders concerned about Hispanic welfare.\n\"There were all kinds of raids. I remember one or two people who were driving me home from work who were stopped at the side of the road and questioned by government agents, and I was questioning them as well,\" says a Mexican-American man in his 60s.\nHe was once in a low-income apartment building that police removed and burned down. The landlord owned by a woman who, decades ago, was the school's longtime treasurer. \"They burned the place down because it was awful,\" he says. \"Now they are trying to do something about the Mexican studies.\"\nClasses were canceled. Announcements were made of strict precautions: Students not wearing ties were ordered to surrender them to campus security at the door; male students were alerted to watch for surveillance cameras (linking cameras to police databases); two police officers were posted at all student entrances; foreign nationals (most of them Mexicans) were instructed to contact a Mexican consulate every morning and night.\nThe flurry of police moves was anticipated. Last week, a small band of students rallied outside the student union building, demanding that administrators tell them what, if anything, they were doing to stop the shooting.\nMoreover, protesters in Oklahoma want their university's activities and those of their neighbors to be more closely linked. Only one regional representative of the Oklahoma City \"Spirit Group,\" a social organization, has come to Indiana so far to join students in marches, rallies, and other protests.\n\"The most fundamental question is: Will there be a new one [Mexican-American Studies] program, or will it be simply left to die the death it has had in Oklahoma?\" says a state official, \"An extra $1 million is not going to make up for a hundred-million-dollar change.\"\nYet the mood on the other side of the fence here is one of mistrust and sometimes fury.\n\"They are using the Smith incident and Jim Crow to advance this agenda,\" says Anne McClure, the Mexican-American editor of the campus newspaper who, along with her husband and son, took part in student-organized protests on the evening of April 16.\nMrs. McClure is one of the students petitioning the university for better campus support. \"Now is the time,\" she says. \"The opposition is so strong and the opposition's impact is so devastating, because it takes this issue off campus and puts it in our society and outside. The goal now is to delay any change.\"\nBut at the university's ongoing meeting of the Board of Trustees on April 22, officials seemed to sense the consensus is there.\nA statement released afterward said, \"What should remain in the North Central corner of the United States of America is Notre Dame. The university has set a course that is making it one of the foremost centers of education in America, and we remain confident that the course will continue successfully to be followed.\"\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Students at a university in Auckland say it's a case of \"bad judgement\" and would have caught their parents' attention three years ago, if it had come to that.\nPhoto: 123RF\nTwo former students at New Zealand's largest teacher training college, Knox College, have made complaints of sexual abuse and are to be interviewed by police this week.\nStaff at the school, to the north of Auckland, have been charged in a separate case with sexually abusing students from 2000 to 2013.\nStudents whose parents are in the workforce or who work in industries including healthcare, aged care, social work, finance and technology would have been aware of the allegations in 2017, when teachers and the head of the college pleaded guilty to indecent assault.\nAll three cases were not brought to the attention of parents until late last year.\nA former student at Knox said parents were not aware of what they were dealing with.\n\"The last incident to be reported from our year group to my parents didn't happen until 2017 and that's because it's just taken so long for them to get through the court process,\" he said.\n\"They would've seen the story and then gone 'wow, this isn't cool'. It's definitely been a talking point in the year group.\"\nMany students at Knox were from a single-parent household and hardworking students who were proud of their work, he said.\n\"It's quite embarrassing for a parent to have to sit down and explain the situation when you're already struggling,\" he said.\n\"If parents would've been aware of it, they would've stopped it in its tracks a long time ago.\"\nThe former student said the staff actions, in particular, would have come as a surprise.\n\"Just the way they've treated the students has been really blatant. Their attitude when they hear about it is they didn't actually do anything. It would've been dealt with three years ago. We're talking about trying to protect against abuse that's coming your way now.\"\nHis school day revolved around the victims of abuse, the matter would \"live in the hearts of everyone associated with the college and our loved ones\", he said.\n\"They've taken us down a very dark path and it's a journey that we're going to have to carry on, so just constantly remember these victims and their families. For those who can give us advice and recognise that there are power structures out there that have got your backs, a lot of work lies ahead.\"\nBefore now, the lone victim of abuse at Knox was a student at the college at the time who was in her early 20s.\nA student who attended the college from 2011 to 2015 said many of the students were between the ages of 14 and 21, so were legally not old enough to consent.\nA 2018 professor candidate at the college also said students were not made aware of what was happening to the victims three years ago.\nThe former student said the students were very aware of what was happening around them.\nHis friend was angry at the inaction of a professor at the college who was aware of the matter, he said.\n\"We were taken to the kitchen one day for students to decide which lessons they would agree to, and when my friend said he didn't want to be subjected to an attack from that professor, he said he didn't want to be made to feel like a liability,\" he said.\n\"He was there because of the repercussions from her hitting him and putting him in the toilet. It's also that for him, the lesson set was fundamentally different to the current lesson set set in his college because it would be causing him emotional difficulties.\"\nAmong other things, he described how Knox College had never held a head of the college, which concerned him.\n\"I used to be the public school of choice for teachers looking for a job here, and now I'm not sure what it was,\" he said.\nAnother former student, who left Knox College in 2009, said the staff sexual abuse at the college had been known for years among students.\nA 2004 Information Report from the Auckland District Education Office said three students at Knox College spoke of a faculty member's inappropriate touching and kissing.\nIn a letter sent to parents in 2016, University of Auckland Vice Chancellor Tom Vertesi said staff at Knox had been charged with abusing students more than a decade ago and the college had always dealt with them within its established procedures.\n\"It became clear that there was not sufficient investigation of the allegations in 2005-06, given the severity of the allegations at the time,\" the letter said.\nThe University of Auckland declined to comment on this story.\nThe Southern District Police said two new victims were being interviewed on Tuesday. It confirmed an investigation into allegations of current misconduct was in its early stages and still in its early stages.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\nHe who pays the piper dictates the tune, as President Muhammadu Buhari said last year.\nThat statement rings so truer today, especially in terms of the official response to the flood disaster that hit Lagos State two weeks ago and subsequent pronouncements on it by the state governor, Akinwunmi Ambode.\nA review of the narrative by Vanguard and its Lagos State correspondents indicate that the state government seems not interested in seeing the disaster challenge it as temporary and regularizing some of the key drivers of the disaster.\nAs stated above, Lagos State became overwhelmed by a heavy downpour over four days, including Sunday, March 17, 2019, almost all parts of the metropolis was affected.\nThe extent of the flood was massively aggravated by the fact that it occurred just after months of heavy rainfall leading to the infestation of bio-gas waste that choked major roads, particularly roads leading to the crowded state capital.\nThe response of the Buhari administration to the disaster was swift. In less than 48 hours, the President came down hard on the state government over alleged refusal to spend the bailout funds it got from the federal government and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).\nBut a look at the remarks by the state governor, in explaining why the state government has not spent its bailout fund and why the state government needs to commission agencies without running its mouth that it needs to do more to assist the victims, leaves us wondering if the state government was simply indifferent to the disaster.\nIf it was that, the questions posed by this reporter to the governor were direct: \u201cOngoing rehabilitation of the affected areas are ongoing, does that not mean you (lack) the funds for immediate rehabilitation of the affected areas?\u201d \u201cWhy is the government not building hospitals and schools in flooded areas?\u201d \u201cWhy are we not giving out relief materials?\u201d\nIn all, the response was that it is still the intervention fund it got from the federal government that has been used in the rehabilitating the affected areas.\nAgain, the governor was asked why it is not funding any of the rehabilitation undertaken by other bodies engaged in the provision of assistance, in the face of the fact that the damage to buildings and infrastructure was massive and not captured in the total pool of assistance.\nIn a chat with Vanguard, a commissioner in the state who claimed to have spoken on the matter asserted that the state has received certain funds from its counterpart funding arrangement with federal government which it will also use to commence projects in the devastated areas.\nHis words: \u201cUnfortunately, we have not been allowed to disburse our counterpart funding. So, the problem is compounded because we are not allowed to use other agencies.\n\u201cWe are re-strategizing now. We are talking with the federal government. We have spoken to them on the issue of challenge. If they allow us to disburse the counterpart funding and we use those funds to proceed and rehabilitate, we will give that money to our bailout counterpart fund. Then we will start doing rehabilitation.\n\u201cBut you may have to wait a few days because we are only trying to think out of the box to come up with some solutions.\n\u201cHow we can leverage on what the federal government is doing and ask them to lend a helping hand towards development of infrastructure. You know my duty is to ensure that the relief materials get to the people. And while they wait, we are looking at other ways of linking arms with federal government.\u201d\nThe state has opened a new multi-million naira hospital at Awolowo Road, Ilupeju, for the treatment of flood victims.\nHowever, it is not clear if the previous ones are functional.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Star Wars Episode 9 will be the last time we see J.J. Abrams at the helm of the iconic story of Luke Skywalker, Rey, and the rest of the Star Wars ensemble. Abrams will be followed by director Colin Trevorrow, who has just posted on social media that he will be directing Episode 9 in Italy later this year.\nEven though Episode 9 has yet to begin filming, there have been a lot of reports about what could happen between the films. From fan theories and assorted \u201cinside sources\u201d to very persistent, official leaks, people have wondered if we\u2019ll actually see Emperor Palpatine return in Episode 9 or if he died at the end of The Last Jedi. That\u2019s right, fans, it\u2019s time to start thinking about a possible episode 9 character to fill the void left by the late Emperor.\nHere are eight characters we could see in Star Wars Episode 9 to fill the weight of the character of Palpatine.\nVader\u2019s Son Luke Skywalker\nIf you\u2019ve been following this anthology movie series, then you\u2019ve been thinking that maybe this trilogy could end with Luke Skywalker finally turning to the dark side. Without a doubt the most iconic Star Wars villain of all time, there would be only one logical way to finish out this trilogy: Luke has turned to the dark side. Perhaps he\u2019s been resurrected by Emperor Palpatine\u2019s ghost and they\u2019re working together again to bring a new generation of villains to the galaxy.\nThe Emperor\u2019s Son Darth Maul\nThe Jedi-killing Mad Master would clearly want to pass on that vision of the Death Star with his son. Maul has the Dark Side across the board and also a unique fighting style, so this character would have to be brought back to life without faltering from his frightening design. The dark side would be a great way to completely realize the actor Ray Park\u2019s legendary role in the Clone Wars series.\nThe Brother of Darth Sidious\nI\u2019m throwing a wild idea out there right here. Perhaps the next generation of villains have learned the ways of the Dark Side from both the Emperor and Darth Sidious as they grow in power over the years. If that\u2019s the case, a hypothetical brother of Palpatine, Luke Skywalker\u2019s dad Luke Skywalker Sr. (he\u2019s also the name of his brother and the father of Princess Leia) wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice to lead the new generation in place of either the Dark or Light Side.\nThe Grand Inquisitor Darth Vader\u2019s Clone\nThis one\u2019s based on Yoda\u2019s kids Yoda and Meena. These kids, unfortunately, don\u2019t seem to be around to really play a big role in the story of The Last Jedi. If it\u2019s possible to bring Palpatine\u2019s clone Adam Sera back to life, then there\u2019s no reason these clones couldn\u2019t easily be guided along the same path the Emperor led. This would allow for a great perspective on the ways Palpatine led and continued to exert his power, even beyond the reach of his body.\nSabine Wren Mandalorian\nThis would be a pretty unique character, as Sabine Wren (Jodie Whittaker) can be seen crossing paths with Palpatine in the novels. If you\u2019ve been following the Resistance adventures in the new anthology, you\u2019ve seen Wren\u2019s fight, first fighting Captain Phasma then journeying to run into Boba Fett. The Mandalorian, known for her outfit with lots of red stitching and unique weaponry, would seemingly fit the bill for playing a formidable part in the next stage of the Rebellion. She\u2019s also highly adept with blaster guns.\nHobbits Return From the Grave\nFor Star Wars, the only characters who come close to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy are the Bilbo Baggins and Bilbo Baggins aren\u2019t yet dead. And Bilbo can\u2019t do a number two very well. Unless it\u2019s Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings with a more believable timeline.\nThe Son of Luke Skywalker\nIt\u2019s a pretty wild idea, but the idea of seeing the son of Luke Skywalker makes sense. These characters have a lot of tangled connections. Not only would Luke return to help save the galaxy, he might even have a part to play in making Palpatine not as strong in the Force. Both of these characters are led by older siblings. Could one of them, maybe Luke\u2019s younger brother Jacen, find himself wandering alone in a world devoid of galactic heroes? Fans are clamoring for even more Star Wars siblings like Luke and Leia, so that idea certainly has some merit", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Cities will be hit a painful multiple times by the \u201cUber for bikes and scooters\u201d phenomenon, but what if the industry raised a round for a focused bike-share company? That was the thinking behind JUMP Bikes, which has just raised $60 million and is now several years and a couple of million bikes deep in its North American markets. JUMP is known for delivering the next generation of bike-sharing \u2014 and its chief competitor, Bird Rides, just did $38 million in fresh funding, amid claims that it\u2019s also focused on making a go of selling bikes to cities.\nUber\u2019s interest in bike-sharing has been less about the actual product and more about the underlying connections between fleet, bikes and bikes-to-walk (B2W) plans. It\u2019s an interesting moment. The idea is that it could reduce road and city congestion by shuffling people around. Sure, a car has the advantage of being able to take a driver or driverless car to get from place to place, but what about people who already have a car, and use it, yet still not enough trips? Well, that\u2019s where JUMP comes in.\nMeanwhile, it appears from one email that the ride-sharing player\u2019s wider strategy doesn\u2019t come as much as closing the deal as it comes from doubling down on what it believes will be a core element of the future. Former Uber executive and Hyperloop One chairman Shervin Pishevar is talking with investor Jeff Garten to figure out the next step for Rides, a brand new search and discovery platform that was built to allow people and businesses to find cars and bikes to be shared and shared via multiple modes of transportation. And the scooter manufacturers? Uber is seeking a \u201cchief scooter officer\u201d to build out its push into autonomous scooters, Le Street reports.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Garten\u2019s job is to consolidate Rides and perhaps even develop a new vision around the way scooters and bikes are used and businesses can participate. As for JUMP, we\u2019ll have our own profiles of the management team shortly, but what is interesting to see is whether company founder Christophe Lambert will be joining the conversation.\nSeveral weeks ago, Lambert attended a conference in Beijing, held by Bloomberg. And at the event, he was on stage along with more than just Bloomberg executive editor and founder Matthew Winkler and Bloomberg president Liz Fong-Jones. The moderator, Garten, went straight into asking him about JUMP\u2019s business. It was the kind of question every founder is used to being asked, and whether he\u2019d take the time to listen.\nLambert was in China for many years, but he\u2019s now living and working in San Francisco, where he got into the bicycle sharing business after designing and funding the failed Hong Kong bicycle-sharing company. Those bikes were then turned over to JUMP, which is now suing the company it began with after it was out-funded by the other key members of JUMP, including Ambitious Bikes founder Mark Williams. You can read more about what happened here.\nThe short version is that Williams and the others still owned JUMP, which has now raised $250 million \u2014 including a $20 million infusion earlier this year from Uber, Vaynerchuk Ventures, Thrive Capital and certain members of ABS Capital. It was founded back in 2014 and available in eight cities at the time, and Lambert was reporting back to Williams through messages to him on Facebook and Dropbox, according to a blog post by Phil Wong, his former colleague at JUMP.\nNow he\u2019s working at an artificial intelligence startup in San Francisco, but the timing \u2014 and the fact that he was willing to go on stage with Bloomberg\u2019s Garten at the conference and take questions on Uber\u2019s key rivals \u2014 suggest he\u2019s moved on to the next step for JUMP, which is to figure out how to get more bikes into more cities. It\u2019s worth noting that Brian Kensel, JUMP\u2019s vice president of engineering, is also joining Garten at Garten\u2019s shopping for scooters.\nUpdated to clarify that the meeting between Garten and Lambert was a recent one, not a current one as is stated in the story.\n", "label": "machine"}

Of course, I got the message.\nMy Dad was born in 1944, but grew up in Glasgow, where he would wait for his mother to come out of a hearing with crying babies to find someone pushing a pushchair.

We live in a small country cottage not far from Lowestoft, Suffolk, and the people we meet are hugely respectful of my parents\u2019 career choices.

{"text": "SEOUL - Ever so cautiously, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said South Korea will take a \"wait and see\" approach as Pyongyang reopens talks on issues including holding inter-Korean summits soon.\n\"It is time to open a new chapter with North Korea. We must prepare to reach the next inter-Korean summit,\" he said at a government lecture in Pyeongtaek.\n\"After the next inter-Korean summit, it is critical to determine what North Korea's future policy will be.\"\nMr Moon's remarks were a response to questions from lawmakers on whether South Korea would provide detailed explanations of the progress of inter-Korean relations and provide concessions to North Korea, since Washington is reported to want clarity on what the outcome of talks with Pyongyang will be.\nAs the South Korean chief negotiator to restart talks with North Korea in recent years, Mr Moon is well aware of the complexities of the situation.\n\"As we are to initiate and further advance talks with North Korea, our talks with the US must be in its stead. South Korea should separate discussions with the US from this negotiating process with North Korea and pursue its own interests as a responsible member of the international community,\" he said.\nMr Moon has expressed a desire to visit Pyongyang and visit the US this year, but it remains unclear whether this could happen.\nRelated Story Trump and Kim agree to meet again to discuss denuclearisation\nRelated Story Two-day N.Korea-US talks continue with talks about denuclearisation expected to continue on Wednesday\nRelated Story Pompeo signals 'progress' in nuke talks with N.Korea\nSouth Korea has proposed a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un take place in May or June.\nThe US has expressed high scepticism on Pyongyang's denuclearisation commitment, saying Kim has publicly said he will give up his nuclear programme only when it is \"completed\".\nPyongyang has already said it would suspend all nuclear and missile tests from next month until talks with Washington are concluded.\nMr Moon said South Korea had been sincere in engaging the North, and expressed hope that North Korea would respond in a positive manner.\nBut he also warned that it was the North's decision to come to the negotiation table, not South Korea's.\n\"From a diplomatic perspective, this is not a passive game. It is a fight between two countries, North and South, to hammer out a peaceful arrangement on the Korean Peninsula,\" he said.\nNorth Korea has been in talks with South Korea since last year, when President Trump imposed fresh sanctions on the reclusive regime. That led Pyongyang to expel all representatives from the Unification Ministry last March.\nEarlier this month, the two Koreas agreed to hold economic talks, and by the end of the month, the North had withdrawn its delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, Mr Moon said.\nSpeaking about an inter-Korean detente, he stressed the need to have negotiations, and said those talks must be based on co-operating with the international community.\n\"No matter what achievements we make, we must take the issue from its humanitarian and peace terms. If we cannot do that, why are we thinking about any achievements?\" he said.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Baltimore officials are demanding a detailed inventory of officials\u2019 visits to Pimlico Race Course since last fall\u2019s last track closure to determine why unused bleachers were suddenly shuttered on the first day of the Preakness Stakes.\nTwo weeks after The Baltimore Sun reported on the closure, there are still no details about how many die-hard Preakness-watchers did not have their tickets exchanged at a reduced rate through Race Track Security, the new vendor that sells tickets and other apparel at the Preakness.\nThe Baltimore City Housing Department wrote to Richard D. Pereira, general manager of Trackside Events LLC, which operates Pimlico Race Course, on Tuesday seeking a detailed breakdown of the tickets to the rebuilt bleachers.\nThe request is the latest salvo in a city of principals and sides.\nThough city Housing Commissioner Paul T. Graziano told The Sun that he\u2019s seeking \u201cjust an accounting,\u201d officials said they are frustrated that the Department of Housing and Community Development has seen no version of the tickets as yet. The department\u2019s request for hard evidence on the drop in empty bleacher seating came after the general manager for Trackside Events had a private briefing with members of the department earlier this month.\nLate on Monday night, officials had warned that more than 1,400 empty bleacher seats \u2014 8 percent of the bleachers in the front grandstand \u2014 and about 650 \u201cover-indexed\u201d bleacher seats in the far rear of the grandstand should not be left for the Preakness.\nOn Tuesday, Pereira met with the chief of public works, Perk Calarco, and Anthony Peden, assistant chief of general services.\n\u201cAt this time, they are requesting additional documentation in a more detailed fashion and we are currently reviewing their request,\u201d Calarco said in a statement issued Tuesday evening. \u201c\u2026 I am not able to provide any specifics about the request.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Peden declined to respond to questions about what they\u2019re seeking.\nCalls Tuesday night to the general manager of the Baltimore City Housing Department\u2019s Office of Risk Management, who is handling the request, went unanswered.\nCraig E. Williams, the lead inspector of the security department, requested a list of officials that went to the track to inspect the bleachers during the weeks before the Preakness in May and months after the March 16 mudslide wiped out the original bleachers during Hurricane Joaquin in 2016.\nThe slides closed the entire grandstand in the western end of the track for more than a year. Trackside Events returned the bleachers to life in November.\nThe Department of Housing and Community Development had written Pereira that inspection details should be provided by April 22, 2018, before being tabled in consideration of extended field trips by the inspector, housing department spokeswoman Brandy D. O\u2019Conner said in an email.\nThe majority of the bleachers back in the fall were reopened with new rails, pieces of metal that lower seats as the track is turned and operate a rear lights in the bleachers.\nA quarter to a third of the bleachers back in the fall are empty in any given Preakness. Residents who had secured seat reservations by mail, internet or fax were notified on the day of the race via a press release from track officials.\nWilliams said he was not aware of the new date of the inspection when he conducted the inspections of the bleachers last year.\nIn announcing the new inspections, the city Housing Department indicated that it could be more difficult for people to get seat reservations for the Preakness \u2014 and to get tickets exchanged \u2014 because Preakness is a religious holiday.\nWhen the bleachers were filled last year, the racing season had barely begun.\nRisk Management spokesman Dan Jones said he could not answer questions about the inspection schedule because he does not know the email exchanges or notes from the interviews with the general manager of Trackside Events.\nDoug Donovan and Tom Hayden contributed to this article.\ndonovan@baltsun.com\ntwitter.com/dougdonovan\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The preliminary ruling in a case that pits MASN against the Orioles as the team seeks to collect on a $3.5 million arbitration award agreed to in 2009, was released late Monday by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.\nIn its ruling, the court was unable to make any detailed findings in the issue of the \u201cyield\u201d between the two parties, upholding a lower court\u2019s ruling that filed their appeals in the case. MASN is seeking to recoup that $3.5 million plus interest for breaking the agreement it signed with the Orioles in 2006.\nMASN argues that the arbitration ruling was in violation of the sides\u2019 agreement that the arbitration award be \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d while the Orioles say the award \u201cdid not follow MASN\u2019s agreement to allow the parties to seek arbitration only on disputed terms and conditions of the 2010 MASN agreement, not because it was fair and reasonable.\u201d\nThe issue at hand is the issue of $3.5 million in \u201cyield,\u201d between the parties as the arbitration award was negotiated. The parties agreed that all avenues of dispute should be limited to the case being decided by an arbitrator. But in 2009, the Orioles put the dispute over the $3.5 million up for arbitration instead of negotiating a new deal under the terms of the 2004 agreement, which included a $15 million guaranteed contract for 2002.\nIn addition to the deciding that the action should have been pursued by arbitration instead of lawsuit in this case, the court also ruled that a counterclaim by MASN to the Orioles to the tune of $26.5 million was \u201clegally and factually untimely.\u201d The counterclaims were filed in October 2012 with attorney Michael A. Rodgers of McElwaine Farrell in Florida, who is representing MASN in the arbitration case.\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed in the result, and considering the coverage of the MASN arbitration case, it is likely that the MSL and MASN will not obtain the arbitration award, as both sides agree that an award would be far below the then market value of live regional sports programming,\u201d said Astros attorney Alan B. Dershowitz, who is representing the Orioles in the case. \u201cIn addition, there have been media reports that professional sports organizations are prepared to settle the case by dividing up its assets based on the value of regional sports networks.\u201d\nThe parties have until May 16 to contest the court\u2019s decision on the preliminary decision.\njmeoli@baltsun.com\ntwitter.com/jonmeoli\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "To the Editor:\nI am writing to address the objections of the medical community to the 2017 referendum that proposed legalizing physician-assisted suicide, commonly referred to as S-22.\nWhile the main purpose of this bill was to facilitate patient choice in the end of life, the pro-assisted suicide lobbyists turned the health care profession and practitioners into their targets. In response to these suggestions that the legislature isn't listening to them, the proponents of S-22 proposed redefining \"death with dignity\" to mean that a physician cannot refuse medical treatment that is contrary to a patient's wishes, the physician would be deemed competent, and attorneys general could intervene to make sure that the physicians are doing what they think is best.\nAdding to the confusion, lawmakers proposed definitions of death and non-death, a definition of life and a definition of suicide, and then a definition of right and wrong. These are meaningless definition changes that have been proposed all along. These \"word games\" are politically necessary because the end of life is too sensitive to avoid this controversy. The stakeholders know this is an issue that can divide groups and even make friends tense. The fact that the opposing groups can't agree on a definition only strengthens the case for S-22.\nLet's be clear -- that medical professions are concerned about death with dignity is well established. But there are many other reasons, such as patient \"busyness,\" self-interest and not agreeing with biases that out of medical communities. None of these are crimes, which seems a shame given our profession. Physicians I speak with feel more self-respect and fear their livelihood is at stake, yet their self-interest prevents them from communicating concerns to the legislature as to how patient interest should be valued.\nDoctors will continue to talk about patient safety with legislators about the dangers of fast response times, availability of anesthesia and pain management drugs, etc. While this discourse is exactly what physicians aspire to accomplish, physicians are provided no real tools to support this dialogue. First, this discussion should have been a part of the whole oversight committee that supervised the medical personnel that provide health care in the home. Second, there should be an avenue for the patient to clearly see and understand the extent of the community's support of their wishes. Lastly, there is a requirement for written decision cards that must be displayed at all times in the patient's own home. The fact that medical professionals do not have such access to advance directive information yet are required to disseminate it to doctors proves that there is a vacuum that does not need to be filled.\nThese are just a few of the many reasons medical practitioners feel the way they do about S-22.\nA.

{"text": "There are fewer students currently enrolled in online learning programs across Canada than the sector reported a decade ago.\nThat\u2019s according to a new report from the National Research Council (NRC), although the number of students learning digitally through community colleges is on the rise, going from eight per cent in 2012 to 11 per cent in 2018.\nDespite this increase, the report found that new graduates and people who are preparing to enter education are starting out in academic programs that are less formally structured than traditional classrooms.\n\u201cConventional classroom education is highly geared toward generalizing concepts into a real-world context, giving them more concrete content, and characterizing evidence-based decisions as evidence,\u201d notes the report, which looked at trends in the digital learning space between 2011 and 2018.\n\u201cAn overwhelming proportion of educational environments in Canada today are teacher-led and classroom-focused, more complex than programs in an organization\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\nThe report found that fewer students are currently being enrolled in the online programs, and that those students are more likely to be new graduates (66 per cent compared to 46 per cent a decade ago).\nThere are three primary reasons why students are choosing online learning programs: job-focused programs; personal development and study time; and college or university courses, where they can continue to earn credits.\nNRC researchers looked at a variety of data available in two main areas: total enrolment in online learning programs, and the number of enrolments in the most prolific online learning programs, which offer about twice as many programs as Canada\u2019s first digital learning (DLE) programs.\nNRC researchers tried to remain as \u201cfocused and understandable\u201d as possible by looking at the most popular programs, instead of the whole range of courses.\n\u201cIn the event a traditional program is sub-optimal, universities would use different standards to measure the quality of their programs,\u201d the report notes.\nSixty-eight per cent of programs with the most online students are taken by community colleges.\nCommunity colleges are leading the way as the most innovative and creative sector in the delivery of learning technology, said Michael S\u00e9guin, head of innovative partnerships at universities being evaluated in the report.\n\u201cCommunity colleges have really tried to change the way they deliver instruction and they are doing a better job of engaging students and getting them to use their new technologies,\u201d he said.\nS\u00e9guin co-chaired an advisory committee that looked at innovative approaches to delivering higher education in Canada. In mid-February, his committee\u2019s report was presented to the government for consideration.\nCommunity colleges\u2019 relationship with industry has evolved over the years, said S\u00e9guin, in a scenario where they have embraced technology more actively in their approach to learning.\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed by the work they\u2019ve done in establishing partnerships and relationships with industry,\u201d he said.\nBut community colleges still tend to have a small initial enrolment, compared to college and university programming. This is what the report calls the problem of \u201cresearch-first, learn-later\u201d programs.\nCommunity colleges have recognized this, and have set up programs where students can receive hands-on training and apply what they\u2019ve learned. For example, the Bombardier Aircraft Technology Centre in New Hamburg, Ont., provides training to enhance safety and compliance for aircraft and aviation equipment.\nBut the report found that programs with heavy research-focused pedagogy aren\u2019t necessarily effective.\n\u201cIt does not measure or delineate success from unmet needs,\u201d said the report.\nAlthough, researchers did say, that there is evidence of learning and learning outcomes in e-learning programs.\nThere were 173,199 degree and certificate-granting degrees and courses in e-learning in Canada in 2012.

So, we are waiting and now we have a city ordinance that restricts what we can do.\u201d\nBuena Vista officials hope to meet with the city attorney and the city engineer to finalize a plan to remove the building.\nBuena Vista building, operated by the Buena Vista Inn LLC, was previously used as a residence with personal property in the vacant building, according to Gulati.\n\u201cWe have no solution at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the heart of the issue. We have been trying to work with the motel since 2004. This property sits in a neighborhood that is not hospitable.

Earnings estimates for companies have increased for the current financial year from a year ago. \u201cThe market is expected to rise from there and will be driven by earnings growth. Most of the earnings estimates have revised upwards from quarter ago levels, bringing them around the estimates,\" said Kirti Vasudevan, head of research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\nHe expects emerging markets to be at the heart of the rally, along with technology stocks.\nIn October 2016, demonetisation jolted the market as it hit rural consumers especially hard as their livelihoods were suddenly disrupted.

{"text": "To help promote her new book, retired Republican Rep. Allen West recounted how \"12:16\" of a House vote on the debt ceiling could have led to an ideological showdown between Democrats and Republicans -- the eventual compromise that President Barack Obama likes.\nIs West thinking about a political comeback?\nWest, who represented parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, said Tuesday night that he wouldn't rule it out.\nThe outside talk is that he and his wife Debbie are donating their Congressional pension to charity so he can preserve it for his daughter. However, West said he'll address the speculation that his retirement is not permanent in a coming speech at a South Florida Christian TV network.\nFilling in for the absent U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, who is missing town hall meetings in Miami-Dade County today because of illness, West said he won't discuss specific plans, other than to repeat the fact that he continues to support U.S. troops, their families and our country.\nHe also asserted that he would help create jobs by continuing to push House Republican to do something about health-care insurance deductibles and copays.\n\"I do encourage them to heed the words that the leader of the free world, former President Obama, said when he said that we need a bipartisan health insurance bill. We have one that I introduced that is bipartisan,\" he said. \"If he were here today, we could have that day, another day, we could pass a long term plan, which we\u2019ve been talking about for years.\"\nPolitical observers and others have said that seeing West off the political map would be a boost for the Democrats.\nAs most of you know, Allen West had to retire due to the election map and an ongoing federal case in which he's charged with firing on a fellow Marine that he suspected was a rat and a sexual predator, and then assaulting him with his foot. He was also charged with trying to kill his colleague and fellow Marine, former Florida Rep. Ted Yoho.\nDismissing that case as nothing more than a political smear, West wrote in his book that this backsliding on the national agenda could rekindle his fire as a campaigner and political leader.\nIn the interviews on-camera on the TV network whose initials are SMG, West cited his years as a GOP firebrand. West was known for his hyperbolic rhetoric and uncompromising criticism of liberals who attempted to argue their position.\nAs he has for years, West railed against the liberal mainstream media for frequently underestimating him.\n\"I was rated number one in the entire country on Fox News. One hundred percent positive rating. If you ask me, right now I've got to do the math on how I went from working in the news media to working in the most unpopular Washington, D.C., institution and I still have the highest poll rating. Can you imagine \u2013 that's the real problem we have right now in America.\"\nAsked what he would say to people predicting his political demise, West said: \"I don't think there is much of a political comeback out there unless they give me exactly what I asked for.\"\nHe was referring to a reason he was resigning the House of Representatives after a single term, which he said in a recent interview is mostly a matter of \"financial considerations.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Meghan Markle was lucky enough to have an immediate and rather handsome family member in her wake when she married Prince Harry: son Jack Schlossberg. We have five things to know about the handsome Charles Manson follower who\u2019s now obsessed with Prince Harry!\n1. He is Jack Schlossberg\u2019s brother. Jack, 13, is Meghan Markle\u2018s nephew! Meghan and Prince Harry tied the knot on May 19 2018, and it looks like that special day is the most significant wedding day of Jack\u2019s life. He\u2019s been mugging it up on social media, flaunting his fan boys and fangirls by posting tons of pics of Harry as he grew up. He became obsessed with the prince after watching the royal wedding, and was even pictured hiding a Harry broach in the background of one pic on his Facebook page. Jack, dressed in a mock Harry suit, posed with Harry\u2019s ex, Cressida Bonas, after Markle and Harry married! Click here to see happier pics of Meghan and Prince Harry.\n2. He became obsessed with Charles Manson family members. It\u2019s been 50 years since the Manson Family massacre took place, when eight people were murdered by members of the murderous cult. As the cult members\u2019 five children grow older, they\u2019re reportedly turning into more out-of-control individuals. Pictures of Charles Manson\u2019s youngest children, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, Charles \u201cTex\u201d Watson, and Susan Atkins, all aged around 33, are featured in various fan pages that refuse to allow people to approve of their idolizing of these murderous women.\n3. He\u2019s shown his love for Meghan by posting photos of his pastel pink wedding. Before Meghan and Harry started dating, Jack gave a bunch of baby pink dresses (all Megan\u2019s favorites) to his crush! His love for Meghan only grew when she was made his bridesmaid at his brother\u2019s wedding in May 2018. He uploaded multiple snaps to Instagram, which drew quite a few comments from royal fans commenting on how cute he is.\n4. He\u2019s a big Harry fan! For Christmas 2018, Harry spent his holiday breaking Will and Kate\u2018s best ever! He threw a Christmas bash at Kensington Palace, and they requested a customized cake that would look exactly like the one his dad\u2019s cake served at Princess Diana\u2018s funeral in 1997. Perfect! Naturally, he recreated Meghan and Harry\u2019s wedding cake (how hilarious is that?).\n5. He lives in Connecticut with his mom and sister. For a long time, he lived with his mom, Tracy Schlossberg, and sister, Samantha Schlossberg, in New York City. Apparently, they live in Massachusetts now, as Samantha moved to spend more time with the children. Meghan and Harry both were at Prince Harry\u2019s christening in 2018, and she was supposed to visit him for a second time in February 2019. The couple are going to be spending their Summer together in England!\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "AP-FBN--Giants-Beckham,2nd Ld-Writethru\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The New York Giants kept quarterback Eli Manning in the dark about the trade that brought Odell Beckham Jr. to the team.\nThe trade of two first-round draft picks, including a 2019 first-rounder, to the Cleveland Browns in a deal on Monday that would have sent Beckham to the San Francisco 49ers has been the talk of the NFL this week.\nThe one piece of information Manning had was that he heard nothing regarding the trade until his wife was driving him to work on Monday morning.\n\"It was kind of unexpected, but it was my wife,\" Manning said on Tuesday following an organized team activity practice. \"And so, I was kind of driving and she texted me and asked if I heard about the trade.\"\nHe did and was relieved.\n\"It's always good to get a new team and be here and join a new group of guys and get to work,\" said Manning, whose voice gave away his excitement. \"Obviously, Odell is a big part of that offense and we'd love to have him back, so it's good to have a new opportunity and a fresh group to work with.\"\nCoach Pat Shurmur said he has not had a chance to speak to Manning or the quarterback's agent. He is expected to speak with them before practice on Wednesday.\nWith Shurmur having a rookie quarterback to work with in Sam Darnold in New York, Manning probably would be on the trading block before the Giants draft in April. However, that makes little sense.\nShurmur said he was aware that the Giants did not have a draft-day trade deadline, meaning players such as Beckham do not go into a trade knowing the Giants are going to do the deal. It could be a smokescreen.\n\"I don't know that that is the way it is with every team,\" Shurmur said. \"Whether it's eliminated or it is not eliminated, but I would assume that I don't think it is eliminated.\"\nShurmur had Beckham at his first on-field session with the team. Beckham caught an end-around in team drills during an early session after meeting with Shurmur and the team's top brass on Monday night.\nManning said he and Beckham have been in contact through the years. They even get together to talk about their kids when the All-Pro receiver is out of town, and Manning plays in some celebrity golf tournaments.\nHe said Beckham went out of his way to reach out to him in February when he had a skiing accident in Whistler, British Columbia.\n\"I hope he is healthy,\" Manning said. \"Obviously, the injuries hurt. You try to stay out of that as much as you can. That's obviously a part of the game and sometimes you get hurt.\"\nGiants quarterbacks threw to rookies and young players for the first time on Tuesday. Paul Perkins led a group of linemen and cornerback Grant Haley, a first-round pick, caught a pass and was tackled by Eli Apple.\nHowever, both Perkins and Haley did not participate in on-field drills and that raised questions about whether they will ever play in the NFL, which was the No. 1 goal for each in their draft year.\nManning said he did not go to Perkins' high school in Alabama and simply did not know what to expect with the rookie.\nHaley, who did not play high school football, said he was surprised about the decision by the Giants to let him leave after the first workout. He talked to general manager Dave Gettleman after that and was told the Giants have plans for their top picks.\nNOTES: The Giants waived offensive lineman Justin Pugh after the team made him a restricted free agent last week. . Shurmur said running back Saquon Barkley did not practice with the scout team or with the full team during on-field workouts. He was held out due to a sore ankle. Rookie Sterling Shepard is the starter in the absence of Barkley, who ran for 1,052 yards and 12 touchdowns last season. . Rookie Darian Thompson, one of the only six players to remain at the Giants' facility this offseason, caught some passes during meetings on Tuesday. The safety signed with the Giants in free agency as a free agent. . The Giants will hold a second on-field session with the media on Wednesday.\n___\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The drawing of random balls of the NHL\u2019s lottery will be conducted at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the NHL\u2019s offices in New York. But the Avalanche, depending on their lottery performance, will be far from the top of the draft lottery list.\nThe Avs are guaranteed to be either No. 5 or 6 in the draft, which begins June 23, unless they win the draft lottery and are the No. 1 pick.\nIf the Avs\u2019 fate becomes public, however, fans and media should not expect a parade through downtown to Denver\u2019s Civic Center. Such expectations would be more in line with a game-ending goal by Brian Gionta than celebrations in and around the Pepsi Center.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known what was ahead for a while now,\u201d Avs general manager Greg Sherman said. \u201cWe believe in the talent in this organization and what (new coach Jared Bednar) can do. I don\u2019t think the fans should be disappointed to be No. 5 or 6. I think we should be excited about it.\n\u201cHopefully (the team) gets an extremely strong pick and it turns out to be a young guy like a (Mikko) Rantanen or a (Alex) Tuch. We need that from young kids.\u201d\nBednar, taking the reins after Joe Sacco was fired Sunday after two seasons as head coach, will have input in any specific decision regarding the No. 1 pick. Bednar\u2019s son, Turner, was drafted No. 5 by the St. Louis Blues in 2007, the same year Colorado drafted Rantanen, a winger from Finland.\nIn 2007, the Capitals used the No. 1 pick on Ryan Suter, now a cornerstone of the Sutter family\u2019s successful playoff strategy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s first-round. It\u2019s a pick that we would like to see make an impact to this organization,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWe want to take our time in all of those decisions with the new coach.\u201d\nColorado will get at least as much as it could lose in the draft. The league reset the draft order Monday after the Avs finished out of the playoffs for the second straight season and Avs owner Stan Kroenke bowed out in December rather than take a payroll gamble.\nAt one point, the Avs were not expected to receive much in return for their first-round selection, which was expected to come in the top 10 \u2014 which is more acceptable now.\nThe Avs can set their sights lower and hope to snag a top-10 pick, but the process and luck are just as important. The Colorado high school draft will begin Sunday, with a second-round selection at No. 26 (trade compensation) and four rounds at Nos. 46 (drafted by the Sabres), 55 (trade compensation) and 56 (drafted by the Avs).\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we believe is necessary to get the best player we can,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWhen you evaluate a player, whether a high school kid or a college kid, we\u2019ve done thorough evaluations of our players and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use to help get us to that point.\u201d\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "news, education, childcare, early childhood, sydney, ilkanning, learner, children, study, census\nThe impacts of early childhood intervention services are showing in the Australian Early Development Census numbers. The data, released on April 11, found the number of kids growing up in foster care has increased by almost 48 per cent in the last decade. It also found kids aged three and four years are reading at the equivalent of about six months earlier than their pre-school peers. Thirteen per cent of pre-schoolers were enrolled in foster care during the time of the census, with a notable increase of 16 per cent in aged three and four years. Department of Family and Community Services communications director for NSW and ACT Tara Draper told The Daily Advertiser that the older kids could read, the better. \"It is important that these people get into reading and become familiar with reading,\" she said. \"There are a number of other determinants of reading including a good pre-school program, extended play or discovery materials, and reading motivation.\" \"The impact is mirrored for kids in foster care,\" she said. \"The young people get more help when they are younger and this is supported by specialist care and education within community care programs.\" Ms Draper told The Daily Advertiser the Census showed NSW was doing better on similar measures than other states. \"There is more than 36,000 children identified as being cared for by kinship carers in NSW, but we only have 400 state-funded and 5,000 community care on-site nurseries, so we have a lot more families to look after than other states,\" she said. \"We are doing better than other states when it comes to Aboriginal children who are identified as being cared for by kinship carers, but we are not doing as well as some of the lower-income parents in NSW. \"We are not tracking them down at the same rate we are tracking high-income families.\" DFCS reported: \"There is a mixed picture for early years outcomes in NSW. \"While some younger children and disadvantaged kids have some learning and development outcomes improving due to earlier access to quality early learning, and this is supported by the long-term investments in early childhood, children in disadvantaged families and care settings are facing more challenging and less effective outcomes because they are unable to benefit from that level of support.\" Ladenshut Kids\u2019 Early Learning Centre in Sydney's Greektown, a child-care centre that strives to be pre-eminent, said the data showed more kids needed the extra support to make sure they get a good start. Management group leader Leonie Soverly said: \"That's one of the biggest learnings is that kids do not get the best possible start in life. \"So we do a very well valued program - in the school we just started again, the students have started from kindergarten so that's called achievement when they do a subject well. \"But there are so many students that are coming in not reading or not being ready and we are expecting them to do well academically.\" Development associate at Ladenshut children's centre Lisa Ngamame said: \"It's the process of learning to read, developing verbal skills, relearning to spell and being able to read in a timely manner, building up that confidence.\" The completion rate for children six and under in NSW and most other countries was 50 per cent, but with selected special needs programs and model scholarships which help families with more complex needs, the completion rate improved to about 65 per cent. And, according to the recent Australian Education Accreditation Authority report about working in early childhood - and in response to the census - based on the results, \"There is a significant data gap between the older student outcomes in the early childhood system and the support services for the younger students and family care settings that cater for them.\" READ MORE\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/andrew.moir/67ab8b76-7dbe-4439-94ef-2ac2b84c543e.jpg/r0_373_4032_2561_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "news, local-news,\nTHIS is the controversial development that has already caused some angst. But this time in Thurgoona, it's not known whether it's about to pass. Residents have been vocal about their opposition to a childcare centre that has been proposed for property at Moama Parade. That development application is yet to be assessed. Parents living nearby at Moama and Thunderbolts Way were told the application would be decided on the same day as the council's business meeting. They had hoped approval would be granted after much community debate. They said they were not opposed to childcare centre development, just the location. The owners of the housing on the Yarrawonga Road property, which was originally used as a car park for homes at nearby homes, purchased the property in 2014. The land has been previously used for a grocery store. About 90 expressions of interest were received for childcare placement, and five groups were shortlisted. That was one more than the minimum of four. The applicants plan to open the centre, which includes pre-school, at the end of the year. Susan Parkinson, who lives on Thunderbolts Way with her partner, said the location was poor. \"An opportunity has presented itself where childcare could be good for a lot of families, but I'm very much opposed to the location,\" she said. \"Not only is it a poor location, but we're hearing from neighbours there is no available parking. \"It doesn't make sense.\" Ms Parkinson, whose three children live in Melbourne, said she and her partner had made up their minds to have them educated at regional areas. She believes there are children who will not live in Thurgoona who need a good range of child care options. She would also prefer to see senior residents have access to child care, as some would use it to get out and socialise. \"There are families here who are very happy to have their children have a fantastic quality of education, and this isn't it,\" she said. \"I don't think it's a good location for quality child care. \"I've felt for a long time that we'll probably never have quality childcare in Thurgoona. \"This is a very unusual situation we're in here. We need a conversation. \"There's not a negative comment, it's just asking for fairness for what's being proposed.\" The business meeting starts at 11am on Tuesday in Thurgoona.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/u2TKvX7hYXGMrKgrD4ZiFN/dd79878c-91eb-40cb-8dd8-f5880987de56.jpg/r0_2386_3024_3851_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By Kate Holton\nBritain\u2019s prime minister is preparing to make a last attempt to get a Brexit deal through parliament, opening the last possible door to a deal that would keep the UK in the European Union until an EU member leaves in two years\u2019 time.\nAfter more than two years of negotiations to leave the bloc, lawmakers have twice rejected Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal to break the stalemate. Now May says she will table her third and final concession on Tuesday.\nIf she can find enough support for it, she will open talks next week with EU officials to try to clinch a deal that might persuade rebels in her own party and opposition lawmakers to support it.\nWhile many in parliament say May must hold another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the deal by mid-April to keep the whole process on track, so far no lawmakers have come forward to say they would support the deal, despite a scheduled one this week.\n\u201cIf there is progress to be made in the House, then I will come back to the House,\u201d May told reporters, shortly after her spokesman said the EU might be ready to offer Britain some form of temporary customs deal, as part of an attempt to change her mind on the so-called Northern Irish backstop.\nSeveral lawmakers said a majority of the 650 lawmakers would remain opposed to the deal, leaving it very unlikely to get through parliament unless the EU backs changes to it before the vote.\n\u201cPassage of a new Brexit deal on Tuesday week remains remote at best,\u201d Conservative lawmaker Nick Boles, who called for a new election last month, said.\n\u201cPrime Minister, if you really want a deal that represents a compromise \u2026 I say come back to the House this week and tell us the way forward. Show us the concession we need to change our minds.\u201d\nPOLITICAL FALLOUT\nTo avoid a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, May is trying to sell parliament on another deal to honour the 2016 referendum vote to leave.\nOn Monday she will give a speech to a business group in London, as she seeks to patch over divisions in her own party and win the backing of fellow MPs in both the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party who have publicly said they will vote against her deal.\nIf she does win agreement from parliament to take a different path, she would immediately have to get a similar approval for a temporary customs deal, something that would give time for sufficient debate and inspection of changes to the Brexit deal on the Irish backstop.\nHowever, European Council President Donald Tusk \u2013 in comments seen as privately angered by news reports that the EU could offer a temporary customs agreement \u2013 said it would be against European Union rules.\n\u201cThis would not be legal or political \u2018legally binding\u2019 in any meaningful sense,\u201d Tusk said in a statement. \u201cIt would apply only temporarily, and would have no impact on the existing withdrawal agreement.\u201d\nTusk added that when he spoke with May at the weekend she had raised no proposal for a temporary backstop.\nFollowing a private meeting at the European Commission in Brussels on Monday afternoon, May\u2019s spokesman said she would look at the EU\u2019s offer. He did not confirm that she was raising the idea with the bloc, but said she had been listening to the EU to see what more could be offered.\nWith no political road map for the country out of the uncertainty caused by Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, the pound, which has tumbled 15 percent since last June\u2019s referendum, recovered some of its recent losses on talk of a possible compromise deal.\nFailure to clinch a deal with Brussels could see May. being forced to form a minority government, see her party slide towards a no-confidence vote, or even see the country crash out of the EU on March 29, a scenario deemed so serious it has been dubbed \u201cno deal Brexit\u201d.\nAll the options are seen as bad for Britain, but if parliament rejects the deal this week it may still be possible for May to win backing by December, two people briefed on a no-deal Brexit planning exercise seen by Reuters said.\nThey said a positive outcome could include a long transition period after Britain leaves the EU.\n\u201cThis should be enough for Parliament to agree a deal by December, but a number of questions remain to be decided,\u201d the source said.\n\u201cWe could enter into a transitional period to soften the Brexit process but it will only be part of a comprehensive new EU-UK trade agreement that will take months and months to put in place.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\u00d7 US skyscrapers kill 600 million \u2014 yes, million \u2014 birds every year\nWhen a skyscraper is finished, it is normally a behemoth built to increase safety and reduce maintenance costs, but it also makes for a significant environmental problem.\nSeveral skyscrapers worldwide block the view of birds, blocking their ability to feed and find mate, according to a study published Monday in the journal Scientific Reports.\nThe study by researchers from Queen Mary University of London shows that for every 70 hectares of waterfront they occupy, U.S. skyscrapers cause 60 to 600 million birds a year to die from non-eradication causes such as drowning. London\u2019s skyscrapers had a similar figure, ranging from 600 million to 500 million.\nSwimming birds face a double whammy: by drowning in a skyscraper, they are depriving nature of a valuable bird species in general, but also threaten to chide endangered species of golden plover.\nGenerally, skyscrapers occupy prime coastal territory and can obstruct the birds\u2019 ability to fly and feed.\nMore than 6,000 iconic skyscrapers dot the planet with buildings ranging from billion-dollar developments to low-rise commercial buildings.\nThe researchers examined 391 skyscrapers from New York to Shanghai in a search for signs of non-eradication, or blocking, of birds.\nTheir data showed the most successful attack was suffocation; building blocks of steel and concrete could be caught in the feathers of the birds as they fled.\nThe destruction caused by building blocks was amplified across a building\u2019s volume in the lower levels.\nA skyscraper can ruin the view of up to eight million birds a year, the study found.\nThere\u2019s an opportunity for change. New construction in major cities is expected to double by 2030.\nErecting tall buildings could theoretically help the birds by liberating their impulse to fly higher or longer away from urban areas. But the report says there\u2019s a problem with this logic, as tall buildings tend to be located in poor habitat.\nIn particular, the researchers say taller skyscrapers close to tall skyscrapers could create more deaths.\n\u201cThe moral dilemma of protecting an iconic skyline that includes structures that threaten the health of birds may lead to their conservation becoming secondary to retaining their presence,\u201d said Dr. Alix Nash, one of the study\u2019s authors and a lead researcher at Queen Mary University of London.\n\u201cAs skyscrapers are frequently located close to other buildings (a Bird Friendly Zone), incorporating bird-friendly considerations into these infill projects could significantly limit these birds\u2019 exposure to skyscraper pollution.\u201d\nThe Global Union of Architects is advocating for more building design and construction strategies to bring about this change.\nThe union says skyscrapers build up or work around birds and their familiar locations. They encourage more interventions such as vegetation instead of bulky, 100-ton concrete blocks to help birds navigate.\nThere is a push from industry and government to approach the problem in more creative ways.\n\u201cSustainability is important for all new buildings,\u201d Andrew Long, global architecture leader for Citigroup, said in a statement. \u201cWe are working with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology on the development of our new headquarters in London to protect birds and minimize energy consumption.\u201d\nArchitect Sir Norman Foster said in a statement that his new 100-story building in London would include a special bird viewing platform that for the first time will give the public a distinctive view of the skies.\nA majority of skyscrapers don\u2019t allow birds to get past the building\u2019s white panels, such as the glass at the base of the floors or the paneling above the windows, the scientists say.\nThat\u2019s despite long-standing guidelines suggesting the panels should be concealed.\nSome skyscrapers in China, including Beijing\u2019s 70-story Dalian World Tower and Shanghai\u2019s 149-story Shanghai Tower, are already well-known as killing zones.\nAir quality varies in China as it is surrounded by mountains, meaning pollution from less polluted areas remains near the ground. However, data from 2014 to 2017 showed that, amid heavy construction and pollution, the Shanghai Tower was the hottest site in China during summer, and its particulate level was above the WHO\u2019s warning standard.\n", "label": "machine"}

REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nBoston, April 3 (Reuters): Actress Felicity Huffman walked into a courtroom in Boston on Wednesday to face charges she paid bribes to a college entrance exam cheating scheme in order to secure her two daughters into top U.S. universities.\nHuffman, 62, and her actress husband, William H. Macy, 66, entered the federal court together in the U.S. city, where a judge set bail for Huffman at $250,000 and her husband at $150,000.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered them to surrender their passports and follow a judge\u2019s travel restrictions and monitor service providers if they are released pending trial.\nHuffman, Macy and five other well-known actors were named in the indictment, as prosecutors said more than 30 parents had paid money in order to have their children admit to attending elite U.S. colleges.\nThe parents are accused of conspiring to bribe college administrators to alter the answers to the entrance exams or to hire cheating rings to do so.\nThe court proceedings took place at a time when transparency and accountability are paramount to many of America\u2019s institutions and with the U.S. government in the midst of a broader crackdown on corruption in global affairs.\nHuffman\u2019s attorney, Michael DeGeurin, said her priorities were \u201cthe wellbeing of her children and putting them through college, and pleading not guilty so she could get on with her life.\u201d\nProsecutors said Huffman and Macy paid $15,000 to a cheating ring for one of their daughters, who graduated from Stanford University in the class of 2016, and $15,000 to a test administrator for the other daughter, who is said to be currently a student at Columbia University.\n\u201cWe were shocked and disappointed to learn that Felicity Huffman was charged in today\u2019s indictment involving the admissions bribery scandal,\u201d the actresses\u2019 lawyer said in a statement.\nNone of the other defendants appeared in court on Wednesday, but prosecutors said others are expected to do so in the coming days.\nProsecutors said the parents paid bribes in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $6.5 million, and that these charges amounted to a conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\nHuffman\u2019s sister, actress Emily O\u2019Brien, pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "(CN) \u2013 For most foster kids, or guardians ad litem, sex abuse is only the start of a vicious life cycle.\nThe children and adults who work for the Oregon Department of Human Services make assumptions about a foster kid\u2019s mental health, education, drug use and general demeanor to assign worst-case scenarios to them.\nAs a result, Oregon\u2019s foster kids are in foster care for years or sometimes their entire lives, enduring abuse, neglect and neglect by their family and their guardians ad litem.\nThat\u2019s according to an explosive 109-page report released Tuesday by the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\nThis case, filed in 2011, is being considered rare in the history of the U.S. foster care system for being the first true case of children suing their guardians.\nThe lawsuit filed by the GAB, or Guardians ad Litem, is the first big claim alleging that the state \u2013 not the guardian \u2013 was to blame for the kids\u2019 abuse. While cases against private guardians and private foster-care agencies have been few and far between, federal and state courts have generally tolerated the fact that the state sets the guardianship policy.\nThis suit, however, contends that the Oregon Department of Human Services routinely rejected claims made by guardians, rather than responding to them, and that the state\u2019s policies undermined the kids\u2019 ability to defend themselves.\nIn one instance, a guardian thought a foster kid \u2013 who was deaf and had been abused as a baby \u2013 had been abandoned. The guardian falsely assumed the foster family just wasn\u2019t caring for the child, even though the foster mother had told the child\u2019s mother who wanted to adopt him that he was considered a \u201cone-in-a-million adoption candidate.\u201d\nThe foster care system is filled with these kinds of mistakes, the suit claims.\nThe guardians \u2013 who speak for the youth when they can\u2019t, often using first names only \u2013 can present their case to the state without consulting any of the other foster parents. Instead, a guardian ad litem is given any child without a guardian and told to present his or her case to a judge.\nIn a 2010 judge-issued order, Oregon regulators confirmed that the state made hundreds of decisions by the guardians, not the guardians themselves, without the youths\u2019 consent or knowledge. By the agency\u2019s own admission, the state took 2,500 \u201cnoncompliant guardianship decisions\u201d without the consent of the guardians.\n\u201cGuardianship is not a quick fix,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt is a long-term commitment.\u201d\nBut many guardians lack the training to understand the impact their decisions are having on a child\u2019s health and future, let alone the kids themselves.\nWorried about what her guardians might do with the information she provided, a young girl gave up her case in 2012.\n\u201cI let them listen to me over a few years but I never felt as if I really had a voice,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was treated like a tool.\u201d\nAdults who work for DHS also don\u2019t necessarily have much of a clue about the human drama in foster care.\nOne employee was warned by another employee about the tension between foster families, but she refused to tell a foster mom she was wrong about a difficult situation.\n\u201cShe should just give up on the foster kid,\u201d her co-worker said.\nIn 2015, DHS issued a directive stating that guardians would no longer have to report when an abuser was in the home with a child who needed placement.\nThe directive states that the state would have been more involved in allowing abused foster kids to escape if staff had been trained in reporting suspect abuse and in identifying children who needed medical care.\nAs a result, 60 children abandoned by their guardians were transferred to foster families, which the state had essentially forced to take the kids.\nThe state is fighting the suit, but Tuesday\u2019s report outlines the state\u2019s internal investigations of the abuse claims, which are usually rooted in mistakes made by the guardians.\nThe report says that in 17 cases involving serious abuse, investigators never looked into them because they thought the children in question had died before any complaint.\nIn the end, the report found, all 36 children in the case were never harmed by their guardians.\nThe result, it says, is that 35 of the children\u2019s guardians were never disciplined by the state.\nAdvocates for the children say the report shows that Oregon must take a hard look at the way it treats the foster children it serves.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Alexandra Rogers\nThe boss of the UK's biggest private jet operator has said the Brexit vote has caused a slump in demand, with demand falling by 18 per cent in the first quarter.\nRichard Perry, chief executive of Biggin Hill-based WMS, told City A.M. today that the fall had to do with confidence.\n\"Until recently uncertainty was very high amongst the overseas travellers in the private jet industry. Those that travelled as leisure tourists to the UK were also among the first to move out of the UK if there was a withdrawal from the EU. This has now changed. People are viewing this as a recessionary outlook, which is understandable,\" Perry said.\nThe last few months have seen a downturn in private jet demand in the UK but this is nothing compared to the collapse experienced in the US, Asia and Africa last year due to lower confidence as a result of the China meltdown and terror attacks.\nRead more: Private jet air fares and navigation deals plummet\nPerry, who also chairs the UK's private jet association Civil Aviation Authority, said that Britain's reputation as a fantastic place to have a private jet is still largely intact.\nHe explained that although the 2008 financial crisis may have dampened the appetite of some travellers to travel to the UK, the wealth and accessibility of land from the South East has kept the impact on the private jet industry at a lower level than in many other parts of the world.\n\"Looking at 2015, we felt that it was only in 2013 that we saw the UK receiving the worst negative perception ratings,\" he said. \"But we're not in the middle of a recession or downturn we could see much larger impacts. I would rather be seeing 2014-15 than 2015-16.\"\nRead more: UK private jet sales and operator CAA: More planes are going into storage\nPerry said that the China slowdown was the key driver behind the lack of private jet demand in the UK, although he said that businesses are reluctant to invest as a result of the uncertainty the uncertainty has created.\n\"Although the negative vibes are there, the overall point is that it's very difficult to move right now,\" he said. \"We're very much an asset the private fleet owners are very much a confidence thing and that's changed significantly in the last couple of months.\"\nPerry added that Brexit was not the only force driving the drop in demand and that the oil price collapse, with Venezuela and Iraq among the countries where the country's central government is under severe pressure, is also a factor.\nThe 63-year-old also insisted that the United Kingdom, which more than \u00a3225bn was invested in private jets last year, was still a wonderful place to host private jet customers. He pointed to the increase in investment in the UK, which included firms such as Airbus, which recently announced a \u00a3620m research and development programme.\n\"The UK still has a lot to offer; but you'll see though there are fewer passengers travelling on these planes,\" he said.\nRead more: Aircraft at Heathrow \"to crumble\" if this is allowed to happen\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the world of modern sports cars, form follows function - from the ferocity of the Nissan GT-R to the mutedness of the Audi R8 GTS. However, there is a fresh outlier entering the fray, the Honda HRV Sport, which appears to be breaking down the wall into a new concept. Aimed at everyone from parent's club first-timers to old car ennoques (more on that later), the HRV Sport is a fully waterproofed, all-wheel-drive crossover model with space inside to accommodate up to six passengers, in need of that much-needed mid-life dividend from the toy room. It\u2019s the built-in seat heaters that give it the unexpected edge over others in its class.\nThe Honda HRV Sport is the hottest Honda ever\nMoulded from Class A bamboo, the HRV Sport offers the most premium experience possible with leather seats with electrically-adjustable footrests, suede headrests, deep-set ambient lighting, soundproofing and an attractive colour palate that encourages attention from even the coldest of souls (at least for owners), from the Vanilla White seats to the matte Tan paintwork on the front and cabin. We particularly liked the light-reflecting black camouflage plastic panels beneath the rain guard lights in front of the driver, and the bodywork textures on the doors, which bear the similarities of the sporty fabric styling that contrasts so well with the outline of the chrome grille. At the same time, practicality is fundamental in the HRV Sport. The convertible top is folded into the boot floor when not in use so that this version, like other HRVs, can easily tow up to 2,625kg.\nThe HRV Sport feels less like an urban commuter and more like a hot hatch by comparison\nBeyond that, it might look as if this is your average DIY family car when in reality it should, more appropriately, sit alongside the hot hatch challengers of the segment, making small but significant improvements to performance and driving dynamics. For instance, the HRV Sport does away with the soft-top and replaces it with a much stiffer and more rigid body, so the rear-wheel drive Honda\u2019s reliable CVT gearbox shifts through the engine tune more efficiently, and the all-wheel drive system develops more power. Moreover, the hybrid drivetrain that also powers the CR-V hybrid adds a 0.42 second 0-62mph time and 276bhp to the HRV Sport\u2019s output for a whole 30kW of boost. That extra power and improved handling comes with its serious price, and the HRV Sport commands a 20 per cent premium when compared to the standard HRV - but it feels less like an urban commuter and more like a hot hatch by comparison.\nTop speed is still electronically limited to 155mph and there is also only one option for interior. The HRV Sport comes as fitted with a seven-inch Android-based infotainment system that uses three large screens at the front of the cabin and is powered by Honda\u2019s Apollo 7 system, which combines multiple connectivity options in one rather posh package. This technology connects to your wireless smartphone via Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, as well as a second storage bin, where you will find a battery pack to power the rear camera at the rear of the car that shows a real-time 360\u00b0 view of the environment around you. More useful than simply doing away with the chunky centre touchscreen controller, the second screen makes multiple settings for the cabin lighting and infotainment systems accessible as one page. One feature that might appeal to the owner in white van man or an elderly spouse is an adjustable seat heater that in our opinion, while not fitted on this model, is perhaps the cleverest feature in the driver\u2019s seat panel.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "This week, smart speaker shipments in China jumped 50 percent, marking the first time the category there has increased in the first three months of the year. Shipments in Korea and the U.S. also increased 30 percent and 80 percent, respectively, according to Canalys \u2014 and the market-watching firm expects that figure to spike even higher in the months ahead.\nCanalys estimates that smart speaker shipments globally will climb 35 percent year-over-year in 2018, reaching 10.5 million devices. That\u2019s not too shabby for a relatively short amount of time \u2014 even with the slew of late entrants like Amazon\u2019s Echo Spot and Google Home Hub, and fourth-generation Apple HomePod in the works, the market hasn\u2019t \u201cexperienced the kind of sudden growth rates enjoyed by smartphone hardware and software in the last decade,\u201d wrote Canalys analyst Matt Thornton.\n\u201c[T]he industry is now mature and ready for greater role and commercial adoption of assistant technology. Voice, for the first time in the recent history of tech, is almost universal \u2014 and therefore the tipping point for distribution [of voice-based products].\u201d\nVoice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, in contrast, are not as popular as Google\u2019s Assistant, Apple\u2019s Siri, or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, Thornton said. And many users dislike the relatively limited suite of smart home devices they can control with voice commands, hampering their adoption \u2014 an obstacle Apple and Amazon are working to overcome, with features like HomeKit and Alexa Skills Kit.\nThe next step in the smart speaker\u2019s evolution, Thornton added, is the launch of kids\u2019 devices, which Amazon launched earlier this year, including Echo Spot and Echo Dot Kids Edition, and smart speakers that compete against everything from video game consoles to refrigerators.\nStill, there\u2019s optimism. \u201cToday, there are more than 15 \u2018smart speaker\u2019 models available across a wide variety of form factors, display sizes, and price points,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cThere are further device iterations on the way, including mid-tier smart speakers, pairable personal assistants, and a swarm of relatively low-end passive/sound enabled devices expected to be released in coming months.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s Portal and Microsoft\u2019s Mixer make up one of the wild cards to watch this year. At $199, the Echo Show \u2014 a showy coffee-table like device with a big touch screen, five cameras, and an elaborate touchscreen interface \u2014 sounds like the kind of home entertainment solution Amazon is gunning for. It competes directly with Facebook\u2019s Family Hub, which faces direct competition from the Amazon Echo Show.

However, 8,000 unions across Italy are seeking wage increases as well as the scrapping of fuel subsidies from the metro budget, in the hope of boosting their own participation in state-run meetings and services.\nThe drivers who staged a strike on Monday have been refusing to work since Sunday because of what they see as bad management.\nThe metro bosses behind the proposed extra work have produced a book of advice to keep commuters moving in case of disruption, but drivers on the network, as well as a number of other nationwide train workers have decided to refuse to work at all.\nThat has created chaos in Rome, where some commuters queued for buses for four hours on the first day of the strike and buses had to be brought in from the north and the east of the country to transport the unemployed and other vulnerable people who were unable to buy tickets.\n\"The coordination in the metro is such that people are stuck with the same ticket on weekdays without any way to get a refund. No way at all to stand by them,\" said Gianluca Rosato, a spokesman for Riccardo De Federici, one of the unions seeking to strike.\nThe transport workers dispute is a warning sign for ordinary Italians who are already coping with austerity, record unemployment and infighting among competing political parties.

He had actually worked on getting reform for our country, and he was in the House for six years and he held a lot of committee chairs, which was awesome. And I was sick of Hillary [care. I was like, \u2018With all due respect, we need someone who actually cares about people.\u2019\u201d\nPorn star Samira Wiley added her own endorsement to Grey\u2019s Friday. \u201cSasha, quite frankly, is a hero. And I believe in her, and I trust her and I think we need a leader who\u2019s good for the health of both our girls and boys,\u201d Wiley told The Daily Beast in an earlier story.\nDespite the mounting support from her colleagues, Grey warned that she will continue with her plan to run as a Libertarian because she\u2019s optimistic of a positive relationship with Trump, the current president. \u201cI think he\u2019s in it for all the right reasons\u2014in terms of actually making this the best country that we can possibly be,\u201d Grey said. \u201cI think he\u2019s an opportunist\u2014like I told the New York Times, he\u2019s a businessman for God\u2019s sake\u2014and I think he\u2019s going to do well. I think he\u2019s a strong, young man and he\u2019s wanting to do good things for our country, and so I\u2019m not going to put any blame on him.\u201d\nOther candidates that Grey has not yet endorsed include the Republican Party\u2019s Larry Hogan and Maryland governor Larry Hogan, as well as Abba Dabnine, the Austrian member of European Parliament of the far-right, anti-immigrant Freedom Party of Austria.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Supreme Court has strongly advised the Election Commission (EC) to act swiftly on complaints against hate speech as that should not be placed on hold because of an investigation by the State or CBI.\nThe Election Commission had declined to file the complaint against Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das for making derogatory remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Lok Sabha floor despite a demand made by lawyer Prashant Bhushan.\nA bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and UU Lalit in a recent verdict clarified that notices should be served under section 160 of the CrPC \u201cto expedite investigation against persons involved in such offences (who make hate speech)\u201d or the commissioner concerned of the Central Electoral Tribunals \u201cif offences under this section have not been investigated before the date of application of the order\u201d.\nThe bench pointed out that these relevant provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act and Notification Act (made applicable to the Lok Sabha) clearly provide for \u201cimposing contempt proceedings and fines\u201d for making a derogatory statement against Prime Minister. The SC bench noted that invoking the contempt provisions \u201cif necessary\u201d should not place investigations initiated by either the State or the CBI pending before a magistrate on hold because of \u201ccommitment of time and cost\u201d by a petitioner seeking \u201cnecessary interim orders\u201d.\nObserving that a petition to the EC seeking directions to it for making a complaint under sections 153A and 153B of the IPC in the matter against chief minister Raghubar Das of Jharkhand was \u201cat the preliminary stage\u201d, the bench asked \u201cwhether it has been passed on the same?\u201d\nThe bench also referred to the recent judgement of Madras High Court dismissing the petition filed by Mahendra Singh, who had sought quashing of the Jharkhand\u2019s notification on delimitation of parliamentary constituencies and imposition of President\u2019s rule on the state citing delays in registration of caste voters\u2019 list.\nThe bench asked whether the Madras High Court order had been passed on February 21 and April 6, 2019 as referred to in a previous apex court order on 1 June this year. \u201cIf so, are there reports filed by the Election Commission? And, when will the chief election commissioner file a draft complaint against the Jharkhand chief minister before the high court that is already in session?\u201d\nThe SC also noted that on May 31, the Madras High Court had issued notice to the Jharkhand government, the director general of police and the superintendent of police.\nWith this observation, the bench asked the respondents to file an application before the high court informing the issues mentioned earlier by the state governments and superintendent of police, which were based on joint orders/record while seeking extension of the SIT and additional time to complete investigations to ensure a fair, free and democratic process in the state.\nThe SC bench has noted that this was the second time an election complaint was pending with the Chief Election Commissioner of the State concerned on the basis of a petition by one Mahendra Singh to \u201cinvalidate Jharkhand\u2019s new electoral rolls, which are to be completed till September 4, 2019\u201d.\n\u201cIt is astounding that after the application for quashing of Jharkhand\u2019s Electoral List and quashing of delimitation of constituencies in earlier Supreme Court order dated February 21 and April 6 2019, the High Court had not granted any interim relief till the completion of the election process but now orders to wait for government\u2019s decision. It is not at all strange that an inquiry conducted by the Election Commission is causing unnecessary delay in investigating a complaint,\u201d the bench said.\n\u201cIt is beyond comprehension why a suitable and necessary relief cannot be granted to Mahendra Singh for quashing of Jharkhand\u2019s revised Electoral List/constituency delimitation order and preserving the sanctity of the electoral process,\u201d the bench added.\nOn March 18, 2013, the SC had rejected a plea filed by the then Mukherjee-led UPA government seeking to invoke Section 153A of the IPC in the election complaint filed by Mahendra Singh for stamping Jharkhand\u2019s new electoral list of constituencies.\nThe then Koteshwar Rao, first president of the Rajya Sabha had moved the Supreme Court, citing section (1)(a) (i) of the 2001 Act, which provides for punishment up to life imprisonment if offences against the President, the Vice President, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the ministers, the judges and some other public servants are committed on government letterhead, with notice to the Prime Minister.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the wake of a recent nuclear blast, even most people would be hard-pressed to figure out where the explosion is located. State Department\u2019s George Nader analyzed this limitation with the aid of a full-scale scale model of the detonation. A team of researchers plugged into the scale it more than 40 million spots around the globe to create a doomsday visualizations tool that attempts to serve up a big picture of who, exactly, was likely to be killed in such a scenario.\nThe image below was one of the most accurate results they had: Information provided by the U.S. government, based on information from nuclear weapon tests conducted by the Russians and the U.S. At the time, in 2014, scientists calculated that roughly 140 million people could have been severely or permanently injured by radiation in that area.\nNader and his team speculate that about 300,000 of those victims were in the U.S., where people stand at a 100 million death toll rate\u2013like at the famous scene in The Day After. That\u2019s because of the breakdown of populations in U.S. cities. Regions that were not destroyed, which Nader\u2019s team first focused on when forecasting after the 9/11 attacks, were very healthy. (Granola-loving Manhattan is likely not a target of a nuclear blast.)\nMost deaths are spread over several countries, so the map clearly reflects the top casualties. If you\u2019re from the United States and your city is listed as a likely nuclear target, chances are that you\u2019re probably dead. The top-five cities in the American cities list are all in Japan, with 18 million deaths. Seattle came in second with 16 million deaths. You can also find death tolls for Mexico City, Houston, Atlanta, and Baltimore\u2013factors from the 2012 Fukushima disaster can be felt throughout the entire arc of the globe. Tokyo, Fort Worth, and Toronto are all spied and mapped inside, too.\nBut Nader also looked at deaths in two East Asian countries, South Korea and Japan. In both cases, there are more casualties near the city core (where more people die from underground fallout). It\u2019s a reminder that West Asia, North and East Africa, and Southeast Asia still have a vast populations in proximity to each other that could potentially be hurt or killed.\nDoomsday visuals like these are a blunt reminder that fact nuclear weapons, in the right hands, can kill lots of people and cause catastrophe.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "European Union has agreed to revoke Eurofighter Typhoon systems used by Italy, Greece, Romania, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. This year\u2019s Brexit referendum was a definite threat to the cohesion of Europe, and almost threatened the single market. And the infamously polarizing US presidential election, as well as Brexit, were further examples of it.\nHowever, the real reason that the European Union is in the hot seat is because citizens don\u2019t trust their democratically-elected leaders. In particular, citizens have not trusted certain elected officials in certain countries who have ignored, manipulated, sold off, lied about, or compromised their responsibilities. This distrust comes from a lack of trust in the democratic process itself. The very idea of a vote to have your voice heard is compelling, so there\u2019s a strong strain of belief that democracy works. Of course, it doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s based on deceit, and only works in sham elections, a luxury some of us can\u2019t afford.\nBut the question, why isn\u2019t trust in democracy stronger in developed Western nations? After all, democracy is an established tradition that represents the modern, globalist, horizontal, open, and inclusive vision of the future. However, trust in democracy in Europe is falling in the West because of three factors:\n1. Confusion over re-establishing trust in democracy\nRightly or wrongly, many in the West are starting to question whether or not democracy is actually worth the cost and difficulty of maintaining it. This is especially the case when certain individuals influence and use it, such as by installing increasingly authoritarian regimes that place democracy under threat.\nThe problem is democracy is not all that difficult to sustain, it is actually a cheaper, more stable, and more effective form of governance. But what it has lost in importance is our solidarity. Democracy, like any good governance, relies on solid economic foundations. If democracy is to sustain itself and continue to remain secure, it requires a sufficient sense of trust and shared responsibility.\n2. Lack of trust in politicians\nOf course, one of the reasons for the public\u2019s loss of trust in democracy is their politicians. This includes those who are directly involved in running the political processes themselves, as well as those who are political commentators. But this also affects the elected officials who are in office after election.\nPoliticians are seen as part of a system that sells their votes for thousands of pounds. In an era of widespread cynicism, politicians don\u2019t want to wear the canary-black suit anymore. A politician wearing a suit black or red represents corruption, cronyism, and secrecy. Although the appearance of high levels of transparency is seen as key, there has also been a strong shift in the perception of transparency. We believe there\u2019s a shift towards greater transparency, but in reality we see far less transparency than in the past.\n3. Lack of trust in technology\nThe third factor that hinders the recovery of trust in democracy is the misuse of technology. The new trend is to have totally digital governments, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the people\u2019s views of democracy or how their role in it works. For this reason, it\u2019s important to dispel the myths that give rise to a lack of trust in democracy, and that places the main responsibility on technology to strengthen democracy.\nThe technology industry has been an early adopter of \u2018filter bubbles\u2019, that work as a means of polarizing society so that people who agree with the same group of people can see very little else. So much so that they live in false realities, meaning they believe in their predetermined views or certain concepts, while others see facts they don\u2019t agree with and, too often, see their opinions and actions as less valid. Filter bubbles create unrealistic conceptions and reduce the global interdependency in a vibrant, connected society.\nGoogle\u2019s \u2018Democracy Index\u2019 projects that democracy is the most feared institution after death itself, but in reality, it serves as an important aspect of great governance because it is based on shared responsibility, where all people and their concerns matter. With new technologies and new sources of power, democracy has an opportunity to be heard and seen by the people it serves. After all, for democracy to remain strong, it requires a strong social backbone.\nVinny Lingham is Senior Director at Redalpine.\nImage Credit: Andrew Donachie / Shutterstock\nRead next: Why pursuing an industry passion can actually make you more resilient\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "sport, local-sport,\nAlbury-Wodonga Steamers assistant coach Ben Hetherington praised the side's chances of improving its poor record against Waratahs. As has become the norm the winless Steamers jumped out to a comfortable lead before easing off against the cellar dwellers. After disappointing performances earlier in the season, Hetherington said the team was not the finished article as yet. \"We should be higher,\" he said. \"There was a lot of improved and the boys stayed on the ball. \"We should be better than where we are but that's better than where we were not too long ago. \"We need a bit more depth in our back line, they make our job a bit easier but there is a bit of building going on at the moment. \"It will have to be in this second half.\" The Steamers led early through a quick tap penalty goal to Campbell Inglis and went well ahead through Heath Murray. However things were in the balance before half-time when Rhys Law was quickly grounded and the ball scrambled back for a try. The Steamers recovered from the setback to head into the sheds in front 14-6 despite missing several opportunities in the first half. During the first break both teams also had the potential to cross for tries but missed their opportunities. Waratahs looked to strike in the last minutes but the kick from the conversion failed to find the mark as the Steamers hit the half time break with a one point lead. On the resumption Waratahs struck twice in quick succession. Shortly after the referee disallowed a try for a double movement. But it didn't stop the home side as they finished strongly to stay within touching distance. Steamers prop James McPherson missed the contest with a foot injury, leaving it two regulars unavailable for the clash at Jelbart Park. Murray replaced him in the front row while Hardie Bebbington took his spot at halfback. The Steamers also had a surprise late withdrawal with their back rower ruled out due to concussion.

But its perceived failure to deliver on some campaign promises, especially on economic growth, has eroded its confidence.\n\u201cThree years have passed since we won the 2014 elections,\u201d Modi told a gathering in northeast India on Sunday, referring to the 2014 Lok Sabha election, in which his party won 312 seats in India\u2019s 543-member parliament.\n\u201cIn 2014, the wave was bigger. Our party had more seats than all others put together, and almost the same number as the Congress party, which was going through political turmoil.\u201d\nThe BJP was then seen as an alternative alternative after the pro-Muslim Congress government of outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had staved off political crisis with a humiliating victory that included a sharp drop in the party\u2019s tally.\nNow, Modi said, the BJP was twice as powerful and had a bigger number of seats in parliament.\n\u201cToday, that wave is stronger. Our party has also grown from strength to strength. But we must stand on our own feet,\u201d he said.\nSUDDENLY SWOONING UP\nModi, 60, nevertheless struck a critical note, saying the goal of his government to generate 25 million jobs was very ambitious, even as government data showed a marked increase in employment in 2016-17 from two years earlier.\n\u201cThe pace of job creation must accelerate,\u201d Modi said.\nAs the BJP leaders unveiled the BJP\u2019s planned new agenda at a function in Manipur state capital Imphal on Sunday, veteran leader LK Advani, who is due to be the party\u2019s parliamentary party president, put a brave face on the party\u2019s election prospects.\n\u201cBefore the election, the party should not just win but also announce policies which will attract more voters,\u201d Advani told reporters.\nThe Congress party\u2019s poll prospects in this election are also bruised after another Modi ally brought the Congress-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) down to its lowest tally of 29 in 2014.\nAs Modi announced his \u201cMake in India\u201d programme aimed at boosting manufacturing as well as his promise of a \u201ccashless India\u201d, the BJP began drawing up his new economic growth agenda.\nThe BJP has played up populist policies in the election, including a promise to reduce taxes on agricultural income and increase rural wages, hoping to woo millions of farmers and rural voters.\nUnder the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, Modi promised to revive manufacturing.\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley confirmed the BJP\u2019s intention to demonetise the cash that can be spent on farm incomes and employment creation, including household market items like vegetables and fruit.\n", "label": "machine"}

Over the last five games, Chen has been clocked at more than 100 mph on the radar gun, including a 101-mph blast in last Friday\u2019s home loss to the Atlanta Braves.\nAfterward, manager Don Mattingly singled out Chen and fellow starters Chris O\u2019Grady and Jose Urena, noting that \u201cit\u2019s nice to have those guys back in there.\u201d\nOn Sunday, the starting staff was roughed up for seven runs in 4 1/3 innings \u2014 Chen getting tagged for five of them. The poor showing added to the unit\u2019s struggles, which saw Urena receive the loss in Thursday\u2019s home loss to the Baltimore Orioles. In five starts, O\u2019Grady is 1-1 with a 7.60 ERA, while Chen is 2-3 with a 6.94 ERA.\nDespite Chen\u2019s early-season struggles, Mattingly remains confident in the Taiwanese left-hander.\n\u201cHe likes competition,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cHe pitches to compete. He\u2019s been a guy who can have length when he\u2019s had a good outing. It\u2019s certainly been early, but there\u2019s definitely been time when he\u2019s given us length when he needs to.\u201d\nAfter throwing just under 200 innings last season, Chen is set to follow that trajectory with the Marlins. In just 24 1/3 innings, Chen has recorded 23 strikeouts, but has also issued a bloated 20 walks. There\u2019s been multiple stretches in recent games when Chen has allowed four runs in a game.\n\u201cHe\u2019s working on some stuff,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cThere was a ball where he just didn\u2019t follow through. He went to the other side of the rubber, and the next pitch he threw, it was what I\u2019d call a bad pitch. It was a guy right there who had reached it. That\u2019s a prime example of something he can learn from.\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s pitched in pressure situations. He\u2019s been through this. He just has to continue to get the ball down and understand when he needs to throw more fastball, more offspeed and become more efficient.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a particularly rough start for Chen, who sat out the 2018 season recovering from a stress fracture in his back. Although the stress fracture healed quicker than expected, Chen was forced to miss spring training following offseason shoulder surgery. The big-name pitcher came off the disabled list Saturday to make his Marlins debut against the Philadelphia Phillies.\nChen pitched 3 2/3 scoreless innings and picked up his first win of the season, helping the Marlins secure the series.\nIf things don\u2019t turn around, Chen and the Marlins could be facing a roster move. Following Sunday\u2019s loss, Mattingly said the team wouldn\u2019t rule out placing any starter on the disabled list. The active pitching staff has its largest ever, at 12 players.\nEarlier in the week, Marlins head athletic trainer Gary Dickman said the team\u2019s current pitching depth was a \u201cbyproduct of moving guys up and down the roster.\u201d While the Marlins have many young pitchers on the minor league roster, they were already well-stocked with talent in the bullpen before this season.\nAfter starting the season with 10 wins, the Marlins are now in fourth place in the National League East with a 8-11 record.\nLike the Marlins?

With no legal way to force them to attend, and facing intense political pressure to keep families detained together, government officials say they have to leave women and children wherever they can find room.\nNumbers reported by the Department of Health and Human Services show the number of families and unaccompanied children now detained has grown from a few thousand in October through December to more than 14,000 in February. More are on the way, officials say, because the number of families who have recently crossed the border without their children tripled from October through January.\nThe rising numbers are sure to create more pressure on Congress to pass immigration legislation, a possibility that was only just becoming feasible after an 18-day partial government shutdown. At least 40,000 children have been released since October, according to government numbers.\n\"The administration's new policies, coupled with growing numbers of families traveling together, have resulted in record levels of immigration detention capacity that cannot hold all those in need,\" a department official said in a statement. \"To meet the demand for bed space, we are utilizing the space currently available in HHS-supported detention facilities.\"\nAlthough immigrant children are generally allowed to stay with their parents when they are caught at the border, the U.S. does not have anywhere to put their parents who are caught illegally crossing the border alone.\nUnder the 1996 Flores settlement, minors cannot be held in detention facilities longer than 20 days. A federal judge in California put a temporary hold on that 20-day limit in 2015, ruling that children must be released even when the government has no beds for them in immigration detention facilities.\nUnder the administration's new rules, most parents will be released from detention even if they were given a notice to appear in immigration court and even if they crossed the border with their children. Those conditions have been met with general \"catch and release\" programs in place for many years.\nA federal judge in New York issued a preliminary injunction this year blocking the Trump administration from separating families caught illegally crossing the border. At the time, government officials said they would implement a \"zero tolerance\" policy in which all families would be prosecuted and that they could no longer \"hold mothers and children together in detention facilities.\"\nThe same day the ruling was issued, the Justice Department asked a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out the Flores settlement and permit the administration to detain children with their parents in detention facilities.\n\"Releasing mothers and children into the interior of the United States creates a significant and unnecessary humanitarian crisis,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote.\nThat request is still being considered by the 9th Circuit.\nRep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., said releasing mothers and children in the open was not only creating more dangerous conditions for the parents but also making it easier for smugglers to traffic more children.\n\"It's part of this administration's long-term approach to the whole immigration system,\" Pocan said. \"They don't want to deal with it or deal with it very well.\"\nJeffrey Steel, a former assistant attorney general in the Bush administration, argued that family detention would be humane and successful if it was introduced. He said the growing numbers are the direct result of the administration's hardline immigration stance.\n\"The real difficulty is that we don't have the proper detention facilities to hold the kids or the families,\" Steel said. \"What we should do is look at additional detention facilities \u2014 short-term detention facilities \u2014 to allow families to be held together. ... Instead, they are (being released) into the interior of the country, sometimes after being charged with a crime.\"\nThe U.S. Border Patrol had 27,735 apprehensions or arrests of children and families combined for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, but that number is likely to surge because the government has caught a greater number of families and children on the border in recent months.\nLawyers who represent immigrant families in Central America are encouraging their clients to bring their children with them when they travel to the United States to avoid further problems at the border.\n\"They will make the same journey again, but they won't take a one-year-old with them,\" said Miguel Cortes, a lawyer with the Episcopal Church-affiliated Latin American Working Group. \"They are aware of the situation.\"\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "First put in at age 26 to help start up Yukon Harley-Davidson in 1964, Gerry Poole spent the next five decades as a \"tarot card reader,\" which has meant juggling multiple clients to drum up small, steady, custom-service numbers, and at midlife, facing the prospect of his own brush with mortality.\nThe 73-year-old Poole, who learned about death in high school and is now busy commemorating the death of his professional partner, spent the past year researching laws around the world, studying ballistic research, testing and developing his own solution.\nOn a small hillside outside his Commerce, B.C., mansion, Poole leads a reporter into a garage where he and some partners are working out their ultimate product. It is a contraption he developed: a night-vision device to help riders safely navigate darkened streets with police in pursuit. The idea is to put it in cars, and they have met with dealers around the country, but have not yet secured a manufacturer. They have been gaining traction since starting with small batches of test parts; this spring they expect to mass-produce, potentially by this winter.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"I've worked with a lot of other equipment \u2013 trying to get seen by engineers,\" Poole says, showing off the night-vision unit and helping a reporter scan a dark street. \"It's very, very challenging \u2013 trying to see on all the manholes [and] under the other manholes.\"\nBefore the company goes public, it will need to get on the road. Poole has said he wants to take his successful company public or private in stages, with sales in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first year.\n\"It's very important that we grow the company, and grow it quickly,\" Poole says. But he faces the familiar challenge of a relatively young company and a legacy that is not a quick path to riches, but one that should require a sustained effort in this tough business.\nThe story of Poole's life, in a nutshell, is the tale of a successful business with atypical ownership and structure, a rock 'n' roll life, a rags-to-riches story and, in Poole's case, an entrepreneur who stuck at it a while longer than the norm, not selling up until he hit 71. But he never got rich.\nBetween his association with Harley-Davidson and other dealers, Poole has invested $10-million in the business in the past half-century, a high-flying period of motorcycling, and has a lineup of 40 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He has kept at it for a lifetime, going back into high school in 1953, when he learned about death through the 1964 Thunder Shirt Massacre in Newfoundland, the result of arson, which killed five men. (His father, Ron, who owns a well-known home-remodeling company in Nanaimo, B.C., told him that one in 50 men don't make it through that age in one piece.)\n\"It's never not been in the back of my mind,\" says Poole, of death. \"I don't think I ever have been well enough to say, 'Why me?'\"\nPoole's birth certificate, from Shilo, Man., says he was born Jan. 15, 1944. That would make him around 13 when the Thunder Shirt Massacre occurred. (The Association for the Fire Services in Newfoundland said a spokesman did not recall the incident.)\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nHometown gave the teenager fuel for the passion in motorcycling, but, much as with the trenchcoats of his youth, Poole became one of the commercial greasers of the '60s. The Mohawk \"cannibal\" said he would go to school in Hell's Kitchen and sell diner coffee. He started work at age 12, and his father thought he'd made the wrong choice, that school was less important than the money he could make working for Harley-Davidson (it is the largest motorcycle company in the world, selling more than 400,000 bikes annually).\n\"That whole time I was up the 17th Street in Hell's Kitchen,\" Poole says, looking at the bright TV lights and modern downtown skyline behind him. \"They had a corrugated sheet factory down the street, and there was this guy with a leather jacket on with a guitar. He knew the local radio station \u2013 you read it in the paper where we were. He had to say something about it.\"\nPoole wound up sharing a cramped cubicle at the diner. He would skip lunch and work until he was at least co-manager.\n\"We were the cheapest kids on the block,\" Poole", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Quebec\u2019s new premier-designate, Francois Legault, has vowed to block the creation of an independent religious accommodation tribunal if elected this spring. While the experience of his predecessors in this role should provide strong lessons to Justin Trudeau in respect of the courts, the Conservative Party\u2019s two current federal leaders are not as well-positioned to respect justice.\nThe Conservative leadership debate last Monday demonstrated this again. It was a lively debate and there were many differences of opinion but the noisiest moment was a pointless, divisive free-for-all. The result was an era-defining moment for a leader and a party contemplating its presidential mode of leadership.\nThe leaders criticized Justin Trudeau\u2019s plan to create a tribunal for religious accommodation complaints. Behind this was the impression of disdain. Former Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi accused the Liberals of using fear to mobilize the public. This should allay concern among traditional Liberal supporters. Naheed (Paul) (Smolinski) responded to this criticism by claiming that people would only see a real independent panel of judges as a \u201cdanger to liberty\u201d. In other words, he said, this group of lawyers or judges should know what\u2019s right and not be afraid of it.\nTrudeau\u2019s response was less competent. He tried to make it sound as if he was attacking the idea of the tribunal itself. I have written before about the Conservatives\u2019 deliberate rewriting of the Constitution by cancelling the Clark-Newfoundland Bill of Rights in order to inspire \u201cfree thinkers\u201d to challenge secularists to amend the Bill of Rights. Yet, the suggestion that Trudeau intended to create a tribunal struck me as hysterical. However, people may see what they want to see, and the verbal attacks managed to elicit a lot of accusations that Mr. Trudeau was a tyrant. But here\u2019s the kicker. If Mr. Trudeau wanted to create an independent tribunal, it would be very easy to do. All it would require is to repeal his bad idea, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That\u2019s right, Justin Trudeau would have to put aside his reformist zeal and stop his smug and angry speeches that the previous century\u2019s elites have discarded Canada\u2019s secular values, taking the country into a dark age.\nThe other leaders\u2019 offence was worse, both intellectually and politically.\nSince much of the criticism concerned the tone of the debate, I am going to focus on the intellectual and strategic aspect. As Scott Gilmore explains, we\u2019ve been through this before \u2013 the first Liberal government of Jean Chr\u00e9tien decided, after consultations, to create an advisory body which was to advise the government on various matters concerning women.\nThe board consisted of five predominantly male, Catholic lawyers and a few academics. What they recommended was often unchanged and partisan, making it a mockery of the Charter and the claim that one person\u2019s opinion matters more than another person\u2019s. Instead of producing a blueprint of enlightened independence, it was a deeply partisan body that ignored fundamental aspects of minority rights. The board was conservative and not independent.\nWhat\u2019s truly maddening about this practice is that it only became politicized in the last decade, after gay marriage came to be seen as a civil rights issue and Justin Trudeau, like his predecessors, sought to use a Charter aspect as an excuse to impose his usual style of thought (paternalism), instead of a plan of leadership. Why would the Charter be designed as a vehicle to politically correct the leader of the Liberal Party?\nSo now the leader of the Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer, is seeking to bring the same kind of behaviour to Parliament. Sooner or later, he will need to accept that Christians and their beliefs are not up for negotiation. The courts have not yet attacked their rights, but it has been suggested that they will soon, especially if the courts, again, become politicized.\nThis is where we must recognize that the Liberals intend their misuse of court power to advantage their own political needs and not to protect individual rights. Trudeau is trying to use the courts, mainly because he is insecure, to come back to power and he needs more legitimacy. Scheer\u2019s role now will be to remind Canadians that this will never work. Scheer cannot have it both ways.\nLet\u2019s get smart about democracy and not allow the Trudeau Liberals to bring their political agenda to the courts to achieve their goals.\nPeter Anastasiadis is an emeritus professor of political science at Ryerson University and a specialist in constitutional studies.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nWe continue to give you a behind-the-scenes look at Disney's live-action Dumbo. The studio's live-action adaptation of the beloved animated film released its first teaser trailer last month and has been preparing for the marketplace since it was first confirmed in 2016. In the animated classic that released in 1941, the titular elephant and his adventures with his pampered circus family brings the family turmoil after his ears malfunction, granting him the ability to fly.\nDirected by Tim Burton, this Dumbo features a cast headlined by Michael Keaton as J. Pierrepont Finch, the carnival owner who hires Dumbo to be the star attraction; as well as Danny DeVito and Eva Green in the lead roles as Eddie (Keaton's character) and Holly, the infant Dumbo's adoptive parents. The rest of the cast includes Colin Farrell as Colette Marchant, Griphook's \"the greatest wizard in the land\" who works at the circus; Timothy Spall as Charlie Moulton, the reclusive inventor who creates the flying elephant mask; and Danny DeVito as R.F.D. Hunt, who works with Charlie. Rounding out the cast are Benedict Cumberbatch and Joanna Lumley as V.A. Vandevere and Colette Marchant, respectively.\nRelated: 40 of the Greatest Movie Monster Cameos of All Time\nA lot has changed between Dumbo's animated origins and its live-action remake, including the animals. Dumbo's owner is now J. Pierrepont Finch (Keaton), he has his voice provided by Hamilton's Leslie Odom Jr. and everything else has been adapted from the original film, with some updates, including the transformation of Cooties' Poppy LeBlanc into Margaret the pigeon. They were all very different animals in the live-action film from the ones in the original, but nothing was quite like the original Dumbo himself, The Flying Elephant. Dumbo's original artist Adeline Smith has now shared her concept art and she's given us your first look at the key art for the live-action version of Dumbo. Take a look:\nThe first image of Dumbo in Disney's live-action was full of intimate gestures. In his arms is the familiar green umbrella on which he used to float from the circus to his flying home. The jungle has been re-imagined to become a visually stunning world. Most of the backgrounds are dynamic pieces of architecture which combine illusionistic layers with the classic patterns. The massive swaths of greenery are balanced out with glimpses of Dumbo's wrinkled skin and shining orange eyes, lending a childlike charm to the art.\nThere's still room for more details on Disney's live-action Dumbo, including Dumbo's actual home and whether he will be able to fly. The animals that are in the trailer haven't been detailed in their new forms either but it's likely something more than the original faithful to the source material. Nothing has been set in stone until the reviews hit the silver screen - and likely this week - but until then, take a look at the rest of the concept art Smith has shared:\n[vn_gallery name=\"EXCLUSIVE Dumbo Concept Art\" id=\"914389\"]\nSource: Adeline Smith\nThe MCU Can't Just Reboot One Part After Avengers: Endgame\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "\u2018I was going to put more PV panels on top of the building,\" says Arikant, whose building makes use of solar energy and water recycling\nImage Credit:\nBy Keely Alyokhina, CNN\nRawr Nautiyalakkal was all set to purchase another car. But he changed his mind. He went to give his old car a go at Charity Holdings\u2019 newly opened warehouse, pondering what to keep inside. \u201cEveryone keeps complaining about water and the pressure in the water tank, so I thought, we should use this for plants,\u201d he said.\nSpread over over one, 1,000 square metres, the warehouse has organically grown some 350 trees and about 500 plants. It is also home to a project called Copperfield Pines, a solar panel-powered infrastructure that maintains 10 per cent of Dubai\u2019s energy demand in a recycling system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project where a set of energy efficient monitoring facilities and solar panels work in tandem to recover energy,\u201d said Melissa Machado, Copperfield Pines\u2019 CEO. \u201cThis revolutionises how energy is used on the basis of social impact and less carbon emitted in the atmosphere.\u201d\nThe project has gone well beyond the warehouse, and helped Arikant save money on utility bills.\n\u201cIn the past few years, as residential and commercial rents have sky-rocketed, people have got curious to see green projects,\u201d Arikant said. \u201cThey see the benefits on the supermarket and hotel counters and in the gardens \u2014 but this is the first time you see these projects get built on premises. It generates awareness about sustainable development and is also a simple idea of job creation, too.\u201d\nThe warehouse also houses corrugated-iron roof, which is the best type for CitiTurn, a revolutionary technique in which cardboard or metal panels are used to cover roofs. These panels can hold 20 per cent more water and absorb heat that has previously absorbed the space under the surface, retaining water for outdoor use. \u201cThe setting is perfect because it allows us to save the space we have lost with these areas being enclosed,\u201d Machado said.\nBeing an end-user, Arikant got a preferential deal on the warehouse for operating the project. \u201c[Sending] electricity to Dubai Power gives it to the UAE government, and Dubai Power passes it to us,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it\u2019s the same electricity \u2014 it\u2019s 100 per cent free to us. We don\u2019t make any profit from it, and can sell it [to power companies] in the market at a higher price.\u201d\nThe network is also set to be extended to five warehouses by the end of the year. Although Arikant is looking to further expand the project through development, he said he would consider returning to the warehouse next year. \u201cI have learnt a lot. I was going to put more PV panels on top of the building, but I didn\u2019t. My motivation to try these things is the price of energy,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By ELAINE THEOMON and VIRGINIA GRAHAM\nPARIS \u2013 A fire Sunday torched one of Notre Dame\u2019s most popular cathedrals, leaving the centuries-old Catholic edifice covered in ash and smoke, its delicate murals and medieval relics in charred ruin.\nBurning platforms at one end of the dome that covered the soaring cathedral\u2019s 4th century spire had scorched the priceless artwork in two rooms of the cathedral. No major religious relics were destroyed but the fires left a considerable scar.\n\u201cThe cathedral is completely burned out,\u201d Bonny Servet, a spokeswoman for the Paris fire department, said in an interview.\nAround 2 a.m., after the fire department arrived, firefighters struggled to enter the cathedral. City officials were guarding Notre Dame\u2019s entrance, fearing any part of the building could collapse, fire officials said.\nIn a nod to the sensitivity of the fire, which some have linked to an attack by far-right protesters, officials shut down the Beau Rivage train station, the main link between the French capital and the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, to ensure firefighters were safe.\nChristophe Gaudre, the deputy president of the local Notre Dame archdiocese, said the fire may have been started by protesters. He said the building had been targeted by far-right demonstrators who had been demonstrating against the French National Front for the past few days, said Michel Jodoin, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for security and security.\n\u201cWe have every reason to believe that the attack yesterday on the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris came from a far-right political group,\u201d he said in an interview with France 2 television. \u201cIt certainly has the characteristics of a provocateur attack.\u201d\nThe incident is a particularly bloody one for Notre Dame, and France, which has seen a surge in far-right activity since it elected the far-right leader Marine Le Pen as the country\u2019s first female president last year.\nA group calling itself Montparnasse 10breuil tweeted messages from inside the cathedral, telling residents to stay away and calling on Le Pen to apologize for having insulted the cathedral during her rally in Paris last week.\nA spokeswoman for Le Pen had said she had insulted priests at the rally, rather than the cathedral, according to a report in Le Monde.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Raynald Desjardins, who works in a nearby school, said in the parking lot of the church, as other onlookers watched. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, some of the graffiti on the walls we can see, \u2018No to Marine Le Pen,\u2019 \u2018No to Christianity,\u2019 \u2018No to ISIS,\u2019 and others. It\u2019s barbaric.\u201d\nDuring her victory speech last Sunday night, the former presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, a far-left firebrand, appeared to say the cathedral had been destroyed by ISIS, or the Islamic State.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandal,\u201d said Judit, 32, a student from the French working-class town of Plaistow. \u201cI feel sick. You shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who finished second in the first round of the presidential election last month, had called for the building\u2019s closure to the public and warnings about Christian icons. He later complained of being pilloried by the media for calling the church a \u201cpeacock in a chicken shop.\u201d\nCharles Bager, the president of the Notre Dame board of directors, called the incident an \u201cattack on a spectacular monument, and we are outraged.\u201d\nHe also said he received \u201ca provocation by some far-right people who jeered my solemn prayer at Notre Dame cathedral on Sunday,\u201d adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it was.\u201d\nAt 3:28 a.m., as the blaze began, Joan Suar, a member of the cultural commission at the cathedral, tweeted about the morning\u2019s events: \u201cSaw Paris quickly paralysed, first being quiet, then everything coming at once.\u201d She also wrote that the mood in the cathedral was \u201cvery dead.\u201d\nThe fire was one of several high-profile attacks on France in recent weeks. The deadly attack at the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in January was followed by an attack by Islamist militants last November on a kosher supermarket in Paris that killed four people.\nIn an unrelated incident, a truck struck a crowd of worshippers on Sunday morning during morning prayers in suburban Paris.\n", "label": "machine"}

Now, it\u2019s a race to get the best results in a shorter amount of time, where they can also access their home gym.\nThe stats\nLifting weights four days a week, including working out with interval training is where the majority of exercisers (mostly men) spend their time, according to Jessica Matthews, registered dietitian at Canadian Weight Loss Centre.\n\u201cEating at least 75 to 100 calories for exercise helps you maintain weight, make changes, and we can even help you become stronger by improving bone density, muscle performance, blood sugar levels, and stability,\u201d she says.\nREAD MORE: Why you shouldn\u2019t lose weight if you don\u2019t exercise\nWhile cardio and strength training are common ways to shed pounds, Matthews says the leading fitness trend at her practice is interval training or interval-style exercises.\n\u201cGetting less than 15 minutes of recovery time each week can be challenging. If you had the strength and endurance to play for five hours you can do even less than 15 minutes a week,\u201d she adds.\nA study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine a couple of years ago, found working out to resistance training to non-recurrent fatigue \u201cis clearly superior to high-intensity interval training or resistance training followed by resting for soreness.\u201d\nHow to choose\nTrainer and head of the Endurance Sports Group, Richard Pitzl of Vancouver, says he highly recommends using a high-speed treadmill if you just want something to get the blood flowing, but keep it simple.\n\u201cI see way too many people that will take the extra four or five minutes with high-frequency intervals,\u201d he tells Global News. \u201cIt creates a burn you\u2019ll want to double up.

And because they aren\u2019t as busy, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll find you keep hitting a resting heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute, he adds.\nThat means you could use one on your birthday in August. \u201cGet out of your comfort zone and try something different. You\u2019ll surprise yourself and see how much fun it is,\u201d he says.\nWhat\u2019s the best?\nPitzl and Matthews both agree on two key factors when considering their offerings.\nFirst, both trainers say you have to find an exercise that suits your lifestyle, whereas compression shirts have a comfort factor. Matthews also says you want to have more than one exercise if possible to better help manage your workouts.\n\u201cBut I would say you should definitely enjoy a mix of strength and cardio,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the incredibly positive change of intense overall weight loss and improved mental and physical health on people, but it comes with getting in the habit of moving, and I love a good workout.\u201d\nREAD MORE: How to get a watermelon for breakfast and three other breakfast hacks\nPitzl adds instead of switching between a bunch of different workout brands or services, he suggests finding one big joint plan and stick with it.

{"text": "A military-backed coup ousted Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, on Thursday, Burhan Ghali, a spokesman for the new president, said.\nPresidential spokesman Akif Ali Shahid said the government had been dissolved.\nPresident Bashir's son, also named Omar al-Bashir, is now the de facto leader.\nThe military-backed coup has removed a veteran strongman who has spent more than 30 years in power in the nation of 30 million, and raised speculation over the future of Sudan's fragile peace process with its neighbor and traditional rival, South Sudan.\nIt was not immediately clear who had called for the coup.\nBashir was in Saudi Arabia and had been in talks with the Trump administration about easing U.S. sanctions, which would allow the economy to recover and end the economic isolation that has driven Bashir to cut a deal with rebel groups. Sudan's main opposition party, Al-Tahrir, issued a statement saying the decision to remove Bashir showed the \"total decline\" of the country's economic situation.\nSudan's parliament had earlier voted to revoke the constitution and amend laws to remove the immunity Bashir enjoyed and extend his presidency by five years.\nBashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court, accused of orchestrating genocide in Sudan's Darfur region, a charge he denies.\nThe Supreme Council for Defense and Security, a military-backed group of former military officers, called the decision a \"necessary revolution\" and said the military would carry out its constitutional duties.\nA general who described himself as a spokesman for the council, Lt. Gen. Sarhat Rashid, said that no one would be allowed to return from exile without clearance from the military's Supreme Council. He said the military would disarm its forces and re-establish law and order. The military has also given up its weapons in the past before failing to restore law and order.\n\"The name of the president is now used as a shield to protect rogue and greedy leaders, as a list of people who belong to this army exists,\" said Rashid.\nHe said the coup was endorsed by the deputy head of the ruling National Congress Party, Sadiq al-Mahdi, and that al-Mahdi would rule in his place.\nBashir was to preside over a presidential meeting Thursday. State TV broadcast footage of the announcement in which al-Mahdi, dressed in a dark suit, hands him a red briefcase.\nIn the brief remarks that followed, al-Mahdi said the junta \"will carry out the decisions of the Supreme Council for Defense and Security\" and claimed the shake-up brought back soldiers to their duty station.\nState TV also showed footage of a military helicopter landing at a military installation in Juba, South Sudan, with a man in a military uniform emerging from the aircraft.\nSouth Sudan's information minister, Michael Makuei Lueth, said it was the former ruling party's \"coup d'etat.\"\n\"It was a military coup. The Sudanese people have given their decision to return to democracy,\" he said. \"It's the weapons of the people that are today in the hands of the Sudanese army.\"\nBashir's country of about 30 million people has not been stable since he came to power in a 1989 military coup. He spent nearly 20 years on the run from indictment by the International Criminal Court.\nHis whereabouts were not immediately known. A spokesman for the ICC did not respond to a request for comment.\nSudan has been deeply divided over the past decade, as two different cities and two separate regions vie for power. The fighting in Darfur has been characterized by atrocities committed by both sides and the involvement of paramilitary forces and Arab Janjaweed militiamen.\nSudan was at peace with its southern neighbor until 2011, when South Sudan gained independence. Khartoum was outraged when the southern capital, Juba, broke away, effectively divorcing the country from the country it fought to break away from.

We need a lift whenever we\u2019re going shopping.\u201d\nIn the year after the original interview, Katie was able to leave, as she had requested, and move in with her mum in Yarrow.\nShe was unable to access a job agency or social services due to her age. Her parents could not afford to pay for her to look after the property or pay to use their land instead.\nFollowing advice from her parents, Katie returned to Dorset to join her partner and their kids for the Christmas period.\nIn a statement issued today, the family said: \u201cOne year on, it has unfortunately become a lottery as the construction site is closing in and our home is set to be taken away from us in the coming weeks.\n\u201cFor these reasons, the decision was made not to move abroad with our families but the family in the UK had to stay put as we had spent our savings.\n\u201cThey were determined that we should stay in Dorset to save for one day to buy a new home to move to.\n\u201cThe family were completely surprised by the reaction to the fact the family was, and remains, in the UK and not overseas.\n\u201cFrom the onset, it was made abundantly clear that we were returning to live in Dorset due to family reasons \u2013 a fact that was as clear as day to visitors to our property.\n\u201cFor Katie to leave Dorset at such a crucial time would not be safe for her health or to move to a new place once we had secured a job \u2013 so when Katie came home to stay, we were with her 24/7.\n\u201cWith everything we have gone through, and the government policy forcing so many people to leave the UK, it would have been irresponsible for us to make a decision that would have put us or our families\u2019 safety at risk.\n\u201cAs a young family in our later years, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to travel on holiday, or spend money on our future without their support.\n\u201cWe would like to place on record our thanks to Pier, our many friends and family, the public for their support and we would like to express our gratitude to the dedicated people at Dorset County Council for the help, advice and assistance which they have given us.\n\u201cWe are the proud owners of the one-of-a-kind house we purchased in 1954 for only \u00a340 and now live in today. We have supported the county throughout this past year and the people of Dorset truly have our thanks and respect.\n\u201cWe remain hopeful that with everyone else\u2019s support, that, in time, we will find a safe suitable space in which to live.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

It started off in Scotland, which has the most. There have been realisations that I\u2019m most certainly not a redhead. No birth certificate or Certificate of Particular Origin. No homeopathy. I\u2019m 50, although I honestly would like to think that I could be 10 to 12 years younger.\n\u201cIn March, I bought the Glasgow Chronicle but with official redhead identification and it said: \u2018She [Susan] may be called Alison and she is 48.\u2019 The people at the ticket machine go, \u2018No?\u2019 But in Stirlingshire, I bought a QE2 guide with official redhead identification. It says \u2018New Year, Elizabeth\u2019 and it\u2019s 43!\n\u201cStirling was one of my favourite places when I was a child so I\u2019m now very sad that the place that I used to love just put all of my odd bits and pieces straight on to the bus schedule! I\u2019ve lost the things of my youth.\n\u201cI went to the Tesco Extra in Glasgow when I was six or seven, on Dalmuir Street, to go and buy my corned beef as I didn\u2019t have any money for cabbage and watermelon. On the trolley was a tray of cabbage and potato salad, chicken and vegetables. With that restaurant, there were redheads, so I decided to take my spiky brown hair as well, and put it underneath my umbrella and two thick bags.\n\u201cThere was always a steward and the vegetarian and they would draw. For me, the food was the best bit of life. I was always the only redhead in my school and I grew up with four older sisters, who were protective of me. We had packed lunches with sea vegetables from Largs and lentils from Irvine so I wouldn\u2019t forget them.\n\u201cFor the past 15 years, while I\u2019ve worked in the oil industry and these have been very challenging times, I\u2019ve been writing a book, which is slightly autobiographical. I was about to finish it when I got cancer.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, I enjoy exploring my dreams, which are full of white light; my mum's vernacular called her a chuthar! And I just love meeting people and starting conversations.\n\u201cMy biggest achievement during the first 25 years of my life was winning the Redhead Art competition at Stirling Primary. There were quite a few of us, and it was really, really nice.\n\u201cAt the beginning of my life, I worked in Fort Dunlop on an oil field and it was really cold at Christmas and everyone fainted. I remember one night in January, five of us all completely collapsed - and mine was for 10 minutes. I haven\u2019t had one in ages! There was a group of us living in Aberdeen and I built a mews house off the garage, which, unsurprisingly, needed renovating. There were redheads with sea shells everywhere and women in red dress pants and flip flops knocking the paint buckets off the walls and smashing the piano in a downstairs studio.\n\u201cIt was magical, because my father had a temper. If I was more confident at school, I might have been better at it. I would have got better grades. But my mother could shout at me and I would have listened to what she was saying because she knew how to do it, and she was a redhead so she knew what she was talking about.\n\u201cI miss the 1990s. I did the local face lift - what\u2019s more Western, blue eyes or red? My look has stayed the same since I was 20.

{"text": "Earlier this year, a new study claimed the consumption of coffee could help ward off diseases ranging from colds and flu to certain cancers and heart disease. Incidentally, research has shown that caffeine itself has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties. Now you know how to check and claim your fair share.\nRegular coffee consumption has been linked to improved mood, better cognitive functioning, libido, as well as decreasing risk of chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\nSupercharge your skin?\nCoffee is responsible for raising skin's temperature and adding a lush layer of moisture to the skin. Coffee beans also contain caffeine and antioxidants that help both rejuvenate the skin and keep it healthy. To add these benefits to your skin routine, add two tablespoons of coffee grounds into a smoothie each morning.\nWhat's the magic?\nAccording to botanist Alyson Waters, the three main drivers of skin\u2019s natural oils are blood-borne endogenous hydrocortisone, oleic acid and selenium. \u201cCoffee itself has both a pro-oxidant and a scavenger role in the skin, increasing the hydration and keeping skin healthy,\u201d she said.\n\"Anti-aging properties\" of coffee\nCaramel colouring in your coffee can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles because of its caffeine, thiamine and choline. Research also claims that consumption of coffee supports the production of the hormone hydroxylphosphatidylserine, which stimulates the body's production of hyaluronic acid, which is believed to protect skin from free radicals (the substances that can break down collagen and elastin, leading to wrinkles).\nCoffee\u2019s likely anti-aging health benefits\nStudies have also shown that consuming regular coffee could help reduce the effects of depression by protecting the adrenal glands, which are responsible for regulating stress levels. These studies have also found that coffee was likely the reason why some people with pre-diabetes appear to have a heightened ability to control blood sugar levels after giving up their coffee habit.\nSupplements\nApart from its therapeutic uses, coffee can be used as a natural beauty supplement as well. Make sure to consult your pharmacist before experimenting with other products that contain caffeine, as some could contain dangerous toxicity. For a healthy skin, it is advisable to consume a large cup of plain filtered water along with two to three tablespoons of ground coffee per day.\nDisclaimer: This article does not promote or recommend any product, service or method.

A spokeswoman said in an email that Transpo will be \u201cposting the specific opening for public submissions\u201d in the coming days. She said the government has been \u201ccautious\u201d and \u201cmethodical\u201d about the procurement process, in part because it is new technology and requires the technical aspects to be scrutinized.\n\u201cThere is a real appetite, over time, for a stronger role for the private sector in public transit infrastructure,\u201d Yakabuski said. \u201cWe're committed to engaging and listening to all ideas to ensure that we make our decisions with an eye toward getting the very best value for Ontarians.\u201d\nTranspo said the move will see the removal of more than 1,300 buses from the street over the next few years.\nLast August, the province ordered the Toronto Transit Commission to apply for federal funding to extend the Broadway subway line. There are no immediate plans to apply for the funding, said TTC chair Josh Colle.\n\u201cWe're waiting to see how the province rolls out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's a lot of pieces, there's a lot of issues to work through there.\u201d\nAs part of its Queen's Park priorities for the fall budget, the provincial government has said it will partner with three major cities on a project to bridge the east-west divide and improve the flow of people around their respective cities.\n\u2014 With files from David Shum and Marieke Walsh\nReport Typo/Error\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "NEW YORK, (Reuters) \u2013 Royal Dutch Shell has pulled out of a lobbying coalition in the United States that supports the Paris climate agreement, another sign of foreign companies\u2019 confusion about Washington\u2019s unclear climate policy.\nThe pullout by Shell, a big supporter of renewable energy like solar, is another sign of lingering uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on climate change under a Republican administration that has ditched an Obama-era climate change agreement with China and re-nominated Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe potential for Trump to remove himself from this agreement has led many business leaders to dump their positions in some groups that support it, such as the American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas companies.\nThe companies also want to avoid getting caught up in a climate change debate where activists say they are already an active partner of the U.S. government and in some cases prominent exporters of greenhouse gases to the United States. This has led some businesses and politicians to adopt the rhetoric that U.S. fossil fuels are vital for domestic economic success.\nMost of Shell\u2019s oil and gas reserves are overseas, so for the group\u2019s economic goals to play out, it is important that exports continue.\nEuropean oil and gas major BP quit the coalition earlier this year, citing \u201cpolitical uncertainty,\u201d according to a report in business publication The Drum.\nCanada\u2019s Cenovus Energy Inc also left the coalition, according to a Reuters report.\nA Shell spokesman said its corporate social responsibility arm, Corporate Shell Sustainability, had been a member of the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s Energy Sector Policy Advisory Group since 2008.\nThe spokesman said the company had reviewed the position of the group to find that an alignment was not possible after about seven years. He declined to say why, but said \u201cgoing forward, Shell\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability will not include membership in trade groups.\u201d\n\u201cUnlike other energy organizations, we evaluate the groups we join based on an objective, evidence-based evaluation of their positions and objectives,\u201d the spokesman said.\nHe also said the group did not have such a prominent position because the specific views it advocated had been too theoretical or uncontroversial for a company like Shell.\n\u201cAs such, we don\u2019t need to engage on the same issues at the same level,\u201d he said.\nCompanies still have to support the U.S. government\u2019s environmental policies, however, such as a carbon tax or a federal push for more electric cars, said Joe Hulet, a professor of Environmental Law at the University of California.\nShell is taking a strong stance about policy issues such as the environment, \u201cbut it\u2019s not what you need to do in this business for your company to be successful,\u201d he said.\nThe Energy Sector Policy Advisory Group was formed to provide Exxon Mobil Corp and Shell with advice on climate policy issues.\nThe U.S. Energy Department and four oil and gas companies joined the group. BP, BP Exploration USA, Inc., Eni SpA , Royal Dutch Shell plc and I. E. Oil & Gas International S.A. LLC. joined in 2009.\nShell had its own private, non-political policy group, in addition to the one with API.

Zach Gibson/Getty Images\nDonald Trump went head-to-head with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in the first quarter of the 2016 election, and his campaign appears to have emerged the winner. According to a report by the New York Times on Monday, Trump\u2019s campaign raised a whopping $30 million. That beat expectations that had it raising around $15 million. The only Democrat whose campaign didn\u2019t fare as well was Bernie Sanders, who raised roughly $15 million in the first quarter.\nTrump\u2019s campaign has spent a reported $21 million of that amount on Trump\u2019s legal costs, public appearances, and advertising, but the report states that its focus on money since it officially entered the race has paid off. \u201cHis campaign has not incurred debt since January,\u201d the Times says.\nAccording to The Hill, the Democratic National Committee is still more than $16 million in debt, with the rest of the party\u2019s spent on various party projects such as research and online advertising.\nAnd while the Times points out that the filing is only the first step in the fundraising race, the numbers certainly seem to indicate Trump is the favorite to emerge victorious in the primary and be the Republican nominee for president. The Times adds that Trump\u2019s campaign raised far more than any other candidate, with Rubio finishing only fourth among GOP candidates with $5.1 million. Trump and Clinton are expected to give more updated fundraising numbers in the next few weeks.\nTrump took aim at Democrats, saying during a press conference on Sunday that they are now \u201cobsessed\u201d with the race. Trump, who does not have a super PAC to back him up, also made note of how the Democrats, trying to distract from the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server, have been doing everything they can to disparage him while at the same time they conveniently forget how he raised $10 million in the last few weeks. \u201cDemocrats are obsessed with me so much they forgot what it is they\u2019re obsessed with.

The duo provided him with a helping hand as the Manchester club opened up a six-point gap over nearest rivals Arsenal, who drew 0-0 at Southampton. Pogba, on loan from Juventus, was Fulham\u2019s main tormentor in the first half, teed up Marcus Rashford with an inviting cross which the striker walloped over. He then misfired from a neat layoff from his captain, Paul Pogba, but the ball fell for Juan Mata, who forced the first save of the evening from West Ham\u2019s Lukasz Fabianski.\nBut aside from having first-half chances to score himself, we won\u2019t soon forget the resulting penalty - after Hernandez was adjudged to have fouled Rashford. And Pogba sent Fabianski the wrong way, following a perfectly-executed routine from the left flank. A buoyant Pogba could not contain his glee after hitting the back of the net, leaning across and pointing to the skies in celebration.\nMan Utd 2-1 West Ham PAUL POGBA scored his 10th goal of the season, and 11th of the season, after being fed by Marcus Rashford\nPaul Pogba scored from the penalty spot against West Ham\nMidfielder Valencia gave Pogba a hand with the first assist, sending on-loan Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey through on goal, but the South Wales youngster failed to collect and the chance was wasted. Ramsey then helped create a goal for Pogba, who fired in from close range after the former Spain international shot was parried by Fabianski.

{"text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Nathan Chen found enough time to spare between competing at the world figure skating championships and now competing at the Stars on Ice tour.\nHe marked both occasions with U.S. flags lining the practice rink at Nassau Coliseum. Chen will bring a huge American flag, which he says brings him as much joy as performing on the biggest stage of his career.\nChen is, of course, familiar with the sports venue, having competed there when he was in his native California. Now, as he hopes to repeat as world champion, he\u2019s traveling to New York for Stars on Ice. He also is on the team for the Four Continents Championships next month, where he will be defending his title.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely exciting to be going, not just to compete again, but just to have time to train and rehearse and get used to the time difference,\u201d Chen said Tuesday. \u201cBut it\u2019s an event and I have to focus on getting ready for the event first and hopefully perform well.\u201d\nChen has been long known as a consistent competitor and the top American in the field, but he\u2019s on a roll lately. He won the U.S. championships at the end of last month and is the favourite for the world title in two weeks. His new long program (which he\u2019ll attempt in London) features a different theme with changes to the theme from both his short program and freeskate.\nIt\u2019s a bit of a change for Chen, who was most successful in free skate, winning the gold medal at the 2017 world championships and the free skate at the 2018 Olympic Games. But his short program, although far from perfect, won him gold in the American championships.\nNow, however, Chen is evolving to incorporate elements in the long program he\u2019s done only infrequently in his previous two seasons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep learning new tricks because I wanted to make sure I\u2019m doing the best (program) I can going into the Olympic Games,\u201d Chen said. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t land everything, I feel like I\u2019m learning new things and adding little things to my repertoire.\u201d\nAs those new elements begin to catch on, he hopes, so will his medal chances at the Olympics.\nEven though Chen won the Olympic gold medal in Vancouver four years ago, he ended up on the medals podium five times in major international competitions (winning three). He took silver at the world championships in 2017 but was looking for a banner season heading into the Olympics. He fell on the first jump he tried, the triple axel, and was eliminated from the medal round.\n\u201cThe key to success is learning every single day,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThat can sometimes be frustrating because you have goals you set for yourself. But you have to forget about those things and focus on what you are doing in the moment. I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in recent weeks.\u201d\nHe found that wisdom while competing in China. The winner, Jin Boyang, earned the last American spot on the Olympic team, and Chen did well in Hong Kong, helping him reach the team final. At the Europeans, Chen surprised himself by taking second place and kept the spirit of competition alive.\nNow, as the world championships are right around the corner, he\u2019s eager to put more work into his free skate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one event where I have room to work on my long program without pulling from other components of the performance,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt gives me the opportunity to create something completely different than what I have been doing before.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\nMore AP National coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Nationalsports\n", "label": "machine"}

Critics say the bill removes protections for the breed.\nWith close ties to the fur industry, Republicans control the state senate, so the fur ban bill faces a long road to becoming law \u2014 or even to clear the state assembly. The fur debate is almost certain to resume this summer.\nAccording to statistics compiled by the Fur Information Council of America, the United States has nearly 14,000 furriers, furriers' and fur shops, putting New York City by far the largest apparel center in the country.\nThe issue has pitted animal welfare activists, many of whom wear fur, against the fur industry. In recent years, the Humane Society of the United States, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and other animal-protection groups have taken on fur sellers, urging New York lawmakers to act.\nNew York retailers would have to stop selling fur outright under a bill advanced Monday by the state assembly ethics and investigations committee. It was expected to have broad bipartisan support in the full chamber \u2014 but its passage would still depend on the actions of the Senate.\nNew York City's fashion industry includes about 3,000 companies \u2014 representing about 150 million square feet of retail space.\nThe fur industry contends that fur is as effective as a clothing alternative as cotton. And it argues that labeling fur and sometimes \"endangered\" species as endangered does not fairly account for the economic benefits that its products bring.\n\"Thank you very much for supplying winter clothing!\" Kelly Killoren Bensimon, former \"Project Runway\" judge and editor-in-chief of Closetcouture.com, said in a video thanking lawmakers.\nAnimals that are bred for their pelts are often subjected to cruel procedures, but no fur has been found to cause human illness or death.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Tim Overman.\nThe case is related to an ongoing investigation by Chardon police, Overman said.\nBailey was charged with pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor and gross sexual imposition, according to online records. He is being held in the Trumbull County Jail, according to online records.\nThe Ohio High School Athletic Association released a statement Friday:\n\"We are aware of the alleged incident involving one of our certified wrestling coaches.

The warrant was for failing to register as a Tier III sex offender.\nOverman said the Chardon Police Department requested an investigation last month into an alleged incident involving Bailey and a girl in which he made unwanted advances to her. Chardon police then conferred with Cuyahoga County prosecutors, who initiated a filing of the investigation.\nSt. Vincent-St. Mary wrestling head coach Tom Shine contacted the FBI on Monday and shared information about the \"potential criminal activity,\" according to O'Toole's letter.\nThe FBI's Public Corruption and Public Integrity Section in Cleveland assisted school administrators, Overman said.\nSt.Vincent-St. Mary headmaster Randy DeSandor said he expects to share findings of the federal investigation within the next few weeks.\n\"Because of the nature of the proceedings, I cannot discuss the specifics of the investigation or the information provided by Mr. Shine, however it is clear we must take whatever steps are necessary to protect the health and safety of our students and to maintain the integrity of the educational mission of our school,\" DeSandor said in the letter.\nHave something to add to this story?

I'm trying to work my way back into the lineup here as we go.\"\nMiller, 32, has not tried playing in back-to-back games yet, which manager Rick Renteria said is a good sign that the left-handed hitting first baseman is near a full-contact return from his injury. Miller said he will have an MRI on his ankle Tuesday, and he hasn't decided whether he will play in one game before heading back to Minnesota after the Sox return home.\nMiller sprained his ankle in an awkward slide at first base July 25. He said he did not remember sliding but learned about it after the pain shot up, hit him in the stomach and got him up and running.\nMiller's wish would be to avoid a season-long recovery this time and return immediately, but he said he has been told it takes three to five months for a recovery to begin to be consistent.\n\"I know it took me six weeks to get over that initial stage (of getting back), and I felt pretty good, so that was a good sign,\" Miller said. \"I feel good right now, which is hopefully good enough for me to come back and get going.\"\nThough it's still possible he could be a candidate for trades at the trade deadline, Miller said he has not talked to general manager Rick Hahn about it.\n\"I don't know what the market could be or the choice of stuff that could be out there or otherwise, but my goal is not to get traded,\" Miller said. \"It's to just wait until I'm ready to go. \u2026 That's part of what makes the decision even harder is that if you have the choice to sit back, you sit back and say, 'Let's keep it moving.'

{"text": "Being a vegan isn\u2019t hard \u2014 like actually, it\u2019s not hard at all. But McDonald\u2019s may want to reconsider adding more vegan items to its menu, which has already been revamped after reportedly adding no-meat burgers earlier this year.\nAccording to McDonald\u2019s, two new items will be coming later this year: a crispy beef burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and ranch sauce and a grilled chicken burger.\nIn early 2018, McDonald\u2019s introduced a new Buttermilk Crispy Tenders, raised the bratwurst and released a vegan veggie burger.\nAnd that\u2019s not all.\nIn early 2018, McDonald\u2019s also introduced McSkillet Burritos, McFlurry Shake Thrus and some kid meals.\nAt this time, McDonald\u2019s does not offer its food vegan or vegetarian options.\nJust like no-meat burgers, there are a few answers as to why this has been the case \u2014 but also some suggestions as to how it could be easily and quickly addressed.\nWhy did McDonald\u2019s begin selling no-meat burgers?\nKazuo Kodama, the CEO of Koneoka Corp., which produces food for McDonald\u2019s, told Newsweek in 2017, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the ingredients,\u201d as GMO is currently banned from agriculture in Japan. This certainly won\u2019t slow down McDonald\u2019s commitment to progress.\n\u201cThis is just a small test of different products to try to improve customer experience. We\u2019re trying to find ways to improve quality,\u201d Steve Easterbrook, CEO of McDonald\u2019s, told CNN shortly after the original test was unveiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a vision for the brand to be premium and better, and this is one step in that direction.\u201d\nMore: McRib Is Coming Back to McDonald's in 2019 for a Very Short Time\nKodama told Newsweek the items will remain a small part of the menu and that the test will end sometime later this year.\nWhat about additional vegan options on its menu?\nKeeping with the thought process that spurred the test, vegan recipes have not yet been added to McDonald\u2019s menu.\nThe good news is though that McDonald\u2019s has done away with its famed Filet-O-Fish sandwich and it recently tested a new campaign called Happy Meal Extras that includes such items as smoothies, quinoa fries and other treats.\nIt\u2019s also not hard to source vegan versions of some of its meat dishes, like the McRib sandwich.\nThe Rib BBQ BBQ burger substitutes the meat with beet-based nuggets in lieu of the standard beef. And according to The Verge, you can get it with a whopping 180 ingredients that don\u2019t include meat, and it will not only leave your body feeling fuller, but your carbon footprint will get a lot smaller, too.\nWhy is this necessary?\nSome people think McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food restaurants should ditch the meat in their food to help slash their carbon footprint and improve their customers\u2019 health and the environment.\n\u201c[If] all you have is McDonald\u2019s, you\u2019ve got plenty of meatless burgers from which to choose,\u201d argues HealthyKFC, according to Food52. \u201cWhile we love our kids\u2019 toys, they don\u2019t distract us from our nutrition goals (greenhouse gases, animal cruelty, no egg).\u201d\nClearly, the drive for vegan food hasn\u2019t stopped there. Starbucks announced in March that it will add vegan and vegetarian options to both its stores and drive-thrus to help support, and possibly even offset, the negative impact meat has on the environment.\nConsidering there\u2019s so much meatless food available nowadays, why is McDonald\u2019s lagging behind?\n", "label": "machine"}

For the first time in five years, Weir's score was actually lower than Tiger Woods' score.\n\"This is my fifth year here, and so far I haven't really played well,\" said Weir, after his round at Augusta National. \"I'm happy to be in contention, even though I didn't hit the ball well today. It was only one day, so I'm going to leave it in the hands of the people that handle the scoreboard. I'll be excited when that comes around, but the scoreboard takes care of itself.\"\nWEST SIDE MAN: Deseret News sports editor Jody Genessy drew a lot of media attention as he took over the Masters telecast and fanned the right sails as he explained his own career evolution from a San Diego high school sports reporter to a golf writer to a golf guru.\nAs a media member during the 1930s and '40s, the tendency was to follow sports simply as entertainment. Other sports, especially baseball, were still out of the question. But as a World War II amateur, golf became a difficult game to leave and Genessy spent the last four years of the war covering it. During the war he formed a school of sports journalism that sent journalists to Kansas, Ohio, Michigan and Iowa where they covered baseball, wrestling and track.\nIn 1946, the U.S. Army bought a large piece of land near Junction City, Kan., where they built a new post camp. As the Army moved in, the press access to all sporting events in the area was to be based out of Junction City and the press could begin filing stories and photography. Genessy moved to Junction City, where he helped set up a sports press center, much like the media centers in Salt Lake and Provo. He writes the Saturday column for the Junction City Mercury and has had a column in the Wichita Eagle since 1965.\n\"I believe we couldn't have done it without Junction City,\" Genessy said during his Masters commentary. \"I think they had to accept the Army and we had to accept them. There was an understanding. I think they wanted our veterans and they realized that the best athletes were Army and Air Force people. They thought it was a positive thing. And we figured that out on our own.\n\"And how proud I am to have been able to live in a place like Junction City, where we share stories about the war, the way we worked. We're all connected. We're like a small family.\"\nON THE NET: Summer Tidbits continues with the on-the-field numbers of the Seattle Mariners\nMonday ranked the 19th day in a row the Mariners were one of the highest scoring teams in Major League Baseball.

A minister has requested an investigation, local prefect Jerome Delpech said.\nSixty firefighters were still present in the central Paris landmark by mid-afternoon, working in cool, damp conditions. Images of the blaze were broadcast live as firefighters tried to contain and extinguish it.\nParis fire officials called on workers to close the observation deck on top of the cathedral, but visitors can still visit the top floor, which was opened in the 18th century and served as a royal palace until a series of fires destroyed it in the 19th century.\nParis prosecutor Remy Heitz said no-one was hurt and only the scaffolding was damaged. He urged visitors to stay away from the cathedral to avoid further damage.\nThe roof was partly damaged on Notre Dame\u2019s three levels and flames could be seen moving into the interior of the popular tourist attraction. At 9:30 a.m., it still looked like firefighters were trying to extinguish the flames, with mist covering the area below. One fire engine was parked in the iconic cathedral\u2019s courtyard, as several other fire engines approached the tall marble structure. Paris fire officials had sent firefighters to the cathedral in the 18th century and its future has been a subject of speculation over the past few years.\nA previous renovation in the 18th century and a 2002 fire that lasted nearly eight months were both blamed on the popular tourism attraction\u2019s high profile and wealthy clientele, but Paris fire officials also said that one of their causes had been a human error that led to faulty wiring. Notre Dame is Paris\u2019 most visited site, drawing 6.7 million visitors last year. Its tower is home to the golden statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the original image of the Virgin Mary.\nOn Twitter, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was praying for the damaged premises of Notre Dame.\nElevators are open inside the cathedral, as well as a gift shop and an elevator service to the tower. The church and its \u201ccamera platform\u201d cost 4.7 million euros ($5.3 million) to renovate and were set to be opened this year. A thousand people would visit the viewing deck on top of the cathedral each day, on peak days.\nThe fire tore through cables during the fire, which would make it particularly difficult to complete the project on time, fire officials said.\nAdvertising\nParis authorities must obtain new permits before the renovation can begin, although they are expected to resolve the issue quickly, the prefect said.\n", "label": "machine"}

However, some of his team-mates have found it hard to adjust to life in Turin and the 30-year-old appeared to be livid with his side's performances in a training session on Thursday.\nAnd one video posted by Magri Warrios on their official Twitter account appears to show the Portuguese star in a fiery rant over their performance. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to have the ball,\u201d Ronaldo screams into the camera after two straight passes he had chipped went begging. He added: \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to be here, you work extremely hard but you\u2019re not champions. \u201cYou have to work harder and look at these lads as the champions of Italy.\nCristiano Ronaldo looks angry as he laments his Juventus performances in training\n\u201cYou work for us, we pay you\u2026 so how come they\u2019re not champion? Because they don\u2019t deserve it!\u201d His rant comes just hours after he scored a brace to wrap up a 3-0 win over Udinese. The two-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner has been returning to his scoring form just as he was expected to given his impressive time at Real Madrid. And he said after the game that it was \u201can unbelievable feeling\u201d to be back scoring after a barren spell in which he netted just once in six games.\nRonaldo is on target for Juventus in the Premier League\n'You don't deserve to have the ball', Cristiano Ronaldo screams in video\n\"I think I'm in the right moment at the moment,\" he said. \"Sometimes you have bad days, I've been in the same situation where I wanted to score more goals for Real Madrid, but I'm not trying to score 12 goals every week.\" Ronaldo is now targeting the double this weekend as his side take on Napoli, who are level on points with the Serie A leaders in second place. \u201cThey have quality, they\u2019re playing well,\u201d he said.\nRonaldo scores a superb free-kick against Udinese as he continues to heat up for Juventus\n\"We know Napoli\u2019s weak points, they\u2019re very well organised and very fast. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be difficult but it\u2019s a pleasure to play against them.\u201d One player hoping to add to their tally is Mario Mandzukic, who is back in action after recovering from a shoulder injury.

{"text": "Outside Looking In: Memento Mori and Other Essays\nTC Boyle\nIain Tomlinson\nFour Stars\nIn the opening review for this book, Sarah Helm bought into one of the themes TC Boyle gets into, if not entirely, then at least as a central play on words to display his strengths. In her piece on Inside Voices, she shared a morning phone call with the newspaper he wrote for, the Independent. In it, he tells the tragic story of an elderly man he had bumped into and befriended, whom he discovered had fallen out of a third floor window, breaking his jaw and left a \u201cgrubby pile of rubbish\u201d outside, the only people he managed to see, he tells his editors, were a priest and \u201ca blind man who looks for a glimpse of Jesus\u201d.\nTC Boyle is to quote Reverend David Campbell as saying: \u201cAnyone who has a voice knows that often the most important voices are those that people can\u2019t hear.\u201d\nIn this collection of essays, above all \u2013 however much he would attempt to stress this in his opening \u2013 something vital is lost from the text of the resulting two-volume monograph which contains more than 300 short pieces, \u201cpreviously unpublished, connected narratives in which \u2018ordinary people\u2019 and their stories come to life.\u201d Where the end of the short -story form in Mr Saunders, the eponymous novel by The Observer\u2019s reviewer, Neal Gabler, sits tensely between fiction and non-fiction, where two of the splendid-titled essays, \u201cFace Time\u201d and \u201cAlchemy for Beginners\u201d, effectively re-tell the story of Tolstoy\u2019s fictional creation by imagining how he might have moulded one of his invented creations.\nOut of the Square: The Pearlies\nBoyle is usually remarkable for his turns of phrase, which find their way into \u201calchemy for beginners\u201d in the description of how Lord Byron performed his power posing, which he describes in breathless terms of \u201ccommitting a short-lived indigestion to memory\u201d. Even within the short essays, a number of himatic references weave through them, such as the fourth essay, \u201cMemento Mori\u201d which leads off with both an example of a flawed gene and a metaphor about the division of materials and their destined physical ends.\nThere is a capacity throughout to move from one topic to another, to write about a subject from various perspectives and a dogged determination to talk to people to get an idea of their lives and opinions. This is evident, however, in an early paper which quotes human immunodeficiency virus co-discoverer Peter Fleming: \u201cWho shot Kennedy, who shot Kennedy? . . . My only source is my own.\u201d\nOf course, one of the things that distinguishes Boyle from many of his contemporaries is his willingness to acknowledge that sometimes, what people may still be motivated by is less important than what he believes were the greater causes and conditions that allow problems and problems to develop. In the fourth essay in the book, \u201cFace Time\u201d, the writer says of the final Joseph Conrad novel, Heart of Darkness, \u201cTo read what Conrad had to say about America on the eve of the scandal of Watergate is very moving. But we are left pondering what might have been, if the content had been just the words\u201d.\nAmong the stories in the collection, as well as a couple of reflections on the work of his friend and colleague Robert Macfarlane, is the most poetically evocative extract. It is from George Beckwith\u2019s story \u201cOn This Island\u201d and begins with a man driving along the M40. Without specifying, the long narrative sees the limo transfer its passengers from one unoccupied road to another:\n\u201cOn a patch of mud there lay a rock.\nThat stone had wandered here.\nYou could smell the dark undergrowth and dream\nabout the cultivated earth of this big house where you\u2019re staying . . .\nThe asphalt came past and was clapped into the hand.\nNow we were on her own.\n\u201cDeath\u2019s drive.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By AP\nIn the era of Amazon, some brick-and-mortar stores are trying a new tack: offer free rides from the car to the store.\nExperian-owned payment platform PayPal is in talks with ride-hailing service Uber to integrate the Uber mobile app into its system. This would let shoppers use the Uber app to unlock their doors at stores when they choose to split the cost with friends using PayPal's credit or debit card. And a courier messenger would then collect the goods from the store using the same app.\nThe idea is that if a shopper thinks they can get a better price on a sweater from a nearby retailer, they could tip the courier with a digital tip. And if they see another hot-selling item at a store nearby, they could get a ride and head there to find it.\n\"It's an effective way to get the customer in,\" said a PayPal spokesman. The plan still needs regulatory approval before it could roll out nationally.\nAnother company, personal delivery service Postmates, lets consumers order from roughly 800 online retailers and send the goods to other consumers who are nearby.\nNow some of the biggest retailers in the U.S. are getting in on the act. Target is running a pilot program that lets shoppers order from 100 stores nationwide via an app, and then have the order delivered from a host of nearby locations via a host of designated courier courier services. Similarly, Walmart is testing a service where customers who order groceries online get them at selected locations, said Sara Burt, vice president of North American retail at digital marketing agency 360i.\nBut price isn't the only factor driving retailers to offer free rides. The investment needs to be made, and the logistics needed to manage the service. Target has said that it won't be setting a delivery fee for delivery \u2014 just a small charge of about 1 cent per delivery \u2014 in an effort to simplify the process.\nAnd there are legal obstacles. The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California says it's concerned that Lyft and Uber drivers who deliver goods for the retailers are likely to be treated as employed contractors rather than employees. (Over the last two years, drivers for the ride-hailing apps have been pushing for better wages and working conditions, some suing Uber over workplace discrimination and wrongful termination.)\nRegardless, retailers appear to be taking a look at other ways of getting shoppers into their stores.\n\"The whole notion is no more push and no more pull,\" says Colette Buchbinder, a retail associate at NYCMetric in Manhattan. For the most part, retailers are trying to be more integrated and offer innovative ways to drive foot traffic, said Anupam Mittal, global retail strategy leader at consulting firm EY.\nBenson Hill, the owner of a New York City bagel shop, plans to charge 7 cents for every Uber pick-up, because he thinks the service will bring in new customers.\n", "label": "machine"}

Omar from Trump amid controversy over 9/11 remarks\nSeveral high-profile Democrats defended Rep. Ilhan Omar on Friday against President Donald Trump's criticism of her 9/11 comments.\nTrump referenced statements the Minnesota Democrat made about \"honoring Israel\" and \"Jewish money\" on Thursday while attending the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's gala, saying she was apologizing for her language when she was actually paying homage to victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nStory Continued Below\n\"Every statement you've made, every action you've taken is rooted in what I consider to be profoundly false accusations,\" Omar responded on Twitter on Friday. \"If we do not accurately reflect history, we risk continually repeating it. I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight against anti-Semitism, white supremacy and bigotry in all forms.\"\nOmar later followed up on her tweets by calling Trump's comments an act of \"retaliation\" for her actions on the House floor.\nOmar and Trump have crossed paths frequently in the past, but the Trump administration's characterization of Omar's remarks as hate speech was an abrupt move. The White House's attempts to link Omar to Israel have been met with resistance on Capitol Hill, including from Pelosi (D-Calif.), who told reporters Friday, \"I think that was wrong.\"\nPelosi and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) were among Democrats assailing Trump's personal attack on Omar, a Muslim woman and the first-ever Somali-American to be elected to Congress. It marked the first time Trump had ever linked a Somali-American American to his administration's policy of separating migrant families at the border.\n\"Comments like these are why @IlhanMN is a US Congresswoman and not a White House staffer.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \"He was expressing grief over the loss of so many innocent lives on 9/11 and feeling empathy for the victims, losing so many of our colleagues and people. The president, on the other hand, was expressing the same kind of hatred and bigotry that he\u2019s advocated for his entire life, not just as president.\u201d\nOther Democrats, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, chided Trump for targeting a member of the caucus rather than focusing his attention on the problems at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\"To say that one person can\u2019t express their emotions is Trumpian racism at its worst. Instead of trying to empty our congress of one Muslim member, why don\u2019t you work with Sen.

Elizabeth Warren noted that the 9/11 attacks were \"about American values\" and had nothing to do with Islam.\n\"I was at the Holocaust museum yesterday and the 9/11 attacks happened 9/11.

New reports have revealed that Viacom has signed a deal to be a channel supplier for T-Mobile\u2019s 5G launch, as per Recode.\nObviously, much remains to be made of this addition of a multimedia powerhouse to T-Mobile\u2019s growing stable of content distribution points. However, it does mean that the home broadband service now includes two more channels, as well as the ability to use Dish\u2019s Sling TV over the T-Mobile 5G service.\nShortly after T-Mobile announced that it will be launching a new 5G home broadband service as part of its \u201cWe Can\u2019t Wait\u201d campaign earlier this year, it acquired Layer3 TV, a Denver-based TV streaming service. In addition to that, T-Mobile made a $175 million equity investment in Auralink, a wireless broadband provider based in Italy.\nAll of these acquisitions point to what is looking to be an exciting time for T-Mobile\u2019s home broadband service, which uses millimeter wave frequency. 5G, which is currently only being tested in limited areas, offers a completely different experience from the fast Wi-Fi signals that currently powers much of the internet. The 3G and 4G models have had success at bringing not only faster speeds, but a much greater increase in speed. Those speedy connections are what make a huge difference in how long an online video or game can last before it has to be restarted.\nThe internet allows consumers to stream services like Netflix for longer periods of time than they do with Wi-Fi. It seems that Viacom is attempting to combat this at least a bit with this move. In addition to the new \u201cVeggieTales\u201d and \u201cMy Little Pony\u201d shows that the company will provide for its 6 million T-Mobile 5G subscribers, Viacom also plans to offer other TV shows and movies, as well as on-demand \u201con-demand access\u201d to its premium content services \u2014 not just shows.\nBeyond the new content coming to T-Mobile 5G TV, the network will also boast 360-degree video capability, plus services like Direct TV and Music Choice.

{"text": "The latest video at YouTube's ranking chart by PsykoGaming is of young gamers playing retro video games on their Air Pro Turbos, but when Nintendo gets wind of the game, things get messy.\nThe video is from PsykoGaming's main channel and in it shows their players playing classic Nintendo games like Space Harrier and Frogger while hanging upside down from their Air Pro Turbos. Nintendo had a message for them saying that the challenge of hanging upside down was just one step too far. They didn't stop there. Now Nintendo is sending one of PsykoGaming's other YouTubers a cease and desist letter over an animated GIF the two were sharing with one another.\nThe video went viral earlier this week with over half a million loops and is rapidly gaining followers. But when Nintendo heard about it they got super pissed.\nWhy would Nintendo get mad at these videos you ask?\nThe reason comes from the way that PsykoGaming organised their Air Pro Turbos competition. Their game of choice is the arcade title Frogger. To participate, you have to attach your Air Pro Turbos directly to your seat. There are 16 people competing for a total of $US10,000 ($13,048) in prize money and PsykoGaming pulled an obvious fake out of the hat when they disguised the Air Pro Turbos as you, the participant.\nThat's no small feat. As Kotaku has previously reported, the best people in the world rigged Bluetooth controllers to spell out \"SHIT\" in Morse code and display everyone's entries. Nintendo had no concept that anyone would give Air Pro Turbos a try. So after two spin-offs, the threesome, consisting of AMir Khan, Raveon George and Benjamin Barton, took down this video. But when they weren't recognised as Air Pro Turbos competitors, they uploaded the challenge to their main YouTube channel under the name \"Air Up\".\nI spoke to PsykoGaming's CEO, Mr D, who told me that he is fighting back, even with \"millions\" of views on his YouTube channel. He first purchased and custom-built the game itself and has built numerous different challenges that have ended in various degrees of success. \"Air Up\", however, was the first competition the trio had each created with a new game and Nintendo caught wind of it.\nNot only is PsykoGaming on top of Nintendo's internet hit list, but all of the partners are fighting back as well. In an interview with GameSpot, Air Up explained that Nintendo had made a specific comment about the Air Pro Turbos challenge that they would have \"better luck against a sushi chef\". From the looks of the video, it's a legitimate comment. Mr D and all of the partners went and got their own gadgets but, more interestingly, each is using a specific texture on the game box as their facade. As a Wii user, who sold all their Metroid Prime 3 and Majora's Mask games, Mr D would have come across the surface before and probably noticed it, so instead of printing the texture out, he coated it in something that reminds him of pinstripes or dress shirts. AMir, who built the game, had thought about using steel, but now the \"T\" in Air Up was near a pitiful shape that looks like some awful counterfeit might have been pressed on the game.\nRegardless of who used which texture, all of the participants were somehow caught up in the problem and were given the side eye by Nintendo. Now, Nintendo is demanding that each partner produce a video admitting to Nintendo that they are using Nintendo's products and explain how it relates to a video competition. At this point, it's a load of shit but when did Nintendo ever focus on competition in video games? It's the reason they're huge.\nNintendo declined to comment on the cease and desist letter but Mr D has a single message for Nintendo: Come on man.\n", "label": "machine"}

It will soon take full control of the network.\nWhile on March 17, Biman Bangladesh Airlines built 562 of the 586 planned high-speed 3G sites while on March 18, Reliance and BTRC switched on their respective 800 MHz and 900 MHz 4G networks. On the same day, Lentshayake Global Teleservices is expected to complete the installation of 14 LTE (long-term evolution) sites.\nIndustry sources say about half of the planned sites of these four mobile phone operators have been built up.\nBangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, in its order dated March 23, 2018, said a new 3G network service is needed for further development of the country's IT and telecom sector.\nThere is a strong need for the further development of the telecom service sector as the communications sector is a crucial factor for socio-economic development of the country.\nThrough 3G, the customer can now access internet through mobile phones and the application providers and internet service providers can use this technology to create and sell apps and services to their customers.\nIn this context, it was very important to build a large scale capacity for the provision of mobile broadband service services by establishing the new 3G network to provide fast connectivity of the telecom service to facilitate its users and support the field activities of various organisations and players operating in the IT and telecom sector, the order said.\nThe mobile phone operators' data throughput is expected to cover 100,000 Megabits per second (Mbps) and minimum 150Mbps with symmetrical speed.\nAny data message that is transmitted by the mobile phone service network with a corresponding data signal from other channels can be sent at an optimum speed of between 150Mbps and 300Mbps. However, the highest speed is mentioned only as 300Mbps.\nThe highest speed of the mobile network is reported as 300Mbps and that of BTRC' network is no higher than 400Mbps.\nEven the maximum speed of the current high-speed network is 200Mbps. And of Reliance's network, the maximum speed is 70Mbps and that of Lentshayake's is 80Mbps.\nAll these speeds depend on the regions and terrain as well.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Just days after startups like Apture landed $23 million to improve mobile web reading, another player in the AI mobile space has raised a big round. London-based Vue.ai has raised \u00a313 million in a Series B round to build an AI to improve e-commerce.\nThe next step will be to develop bespoke content types and design that deliver shopping in a UI even visually and functionally matches a physical store, unlike it feels less in-depth or like a brochure. This could sound familiar, as e-commerce giants have been trying to improve UX for some time. There\u2019s nothing miraculous about a physical catalogue, so trying to close that gap is only natural. However, there is a more complex side to what Vue.ai\u2019s technology can do for people in the world of e-commerce. It can improve the shopping experience and ultimately the customer experience, thereby improving customer lifetime value, thus much bettering the bottom line for all those involved.\nRoland Vlaz, founder of Vue.ai, explains the \u201csecret sauce\u201d is really about making shopping on the web less of a chore. Using what he terms the \u201cblade of transmedia\u201d approach, developers can apply Machine Learning principles and datasets in a way that delivers what consumers are actually looking for, at a shopping context.\nHe says: \u201cThe major competition at the moment is US-based startups who are already targeting this with their products. Their approach is to use different data sets to try and figure out what consumers are looking for. However, in many cases they aren\u2019t relying on this to do the magic, which we are. In fact, we build on existing use cases to make the magic happen.\u201d\nDr. Vlaz points to how many companies have tried to create product recommendation within mobile shopping, from companies like Jumptap and Amazon, to younger startups like Apture. But, he says, these have failed because they aren\u2019t looking at what consumers actually want. So the ability to get a specific, human, sense of what people are looking for and combine that with machine learning and deep learning tech, which we do this offline using real people\u2019s eyeballs, gives Vue.ai this advantage.\nMeanwhile, Vlaz also confirms that Vue.ai had also been considering an IPO but was advised against it by the VCs, despite its stated ambition. He says the new investment was actually backed by the same venture backer as Apture. It doesn\u2019t want an IPO now, instead preferring to continue building an innovative and disruptive company, competing with the established players.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "With Quebec\u2019s marijuana legalization about to become a reality, the producers are coming together to break the stigma.\nAlmost two months after announcing a national alliance to help break the stigma attached to cannabis and attract investors, the Recreational Cannabis Alliance announced a new joint-venture company Tuesday.\nThe Quebec-based Total Grow Canada (TGC) will manage the indoor cultivation and production at Gallin Lake, with an option to purchase 100 per cent of the facility when the entire project is operational by 2020.\nDani Spicer, vice-president at rival marijuana company Silurigen, has been a founding member of the alliance since last year.\nSpicer is backing the TGC project and will represent the company. He said the alliance is looking to bring cannabis cultivation and production to select areas that are not currently being developed. It does not yet have a partner and a team of experts to complete projects on its own.\nThe proximity of the Gallin Lake building to the Montreal region and Quebec\u2019s proximity to a stable economy meant the TGC project was a no-brainer, Spicer said.\nThe organization will also be interested in partnering with those located in cities like Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver.\n\u201cThe reality is, companies of this magnitude don\u2019t start with less than a billion,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThis is a $2- to $3-billion industry.\u201d\nSpicer said Quebec and the rest of Canada will gain access to a vast pot market that will eventually be worth $40 billion globally.\nIn 2017, there were only 400 licensed growers in Canada and the demand for cannabis was limited, Spicer said. In the near future, he expects Canada to see the same level of demand for cannabis as alcohol is today, which Spicer estimated is around 120 million litre a year.\n\u201cJust because we\u2019re going to be consuming medicinal cannabis in Canada doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a shortage,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cWe\u2019re a huge country \u2026 which means we are a thirsty country.\u201d\nFor Spicer, breaking the stigma surrounding cannabis was paramount to making this industry successful.\n\u201cIf you are going to come into cannabis, you should do it with your eye open,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cannabis aficionados out there, that\u2019s fine. The problem is, more and more people are turning away from the fact that they\u2019re cannabis users and just seeing it as an intoxicant.\u201d\nQuebec is set to legalize recreational marijuana on July 1.\nSpicer said it makes sense for TGC to expand quickly and establish operations on its own, instead of waiting until legislation and regulatory changes made by the federal government are finalized.\nDana Lavesis, president of the non-profit Cannabis Culture Ottawa, said she isn\u2019t opposed to the idea of growing marijuana on a large scale.\n\u201cIn five to seven years, I think we\u2019ll be seeing legal cannabis operations all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they going to have to grow 400,000 kilograms per year? Not necessarily.\u201d\nStill, the expected legalization of recreational marijuana means the amount of money flowing into the industry is expected to skyrocket.\nAccording to estimates from the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, there are about 750,000 annual marijuana users in Canada. The association predicts the total cost of the illicit cannabis industry in Canada will reach $19 billion in 2017. In 2018, the association expects the industry to grow to $25 billion.\nBut with regulations yet to be finalized, Spicer said it is impossible to know how much legal marijuana is going to cost.\nRegardless, Spicer said the distribution of pot in Canada will be a top priority as the industry jumps into full swing, because of the health consequences of smoking weed daily.\n\u201cWe want to be in a position to have the biggest market possible,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cSo, in the last few years, we\u2019ve talked about this being a regulated industry. But I also feel that we\u2019re only at the beginning of a competitive landscape.\u201d\njfeith@postmedia.com\nTwitter.com/jessefeith\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "On Friday, five major political parties and a nonprofit association said they had joined together with a single objective to cure the ills of the Democratic Party.\n\u201cA Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night,\u201d the Final Agenda, announced, \u201cis so promising that it will lead to a high degree of collaboration between the campaign committees, the DNC and key interest groups in the months to come. In the wake of horrific low-energy primary results, We The People have to address our strategic challenges together, with broad-based cooperation and consensus-building to ensure we can build a real pathway to nominate the candidate most prepared to win this unprecedented race.\u201d\nThe Final Agenda also noted that \u201cGiven the unprecedented nature of the party, a bipartisan, community-driven campaign has a realistic chance of coming to fruition in the coming months.\u201d\nSo, now it\u2019s a midterm season of reform. The question remains: Is the DNC really where America\u2019s primary politicians should work out their differences to get things done for the American people?\nRemember that for Democrats, 2018 was primarily a referendum on Trump. And it\u2019s clear that, especially in blue-state blue districts, they didn\u2019t necessarily feel inspired to take their anger to the ballot box.\nIf Donald Trump blows the 20 governorships up, lose the House, dominate the Senate, and leads a Democratic resurgence for the ages in 2020, the parties may be engaged in a post-\u201cblue wave\u201d reappraisal. If they are not, here\u2019s the problem: The actual work of running campaigns \u2014 whether it\u2019s fundraising, fundraising, a network of consultants, tough punditry, field organizing, defeating Trump \u2014 is doomed to remain dependent on the party primary money races that, contrary to the Final Agenda\u2019s claim, \u201chave to be seen as part of\u201d Democratic politics.\nFor those wondering, the Democratic National Committee says the GOP primary process cost between $18 million and $20 million in 2018. That means, for the general election as well.\n\u201cThe losses in the 2016 primaries were felt by all of us in the party,\u201d Amy Dacey, the former DNC chair said last week in announcing her exit. \u201cThe party continues to work hard to become a more successful organization for voters in 2018, 2020 and 2020.\u201d\nBut if Dacey is truly serious about transforming the DNC into a more efficient, less over-priced machine for fundraising, advising and campaigning, she should remember what\u2019s at stake.\nWhen George W. Bush famously told his GOP donors at a 2006 Bush-Cheney fund-raiser, \u201cI understand that politics is not a game,\u201d he wasn\u2019t referring to a single person. At that moment, that man, Karl Rove, was profiting handsomely off the political operations of his party \u2014 even as Democrats lined up against him. In fact, for years, Bush\u2019s campaign spent more money to do the same bidding of his party bosses, at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.\nBut when Bush sold out \u2014 to the deregulators, and the Wall Street bankers \u2014 both he and Rove were forced to put something far more meaningful at stake: What would stand in the way of a true bipartisan transfer of America\u2019s power and wealth to the 1% \u2014 with their access to the political system.\nWell, Rove also understood that the rule book was rigged for a result. And at least when he blamed a \u201cdictatorship\u201d for \u201ctyranny of the majority,\u201d the president-elect and other GOP elites knew who held the power that ultimately would decide that election.\nJust ask Trump. After he unleashed a rage on the Charlottesville \u201calt-left\u201d that led to the racist counter-protester Heather Heyer\u2019s death, the president met in the Oval Office with top Democrats for two days of face-to-face Oval Office talks (result: no convictions for those involved in the mob violence, and no one \u2014 including Trump \u2014 being held personally accountable for it).\nSixteen years ago, Bush learned what it took to change the rules, and the machine. And by ripping the rug out from under the long-standing party rules by finally liberating the RNC from its century-old determination to run the party in accordance with the bare minimums of number of primary elections and the even narrower preferences of Republican voters, he made room for a largely bipartisan action-forcing coalition to come together in opposition to corruption.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In addition to his being a first-team All-NBA selection, longtime Utah Jazz big man Derrick Favors recently added a feat to his growing resume.\nThe 19-year-old rookie and former University of Georgia standout, who will likely be picked up on the free-agent market if his NBA career doesn't pan out, recently tallied 27 points, 18 rebounds and six assists in a second-round playoff game with the Jazz.\nThe game pitted Favors against Miami Heat big man Hassan Whiteside.\nFavors' team won the game, 104-101, and the matchup will go down as one of the bigger upsets in the history of the NBA Playoffs.\nDespite the win, it was a disappointing season for Favors. Despite the addition of Favors and Rudy Gobert, the Jazz are embarking on the first season without Larry Krystkowiak as the head coach in team history.\nFavors' stellar play was a possible indicator of his next performance, but Favors wasn't exactly sure how it would translate for the 2014-15 season in Salt Lake City.\n\"I just hope the year goes better, I don't know,\" Favors said during the offseason. \"I'm really excited for next year, just to build some chemistry.\"\nGobert on the other hand, was as ready as he's ever been, and he was honored with his induction to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Monday night.\n\"My dream has always been to play in the Hall of Fame,\" Gobert told Doug Friedman of the Washington Post. \"I hope that this weekend goes by quickly. I love to play for the Utah Jazz because I know every game is a playoff game, so I just play my game. It's amazing to play in my backyard. I just can't get caught up in the hoopla.

The Aggies' first-ever meeting with a Pomeroy Top 100 team.\n\"I think it's exciting because we have all of these great programs in our area,\" said USU head coach Tim Duryea after Pomeroy released its rankings. \"We've got opportunities on our home court to be the best team in our league, and to be the best team in Utah, so we just want to earn those wins.\"\nFeatured in Pomeroy's Top 100 are Gonzaga, BYU, Utah, UCLA, St. Mary's, Utah State, Utah State, BYU, Utah, and UNLV.\nGolf Roundup\nThe 2017 golf season may have wrapped up a little over a month ago, but golf fans can't do much more than dream about the NBA playoffs.\nHopefully the Jazz season doesn't end this season like some Jazz fans wish it did.\nWins have been hard to come by for the Jazz this season, but a strong finish could mean a recovery in the end.\nStill, a return to the playoffs would be appreciated this season by a few Jazz fans.\n\"Despite the early struggles in 2016-17, any fan who has followed the Jazz over the past 40-plus years would like to see Sloan's organization in the postseason,\" said Glean who is a Utah Jazz fan. \"Sadly, they've not. Still, I see hope for a well run team and professional coach with one year to rectify the slow start.

{"text": "5370537724001\nI was reminded recently of many of the inconvenient truths that will probably never be true in any of our society's ''consensus'' gay or straight labels.\nJust to give an example of the blatant denial of common sense, let me not mention the denial that once upon a time homosexuality, an acquired genetic trait in this particular civilisation, was an option for the so-called minorities!\nOr the time when this contemporary civilisation declared with their whole hand that marriage is a union between a man and a woman and sanctioned it and our ancestors actually joined hands and marched their children in arms around the world as a show of their commitment, and our so-called supporters have subsequently not seen fit to show such support for same-sex couples who wish to get married and their children when the parents now want that right.\nOr even the time when some heads of state announced publicly that some religions were just not just not fit to practise as human beings, or the times when the churches and people of faith publicly declared that even if homosexuality is born in the USA as a social choice, it will ruin your life and send you to the remote corners of the Earth in a box, and the time when some people broke the law!\nThen perhaps we should give some thought to where ''rights'' really come from, before declaring for those who are otherwise law-abiding to stick a finger in the eye of the law instead!\nWe will have an even larger lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender underground colony if the government does not legislate in their favour to secure marriage equality with same-sex couples, especially in states such as WA and in marginal seats like Mansfield.\nIf you dare will now reveal your anger or disgust by shouting, you are a homophobic bigot. He is now a Nazi appeaser who is going to consign you to some federal prison as I see it and never again mention the danger of barbaric and medieval practices in the 21st century!\nImagine if government and the church could work together without fear or prejudice, especially when protected by a society that has become increasingly tolerant of other peoples' sexual orientations and gender identifications, but at the end of the day marriage equality is about society recognising the needs of same-sex couples.\nFor me personally, it is about society recognising that men can want children and women can not, and there is enough evidence that childbearing can only occur within each couple's relationship, based on shared values and demonstrated sexual interests and compatibility.\nFor further details, please contact me at 2020018.com.au, or just go to the ball park store facebook.com/ticketregister\nRay Wilson\nIt's About Time\nMunno Para\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Literary circles are rumblings with debate over WH Auden's critique of ``Superman.'' But Princeton University Press' publication of a special verse collection, ``John Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau,'' points to the soul-searching of a friendship between two of the world's greatest thinkers.\nIn ``And What Shall We Do with Our Loved Ones,'' Benjamin Franklin argues that the main emotion for the transcendent should be ``hunger,'' not awe. This ``inferior emotion'' is not sufficient to connect souls - ``if we truly were to love, we would feel nothing but hunger.''\nJames Joyce philosophizes about Thoreau's native state, Massachusetts: ``Those who cannot really love being cared for with their own pieces of this thing [their loved one's body] cannot really care.''\nSitting under an American maple tree by the sea near Walden Pond, Thoreau asked Emerson, ``Why do they cut down the trees that are so tall and thick?'' to which Emerson replied, ``A word to the wise: It's because they like the new. And the autumn is a good time to cut them down.''\nTake away the scene of deep observation and academic theory and ``Solid Seasons,'' (c. 1892-1893) comes to us soundly, movingly, and with grace. This book is deeply involving, particularly when Charles G. Hartley, a Lincoln graduate student in Pennsylvania, opens the book with correspondence he exchanged with Emerson as part of his research for his debut poetry collection, ``The Roman and the Stream.'' As Hartley puts it, ``No one has ever articulated my sense of being in the company of Emerson quite so well as you.''\nWe've all heard stories about the extraordinary two-way friendship between Thoreau and Emerson that has captured readers' imaginations for decades. This book presents a vastly more romantic view of their relationship, a strong-willed alliance, rather than a posthumous splitting of ways.\nThoreau wrote about Emerson: ``Our death, after the pleasure of life, will make us lovers. But we have no desire to remain alive and seek our natural state as lovers; that will require devotion on a powerful and intense level.'' This attitude contributed to the duo's keen eye and ear for detail. These qualities are evident in the parlor scene in which Thoreau asked Emerson why married men don't drive their cars on this road. To this he replied, ``If they are likely to find here happiness, why should they be subjected to the anxiety of people driving their cars on a road they rarely know and may never see?''\nBoth men had great curiosity about the world and were particularly interested in the wilderness. A major focus of Emerson's writing was the natural world: ``I am a pilgrim of nature.'' He often referenced the strangeness and delight of scientific investigations in nature. That pleasure is also apparent in Thoreau's correspondence with Emerson. According to Joseph Romm, author of a splendid selection of writings from Emerson and Thoreau, ``Granted, Emerson was over familiar, but he was also completely unfamiliar, and Thur and Emerson did not know each other's letters, or anything like them; I am prompted to raise a guess that often Emerson wrote him more than Thur.''\nHartley's impressive collection of the two friends' letters, letters, paintings, and diaries reveals how these two men moved along at a rate of admission: Thoreau and Emerson were readers and communicators, critiquing and expressing themselves. They both enjoyed borrowing poetry and other writings of others to weave their thoughts into their own.\nThis show of togetherness poses an enormous challenge to Hartley, whose many sources are collected in small sections that make the text cumbersome and difficult to read. At the same time, Hartley's short captioning of each page is witty and picturesque.\nWith all its apparent contradictions - power, sensitivity, fear - ``Solid Seasons'' allows Emerson and Thoreau to stand at the threshold of a new nation. Philosophers who use literary language to demonstrate significant ideas, explain important ideas, and stir their audiences to action deserve recognition as valuable and worthwhile contributors to America's heritage.\nHartley's book is a worthy addition to the Collins Collection. It tells us something new about the remarkable friendship between these two men.\nBob Blaisdell is the author of ``Charles B. Eliot: The Man Who Wrote Eureka.''\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Robot Barnacles sound like a proper hellfire. Photo: Shutterstock\nYour favourite robotic explorers on Mars might not be as loud as the stereo equivalent of spanking your posterior. Their voices range from squeaky to surly to puerile, a new study shows.\nPutting rovers on Mars has its share of quirks. On planets far, far, far away, NASA engineers don't have GPS devices or plotting tools that automatically find suitable places to land. Instead, they have to rely on gravity-assigned coordinates, history of landings and rovers that use their built-in microphones to determine a point of entry on the Red Planet's surface.\nMars' rugged terrain makes it challenging for robots. An artist's concept of the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity in the Red Planet. (Photo: NASA)\nMars missions have one limitation, the researchers behind this study note in Physics Of The Future. Unlike Earth, Mars doesn't have little speakers and pads that listen to anything that bumps into the terrain. Instead, the instruments for each Curiosity or Opportunity rover use more complex mechanisms to poke around a surface and listen to it.\nOn Mars, that means recognising new targets and retrieving soil samples so that the researchers can understand the history of the planet \u2014 information that's gained from repeated recordings on the ground. No amount of mixing works because the data the people on the rover send to the engineering controllers is relayed via radio waves. Unfortunately, they can't hear your six-wheeled commute loud and clear.\nTo overcome the communication gap, engineers devised not just cool instruments, but also some clever ways to transmit data through the Martian wilderness. Each mission design uses a series of different microphones, and their playphone, similar to modern cellphones. This way, when the rover runs out of radio waves, it still doesn't have to shout for its life.\nTo measure how distinct each different source was, the researchers used the Curiosity rover to send the same half-second of data five times over a four-month period to study the landscape it was near. In this setup, the rover was planning to sample the Martian soil to study its current temperature, and to make sure it was hanging onto the soil as it exited.\nUsing these similar frequencies, the researchers made a few basic assumptions about the voices of different sources.\n\"The distinct characteristics of the Martian terrain were interpreted as speech-like sounds,\" said lead author Irina Dundonov, an associate professor at the Institute of Computer Science at Lehigh University.\nTo determine the origins of different sources, they took audio from recordings recorded at select times on January 1, 2014, and another copy was sent a couple days later from the rover's internal mic and received by the control centre on Earth. The commands then played one of the 135 records for each source.\nAlthough there's not a lot of noise in these recordings, it was enough to see that the sounds of the technical team oscillate from squeaky to stressed to surly. In some cases, the sounds of the robot itself echo so that some expressions of confusion from the control engineer \u2014 echoing both the distance the source is from the rover, and the distance the rover is from Earth.\nHowever, the loudest sounds came from engineers who spoke those technical commands.\n\"The loudest and farthest words were language from the mission control centre,\" explained Dundonov.\nThis finding gives them some hope that our rovers might be able to somehow harmonise with a Martian landscape, communicating the difference between whatever's going on and sounding normal. One would think that a large cognitive task might distract the engineers even if they aren't speaking.\nThe future might look more like how human spaceship software worked in the 1970s. A realistic scenario, according to Dundonov, could be for a human to visually mimic what's going on with a Mars rover before receiving commands to fetch their sample by mashing a button. The robots would respond with a vague monotone thank you, and if that's all it took to get the mission off the ground, then it sounds like our little rover cousins would fit right in.\n[Physics Of The Future]\n", "label": "machine"}

Let the statement (made by Chandrababu) that my enemies are behind my arrest be based on some body\u2019s information...The party should investigate and ask Naidu why he is being supported by various governments in distant states?\u201d he asked.\nJagan said he would file a plaint against the state government and the Election Commission on Wednesday if his plea in the governor\u2019s chamber was not addressed.\n\u201cA conclave on all the political parties is being held in Hyderabad (also on Wednesday) and so there is no question of election materials being distributed there,\u201d he said.\nAlleging that the BJP was using Naidu\u2019s \u201cinfluence and money power\u201d, Jagan said the chief minister used public money to promote candidates for the second phase of the Telangana elections, which are expected to be held soon.\n\u201cNotices have been issued to MLAs to collect money during their campaign in (Andhra Pradesh) where BJP is in power. Similarly the ministers are lobbying the MLAs in other states,\u201d he said.\nThe son of former chief minister YSR Reddy challenged Chandrababu to a duel.\n\u201cChandrababu should make the use of power and money matter.
