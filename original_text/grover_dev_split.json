{"text": "NEW NORTHERN Territory Lander Thaddes Senior is at the mercy of strangers but relying on the power of all people to trigger the next explosion. Senior's new single Phased capitalises on his second coming in Newcastle after six years spent away from the city. Formed in 2012, the Tsuu Tahu in Marmong Point band disbanded before Senior returned to Newcastle in 2016, writing and recording with members of Newcastle punk collective Three Feet. Less than three years later Senior's new LP Landmarks has finally hit shelves. His frustration at the lack of people in the initial recording process sees the release of the lead single for Landmarks as a single. \"When it came to the recording people around me weren't interested in recording songs or vocals and it was my song as it was written,\" Senior told the Newcastle Herald. Senior recorded his first album When Corruption Was Defeated in Darwin. Landmarks would later be recorded on the swamps of Merewether in their cabin where Senior spent weeks cold-turkey recording. Phased is like Early Years of Senor For Small Is my Land, in which Senior and drummer Justin Pieper start things off with open guitars and airy guitars, before it meanders off into dusty gritty territory. For his second album Senior worked with Joel Wiltshire from Tex Perkins' hip-hop project Pick A Lock, as well as fellow rapper and Kurt Loder's cousin, Ethan Furler. \"When recording I was forced to mix it down in between writing and recording,\" Senior said. \"It was an oppressive environment \u2013 every day after recording I woke up it was getting hot inside the cabin.\" Senior enjoyed his time with Newcastle gangs including 37 @ 37, Phoenix and Payback, who are long-time fans. The Wyong-raised musician is hoping Landmarks will attract the same local vibe. \"It's not 'Oh this dude sells a load of records in Newcastle', this stuff is pop music at its best. \"It's a really good pop tune with songwriters who have people behind them.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Leeton-Whitton coach Daniel Muir may have played his one and only game for the season. The Crows key forward will visit a specialist in Wagga on Wednesday but the early prognosis is that his season may be over after one round. Muir dislocated his shoulder in the opening minutes of Saturday's 90-point loss to Wagga Tigers at Leeton Showground. Scans revealed a fracture and he will find out this week whether it requires surgery. \"I'd say I'm looking at 12 weeks or I dare say, season, if it's true what they're saying,\" Muir said. \"I'll have to wait and see. It's not a great start to my coaching career.\" Muir's injury was the first of many for Leeton-Whitton on Saturday, who were forced to play two short for a period in the third quarter. Key defender Tom Meline injured his hamstring, Bryce O'Garey hurt his sternum and full-forward Grant Commins rolled his ankle. Crows youngster Koby Shaw came off after a head knock, while former coach Jade Hodge was forced to stay on the ground with a hamstring strain. \"It was like Armageddon there for a while,\" Muir said. \"We had 16 on the ground for 15 minutes in the third quarter and played with 17 for pretty much the whole last quarter. \"I'm not making excuses though, we were outclassed in every aspect of the game. Full credit to Wagga, they were like a well-oiled machine.\" The Crows, like most of the competition, have the Easter weekend off and then will take on Narrandera the following week. Muir won't face the Eagles, while Meline and Hodge will be in some doubt. Mason Dryburgh will return, while Tom Van Buuren, Hayden Mahalm and Mitch Seymour could also come in. Muir must now get his head around the prospect of being a non-playing coach. \"It was frustrating on Saturday that I couldn't be out there and contribute,\" he said. \"My position in the team being a key forward is a key post too so we're going to have to rejig our forward line a bit. \"We just have to regroup now. We know internally where we're at, inside our four walls. We'll regroup as a group and a club, stay positive and keep doing the basics.\" READ MORE", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The third slap from Clive Churchill Medal winner Chris Heighington was the last straw for the Knights to come unstuck in the 44-18 belting at the hands of Manly on Sunday. Four tries to 18-man comeback kings Clint Gutherson, Nathan Figallo, Peta Hiku and Amos Roberts inside the opening 24 minutes put the game beyond the Knights before half-time and turned all their energy to get the score back to match-point at the break. For the most part, the Knights looked like a group of players who had not had a hit out for four weeks before Sunday's clash. They answered some of their critics with a strong second half performance, but the fact the loss felt much worse at the final siren means the questions about their handling will not stop anytime soon. \"I can\u2019t defend our effort which was pretty poor,\" Heighington said. \"At least twice in the second half I thought we had things where we were controlling the game and looking like we were going to go over. We just couldn\u2019t finish it off and Manly had too much of a run. All credit to Manly today but we were just off with the decision making and outwork. \"We tried to play positive footy but we won\u2019t have a shot at being the top side until we put it in the right places more often. \"It was tough to take that most as we had just got ourselves back in the race for the six. I thought we gave it a shot, just not smart enough with the decisions for the two points. \"Up until that point, we still wanted to win as we got ourselves close but we couldn\u2019t finish it off. We had too many poor decisions and that\u2019s why it got away from us.\u201d Like last week's horror result at the hands of the Eels, coach Nathan Brown's decision to move Jack Cogger to prop up in his favoured lock position from hooker and move Cameron Ciraldo to centre paid off with his first try of the season. But Cogger's outing in the No 7 jersey should not be misunderstood as the longer term solution at lock. While he started brightly up the middle, dropping a high ball after a dropped Stu Hindmarsh bomb, he spent most of the afternoon in the forwards playing second fiddle to David Klemmer. The size difference between Klemmer and the 160-centimetre Cogger means the move makes sense at some stage given both have big and athletic edges to their game. Klemmer scored one of Newcastle's two tries when he accelerated from dummy half on 25 minutes to race 55 metres and pass to Ciraldo, who scored. Ciraldo claimed the Knights shouldn't have lost that match but was satisfied with the effort against Manly. \"We didn't throw the ball around enough today,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it's a one-off for our forwards and not the rest of the team. From the [last] Newcastle game, there was some really good stuff coming off the back of it. The forwards really stepped up and started to lay a solid platform for us and we gave ourselves a chance in both halves. \"It's one game and we came up short today. But, we have to try and keep improving and not get complacent.\" A major frustration among Knights fans heading into the season was the uncertainty surrounding the status of many of their best players but that hung heavy over Manly all afternoon after Josh Drinkwater's knee injury gave the Knights just three fit front-rowers for most of the game. Origin star Robbie Farah was able to make a cameo late but the Knights looked like a side with a lot of catching up to do to be competitive. With clubs allowed two imports a year, Farah will face the chopping block if he fails to get himself and his club in shape to contend for a top-four spot in the NRL. How that plays out for the club will also depend on whether they decide to go outside the NRL for a replacement at this time.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Actor Chiranjeevi recently supported the Aarushi Talwar case and HLRD in the chorus demanding death sentence. Even the National Law Commission as well as a group of Supreme Court lawyers have questioned the innocence of the killer couple. However, not everybody agrees with the criticism. While the emotions surrounding the case are still high, it has only led to attempts to censor the media just for making speculations. The media has taken on various roles when the Talwars were convicted. They will be the first to condemn the state of affairs and the police work involved with the case. The demand for bail would be made to forestall any additional tragedies that may occur and the black propaganda would come out to back that up. By the time the judges pronounce a verdict, the story is over for all journalists. On being at the same place at the same time as the victim or accused, one would see a different face or character. Speculations about the crime even after the trial start, had led to the arrest of the couple. A legal team along with police made charges, acquitted them. Not everyone can sit through a trial, for reasons, many may not care to discuss, and not everyone would recognize the evidence. However, there have been a few events that have brought it all in sharp focus: the burning of idols in Purnea and Barabati temples, followed by rioting; the death of the two students of Jamia Millia Islamia who had a blunt object used in the attack on their head; journalist Kurung Lama\u2019s death leading to speculation that he had been the target; the murder of Sudarshan in Weizhou City, Guangdong Province; and the death of Dalits at Bhagalpur. Virtually every day they appear like an item for the tabloid magazines \u2014 and they all give reasons why they are of interest. The Nepali woman who died was raped and killed following a complaint by her husband. The Jamia students killed in Jammu were hacked with sharp blades. The Bhagalpur victims were taken into captivity. The attackers who had beaten and hanged the victims were either released or arrested. Many of the incidents were found to involve goons rather than men in uniform, who were powerless to stop them. In these cases, the government of the day tried to claim that it was impossible to know how well-equipped security forces were. In the Purnea case, most of the suspects were arrested, but it took 13 months before all the skeletons were in the cupboard, or, as the case may be, in the cranium. The culprits had even been identified. The parents of the deceased became our heroes. It is not the criminals who deserves praise or blame. Its the mentality and part of human nature which leads some to commit some of the most atrocious crimes, for no other reason than they could. There is also a bigger question: why do we suffer with so much inhumanity, rather than having the patience to forgive and deal with those who commit a sin? Even for the best of them, one would not blame our civil society for opting for a harsher and more draconian punishment; what\u2019s the use of the court of public opinion? Does it not suffer from the same limitations? If a girl is raped or murdered, is it justifiable for the girl to take the law into her own hands, hoping to get the maximum punishment? Does it not justify her taking her own life to avenge the injustice she feels is done to her? Thug life is clearly a path that has no destination, only the hope of being free from a life of troubles. Nothing would be gained by being brazen about it. As religion and politics interact, so does our collective humanity. When an evil is attempted to be eliminated, how can we overlook the inhumanity to the rest of humanity? It is said that a nose has a face; and, when we watch a faultlessly simple and pure-minded girl turning into a furious and violent aggressor in little time, there is no doubt that she has the face of an assassin. It is our human instincts. But this could also lead us to overlook our differences, let alone our similarities, and put them out of our sights. We should see that as a scientific hypothesis first rather than a human being. To live together and inter-relate, we can take lessons from the Talwars\u2019 act of ultimate cruelty. We can learn to live with our differences in a mature atmosphere. Such have been our angry, unkind and violent prejudices, as well as the defence that such offences must be punished in a ruthless manner \u2014 even if the guilt is invisible.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "ONE of Australia's most senior health bureaucrats is under fire for repeatedly using his phone during an emotional presentation by pelvic and hernia mesh victims at a forum where the Morrison Government was slammed for its response to a series of medical device scandals. Department of Health deputy secretary Professor John Skerritt used the touchscreen on his phone during a 30-minute film presentation that included a woman saying she was in constant pain and \"totally incontinent, living in urine-soaked pads\", and another saying \"We've lost our mental health, our physical health and many of us contemplate suicide every day\". Professor Skerritt's phone use angered women who wept during the presentation, only minutes after Greens Senator Rachel Siewert cried during a Skyped speech while talking about the impact of devastating submissions by pelvic mesh victims to a Senate inquiry she chaired in 2018. Nicolle Germano, whose pelvic mesh surgery in 2013 has left her with severe, permanent injuries requiring self-catheterisation every four hours, said she was gobsmacked to see Professor Skerritt beside her \"with his head down and his phone in his lap\" repeatedly through the film, or reading notes for a speech he delivered after the presentation. \"I was blown away. It was unbelievable he did not give the most important part of the day his full attention. I'm pretty hardened but hearing the stories of all those people so badly affected by mesh really hurt me, and he didn't even look up for a lot of it,\" Ms Germano said. \"I was in tears and he was doing things with his phone. I thought 'You didn't even hear that'. That's what it's been like for years - mesh victims trying to get people in the health system to listen.\" In his speech Professor Skerritt said it was \"very important for us to hear directly from individuals who have had adverse effects with medicines and devices and to hear their personal stories\" to make sure products on the market \"are as safe as possible\". In response to questions about the phone use a Department of Health spokesperson said Professor Skerritt had \"special dispensation\" to appear at the forum rather than Budget Estimates, but he was \"required to provide support to those attending on his behalf\". \"After international developments overnight on Thursday, urgent planning was required for a meeting of the TGA's breast implant expert reference group - being held (on Monday) - to discuss macro-textured breast implants,\" the spokesperson said. \"A number of other media enquiries and briefing requests also required Professor Skerritt's urgent attention. Professor Skerritt cleared his schedule as much as possible to attend the forum, where he recognised the serious impacts on the women who were affected and the need for the health system to work together to address the issue of mesh injuries. \"Professor Skerritt has reassured those who attended the forum and other affected women that the TGA is totally committed to ensuring that the regulation of medical devices protects the health and wellbeing of all Australian women.\" The phone use on Friday was only hours after Professor Skerritt revealed a medical device national action plan, headed \"The safety of Australian patients comes first\", was developed in 2018 but not released until last Thursday, on the eve of a federal election where health is a key issue, because \"politicians decide when things go out\". The plan aims to improve how devices get on the market, strengthen monitoring and \"significantly improve\" transparency about device approvals, after sustained criticism of device regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, following a series of scandals, including pelvic mesh device approvals that have left some women with catastrophic injuries. The action plan's release also follows a Department of Health report in the European Medical Journal in January showing only an estimated 0.5 per cent of adverse events involving implanted medical devices are reported to the TGA under a risk alert system that has operated for more than two decades. The device action plan was announced on the first day of a forum in Melbourne organised by health consumer groups from across Australia aiming to make health system reforms a federal election issue. Professor Skerritt told mesh-injured women that \"much of the writing behind the action plan was done last year but we do not control when documents like that are released\". \"I would have loved to have released that action plan ages ago but it's not my job and politicians decide when things go out,\" he said. \"It sounds like a cop-out but really, it's the same right across government.\" Professor Skerritt said the TGA had discussed problems with the device adverse event reporting system \"with all political parties\", including making health care facilities and hospitals mandatory reporters of device adverse events. \"Governments have not had an appetite at any point in time, governments have not had an appetite to look at mandating the reporting by hospitals and health care facilities until the announcement this week and that's governments of both colour,\" Professor Skerritt said. On Friday pelvic mesh and hernia mesh-injured people booed and jeered after a pre-taped film in which the Federal Government announced $2.3 million to fund a pelvic mesh registry for women implanted with devices in future. A government spokesman told the forum he was \"sorry for what has happened in the past\" but was \"delighted\" to announce a $2.3 million registry \"that we should always have had\". \"So this is your moment, it's overdue recognition, but it's real action and it will protect women, it will protect their health and it will also protect their mental health. And it's an acknowledgement of that which has occurred in the past, on our watch, thanks to your work,\" the spokesman said. \"I want to thank you, I want to acknowledge the suffering of those who have suffered historic wrongs, but above all else it will give you a real note of hope that going forward this registry will help you and help us make a profound difference.\" Forum participants booed, called the announcement \"delusional\", and strongly criticised the \"This is your moment\" comment. \"Our moment to be what, shat on again?\" said Mesh Injured Australia Incorporated founder Justine Watson, who attempted suicide because of the severity of mesh device complications. The government has not acted on a pelvic mesh Senate inquiry recommendation for a retrospective audit of an estimated 150,000 devices implanted in women since the late 1980s, after damning evidence that authorities have no firm data on how many women were implanted or have complications. Injured women and health consumer groups say the audit is a \"top priority\" because stronger regulatory action can be delayed while accurate complication rates for different mesh devices remain unclear. Senator Siewert told the forum she was \"disappointed\" at the lack of action on a retrospective audit. Two Newcastle women, who did not want to be named because of legal cases against a device manufacturer, said they were shocked and angered by Professor Skerritt's phone use during the film presentation, and despairing after the government spokesman's comments. \"The registry is for what happens in future, but what about financial assistance for everything we've already endured and have to endure in the future?\" said one of the women. \"It's too late for so many of us. They're convinced there's just a few mesh-injured people because doctors have told them that, but they don't know and they don't want to know because then something would have to be done about it.\" The TGA has not initiated criminal or civil penalty proceedings against any pelvic mesh manufacturers, despite manufacturers being the only mandatory reporters of device adverse events, and confirmation only a fraction of adverse events have been reported to the regulator over the past two decades. The TGA has only initiated criminal proceedings against four medical device manufacturers in the past decade. Professor Skerritt told a forum event it was \"very easy\" to explain the lack of criminal proceedings against device manufacturers because \"in order to prosecute a company in a criminal way you have to provide.. that there's been deliberate withholding of evidence by companies\". He said it was a failure of the legislation that more legal cases had not proceeded. Professor Skerritt told the forum the TGA had only recently obtained powers to increase monitoring of drug manufacturers, but the increased powers did not extend to device companies. Extending the powers to medical devices was \"a decision of whoever our political masters will be\", Professor Skerritt said.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Member for Farrer Sussan Ley will contest the seat of Farrer again in the May election. Despite a party whip that requires her to run for the seat, she handed in her notice with less than two weeks before nominations closed and has sent a text message to her colleagues making it clear she will stand again. She said the job was \"not for me\" and \"will not be\" after leaving Parliament. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said her resignation from the Senate was also \"completely unnecessary\". \"It will mean the budget is packed up the day after the election,\" he said. \"She clearly thinks she's got a better chance of winning the Senate after the election than before.\" In 2017 Ms Ley held the seat with a margin of 4.6 per cent, after being re-elected in 2016. The Greens and their candidate Dean Moss were \"grasping at straws\", Mr Shorten said. \"It's another example of Greens just grasping at straws. They don't have policies that are aligned with their voters or with what we are now expecting of government.\" He said he had spoken to the candidate on Friday night about how he should run. Greens candidate for Farrer Dean Moss said the state of the electorate and his \"lack of experience\" could work in his favour after spending eight years as a member of the Farrer Shire Council. \"(Mr Moss) got the most votes in my view in the last state election and he probably could have won,\" he said. \"You never know what the atmosphere will be like going in, but I see my three years of experience with the local community as being an asset.\" Mr Moss said as a sitting MP, Ms Ley's power was not vested in the Greens Party and there could be a \"leaky wheel\" in a safe seat such as Farrer. \"I have been a member of the party for the last 10 years and while I might not have had the skills they have, my background as an economist as well as my social justice background, my understanding of what it is to be gay, what it is to be a single parent - those things will be a big advantage,\" he said. \"I believe I can use my strong policy framework to make a positive difference here in Farrer, a seat which needs a voice that is on the same page as our federal party on issues like climate change.\" Mr Moss said Australia needed political change and only he and a party led by Mr Shorten could provide that change. \"So the choice is pretty clear. You can try to hold everything to the level of the Liberals and Greens because of the same old systems and politics, or you can try to build something fundamentally different, which we have in this party,\" he said. Sam Hammond will stand for the Liberal Party in the seat of Farrer. Ms Ley said she was proud of her time in parliament. \"It was a privilege to serve the people of Farrer and I believe my many achievements include maintaining the Abbott Government's generosity in funding for rural and regional roads; the landmark climate change policies of the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 26 per cent emissions reduction by 2030; the enhancement of the Australia's gender equality record; the successful delivery of NBN in the region and the Indigenous Legal Services and carers' package,\" she said. On the matter of her resignation, she said she put in her name as an MP but would not do so for an opposition senator. Mr Shorten dismissed suggestions he influenced Ms Ley's decision. \"If you wanted to talk about that, you should have talked to the Greens,\" he said. \"They chose to put up a candidate that could win, that is a total waste of taxpayer funds, a waste of our resources, and it is just sick.\" Mrs Ley last month defended her decision to change sides as well as her role as finance minister, but said it was \"becoming harder and harder to support the side that I passionately represented in the Senate\". She signed up to a caucus arrangement which meant she would vote with Labor, where possible, on legislation. She made it clear she would not stand for re-election, the ALP said. The Prime Minister has made it clear there would be a fresh candidate announced for Farrer if Labor chooses not to field a candidate.

{"text": "WODONGA Saints snapped a 21-match losing streak with a crushing 41-point win over fourth-placed Beechworth at Phillips Reserve on Saturday. The win ensured the Saints earned their first win of the season and inflicted the only loss of the season on the Bloods. Not since round 4 against Myrtleford last year had the Saints won a game and it was only a matter of time before they got their second win. The Saints in recent seasons have provided a poor advertisement for representative football and players who are keen to get on the plane to Canberra. But with Lachie Anderson leading the way with a superb display, Bongi Tehan among others, the young players who've been the mainstay for the last three years stepped up. The Saints finished with eight goals to just two in the first half, scoring 12 goals to just two in the second half in a blowout. Beechworth defender Riley Cooper showed some of the hunger lacking in the Saints' midfield, showing the time is well and truly overdue for Saints-coach Ben Wilson to get a win. Both teams started well, but the Saints had the better of the second quarter. Dean \u201cMoose\u201d Cole kick-started the scoring spree with a snap from the left wing after latching onto a terrific pass from Charlie Barber, before Barber ran 50 metres, beat the Beechworth defence, and passed to Scott Sharpe. Sharpe kicked another for a 8-1 lead in the opening 12 minutes. The Saints looked likely to extend their advantage to 20 points, when the Bloods were forced to bring on an extra defensive player. But the Saints, like Beechworth, had the numbers on deck. A clever pass from assistant coach Nick Partridge out to Bailey Hughes resulted in a goal after Bongi Tehan, Sharpe and Bailey Busby worked the ball out from a goal square in the 35th minute. The bloods kept the pressure on until the long break, when the Saints broke the game open with six unanswered goals to the delight of the 1216-strong crowd. Lambert, Tehan, Murray Christensen, Josh Williams and Sharpe were among the goal-scorers, while Bailey Cole kicked three majors. Tehan passed his highest ranking for a season with 35 possessions and kicked his third goal of the afternoon, in the space of three minutes in the final quarter. Sharpe managed a match-high 31 possessions, including 16 clearances, as the Saints dominated the midfield in the second half and extended their advantage at the final siren. The Bloods, who remain five points behind Corowa-Rutherglen on top of the ladder, are still searching for their first win of the season. Corowa-Rutherglen claimed their sixth straight win with a comprehensive 66-point victory over Murray Magpies at Corowa. Tristan Bulger celebrated his return with a wonderful five-goal haul, while Mitchell Sparks had another outstanding game after being added to the Pigeons' senior line-up. The Magpies were well in touch early but almost fell over the line, when champion quartet Andrew Wylie, Phil Steer, Matt Tratt and Sam Taylor booted goals to give them a brief 10-7 lead. Kyle Hemmingham made a timely return from injury, booted a 20m screamer, and Taylor added a five-pointer. Hamish Culva booted five goals for the Pigeons while Jake Bourke and Sean Moran managed four apiece. Josh Parsons was a workhorse for the Pigeons, racking up 29 touches, but few teams can match them up forward, where they are in another class. Paul Furphy was among the Magpies best, while Taylor added four goals in his return from an ankle injury.", "label": "machine"}
