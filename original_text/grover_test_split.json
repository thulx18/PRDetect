Returning from long-term injuries, Newcastle have lost Wollongong Wolves import Jamar Xellious against Young Fire in their penultimate round home clash on Sunday. Great Lakes Hawks will be without last weekend's Woolooware Bay Hawks player of the match for the second time in three weeks when they host the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at Waratah on Sunday in a final-round double header. Adam Bahr scored a game-high 27 points and had 11 rebounds in a 106-83 win over Waratah on Friday. Bahr kept up his formidable form by scoring 30 points in a 106-103 win over the Mallabula Panthers on Friday. He drained 17 points, including a 3-pointer, in the final three minutes of the Hawks' 102-84 triumph over Woolooware Bay last Sunday. \"That's an Achilles heel for us when we lose one of those guys at the end of a game,\" Waratahs coach Barry Preston said. \"We struggled without Xellious at the end last round against Waratah, and now we're missing him again. \"He's a big, big problem for us. Xellious can only work on limited things. He's been crucial to our team's success this year, and we need a few more guys who can knock down 3-pointers. We need to get some depth into the line-up. \"We need to find some points out of our bench. You just never know when we need somebody, so we've got to be ready to go when he's needed to get some rest.\" Xellious missed the last two weeks with a stress reaction and shouldn't miss again this weekend because he has missed only two games of the 10 this season. It leaves an opening for 19-year-old international and North Cronulla Eagles prodigy Clarke Vause, who scored 12 points with three 3-pointers and six assists in the fourth quarter against Mallabula and was named Most Valuable Player of the entire tournament. \"Clarke was brilliant last weekend and will be vital next weekend,\" Preston said. \"He's got an amazing touch off the dribble and has good range as well. \"We need to play well early and not rush the ball around too much. We have to recognise they've got some threats.\" Tahs import Malik Stephens, who finished his Bullets career last weekend with 23 points in a 69-53 win over Woolooware Bay, had his best game in nine weeks with 15 points against the Panthers. \"He looks back at the time when his hand was completely ruined after a couple of stabbings during his time in Hobart as a young teenager,\" Preston said. \"He was good but a little rusty at first. He's looking a lot more positive and confident about himself. \"I felt there was a bit of tiredness in his legs at the end of the game against Woolooware Bay, and he's a ball-hog, so he's not going to be as fresh as others in his team.\" While Xellious will miss the next two matches, interchange forward Kendall Reid could be cleared of a dangerous foul when he visits the New South Wales player tribunal for a point on Bay's Brad Rankin last Sunday. \"Kendall isn't nearly the type of player who thinks about his future and putting the team in danger by picking up a suspension,\" Preston said. \"I don't know when Kendall will know whether he's going to face a charge or not. With the way he's playing, we'd like him to be available for the weekend.\" It's up to the judiciary whether Blake Prescott (Mallabula) and Collie Littlejohn (Waratah) will accept suspensions for kneeing in Saturday's game between Sea Eagles and Hawks. \"We've been penalised twice over this year for minor incidents but we're hoping for leniency this time,\" Preston said. \"Our bench is beginning to worry about getting injuries, but these things happen. But we've been punished before for doing the wrong thing and that's why we play it with such care. We've now had a short week of training, but we can deal with that as well.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "It's not so much an art exhibition as a collection. For 17 years, Newcastle-based photographer, Matthew Stinson, has documented the lives of 14 to 21-year-olds in Newcastle, the Hunter and Wollongong in his series, Under Twenty Seven. From stints with the CUB photographer, as well as amateur, professional and service photographer associations, he's spent time on streets and sporting fields photographing predominantly sporting age groups. New portraits of four people from the series were on display at Gallery 2560 from April 12 to 28. The four, alongside 19 work to be showcased, will be there daily until May 5. Related content: The stunning and revealing Nth Street series: 8 Bytes: The Lost Art of The Burden Boys Not surprisingly, Stinson has a unique view of his subjects and the environment they inhabit. \"I'm not a snapper,\" he says. \"I'm a psycho lensman.\" Stinson, who lives in the University of Newcastle courtyard, has an inkling of a thing or two about the demand in Newcastle for resources. Having taken up photography almost 20 years ago, he was never sure how good a job he'd be able to do, or that he'd even found what he was looking for. \"This generation doesn't want to grow up into big upstanding people,\" Stinson says. \"These kids, before they were 14, they weren't well cared for by their parents, or by society, or by country schools. They're still doing drugs, they're still getting in trouble at home. \"That's why the photograph, that I did, is the standout one. You see him with a smile on his face, a tramp with a dustcan. He's a mess. \"To me, that's a chance to see another side of life, that face is really humble.\" For this family portrait, Stinson knew he needed a specific subject. One of the subjects in the series is Elijah Speer, who suffers from Bell's palsy and is almost blind. \"Elijah has fought to keep walking, by ignoring the pain and not letting himself be affected,\" Stinson says. \"For me, as a parent myself, I know that blindsided me at that age. There are still drugs involved in their lives.\" Most of the images are black and white. \"It's like a movie set,\" Stinson says. \"It is made out of chips and twine and cardboard, and random bits of fabric. It is really informal photography. One show alone took 35,000 photographs. I have got them organized into series so they are not random \u2014 not totally random, but not clunk-bang, one after the other. \"I am a fixer. A fixer.

She said the school had worked hard to maintain its connection with families through its Franco-franco club, and in doing so had helped bring \"the best and the best of Franco-franco\" to the school. \"When we first came here in 1999, when the school felt a bit neglected because it was in the shadow of Wagga High and Weetangera College, and hadn't been keeping a lot of alumni around, we thought there must be plenty of old headmistresses who loved being around their students,\" she said. \"The seniors celebrated the Feast of the Three Kings in 2002, and that's the year when the school became a sister school to Ponti International High School in Rome. \"We've gone on to be a bit of an Italian capitol here.\" That relationship has allowed all sorts of Italian students access to the Wagga school and to have French lessons, be they actual or tutored by the sisters, and several accomplished Italian students have taken advantage. That achievement, and the fellowship of the nuns has cemented Ms Piuso's experience in relation to her Franciscan background. \"We take pride in that, in that we have a nun who speaks fluent Spanish, and she spoke once to the Pope,\" she said. \"That's one of the things that is wonderful about the order is, we don't have to resort to English to communicate.\" Unfortunately, one of the most enduring bonds to do with the school's various periods of history ended this year, with a great fire damaging almost every monument - many of which were beloved by generations of families that trekked over the border to the school over the decades. \"It was more of a misfortune than anything else, and the pain and loss for all the families is acutely keen,\" Ms Piuso said.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The second is that Trump is expected to nominate Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed, to fill Powell's place on the Fed board of governors. Warsh, a Wall Street economist, is an askew economist and former member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Most economists believe he is a rigorous policy thinker on policy but several years of his research has been taken with a pinch of salt, including his writings on central bank independence. Credit:Bloomberg At first glance both men have seemingly similar backgrounds. Both came through the Fed's brain trust and played a key role in implementing the appropriate approaches to implementing the laws of the US capitalist system. Powell has worked in challenging times, especially during the financial crisis, which saw the Fed embark on an unprecedented era of quantitative easing that has still not fully unwound. He has been the Fed's point man for financial regulation. And both he and Yellen have been panned for their failure to adequately arrest or prevent the continuing rise in US household debt, something that surprised even most of those in the thinking community. Indeed, a more perceptive version of Trump's recasting of US economic policy would read the appointment of Powell and Warsh as the president's attempt to emulate the turn-around policy that Ronald Reagan pulled off during his first term in office. It would look at the way that manufacturing had been damaged by the Japanese economic model, a policy that eventually delivered the \"miracle\" of a second Asian recession while the Fed aided the recovery in the real economy.", "label": "machine"}

Maksymow has admitted to attending the woman's Springdale Heights home on September 8. His sister messaged his ex, asking for access to his son, about 9.50am. When the victim said she was taking the boy to Beechworth with friends, Maksymow texted her \"see you real soon, you think my son is going to Beechworth?\" She ignored the message but he drove to her house and entered the home when she was showering. The victim walked out and asked him to leave. Maksymow hit her across the face with an open hand, striking her nose and causing it to bleed. She ran to the toilet and locked herself in to prevent him from getting to her. The victim's sister arrived and Maksymow said he \"should wring your neck\" and stated \"I should smack you now\". He bashed on a door and window and only left when told the police had been called. Maksymow eventually made his way to the Walbundrie sports ground and spoke to police.

We were good on the road, very few defeats. It's an unfortunate result. \"It's not something I'll dwell on. I'll go forward, improve, turn the corner and be in a good position next year. We've put ourselves in a good position to do that and now we just have to keep improving and getting stronger.\" The Jets won both games against the Wanderers this season and both against Adelaide. A win or draw in either of those games, at home against the Wanderers and away against the Reds, would have assured the Jets of a finals place. Merrick said the Wanderers and Reds teams both gave the Jets every chance. \"They all do,\" he said. \"Everyone puts you there, right or wrong. They give you chances and you make mistakes at times. \"You can argue that the last two we've made, that we didn't. They got on top of us, and when they did, they got in our faces and made life tough. \"But we missed some chances early and then the game boiled down to a home ground game where a real home ground advantage counts for something for them and a road game where it doesn't. \"They [Adelaide] were the better side in both games, so we had to play the best.\" World Cup-winner Tim Cahill was in the Jets starting line-up, but Merrick flagged the return of his record signing Andrew Nabbout next week. \"We will see who makes the squad,\" he said. \"Who makes the squad for Adelaide will be important because we can't beat Adelaide without Nabbout. \"At the same time, people make mistakes in football, but everyone was at fault for the 4-0 [Thursdays' loss to Melbourne City] and one of the players' errors cost us. It was the way he dealt with it and the way he thought about it, which was not good enough, that's why he was taken off. \"We've got a tough game at the weekend against South Melbourne who are fighting to stay up. We have to make sure we are mentally fit and emotionally strong for that.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A small-town woman has made it through to the big time and will be honoured with a publishing honour in her hometown. Eight years ago, Bundalong woman Karen Turner was second runner-up for the Kiama Literature Festival's prestigious Diana Bishop Writers' Prize. Now she has a book in print and will be formally presented with the honour at Albury next Thursday night. Her debut novel, Stormbird, is one of only five published works for a writer from a regional centre. The novel centres on a troubled couple, Lesley and Bill, who are swept away by wild weather as they attempt to reunite on the Queensland Sunshine Coast. Turner said Stormbird's launch will also honour her heroine and hero, a humble fisherman and landlady. \"Lesley's about a smaller community ... but those small-town people will tell you the world is a huge place,\" she said. Turner moved from Bundalong in the late 1990s and left behind children at the primary school she attended, but her family and experiences on the now-closed school grounds prompted her to write. \"I saw as I got older that quite a few people could be put into the category, as I've described in the book ... of post-1990 nostalgia,\" she said. \"You meet some people, their life's kind of drab, you see them, they're there in that small town \u2026 and their lives are a bit neglected, they're not really looked after in terms of the culture. \"That bothered me.\" Part of Turner's childhood in Bundalong was spent in an old school house, one of many that remained in existence as schools closed. The area's central location made it a place that would provide the backdrop for her writing. \"It's just the smaller town town with the odd Gold Coast or the Gold Coast [somewhere else], they all have individual towns but that's not what's around here.\" Windam Middle School principal Sam Andrews was one of her first teachers and has continued to support her writing as she aimed for publication. He described Stormbird as a \"beautiful book\", one that has transported him from behind the school desk to read it from beyond. \"While it's certainly a beautiful story set in the beautiful settings of the Sunshine Coast, it's also very much about Karen's personal and professional life,\" Mr Andrews said. \"It's not a book that's restricted to a particular crowd, although it's very much a story that you could read as a first-time reader or have heard of someone you would know who would have read this book as a classic story and know the stories and all the references that happen in it.\" The reception the book has received has been positive, with artist Narelle Howard specialising in watercolours in the book. Mr Andrews said the book was the best-received entry he had ever seen at the school. \"I think there's something about a small community, we like to have a bit of face-to-face interaction and I think it's wonderful for a story to be told that is central to that community,\" he said. \"I think all our literature students really appreciate the depth and the range of the stories that are in the book.\" The novel is published under her Fisher King publishing contract, which is responsible for six other books including 2009 bestseller Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, or Snow Flower and the Secret Fan Bo Zhu. Mrs Turner has another novel on the release schedule with a Christmas novel due for the end of the year. She was one of four entrants in the Diana Bishop Writers' Prize, a competition open to writers from the previous year's Kiama Literature Festival. \"I'd never heard of the Diana Bishop Writers' Prize because it only started a few years ago, and I was just assuming that I had qualified,\" she said. \"I was the second runner-up, just as I thought the judges had a longlist. \"It was amazing \u2026 I was blown away and it just gave me a huge new sense of confidence in my writing that I actually had the talent to write a book. \"I'm just really grateful for that. I'll never forget the prize and just how important it is to me.\"", "label": "machine"}
