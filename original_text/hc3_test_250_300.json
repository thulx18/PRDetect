{"text": "There are, of course, many possible financial emergencies. They range from large medical expenses to losing your job to being sued to major home or car repairs to who-knows-what. I suppose some people are in a position where the chances that they will face any sort of financial emergency are remote. If you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near-zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system, you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs, you ride the bus or subway and don't own a car so that's not an issue, etc etc, maybe there just isn't any likely scenario where you'd suddenly need cash. I can think of all sorts of scenarios that might affect me. I'm trying to put my kids through college, so if I lost my job, even if unemployment benefits were adequate to live on, they wouldn't pay for college. I have terrible health insurance so big medical bills could cost me a lot. I have an old car so it could break down any time and need expensive repairs, or even have to be replaced. I might suddenly be charged with a crime that I didn't commit and need a lawyer to defend me. Etc. So in a very real sense, everyone's situation is different. On the other hand, no matter how carefully you think it out, it's always possible that you will get bitten by something that you didn't think of. By definition, you can't make a list of unforeseen problems that might affect you! So no matter how safe you think you are, it's always good to have some emergency fund, just in case.

{"text": "Multistage sampling and cluster sampling are two methods of sampling that are used to select a representative sample from a larger population. Both methods involve dividing the population into smaller groups or units, and then selecting a sample from each group or unit. However, there are some key differences between the two methods.\\n\\nIn multistage sampling, the population is divided into a series of stages or steps, and a sample is selected from each stage. For example, you might start by selecting a sample of cities or towns, and then selecting a sample of neighborhoods within those cities or towns, and then selecting a sample of households within those neighborhoods. This allows you to sample from a large and diverse population, while still being able to control the sampling process and make it more representative of the population as a whole.\\n\\nIn cluster sampling, the population is divided into smaller groups or clusters, and a sample is selected from each cluster. For example, you might divide a city into neighborhoods, and then select a sample of neighborhoods to be included in the study. This method is often used when it is difficult or impractical to sample from the entire population, or when the population is geographically dispersed and it is easier to sample from smaller groups.\\n\\nOverall, the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling is the way in which the population is divided into smaller units for sampling. In multistage sampling, the population is divided into a series of stages or steps, while in cluster sampling, the population is divided into smaller groups or clusters.\\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Antibiotics are medications that are used to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria.

These can include things like the flu, the common cold, and HIV.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why it is easier to make drugs that kill bacteria compared to viruses.\\n\\nFirst, bacteria and viruses are very different from each other. Bacteria are much simpler and smaller than viruses, and they have their own systems for reproducing and repairing themselves. This means that it is often easier to target specific parts of the bacteria with drugs in order to kill them.\\n\\nViruses, on the other hand, are much smaller and more complex than bacteria. They don't have their own systems for reproducing and repairing themselves, and instead, they rely on taking over the cells of the host organism in order to replicate. This makes it much harder to target specific parts of the virus with drugs, and it also means that antiviral medications often have more side effects, since they can also affect the host cells.\\n\\nAnother reason why it is easier to make drugs that kill bacteria is that bacteria are often more sensitive to the effects of medications. This means that it is possible to use lower doses of antibiotics to kill bacteria, which can reduce the risk of side effects.\\n\\nOverall, while both antibiotics and antivirals are important tools for treating infections, it is generally easier to make drugs that kill bacteria because they are simpler and more sensitive to the effects of medications.", "label": "machine"}

In return, you receive a premium payment from the buyer of the option. If the market price of the asset falls below the strike price, the buyer of the option may choose to exercise their right to sell the asset to you at the strike price, and you will be required to purchase the asset at that price.One potential risk of selling put options is that you may end up having to buy the asset at a higher price than its market value, which could result in a loss. This is especially true if the market value of the asset falls significantly below the strike price. In addition, there is always the risk that the market value of the asset could rise above the strike price, in which case you would not receive the premium payment.Overall, selling put options can be a risky strategy, and it may not be suitable for everyone, especially those who are risk-averse or have limited investment capital.

{"text": "It is possible for a child to have symptoms of herpes or strep throat at any age, including at 8 months old. However, it is important to note that herpes and strep throat are two different infections caused by different viruses or bacteria.  Herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can cause cold sores or genital sores. It is possible for a child to be infected with herpes at birth if the mother has genital herpes, but this is relatively rare. It is more common for children to become infected with herpes through close contact with someone who has an active herpes infection, such as through kissing or sharing utensils or cups.  Strep throat is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes and is a common infection that affects the throat and tonsils. It is most common in children between the ages of 5 and 15, but it can occur at any age. Strep throat is typically spread through close contact with an infected person, such as through coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils or cups.  The symptoms you have described, including red spots on the roof of the mouth and tongue and a creamy white residue, could potentially be caused by either herpes or strep throat. It is important to have your son examined by a healthcare provider to determine the cause of these symptoms and to receive appropriate treatment.

{"text": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a principle in quantum mechanics that explains the fundamental limits of our ability to know certain things about a particle, such as its position and momentum. It states that the more precisely we know the position of a particle, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa. This is because the act of measuring one of these quantities affects the other.  Imagine that you are trying to measure the position and momentum of a ball. You can use a ruler to measure the position of the ball by seeing where it is on the ruler. But if you want to measure the momentum of the ball, you might need to push it or throw it in order to measure its speed. However, the act of pushing or throwing the ball will change its momentum, so you can't get an accurate measurement of both the position and momentum of the ball at the same time.  This is similar to how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle works in quantum mechanics. When we try to measure the position of a particle, we have to interact with it in some way, and this interaction changes the particle's momentum. This means that we can't know both the position and momentum of the particle with complete accuracy at the same time. We have to choose which one we want to measure more accurately, and this means that there will always be some uncertainty in our knowledge of the other quantity.", "label": "machine"}

Here are a few general rules to help you determine if you need to file a tax return:If you earned income from a job or self-employment, you may need to file a tax return if your income exceeds a certain amount. The amount of income that triggers a tax filing requirement depends on your filing status and age. For example, in 2021, if you are single and under the age of 65, you will need to file a tax return if your earned income is more than $12,400.Even if you did not earn income, you may still need to file a tax return if you received certain types of income, such as interest, dividends, or social security benefits.If you are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, you may need to file a tax return if your unearned income (such as interest or dividends) exceeds a certain amount. For example, in 2021, if you are under the age of 65 and single, you will need to file a tax return if your unearned income is more than $1,100.If you are eligible for certain tax credits or deductions, you may need to file a tax return to claim them, even if you do not have any taxable income.It is important to note that these rules are just a general guide and there may be other factors that affect your tax filing requirements.

{"text": "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network  used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare.[11]\nThe name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both \"long-term memory\" and \"short-term memory\". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus \"long short-term memory\".\nA common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule \n\n\n\n{\n\no\nn\ni\no\nn\ns\n,\np\no\nt\na\nt\no\ne\ns\n\n}\n\u21d2\n{\n\nb\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\n\n found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\nIn addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\nThe association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand.", "label": "human"}

First, Apple and Microsoft are both large companies with a lot of resources and they may have agreed to allow each other to use their products in commercials as a way to promote healthy competition and innovation. This can be beneficial for both companies because it helps to keep them on their toes and encourages them to continue developing new and improved products.

Personal loans typically have fixed interest rates and fixed monthly payments, and you can borrow anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on your creditworthiness and the lender's policies.Credit card: Some homeowners use credit cards to finance the cost of a new furnace. While this can be a convenient option, it's important to be aware that credit cards typically have higher interest rates than home equity loans or personal loans, so you may end up paying more in the long run.Energy efficiency financing: Many utility companies offer financing programs specifically for energy-efficient home improvements, including new furnaces. These programs often have low or no interest rates and may even offer rebates or other incentives.Manufacturer or retailer financing: Some furnace manufacturers or retailers offer financing options for their products. These programs may have special terms and conditions, so be sure to read the fine print before committing to a particular option.Ultimately, the best financing option for you will depend on your personal financial situation, credit history, and the specifics of the furnace you are considering.

Technical analysts use charts and other tools to identify patterns that can suggest buying or selling opportunities. There are many technical analysis indicators that are used to help make trading decisions, but some of the most commonly used indicators that are considered leading indicators include:Moving averages: These indicators smooth out price action by taking the average of prices over a certain time period, such as the last 50 days. Moving averages can help identify trends and can also be used to generate buy and sell signals.Relative strength index (RSI): This indicator measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine overbought or oversold conditions. When the RSI is above 70, it may be overbought, and when it is below 30, it may be oversold.Moving average convergence divergence (MACD): This indicator uses two moving averages to identify trend changes and can also generate buy and sell signals.Bollinger bands: These are bands plotted around a moving average that show the level of volatility in a security. When prices move outside of the bands, it may indicate that a trend is changing.It's important to note that technical analysis indicators should not be used in isolation, and it is generally recommended to use a combination of indicators to make trading decisions.

Tactics: The tactics and strategies used in a modern conflict would also be very different from those used in World War 2. In a modern conflict, there would likely be more focus on \"asymmetrical warfare,\" which means using unconventional tactics and weapons to surprise and overwhelm the enemy. This could include things like cyber attacks, special forces operations, and propaganda.  Casualties: There would also likely be fewer casualties in a modern conflict compared to World War 2.

{"text": "There are several reasons why people might choose to invest in a stock portfolio rather than simply earning interest on a bank account. Some of these reasons include:Potential for higher returns: While it is true that the interest rates on bank accounts are generally lower than the dividends paid by stocks, it is also possible to earn higher returns by investing in a well-diversified stock portfolio. Over the long term, the stock market has historically outperformed other asset classes, including cash and fixed income investments.Inflation protection: While the interest earned on a bank account may keep pace with inflation in the short term, over the long term, the purchasing power of cash can decline due to inflation. By investing in stocks, you can potentially earn returns that are higher than the rate of inflation, helping to preserve the purchasing power of your money.Diversification: A well-diversified stock portfolio can help to spread risk by investing in a variety of different companies and industries. This can help to mitigate the impact of any one company or sector performing poorly, reducing the overall volatility of your portfolio.Potential for passive income: Many stocks pay dividends, which are periodic payments made to shareholders out of the company's profits. While the dividend yield on individual stocks may be lower than the interest earned on a bank account, a well-diversified stock portfolio can potentially provide a consistent stream of passive income.Ultimately, the decision to invest in a stock portfolio or earn interest on a bank account will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

It can be a pain to have to send back a Domestic Money Order to a customer explaining what they have to do to pay you, even more painful if you don't catch the error before shipping your wares. Credit Card. There are a number of companies offering credit card processing that are much cheaper than a bank. PayPal, Square, and Intuit are three such companies offering these services. After I did my investigations I found Square to be the best deal for me. Please do your own research on these companies (and banks!) and find out which one makes the most sense for you.

{"text": "Meditation is basically to be in the moment . Often , People think about yesterday or tomorrow , what they 're going to do later that day , how stupid it was to do X last week . They 're stuck in their thoughts . Or you see people on the bus listening to music and/or daydreaming . Now what you do when you meditate is that you become aware of the moment : You do n't give a fuck about all those annoying thoughts about yesterday or tomorrow or whatever . So basically you do n't think , although thoughts may still go through your head . Of course there are different approaches , sometimes you focus immensely on something ( often the breath ) which will use up all focus and therefore reduce thoughts , or you try to not - focus , where you feel and observe everything in and around you . And there are still even more approaches , for example some have to do with feelings ( try to imagine a person you do n't like and imagine you hug him / like him ) for improving compassion . It 's easy to start meditation , but it takes a while until you notice and feel what it 's about and what it does . In the beginning you just sit there and afterwards you might be disappointed because you 've expected more of it . I can still highly recommend to do it , start with 10 minutes a day , just sit down , stop actively thinking about things ( but do n't try to suppress thoughts which will inevitably come up , just ignore them ) and keep focusing on your breath . That 's it .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Hey , Ph . D here working on light induced degradation ( LID ) in solar cells . Essentially , you need to think of the efficiency of a solar cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy . Now in the body of the solar cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected . These include metallic impurities ( Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole ( which we call charge carriers ) . The more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency . So what happens out in the field over time ? There are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread . We also have a few such as PID ( potential induced degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours . Now this problem has largely been solved . There are a few other known elements that can cause degradation under sunlight , i.e copper ( which can form precipitates ) and Hydrogen , etc etc ..", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are two spacecraft that were launched by NASA in the 1970s to explore the outer solar system. They are currently the most distant man-made objects from Earth, traveling through deep space. Both spacecraft are equipped with a number of scientific instruments and communication devices that allow them to send data back to Earth. These devices use radio waves, which are a type of electromagnetic radiation, to transmit the data. The radio waves are sent from the spacecraft to antennas on Earth, which are large structures that are designed to receive the radio waves and turn them into the data that scientists can use to study the spacecraft's environment and the objects it is encountering. To reach Earth from such a long distance, the spacecraft use a special type of antenna called a high-gain antenna. This antenna is able to focus the radio waves into a very narrow beam, which allows the spacecraft to transmit the data with a very low power level. This is important because the spacecraft need to be as energy efficient as possible, since they have limited power available to them. Even with the use of the high-gain antenna, it still takes a long time for the data from the spacecraft to reach Earth, due to the vast distance that the radio waves have to travel. It can take more than an hour for the data to reach Earth from Voyager 1, which is currently about 13.7 billion miles (22 billion kilometers) away from the planet.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Sure! The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that involves three doors and a car behind one of them. Here's how it works: Imagine you are on a game show and the host shows you three doors. Behind one of the doors is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. The host asks you to choose a door, and you choose door number 1. Before the host reveals what is behind your chosen door, he opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat. The host then gives you the option to stick with your original choice (door 1) or switch to the other unopened door (door 3). Should you switch or stick with your original choice? The answer might seem counterintuitive, but you should switch doors. Here's why: Before the host opened door 2 and revealed a goat, you had a 1 in 3 chance of winning the car (since there are three doors and only one car). Now that the host has revealed one of the goats, you know that the car is not behind door 2. That means that the car must be behind either door 1 or door 3. Since you originally had a 1 in 3 chance of choosing the door with the car, and you now have a 50/50 chance of choosing the door with the car (since it must be behind either door 1 or 3), you should switch doors to increase your chances of winning the car. I hope that helps to clarify things! Let me know if you have any more questions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Sure! The scale of the universe is a way to understand how big and small things are in the universe. It can be a bit hard to understand, but I'll do my best to explain it like you're five.  If you go to the website you provided (URL_0), you'll see a bunch of circles that represent different objects in the universe. Some of the circles are really small, and some of them are really big. The small circles represent things that are very small, like atoms and particles. The big circles represent things that are very big, like planets, stars, and galaxies.  As you scroll down the website, you'll see that the circles get bigger and bigger. This is because the objects they represent are getting bigger and bigger too. For example, you'll see a circle that represents the Earth. The Earth is a planet that we live on, and it's pretty big. But if you keep scrolling, you'll see a circle that represents the Sun. The Sun is a star that's even bigger than the Earth. And if you keep scrolling even more, you'll see a circle that represents the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy is a huge group of stars and planets that's even bigger than the Sun.  So as you can see, there are things in the universe that are very small and things that are very big. And the scale of the universe helps us understand how big and small these things are relative to each other. Does that make sense?", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "There are a few different ways that a DWI (driving while intoxicated) lawyer may defend their clients who have been accused of endangering others on the road by driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Here are a few examples: 1. Challenge the breathalyzer test results: Sometimes, breathalyzer tests can produce inaccurate results due to factors such as improper calibration or the person's medical conditions. A lawyer may try to challenge the accuracy of the test results in court. 2. Attack the police's observations: A lawyer may try to argue that the police officer who pulled over their client did not have probable cause to do so, or that the officer's observations of the person's behavior were not reliable. For example, if the officer claims that the person was swerving or driving erratically, the lawyer may try to show that there were other reasons for this behavior, such as a medical condition or a problem with the car. 3. Present evidence of sobriety: If the person accused of DWI has any evidence that they were sober at the time of the incident, such as a witness who saw them drinking a non-alcoholic beverage, a lawyer may try to present this evidence in court to show that the person was not under the influence. 4. Argue for a lesser charge: In some cases, a lawyer may try to negotiate a plea deal with the prosecutor to have the charge reduced to a lesser offense, such as reckless driving, which carries a lighter punishment. It's important to note that each case is different and the specific defense strategy used will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?  All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.\nLogical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.\nLogicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n, either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n or by formal intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n.  The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.", "label": "human"}

However , these genes are not eliminated from the gene pool because they drastically increase the reproductive fitness when inherited by a female . ELI5 version - So given certain gene , if male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby making * * * The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis * * Argues that genes that express feminine physical characteristics and personality traits increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version - being a little bit feminine can increase your chances of getting lucky with the opposite gender , but too much feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in the past , males used sexual contact with other males as a way to form / strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient Greece , it was not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual behaviour with younger males while being married to a woman .

{"text": "If you are self-employed, you may have a slightly more difficult time getting a mortgage than if you were a traditional employee with a regular salary and steady employment history. However, it is not impossible to get a mortgage while self-employed. Here are a few things you can do to increase your chances of getting approved for a mortgage:Have a good credit score: Lenders look at your credit score as an indicator of your creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan. A high credit score will give you a better chance of getting approved for a mortgage.Provide documentation of your income: Lenders will want to see proof of your income to determine if you can afford the mortgage payments. As a self-employed individual, you may need to provide tax returns, profit and loss statements, and other financial documents to show your income.Have a large down payment: A larger down payment can help offset the risk for the lender and increase your chances of getting approved for a mortgage.Consider a mortgage broker: A mortgage broker is a professional who can help you find a lender and negotiate the terms of your mortgage. They may be able to help you find a lender who is more willing to work with self-employed individuals.Consider a government-backed loan: Government-backed loans, such as FHA or VA loans, may be more forgiving of self-employment and may have more flexible requirements.It is also a good idea to shop around and compare mortgage offers from multiple lenders to find the best deal.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "There are several ways to mitigate the effects of credit and debt on your financial situation and increase your financial stability:Create a budget and stick to it: A budget helps you track your income and expenses, and ensures that you are not spending more than you earn. It also helps you identify areas where you can cut back on unnecessary expenses and save money.Save money: Building up a savings cushion can help you weather financial storms and avoid the need to rely on credit. Try to save at least 10% of your income, and aim to save more if possible.Pay off your debts: If you have high levels of credit card debt, focus on paying it off as quickly as possible. The longer it takes to pay off debt, the more you will pay in interest. Consider using a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer credit card to help you pay off your debts more efficiently.Use cash instead of credit: When you use cash to make purchases, you are less likely to overspend. Try to use cash or a debit card instead of a credit card to make purchases, and only use credit when you are sure you can pay off the balance in full each month.Build your credit score: A good credit score is important for obtaining loans, credit cards, and other financial products at favorable terms.

One of the rules of the FCC is that certain words and phrases that are considered \"indecent\" or \"profane\" cannot be aired on broadcast media at any time. These words and phrases are considered inappropriate for children to hear, and so they are not allowed to be broadcast during hours when children are likely to be listening. This is why you may hear certain words that are considered inappropriate or offensive being censored or bleeped out in songs that are played on the radio or television.  On the other hand, words that are not considered inappropriate or offensive are allowed to be aired on broadcast media, even during hours when children are likely to be listening. This is why you may hear certain words that are not considered inappropriate or offensive being played uncensored in songs that are played on the radio or television.

Pi is a number that is a little bit more than 3, and it is important because it helps us understand the relationship between the circumference (the distance around the circle) and the diameter (the distance across the circle through the center).\r \r The Tau Manifesto is a document that suggests that we should use a different circle constant called tau, which is represented by the Greek letter \u03c4. Tau is equal to 2\u03c0, or about 6.28. The idea behind the Tau Manifesto is that tau is a more natural and intuitive circle constant to use, especially when it comes to understanding radians.\r \r Radians are a way of measuring angles. If you think of a circle as a clock, with the 12 o'clock position at the top, then one radian is equal to 1/6 of the way around the circle. Using tau as the circle constant makes it easier to understand radians, because one radian is equal to 1/3 of tau, rather than 1/2 of pi. This makes it easier to see that radians are a measure of how far around the circle an angle is, rather than how wide the angle is.\r \r So, in summary, both pi and tau are important numbers that help us understand and measure circles, but some people believe that tau is a better circle constant to use because it makes it easier to understand radians.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "There are different rules and laws that apply to different situations when it comes to showing people's faces on TV or in the media.  In general, when people's faces are shown on TV, it is important to protect their privacy and ensure that they are not subjected to unwanted attention or harm. This is especially true when it comes to children, who may not have the same ability to understand or consent to being on TV as adults do. In these cases, it is common to blur or obscure people's faces to protect their identity.  However, when it comes to celebrities, the situation is different. Celebrities are often in the public eye and are well-known to the general public. As a result, they may not have the same level of privacy as other people. Additionally, celebrities often make a living by being in the public eye and may choose to allow their faces to be shown on TV or in the media in order to promote themselves or their work.  As for paparazzi, these are photographers who take pictures of celebrities and sell them to the media. Paparazzi often follow celebrities around and take pictures of them without their permission, which can be intrusive and disrespectful.

One reason is that it is no longer actively developed and supported by Microsoft. This means that it does not receive updates or security patches, which makes it vulnerable to security risks such as viruses and malware.  In contrast, Google Chrome and Firefox are both actively developed and supported, which means that they receive regular updates and security patches to keep them safe and secure.  Another reason that Chrome and Firefox are considered to be better browsers is that they are faster and more efficient than Internet Explorer. They can load websites and run web-based applications more quickly, which makes them a better choice for users who do a lot of online activities such as browsing, streaming video, or playing games.  Finally, Chrome and Firefox also offer a wider range of features and customization options than Internet Explorer, which makes them more versatile and user-friendly.

Sending out mooring lines to a far away point ... tie a knot with a messenger line and pass it along . Rigging a lift ... bunch ' o knots . Securing cargo or deck gear ... knots , knots , and knots . Lowering / raising tools into a hold ... grab a bag , line and tie up a few knots . Need to wash a tank with a portable hose and machine ... Some line and a timber hitch are all you need . As a cadet we would even rig bosun 's chairs and work planks to paint the hull ... all knots . Put simply , knots are very versatile ; there 's pretty much a knot for every situation and they have various degrees of strength retention , and various types and lengths of line are ubiquitous on any modern vessel . This was especially true on sailing ships whose rigging was made up entirely of different knots . But even for modern - day mariners , it 's much easier to just tie off a good knot and accomplish your task , than it would be to involve more equipment that you do n't really need . That said , there are many other types of specialized securing gear that is utilized on board . Ratchet straps , chains falls , shackles , turnbuckles and chain / wire , etc are routinely used when the situation calls for it .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "I was in that same situation years ago with my parents. One way she could apply for a loan in her name without her parents is if she is not currently living with them she shouldn't need them to cosign if she doesn't have bad credit. But if she isn't living with them and they aren't financing her room and board they can't claim her as a dependent so if she really wants to stick it to them she can go and try to politely explain how the loans work and tell them if they don't cosign for her then she will apply on her own (which she can only do while not living with them I believe but not sure) and they will HAVE to STOP claiming her as a dependent on their taxes. If they don't agree she can put her foot down and force them to stop claiming her and tell them she will file her own application anyway and if they continue claiming her and get in trouble for it it's their own fault cause she warned them to stop first. They may agree to cosign rather than lose her as a dependent if it makes that big of a difference on their taxes, if they don't then she can forcefully punish them financially and their taxes will go up. Those were my choices when my parents refused to cosign for me to live at school but that was back in 1999-2000 and things may have changed since then, things also change state by state and I live in PA.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "When we speak out loud there are 2 signals that the brain receives : the internal monologue and ( assuming you are not deaf ) auditory feedback from our speech output . This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are . Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation / speech muscles . Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other ( thinking a word , with the sound of the word , and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word ) . So if you are thinking internally , your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal . But as I mentioned , the internal monologue is extremely closely related to the production of speech ( this topic is known as \" embodiment \" ) . Studies show that when people read text silently , muscles used for speech are slightly activated . Also , speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally . This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways , and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking . Note : this is referring to clear - cut intended internal speech . More ambiguous \" thought \" is going to be much more complex . tl;dr : The act of speaking , the sound of speaking , and the internal thought which is correlated with the speech , are all highly associated with each other ( They use similar brain pathways ) . So when you \" hear \" yourself think , it is * probably * because you are activating the same brain pathways used for normal speech and hearing .", "label": "human"}
