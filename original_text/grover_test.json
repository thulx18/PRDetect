{"text": "Video of a North Atlantic right whale was recorded near Race Point Beach in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Sunday. The right whales are among the world's most-endangered species, with an estimated 411 alive today.\nAn endangered species of whale is experiencing a mini-baby boom in New England waters, researchers on Cape Cod have said.\nThe North Atlantic right whale is one of the rarest species of whale on the planet, numbering only about 411. But the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, said Friday its aerial survey team spotted two mom and calf pairs in Cape Cod Bay a day earlier. That brings the number seen in New England waters alone this year to three.\nThat's big news because the whale's population has been falling, and no calves were seen last year. In all, seven right whale calves have been seen so far this year.\nThe whales give birth off Georgia and Florida in the winter and travel to feeding grounds off New England in the early spring, including the Gulf of Maine, a body of water that touches Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Canada.\nCape Cod Bay is part of the Gulf of Maine and is a critically important feeding ground. The animals often feed close to shore, providing watchers on land \"unbeatable views of one of the rarest of marine mammals,'' the Center for Coastal Studies said in a statement.\nIt's illegal to get within 1,500 feet (457 meters) of the animals without a federal research permit, so boaters are discouraged from attempting to get close to the whales.\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "news, local-news,\nPOLICE feared the crowd at a Hume League semi-final could erupt in violence if they tried to arrest wanted player Jarrah Maksymow, a court has been told. The former Henty forward was released from Junee jail into a rehabilitation facility on Wednesday, following an attack on his ex-partner before the game and a run from the police. Maksymow has admitted to attending the woman's Springdale Heights home on September 8. His sister messaged his ex, asking for access to his son, about 9.50am. When the victim said she was taking the boy to Beechworth with friends, Maksymow texted her \"see you real soon, you think my son is going to Beechworth?\" She ignored the message but he drove to her house and entered the home when she was showering. The victim walked out and asked him to leave. Maksymow hit her across the face with an open hand, striking her nose and causing it to bleed. She ran to the toilet and locked herself in to prevent him from getting to her. The victim's sister arrived and Maksymow said he \"should wring your neck\" and stated \"I should smack you now\". He bashed on a door and window and only left when told the police had been called. Maksymow eventually made his way to the Walbundrie sports ground and spoke to police. An officer told Albury Local Court \"a decision was made by attending police to effect the arrest post-match due to concerns about violence from the crowd\". He fled at half-time and was arrested two days later, and remained in custody until being bailed on Wednesday. YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE: Maksymow told magistrate Rodney Brender he was keen for rehab. \"I need my own tools to learn outside,\" he said. \"I've already served seven months. \"I want to come home to my son and my family.\" The most serious charge of aggravated break and enter with intent was dropped. Maksymow must obey the orders of rehab staff and the matter will return to court on June 4.

{"text": "ANTHONY JOSHUA insists he won\u2019t lash out at Jarrell Miller as he prepares to become part of Madison Square Garden history as he knows the fight would be cancelled if he lost his temper.\nThe WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion defends his titles against the American at the iconic venue in New York on June 1. The bad boy turned British boxing golden boy says he has learned lessons from the past after being riled by Brooklyn bruiser Miller at the announcement press conference earlier this year. Joshua, 29, called out members of Miller\u2019s team when they squared off in New York. But the Olympic gold medallist who has gone from being on remand in Reading to becoming one of Britain\u2019s wealthiest sports stars is confident he won\u2019t put the fight at risk by losing his cool.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m at my best is when I\u2019m in control,\u201d Joshua told DAZN. \u201cI learn to think I\u2019m still a threat, but I just learn to think. I\u2019m still a threat, but now I think before I flip. \u201cI\u2019m older, I\u2019m wiser and I can take care of myself and control my emotions. \u201cThere are so many people in jail, so many people who got themselves into sticky situations because they just couldn\u2019t control their emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to get road rage, flip out and hit someone, get done for GBH. Miller says something, WHAO! boom! fight\u2019s off because someone\u2019s jaw gets broken.\u201d\nThis is Joshua's first fight anywhere outside the UK (Pic: GETTY)\nJoshua\u2019s fight with Miller is his big debut in America and he will make it at a venue steeped in boxing history. MSG has hosted some of the biggest fights in history, including the \u2018Fight of the Century\u2019 between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971. Joshua said: \u201cUntil I had the offer to fight here, I never realised how iconic this place was. \u201cWhen I found out I was fighting at MSG, it made me zone in to what it was about. It is an iconic place, not just in terms of sport, but entertainment. \u201cBeing amongst all these guys is one thing and I feel me and Miller have just posted our names through the post box of MSG history.\nThe mind games between the two had already begun (Pic: GETTY)\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s how do you stamp your name along with these guys because it\u2019s one thing being amongst it, but how do you make your stamp? \u201cIt has to be a great fight and then I have to come back again and own the place. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not going to be the home fighter. Miller will probably bring all his goons, family, friends and supporters, a whole batch of people for him. \u201cI\u2019ve just got tunnel vision and not let it get to me.\n\u201cThe Brits travel, but I hope there will be a lot of Americans there as well because that would show we are breaking barriers. \u201cI want more Americans there. I want to show we can pull in a crowd and bring boxing back.\u201d Joshua\u2019s fight with Miller is believed to be another stepping stone towards an undisputed clash with WBC champion Deontay Wilder. But they are no closer to agreeing a deal to meet any time soon. Joshua added: \u201cIn terms of the negotiations, they didn\u2019t align at the time and I\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve said a lot of things to blame him and he\u2019s said a lot of things to blame me.\nJoshua has not fought since he beat Alexander Povetkin at Wembley last year (Pic: GETTY)\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Updated\nBusinessman and political hopeful Clive Palmer has announced plans to pay back \"millions of dollars\" in outstanding entitlements owed to hundreds of workers who lost their jobs when his Queensland nickel refinery went bust more than three years ago.\nKey points: Clive Palmer said he hopes to reopen the Queensland Nickel refinery immediately\nMr Palmer said his company had \"$400 million in the bank\" to pay back workers\nThe company owed $300 million in debts to creditors when it collapsed in 2016\nFronting the media in Townsville this morning, Mr Palmer said he wanted to reopen the refinery immediately.\n\"Townsville's certainly been doing it tough and difficult since the floods and we want to look forward and not backwards,\" he said.\n\"For that reason I've decided today that we will pay out all outstanding amounts in workers' entitlements that was owed by Queensland Nickel.\"\nWhen the company collapsed in 2016, it was left owing debts of about $300 million to creditors, including local businesses and the Federal Government, which covered entitlements for the 800 people who lost their jobs.\nMr Palmer distanced himself from the sackings, instead taking aim at the administrators who were overseeing operations at the time.\n\"This is despite the fact that we never sacked anybody and the administrators moved in to sack the workforce and to close the refinery operations down at a time when we were ready to pay all the workforce and to transfer them and to operate the refinery,\" he said.\nHe said his company had about \"$400 million in the bank\" ready to pay out.\nAsked why people should trust him, Mr Palmer responded, \"it's not for them to trust me, I own the refinery and it's my money \u2014 it's a question for me to trust them\".\n\"We want to move forward as soon as we can for a large-scale industrial operation to make sure this city operates,\" he said.\n\"We're not asking for anything or any assistance.\"\nIt is understood Mr Palmer is offering to pay what is owed to workers above what the Federal Government's employee entitlements scheme has already covered.\n\"There'll be a form put on our website in the next 14 days where people can go to, fill in their details and make a claim,\" Mr Palmer said.\n\"They'll be assessed against the internal records that we've still got available and a cheque will be dispatched to those people.\"\n'I hope it's true'\nFormer QNI worker Shawn Bramwell said the timing of the announcement was suspicious, but he welcomed it.\n\"I do think that it is tied in with the election because why wouldn't he [Mr Palmer] pay it back a long time ago?\" Mr Bramwell said.\n\"I hope it's true \u2026 it's the right thing that he should have done years ago.\"\nAustralian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) organiser Peter Dalton said repaying workers would be a positive move, but would not help Mr Palmer's political position.\n\"There's a lot of doubt around what Clive Palmer says and what may actually happen, so we would like to see that happen before anyone believes it,\" he said.\n\"I would think the voters of Townsville have long memories \u2026 I can't imagine that there would be too many voters in Townsville that would be interested in giving Clive another shot.\"\nOffer to pay 'paltry': Liquidators\nSpecial Purpose Liquidator of Queensland Nickel, Stephen Parbery, said there was approximately $7.16 million in outstanding entitlements.\nHe said it was unclear whether Mr Palmer intended to also repay the Federal Government.\n\"It is unclear whether Mr Palmer intends to also repay Australian taxpayers for the $66.86 million that was paid to Queensland Nickel employees under the Commonwealth's Fair Entitlements Guarantee in 2016,\" Mr Parbery said.\n\"However, it is disappointing that Mr Palmer's offer, to at long last redress the employees, has taken over three years, and hasn't been extended to the small businesses located in the Townsville region who have been equally affected by the flooding that has had such a dramatic effect on the region.\n\"Instead, Mr Palmer has been offering payments that can only be described as paltry to the affected small businesses in the Townsville area.\n\"Litigation continues in the Supreme Court of Queensland against Mr Palmer and a number of individuals and related entities to recover $200 million in claims against Queensland Nickel.\"\nThe trial has been set down for July 15, 2019 and is expected to run for 45 days.\nLast month, the ABC's 7:30 revealed workplace safety concerns at the Townsville refinery.\nIn the two years prior to the collapse of Queensland Nickel, the company donated more than $21 million to the Palmer United Party.\n'Actions will speak louder than words'\nTownsville Mayor Jenny Hill said the local community was \"still hurting\".\n\"Actions will speak louder than words \u2014 people will wait to see what is actually deposited in their bank account,\" she said.\n\"We need a bit of clarity about what is actually being paid, but if it's the full entitlements and he's paying the Government back, and if that's what he is doing, then that's kudos to him.\n\"We are one of a number of creditors that are still owed money and we would like to see money paid.\"\nWhen asked if Mr Palmer had been in touch, Cr Hill said, \"we've had no discussions\".\n\"Let the community judge the timing of this announcement \u2014 I won't be the judge of that,\" Cr Hill said.\n'Ask me on Thursday': Palmer avoids questions on Herbert\nMr Palmer has spent months running a multi-million-dollar billboard and television advertising campaign promoting his reshaped United Australia Party, after announcing plans to \"contest every seat\" in the upcoming federal election.\nDespite once suggesting he could run in the marginal Townsville seat of Herbert, today Mr Palmer would not say if he would actually stand.\n\"I can't presume that I'll be the candidate, it depends who the party decides who'll be the candidate,\" he said.\n\"I wouldn't answer any political questions here, you can ask me on Thursday [when nominations close].\"\nManaging director of QNI Resources and QNI Metals, Nui Harris, called on the State Government to give approvals needed to restart operations at the refinery, including port and rail access approvals.\n\"Labor has said to Clive Palmer he should pay these workers' entitlements, which he has now acknowledged that he will do so,\" he said.\n\"Now is the time for the Premier and the State Government to do their part and get behind this particular refinery and secure the necessary approvals for the re-commissioning and for the good people of Townsville to get back their jobs.\n\"We also call on the Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill to get behind the refinery and the rebuilding contracts that need to go on over the next 12 to 18 months.\"\nTopics: clive-palmer, business-economics-and-finance, federal-elections,

{"text": "The month of April is undeniably the best time of the year for geeks. So many fandoms are collectively celebrating in anticipation of their favourite pop-culture moments on screen. We're getting a new superhero, a long-impending battle and the next chapter of a much-loved show and that's not even all of it. The month is getting hotter and that just might be because of all the new releases coming in. From films to TV series, here's what we're obsessing over this month:\nShazam! (April 5, 2019)\nThe comic world's most popular superhero is coming to screen. DCEU is taking a break from all the darkness and giving us a flick that's just as humorous as it is action-packed. And we're here to witness it! We've talked about things you need to know before watching Shazam! and the more you discover about him, the more you'll want to see this feature film.\nPerfect Date (April 12, 2019)\nOn popular demand, everybody's favourite boyfriend will be back on screen with an all-new Netflix movie. In yet another teen flick, Noah Centineo is all set to thrill fangirls by doing what he's best at - being his perfect adorable self. Perfect Date will have the actor doing 'boyfriend things' and that's just what we need. Did we mention, Riverdale\u2019s Camila Mendes is also a part of the cast?\nGame of Thrones Season 8 (April 15, 2019)\nThis is the biggest TV series release of the month and that is just by the size of the fan base. Game of Thrones has a massive fandom the world over and one of the biggest in India. The fight for the throne is getting exciting from what we\u2019ve seen of the sneak peeks. All those teasers and trailers only piqued our excitement and after months of speculation, we're finally getting the finale of the fantasy show. Season 8\u2019s release is going to be absolute mayhem as we begin to unravel who will sit on the iron throne.\nKalank (April 17, 2019)\nWhen the trailer dropped, Bollywood fans could see why the magnum opus deserves our attention. Kalank has some breathtaking visuals and some of the best actors of our generation. Starring Alia Bhatt, Sanjay Dutt, Madhuri Dixit, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha, the Karan Johar film looks magnificent. It\u2019s going to be grand and you\u2019re going to want to watch it.\nAvengers: Endgame (April 26, 2019)\nEndgame is another major finale we are getting this month and the Marvel fandom is hyped! The 'Avengers' series that kickstarted seven years ago will see the end of three successful phases of films. Way too many of us are hanging on to hopes that the Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes are going to be and will deliver the planet from Thanos. Luckily for us, the MCU is full of heroes that won\u2019t go down without a fight in the war against humanity. With avenging the fallen on the agenda, it's going to be both memorable and iconic.\nShingeki No Kyojin Season 3, Part 2 (April 29, 2019)\nIn case you don\u2019t already know, Shingeki No Kyojin is one of the most popular anime series and it's getting all-new episodes. The trailer looks awesome and we\u2019re sure the second part will too. Anime fans are definitely hyped about this one.\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina (April 5, 2019)\nWhen you\u2019re done fangirling over Shazam, you also get to return to the Archie Comics TV fandom! Sabrina will be back on screen with some delicious new love interests and witchcraft. We love how the first season went with the thickening plot and the analogies with the history of witchcraft. The series is unexpectedly dark and we can\u2019t wait to see another run!\nAren't summer releases the best? Gear up for the warmer months with the best of entertainment and come equipped with fan theories, you won't be disappointed!\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\"One Good Mama Bone\" by Bren McClain was the book our book club read this month.\nIt was a well-written book, with some very well developed characters. You loved some and despised others. It was Southern Gothic at it's best with the tale of a woman with no motherly skills derived from her own mother (who was the evil character in the book) to lessons learned from a mother cow--Mama Red and her love and care for her baby cow Lucky. It was the journey of trying to find food for the table and love for the soul set in rural South Carolina in the early 1950's.\nIt covered some young men and their 4-H cattle project from beginning to end, and the family dynamics of a few. For those of us not raised on a farm, it can seem a bit harsh to raise an animal you know will go to slaughter. Realistically, I love meat, but if I had to kill it in order to eat it, I would probably be a vegetarian. It was interesting to see characters that became twisted because they had bad parents, while others who had even worse parents, were stellar parents who gave everything they had to help others. It always makes me wonder how environment and your upbringing molds who you are. How do some people with loving parents turn out evil, while some with evil parents turn out to be loving individuals? Food for thought for sure.\nWe had some great discussion.\nI think it was a book that everyone thought was well written and a good story, but it was harder to read for some than others.\nI know I laughed a little, and cried while reading it, but in the end it was redemptive for some. Interestingly enough, you also got to hear the story from the perspective of the mother cow. If you don't mind some dark twists, it was a very good read.\nI also read several other books this month by some of my favorite authors. I don't know about you, but when I find someone I like, I now try to start at the beginning and read my way through in order. I just finished the latest Ian Rankin book \"In a House of Lies\".\nThese crime/suspense novels are based in Scotland with Inspector Rebus (now retired) and Siobhan Clarke picking up where he left off. They are an excellent read, but to grasp all that is said, it helps to start at the beginning. There are 24 in the Rebus series.\nI also just finished Greg Iles newest book \"Cemetery Road\".\nIt started off a bit slow for me, but kicked into high gear 1/3 of the way in. This one is a stand alone novel (so far) but not my all time Iles favorite. He has written 16 or 17 books, but if you are new to Greg Iles, I would suggest starting with the Penn Cage novels. There are six in this series starting with \"The Quiet Game\" (1999), then \"Turning Angel\" (2005), \"The Devil's Punchbowl\" (2009)\n\"The Death Factory\" (2014); \"Natchez Burning\" (2014) \"The Bone Tree\" (2015) and finally \"Mississippi Blood\". They are page turners, and if you are like me, once you start you can't stop until they are done. Most of Greg Iles books are set in Natchez, or areas not far away. They are well written and engaging.\nWhen I find an author I like and get invested in the characters, it is sort of like going home again, once you pick up the latest book. Some authors have more stand alone books. I have finished one and am halfway through another Prey series by John Sanford, and I am not reading them in order. Each one doesn't necessarily build on the other, but I still like them.\nI love reading, and having the opportunity to read and discuss a book with others makes it even more enjoyable. What have you read lately?\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "TORONTO \u2014 Auston Matthews had a lot of fingers pointing in his direction following Toronto\u2019s first-round exit last spring.\nMonday represented a big step towards making sure there\u2019s no repeat.\nMatthews had a goal and an assist for his first points of the playoffs as the Maple Leafs defeated the Boston Bruins 3-2 to grab a 2-1 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal.\nHeavily criticized for his performance in Boston\u2019s seven-game victory 12 months ago \u2014 he registered just two points, while Boston\u2019s top line of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak combined for 30 \u2014 Matthews put Toronto ahead for good on the power play midway through the second period.\nThe 21-year-old centre had a team-high 17 shots attempts in Games 1 and 2, including one off the post, and was relieved to finally find the back of Boston\u2019s net.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another level when you score a goal in the playoffs, especially at home,\u201d said Matthews, who had 37 goals in the regular season. \u201cIt feels like an earthquake under you.\n\u201cThe atmosphere tonight was unbelievable and we just want to continue what we built off tonight here on Wednesday (in Game 4).\u201d\nAndreas Johnsson, also with a goal and an assist, and Trevor Moore provided the rest of the offence for Toronto, which got 34 saves from Frederik Andersen.\nThe Leafs downed the Bruins 4-1 in the series opener at TD Garden before falling by the same score in Game 2 on a night where Boston dominated, especially on the physical side.\n\u201cWe played much harder and we forechecked hard,\u201d Johnsson said. \u201cWe were heavier on the puck.\u201d\nDavid Krejci and Charlie Coyle replied for Boston. Tuukka Rask stopped 31 shots for visitors in front of a crowd of 19,611 at Scotiabank Arena.\n\u201cThey upped their compete level,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOurs wasn\u2019t as good as it needed to be. But we\u2019re right there, we had some opportunities to tie it up.\u201d\nThe Leafs learned less than an hour before puck drop that Nazem Kadri has been suspended for the rest of the series for the centre\u2019s vicious cross-check to the head of Bruins winger Jake DeBrusk in the third period of Game 2.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that he\u2019s not available,\u201d Toronto defenceman Morgan Rielly said. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ve got to move on, we\u2019ve got to play.\u201d\nWith the Bruins pressing late, Leafs winger Mitch Marner, who scored twice in Game 1, sacrificed his body on two Pastrnak shots \u2014 including one that hit him in the shoulder as he lay on the ice \u2014 to preserve the victory.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do to win,\u201d head coach Mike Babcock said. \u201cIdeally, all those things are contagious. When you see your teammate do something like that, you\u2019re more likely to do it yourself.\u201d\nScoreless following a spirited first period, the offensive floodgates opened in the second.\nToronto took a 1-0 lead at 2:38 when Moore poked a loose puck home for the rookie\u2019s first career playoff goal as the fourth line that also included Frederik Gauthier and Tyler Ennis were rewarded for their hard work.\n\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt was just kind of surreal out there to see the puck go in.\u201d\nBoston replied just 52 seconds later when Krejci chipped a bouncing puck past Andersen, but Matthews restored Toronto\u2019s lead 12 seconds after David Backes was whistled for high-sticking, taking a feed from Johnsson and burying a shot beyond Rask to send Scotiabank Arena into a frenzy at 10:12.\nMatthews was immediately serenaded by chants of \u201cAus-ton! Matth-ews!\u201d by the crowd.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a proud guy who wants to be good every night and wants to score, loves to score,\u201d Babcock said. \u201cProbably relieves a lot of pressure off him.\u201d\nPromoted to the first power-play unit because of Kadri\u2019s suspension, Johnsson made it 3-1 with 2:48 left in the period when he roofed a backhand over Rask off a nice feed from John Tavares as Toronto connected for a second time on the man advantage after going 0 for 4 in the first two games.\n\u201cThey were coming with more speed,\u201d DeBrusk said. \u201cWe brought the speed in Game 2 and they brought the speed in (Games) 1 and 3.\n\u201cThose are the results.\u201d\nBoston responded on a power play of its own with 37.3 seconds left in the period when Coyle collected a puck off the end boards to score his second of the series.\nAfter both Matthews and Johnsson had chances to put the Leafs up 4-2 in the third, Andersen made a diving stop with the knob of his stick on Krejci to keep his team ahead.\n\u201cDoing whatever it takes to try to save it,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cHe waited me out a little bit and had a nice move, but you just try to do whatever you can to get something on it.\u201d\nBoston kept up the pressure with Rask on the bench for the extra attacker, but Toronto held on despite some tense moments \u2014 including Marner\u2019s blocks \u2014 to take a 2-1 series lead.\n\u201cIt was great. I love it,\u201d Rielly said. \u201cThere was never a question of the character of our team, but that was just a good display of it.\n\u201cThat can be good to see and we\u2019ll feed off it.\u201d\nNote: Game 5 is set for Friday in Boston.

{"text": "This is the seventh installment of a position-by-position preview of the 2019 NFL Draft.\nDefensive tackle ranks as one of the more talent-rich areas in the NFL draft.\nMany prognosticators believe Alabama\u2019s Quinnen Williams ranks at the top of this year\u2019s college crop, regardless of position, even though Arizona could have its sights set on Oklahoma quarterback Kyler Murray as the No. 1 overall pick. They also can see at least a half-dozen defensive tackles selected in the first two rounds.\nBesides Williams, other defensive tackles widely viewed as worthy of first-round grades are Houston\u2019s Ed Oliver and Clemson\u2019s Dexter Lawrence. Another Clemson product, Christian Wilkins, is seen as going no later than the second round, with Mississippi State\u2019s Jeffery Simmons and Notre Dame\u2019s Jerry Tillery also falling into the second-round category.\nAfter Day 2, however, the consensus is that the quality of available tackles drops significantly.\n\u201cDefensive tackle has been held up as this draft\u2019s strong suit, and for good reason \u2014 the position could produce as many as seven or eight of the top 50 players selected in this year's draft,\u201d NFL media draft analyst Lance Zierlein wrote for NFL.com. \u201cGuys like Quinnen Williams, Christian Wilkins, Ed Oliver, Dexter Lawrence and Jeffery Simmons have received plenty of attention as first-round candidates, and the position's riches will spill into Day 2 of the draft.\n\u201cBut the talent pool isn't limitless here. Teams that haven't addressed DT by Friday of draft weekend could be left in a lurch, as there isn't as much depth in the middle to late rounds.\u201d\nOverall draft grade for the position: A-.\nThe best: Quinnen Williams, Alabama. You might be hard-pressed to find a better or more complete player in the draft. After a college career of dominating the middle of the line, there\u2019s every reason to believe he\u2019ll do the same at the next level. He has size (6-foot-3, 303 pounds), strength, quickness and athleticism. He routinely made it into the backfield to stop run plays almost as soon as they began. He also was a major inside pass-rushing force.\nThe best part for the team that selects Williams is that he enters the draft as a red-shirt sophomore, meaning there is room for him to develop physically and mentally as a pro.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see any plays taken off with Quinnen Williams,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper Jr., said during a conference call with reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got tremendous hand usage. He disengages and gets into that backfield. He\u2019s the closest thing to (Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron) Donald at the collegiate level as you saw this year. \u2026 He destroys double teams, he hustles, he has great effort, he chases in pursuit. He may not be Aaron Donald, but those comparisons are more to Williams than maybe Ed Oliver.\u201d\nBills view: This could easily qualify as the Bills\u2019 top area of need. Much has been made about the leadership the Bills lost with Kyle Williams\u2019 retirement, but the team also lost their most disruptive inside force on defense. Despite his advanced age, Kyle Williams had more of a consistent impact than Star Lotulelei. He also was better than Jordan Phillips and Harrison Phillips.\nThe Bills must find a high-end replacement for Kyle Williams, and the draft figures to give them a good opportunity to do so at the ninth overall spot or elsewhere in the first round if they should move via trade.\n\"Take a seat, mom\": Growing up without a father in a small town in Louisiana, Alabama defensive tackle Isaiah Buggs saw the struggles his mother went through to raise him and his siblings. He has used that as a driving force to become a good enough player to make big money in the NFL.\n\u201cWatching what she did, and what she had to put up with with us, this is my motivation to get her whatever she wants, whatever she needs,\u201d Buggs said. \u201cNow I just tell her every time, \u2018Take a seat. It is my turn to take care of you, because you did it for 22 years.\u2019 And now I owe it all to her. This is why I do it.\u201d\nSleeper: Demarcus Christmas, Florida State. Although he could end up being an undrafted free agent, he has plenty of qualities that will convince a team to sign him. At 6-3 and 302 pounds, he has good size, strength and is a decent athlete. His forte is playing the run, and he consistently gives tremendous effort.\nNext: Inside linebacker\nTop 10 defensive tackles\nA glance at the top defensive tackles available in the 2019 NFL Draft:\n1. Quinnen Williams*, Alabama, 6-3, 303. He comes from a school with a strong reputation for producing quality D-linemen, but the guy could very well to be one of its all-time best.\n2. Ed Oliver*, Houston, 6-2, 287. Tremendous quickness and explosiveness likely will convince a team to overlook his relative lack of size and decline after dominant \u201917 season.\n3. Dexter Lawrence*, Clemson, 6-4, 342. Remarkably athletic for his size and, while he can dominate in close quarters, he\u2019s excellent in pursuit and uses his hands well to disengage.\n4. Christian Wilkins, Clemson, 6-3, 315. Had strongly considered entering the draft last year, but believed he could elevate his draft status by sticking around and seemingly did so.\n5. Jeffery Simmons*, Mississippi State, 6-4, 301. He could do a better job as a pass-rusher, but he shows consistently good effort and does a nice job as a run-stuffer.\n6. Jerry Tillery, Notre Dame, 6-6, 295. Recruited to play offensive tackle, he made a smooth transition to the defensive line as a freshman and has shown steady improvement.\n7. Isaiah Buggs, Alabama, 6-3, 306. Shows excellent quickness, which serves him well when rushing the passer, and his versatility is highly impressive.\n8. Gerald Willis III, Miami, 6-2, 302. His natural talent is considerable, although if he\u2019s going to be a successful pro, he needs to work on improving his techniques.\n9. Dre\u2019Mont Jones*, Ohio State, 6-3, 281. Despite drawing high marks for his athleticism, he falls short as a play-maker, a contradiction that could be a big concern for some teams.\n10. Charles Omenihu, Texas, 6-5, 280. His performance at defensive tackle in college was solid, yet some scouts believe he doesn\u2019t have a wide enough body to succeed at the position in the NFL.\n* Underclassman\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It\u2019s no secret Kevin Garnett was a fierce competitor on the court, but the NBA legend\u2019s intensity extended beyond the hardwood, where former teammates seemingly have countless memories of his commanding presence and locker room leadership.\nKendrick Perkins, who spent parts of four seasons playing alongside Garnett with the Boston Celtics, officially announced his retirement on an episode of \u201cThe Woj Pod\u201d podcast that dropped Monday. Perk shared several stories about his NBA career, and it wasn\u2019t long before ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski asked him about KG and the players\u2019 time together in Boston.\nWojnarowski wanted to know, specifically, about how Garnett handled those who broke his strict rule regarding postgame meals. Apparently, Garnett made it clear that players were to eat first, and any staff member who dared to overlook the mandate was subject to The Big Ticket\u2019s wrath.\nPerkins recalled two incidents: one involving former Celtics chief medical officer and head team physician Brian McKeon, and another involving former Boston video coordinator Brian Adams.\nHere\u2019s what Perkins said about KG\u2019s interaction with the team doctor:\nI remember one time, we use to order Maggiano\u2019s, right? And we had spaghetti and all types of other (crap) going on on the buffet line, (crap) was good. So we come in after the game. Everybody knew this rule, right? \u2018Hey man, don\u2019t touch the food. Players eat first.\u2019 This was established from Day 1, right? Dr. McKeon, obviously he didn\u2019t get the message. So, I remember like yesterday, KG, he\u2019s wrapped up in his towel coming out of the shower, he\u2019s got a towel over his shoulders \u2026 He\u2019s coming out shining and (crap), and he\u2019s like, \u2018Hey man, what the f\u2014 you doing?\u2019 So everybody turns like, \u2018Oh (crap).\u2019 He walks over standing over him with that intimidating like, \u2018Hey man, what the f\u2014 you doing? Hey man, players eat first. Matter of fact, give me this (crap).\u2019 Took the plate, boom! Threw it in the trash right in front of his face. \u2018Hey man, get out of here until the players finish eating man. F\u2014 wrong with you, man? I\u2019ve already said this.\u2019\nHere\u2019s what Perkins said about KG\u2019s interaction with the video coordinator, whom the Celtics players called \u201cLucky.\u201d\nLucky gets on the plane, I guess he forgot the memo, too. He comes up, he\u2019s getting his food. So KG\u2019s like, \u2018Hey Lucky, what the f\u2014 you doing, man?\u2019 So Lucky\u2019s like, \u2018What you mean, Kevin? I\u2019m hungry. I haven\u2019t ate all (day).\u2019 (Garnett said), \u2018I don\u2019t give a f\u2014. You know the rules. Players eat first. Give me this (crap). Matter of fact, go sit in the back of the plane and don\u2019t come back up here until I tell you so.\u2019 So I\u2019m like, \u2018Ticket, chill.\u2019 (Garnett said), \u2018Perk, what you want with me today?\u2019 \u2026 So now me and him are getting into an argument over Lucky not abiding by KG\u2019s rules. So man, yeah, that was the rule: Do not eat before the players. After that, you can eat whatever you wanna eat.\nWow. Garnett sounds like a jerk.\nDon\u2019t worry, though. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, according to Perkins, who prefaced his stories by pointing out how well Garnett typically treated the Celtics\u2019 staffers.\nThumbnail photo via Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Images\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Chantelle Glass thought she was going to die over an unpaid traffic ticket and a request to make a phone call after she was booked in to the Cuyahoga County Jail last year.\nThe simple request to let someone know she was arrested turned into a violent attack by two Cuyahoga County Jail officers who were charged Monday with violating Glass\u2019 civil rights when they strapped her to a restraint chair, punched her and shot pepper-spray in her face, according to Glass and prosecutors.\nGlass, a mother of three children, suffers from asthma and could barely breathe during the two hours the officers left her tied to the chair in a small, isolated cell as the pepper-spray burned her lungs.\n\u201cThat day, I thought I was going to die,\u201d Glass said. \u201cI sat in that cell I prayed to God that I wouldn\u2019t die because I couldn\u2019t breathe. I prayed that I wouldn\u2019t die there.\u201d\nThe officers accused of strapping her down and punching her, Cpl. Idris-Farid Clark and officer Robert Marsh, were indicted Monday, eight months after the incident.\nClark is charged with second-degree felony assault and misdemeanor counts of assault, interfering with civil rights and unlawful restraint. Marsh is charged with assault, interfering with civil rights and unlawful restraint, all misdemeanors.\nMarsh was arrested late Monday and Clark remains at-large. Marsh and two other corrections officers are scheduled for arraignment on Tuesday.\nFive corrections officers charged\nThe two were among one former and four current jail officers charged Monday in three separate criminal cases, all of which led to charges of civil rights violations.\nGlass, 29, said she was dismayed that Clark and Marsh were allowed to keep working at the jail for so long after the July 16 attack.\nBoth were placed on restricted duty in August, but still worked in the jail until Tuesday, when they were placed on unpaid administrative leave.\nGlass said she is considering legal action against the county.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they were still working,\u201d Glass said. \u201cIt\u2019s unjust they were still working and still getting a paychecks.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2019ll just have you maced\u2019\nGlass said she ended up in the jail after her mother called Cleveland police when Glass and her sister had a heated argument.\nOfficers arrested both sisters and booked them into the jail. No charges were ever filed in that case. Glass was held in the jail because of an warrant for failing to show up for court for a traffic ticket from two years earlier.\nShe was placed in a cell and asked to make a phone call in order to let someone know she was locked up. Officers refused several times after she refused a corrections officer\u2019s order to pick up a spoon, she said.\n\u201cAfter that it went downhill,\u201d Glass said.\nThe female corrections officer said, \"\u2018Well, I\u2019ll just have you maced and strapped to a chair.\u2019\u201d\nGlass got angrier and banged on her jail cell and yelled at officers.\nShe asked to talk to a supervisor. Clark, a supervisor, came to speak with her. Clark asked Glass if she was going to stop banging on the cell. She said she\u2019d stop once she got to make her phone call.\nShe said Clark placed her in handcuffs and called for backup. Glass said Marsh walked up and immediately started \u201croughing\u201d her up, Glass said. She said they then ordered her into the restraint chair, which prohibits someone from being able to move.\nShe said she walked to the chair without issue, but again asked for her phone call and hurled a few insults at the officers.\nMarsh shoved her head and the officers told her to stop resisting, even though she wasn\u2019t, Glass said.\n\u2018Everything was burning\u2019\nOnce she was strapped in the chair, Marsh punched her in the head, according to Glass and court records.\nClark put his can of pepper spray about a foot in front of her face and unloaded half the can, court records say. Glass said she was pepper-sprayed for about seven seconds, but she said it felt like five minutes.\n\u201cEverything was burning,\u201d she said. \u201cI had bad aches and my eyes hurt. And I still didn\u2019t get my phone call.\u201d\nShe told the officers she couldn\u2019t breathe and that she had asthma.\nInstead of taking her to get medical treatment, they locked her in a small cell by herself, poured water over her and left her there for two hours. She said she asked to use the bathroom several times and was denied. She urinated on herself. She wasn\u2019t allowed to shower the pepper-spray off her skin.\n\u201cI really can\u2019t believe it happened,\u201d Glass said.\nAn investigator at the jail sought her out the next day and told her he was filing a report after watching the surveillance video of the incident. Cleveland.com has requested a copy of the video, and the county has denied the request. The news outlet filed a claim with the Ohio Court of Claims to get the video released.\nGlass went in front of a judge two days later and was released from the jail on a personal bond and was never charged in the domestic incident.\nWhen she told some family members and friends about what happened to her, they didn\u2019t believe her.\n\u201cI figured if it was that bad, then something would have been done about it back then,\u201d her father Alan Turner said.\nGlass said she was happy to see something finally happen with her case, but has struggled since the incident with flashbacks and anxiety, especially around larger men like Marsh and Clark.\n\u201cI just want to see justice done,\u201d Glass said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be at every hearing to make sure something gets done about this.

When you first started working with comics, why did that appeal to you?\nI think it starts with who I am and what resonates with me.

I start from this place where comedy already appeals to me and I have work that kind of works in that world too. In L.A., around 2010, I started putting energy into performing on whatever comedy shows were open to that. If I\u2019m around that audience, because they\u2019re tuned into comedy, tuned in to delivery, to timing, they would respond to things in my rhymes that I wasn\u2019t even used to people responding to, because people at rap shows tend to listen a little differently.\nOn \u201cSouthside Eagle (93 Bulls),\u201d you say, \u201cI probably need to start another podcast.\u201d Can you envision a time during which you\u2019re doing enough?\nWhen you say is there an enough in terms of what I\u2019m doing, I guess it largely depends on how you measure that.

{"text": "Social networking giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will host its annual shareholder meeting on May 30. Ahead of the gathering, Facebook has released its proxy statement, which details the proposals that will come up for a vote. The company has already been facing rising investor unrest in recent years due to myriad scandals, and there are the usual -- and futile -- calls for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to voluntarily relinquish his majority voting power.\nHowever, in a stunning turn of events, a stockholder proposal goes as far as to call for Facebook to be broken up. Some politicians have been making that argument for months now, and it seems some shareholders agree.\nBreaking up is hard to do\n\"Shareholders of Facebook, Inc. (\"Facebook\") request that the board of directors begin an orderly process of retaining advisors to study strategic alternatives and empower a committee of independent directors to evaluate those alternatives in exercise of their fiduciary responsibilities to maximize shareholder value,\" the proposal reads.\nFacebook has grown exponentially over the years and accumulated incredible market share and power, which have led to calls for the company to be broken up. Management's response to its ongoing crises has seemed \"uninformed,\" according to the proposal's supporting statement. \"It appears that Facebook may be too large and complex to be managed effectively,\" the submitting shareholder writes. The proposal notes that the controversies have weighed on Facebook's share price, which lost roughly 24% of its value in the first 11 months of 2018. Consumer trust in the company has also plummeted.\nIn order to maximize shareholder value, the proposal calls for Facebook to consider canceling Zuck's supervoting Class B shares and/or the \"sale of one or more subsidiaries.\"\nFacebook fires back\nOf course, Facebook opposes the proposal and the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against it. The board argues that under Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has \"established a track record of creating value for our stockholders and navigating important opportunities and challenges.\" Facebook says it is now focused on addressing major social issues facing the company, building new experiences, supporting third-party businesses that rely on Facebook, and communicating more transparently.\nThere's no possible way the proposal will pass, as Zuck will single-handedly vote it down. While the young chief executive has been selling off some of his stake in order to fund his philanthropic efforts, he still wields 53% voting power. When including co-founder Dustin Moskovitz's shares, which Zuckerberg secured irrevocable voting proxy over as part of a settlement years ago, His Zuckness' total voting power increases to 57.7%.\nIf Facebook is ever to be broken up, it won't be from a shareholder proposal.

{"text": "Dog owners are more likely to describe themselves as \u2018very happy\u2019 (Picture: Getty)\nA new study has found that dog owners are significantly happier than cat owners.\nAccording to the findings, 36% of dog owners report being \u2018very happy\u2019 compared to just 18% of cat owners.\nThe General Social Survey (GSS), which is run by social research organisation NORC at the University of Chicago typically use a sample size of between 1,500 \u2013 3,000 to collect data about the attitudes and behaviours of Americans.\nTheir latest findings appear to prove that dogs really are man\u2019s best friend \u2013 and that they can even make us happier.\nBut you have to take the findings with a pinch of salt. The figures don\u2019t necessarily suggest a causation. It could be that other factors in the lives of dog-owners are contributing to this improved level of happiness.\nThe survey\u2019s findings also revealed that dog owners are more likely to be married and own homes than cat owners \u2013 both of which are factors that typically improve life satisfaction.\nIf you have a dog, you\u2019re much more likely to live in a bigger house, near green, open space \u2013 this fact alone could improve your overall happiness levels.\nCats are much more flexible and you can technically have one anywhere, even a shoe box high-rise flat surrounded by concrete. Not exactly a winning combination for perpetual life satisfaction.\nAdditionally, owning a dog means walking that dog. That\u2019s at least an extra 30 minutes outside in nature that cat owners aren\u2019t necessarily getting every day. And, as we reported, just 20 minutes in nature every day can reduce stress levels.\nBeing out in nature has an effect on happiness too (Picture: Getty)\nBeing physically active on a daily basis can be hugely beneficial for your mood and overall well being. Having a dog is a natural way to ensure you don\u2019t spend every evening glued to your sofa. Whereas a cat sleeping on your lap can have the exact opposite effect.\nSo is it time to consider giving up your feline friend? Are you destined for a lifetime of despair if you happen to prefer kittens to puppies?\nWe don\u2019t think so.\nOwning any pet will help to improve your happiness. Goldfish, hamster, rabbit, kitty \u2013 research suggests that owning any of these furry friends can improve your cardiovascular health and lower your blood pressure.\nAnother survey of 1,000 dog and cat owners from last year found that pet owners are more likely to be satisfied in their jobs while almost half of those surveyed said they never felt lonely.\nSo while it looks like dog owners might just have the edge when it comes to happiness, it\u2019s more likely the big house, financial stability and regular exercise associated with having a dog that is causing the spike in satisfaction.\nIf you can persuade your landlord to let you have a pet, any pet, it\u2019s definitely worth a try and your serotonin levels will thank you.\nSend us your cat stories!

Chicago will now be the largest U.S. city to have an openly LGBT mayor, surpassing Houston, where out lesbian Annise Parker served from 2010 until 2016.\nFormer city councilor Satya Rhodes-Conway won the Madison, Wisconsin mayoral race in a landslide, beating incumbent Paul Soglin by a margin of over 20 percentage points.\nFormer Missouri state legislator Jolie Justus placed first in her primary for the Kansas City mayoral race and will advance to a general election in June.\nParker now serves as the president of the Victory Fund, an organization that works to elect LGBT candidates\u2014and she believes that lesbian electoral success is no accident.\n\u201cWhat we have found at Victory is that our lesbian candidates outperform our male candidates,\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\u201dWomen tend to wait longer before they run, they want to be more qualified, and they\u2019re often better prepared.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Parker acknowledges that the particular stigma around gay men may also play a role: \u201cI think for a lot of really unpleasant reasons, lesbian candidates are [seen as] a lot less threatening in some ways than gay male candidates.\u201d\nAccording to the Victory Institute, the Victory Fund\u2019s partner organization, there are currently 38 U.S. cities with openly LGBT mayors. That list includes several lesbian mayors, like Salt Lake City\u2019s Jackie Biskupski, Seattle\u2019s Jenny Durkan, and Key West\u2019s Teri Johnston.\nStill, though, Tuesday night\u2019s wins mark a major step forward for lesbian electoral representation. As Parker noted in a press release, the number of lesbians who are elected mayor of a big city could triple by the time this cycle is over.\nTuesday night\u2019s candidates ran on local issues\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t celebrating the new national precedents they have set.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be working on affordable housing and transit and trying to bridge our racial opportunity gap and preparing for the impacts of climate change,\u201d Rhodes-Conway, who will be the first openly LGBT mayor of Madison, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut at the same time, that in no way keeps me from being, I hope, a national leader and role model for the LGBTQ community.\u201d\nFor Rhodes-Conway, these two roles\u2014local mayor and potential national role model\u2014aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, especially because LGBT people are disproportionately affected by many of the problems she is hoping to address while in office.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see those [roles] as conflicting or separate necessarily,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the issues that I talked about are LGBTQ issues.\u201d\nTuesday night\u2019s lesbian electoral wins\u2014which all took place outside of coastal states\u2014show that running as an openly LGBT candidate is becoming less of a liability than it once was, says Parker. In fact, she believes it could be an asset in some cases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always a positive to run openly LGBT, but it\u2019s not necessarily a negative,\u201d she told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had success everywhere.\u201d\nIn her initial statement to press, Parker shared her belief that \u201clesbian mayors bring unique experiences and perspectives to the position that make them more empathetic, principled, and values-driven leaders.\u201d\nParker expanded on that sentiment for The Daily Beast, observing that empathy and honesty are qualities the electorate seems to want, and so \u201cpeople respond\u201d when they hear candidates be \u201cclear about who they are.\u201d When those candidates have had experiences of marginalization, Parker contends, they may better relate to others.\n\u201cTaking a clear look at yourself and how you relate to the world, and then deciding to come out and approach the world more head-on\u2014I think that\u2019s a good quality for any public official,\u201d said Parker. \u201cThat sense of being on the outside, of being different\u2014I think that makes you more aware of being able to put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\u201c I think being a woman, being a lesbian, is certainly core to my identity and affects how I see the world and how I think. \u201d\nRhodes-Conway agrees that her experiences as a lesbian have informed her politics in the same way that any candidate brings their background with them into office.\n\u201cI think being a woman, being a lesbian, is certainly core to my identity and affects how I see the world and how I think,\u201d she told The Daily Beast.\u201dOne of the most valuable things in leadership\u2014whether that\u2019s in the public sector or the private sector, we know how valuable it is to have a diversity of opinions at the table.\u201d\nAfter 2018\u2019s \u201cRainbow Wave\u201d of LGBT electoral wins in state legislatures, lesbian wins across the Midwest in 2019 are another sign that the electoral map might be changing for candidates who aren\u2019t straight or cisgender.\nIn a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, nearly 70 percent of Americans said they would be comfortable with a gay or lesbian presidential candidate, which is up significantly from 43 percent in 2006.\nThat poll made headlines in large part because of another openly LGBT mayor: South Bend, Indiana\u2019s Pete Buttigieg, whose presidential exploratory committee has gained widespread media attention in the past two weeks.\nIn the midst of the Buttigieg buzz, Parker hopes that the LGBT community can take some time to celebrate these mayoral-level lesbian accomplishments to make sure they don\u2019t get \u201covershadowed.\u201d\n\u201cI love Mayor Pete and we\u2019re all excited,\u201d said Parker. \u201cWe haven\u2019t endorsed him because he\u2019s still in the exploratory phase, but we\u2019re cheering him on from the sidelines.\u201d\n\u201c There\u2019s still a long way to go toward achieving equality. \u201d\nIn the meantime, Victory Fund is looking ahead to the Tampa mayoral run-off election, where out lesbian Jane Castor could become the first openly LGBT big-city mayor in the American Southeast, as the advocacy group noted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go toward achieving equality,\u201d said Parker.\nTo that end, new Mayor-elect Rhodes-Conway hopes that younger generations of LGBT people will be encouraged by this week\u2019s victories.\n\u201cI want them to know that they can see themselves in leadership and that they should see themselves in leadership,\u201d she said.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Islamabad : The third Women Entrepreneurship Conference\u201919 (WECON \u201919) brought together women entrepreneurs, stakeholders and industry experts from diverse backgrounds under one roof at a local hotel on Saturday for discussion on their issues and challenges for finding solutions.\nThe organisers said the event\u2019s theme was \u2018khudi\u2019, which talked about self-belief and self-determination.\nThey said many brilliant women besides facing socio-economic challenges also suffered from a lack of self-belief and self-determination, which stopped their businesses from taking off.\nBesides discussing the topics about the theme, the event, the media partner of which was Jang Media Group, also launched the WECON Movement, a nationwide initiative to help aspiring women entrepreneurs prevent business failures.\nAs part of the WECON Movement, two innovative platforms, the WECON Tribe and WE Portal, were launched.\nThe WECON Tribe was meant to help women entrepreneurs in early stages of their business journey through local communities, while the WE Portal was designed to create a place for women to market their products to corporates and organisations.\nCEO of the Change Mechanics Sayyed Ahmad Masud said the WECON was launched by his organisation, a network of entrepreneurs, change agents and educators, to bring change and innovation to everyday life.\n\u201cRealising the constraints of women in the field of entrepreneurship and the resultant disparity in the ratio of male and female startups, we launched WECON,\u201d he said.\nAhmad Masud said the event was meant to showcase local women entrepreneurs as inspirations to students and budding entrepreneurs and create knowledge opportunities and collaborative framework to help organisations working in the field to connect and partner with each other.\n\u201cBy helping women succeed in business, we can address the most serious societal inequalities through innovation and entrepreneurship as women bring a unique perspective and can create practical solutions to everyday problems,\u201d he said.\nRomella Hameed, founder and CEO of SMT: an online self-management training for special persons, said Pakistani women\u2019s participation in business activities was direly needed.\nShe said most women wanting to become entrepreneurs weren\u2019t encouraged and supported by their families but those who managed such hurdles somehow had turned out to be successful businesswomen.\nShe said as lack of finances, mentoring and networking were the major challenges startups faced, such events could help address them.\nGul Zeba Jawad, CEO of Pernia Couture, and vice-president of the Women Entrepreneurs Standing Committee at Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said WECON was a very good platform for women entrepreneurs of different sectors and cities to meet and connect, and learn from experts.\nShe said women entrepreneurs faced multiple challenges including family and social pressures and financial and administrative issues but the entrepreneurship was all about facing and managing them.\nShannon Grewer, CEO of Victoria Road, complained about sexual harassment and discrimination against working women in the country and called for steps to end it.\nShe, however, said Pakistan was changing for women entrepreneurs as they\u2019d better chances of training, mentoring and growth compared with the past though finances continued to be serious issue for their development.\n\u201cWomen entrepreneurs have still a long way to go,\u201d she said.\nClinical psychologist Uzma Sadaqat said she had come all the way from Lahore to interact with businesswomen and learn from their experiences and had a wonderful time at the event.\nShe said healthy discussions should happen among women about how to progress using their skills and talents, and the WECON was a very good platform for the purpose.\nThe organisers honoured successful women from different fields.\nThe Most Promising Female Led Startup award went to Ayesha Ahmed, co-founder, and CEO of Pak Agri Market, a tech startup that has established an online marketplace to address market access problems in the current supply chain faced by small farmers.\nFounder of SWITCH Danielle Sharaf grabbed the Female Tech Entrepreneur of the Year award for bringing health solutions to adolescent girls, bridging the knowledge gap and empowering women across all socio-economic strata through cellular technology, while the Social Entrepreneur of the Year award went to founder and CEO of TrashIt Anusha Fatima for working on organic waste disposal by making nutrient-rich compost and empowering citizens to adopt a sustainable lifestyle.\nAlso, Tasleem Bibi got the Woman of Influence award for directly impacting the lives of more than 425 women and contributing to the livelihood of 1000s more, encouraging them to start their business.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Before Chicago started picking up garbage on a grid system seven years ago, any alderman could order that a certain corner of his ward \u2014 or even the home of a favored brother-in-law \u2014 be taken care of first.\nAldermen don\u2019t order around the garbage trucks anymore. But for an array of other routine city services \u2014 such as granting a shopkeeper permission to put up an awning \u2014 they still can call the shots, thanks to an unwritten rule called \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nLike Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot, we think aldermanic prerogative, which was at the heart of several recent criminal scandals, should be seriously curbed. And there are practical ways to do it. Most directly, Lightfoot could simply order all city departments under her control to quit deferring to an alderman\u2019s wishes.\nHere\u2019s the tricky part: In the abstract, aldermanic prerogative makes a lot of sense, as dozens of incumbent aldermen and candidates argued when we interviewed them prior to the 2019 elections.\nNobody knows a ward like an alderman, they told us, and they need to have that final say over zoning changes, construction permits and the like to shape their wards for the better.\nBut the whole history of Chicago politics, going back to when men wore bowler hats and spats, is of aldermanic prerogative being abused by ward bosses more interested in getting rich than serving their constituents. Most recently, aldermanic prerogative was at the heart of an alleged effort by Ald. Edward Burke (14th) to shake down the owner of a Burger King restaurant who needed city permits to carry out a renovation.\nChicago Inspector General Joe Ferguson is right when he says Lightfoot will have a hard time getting rid of aldermanic prerogative altogether. As he says, the system is informal and you \u201ccan\u2019t legislate relationships.\u201d\nBut we\u2019re not looking for perfect, just better.\nAnd better, in this case, would be Lightfoot\u2019s promised executive order allowing employees of the executive branch \u2014 her branch \u2014 to overrule an alderman on such matters as where to put a stop sign, a driveway or new affordable housing. We heartily endorse the new mayor putting this into effect when she\u2019s sworn in on May 20.\nAfter being sworn in, aldermen in the new City Council also will have a grand opportunity to put reasonable limits on aldermanic prerogative from their side.\nThe Council should include a rule that an alderman cannot invoke aldermanic prerogative in any matter that presents a possible conflict of interest, especially with respect to outside employment.\nThe classic case \u2014 and Burke again is the poster child \u2014 is of an alderman who also sells insurance or does property tax appeals work. Too often, the alderman\u2019s clients are the dozens of businesses seeking favorable treatment from the Council or a city agency.\nAs a way of sparing the average Chicagoan from even having to play the game, the Council could abolish committees that deal only with minor issues, such as granting permits for smaller store signs. That kind of stuff should not even come before the Council. Let the appropriate city agency deal with it.\nWe mildly regret any diminution of aldermanic prerogative for the really good aldermen. They often know best about what to do about a liquor store that sells to minors or a dangerous drug house in their ward, and they should have the power to do something about it.\nBut, honestly, Chicago has just never had a lot of really good aldermen.\nThe good ones can blame the slugs for the loss of a good thing.\nIn addition to being criminally abused, aldermanic prerogative has had the collective effect of undermining thoughtful citywide planning efforts for new development and affordable housing. When an alderman is calling the shots, nobody with a grander vision stands a chance.\n\u201cAldermanic prerogative has stopped a number of good projects,\u201d says Jacky Grimshaw, the Center for Neighborhood Technology\u2019s vice president of government affairs.\nAldermanic prerogative, like the old wink and a nod, may always be with us.\nBut we can at least try to make it work for everyday citizens. And Lightfoot\u2019s planned executive order and possible actions by the incoming Council would be good first steps.\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.\n", "label": "human"}

He joined tackle Merlin Olsen (1961) and defensive end Phil Olsen (1969) as Utah State's only consensus All-Americans, and just the 16th player in Mountain West history to earn that honor.\nThe native of Las Vegas received first-team All-America honors from two of the five outlets that comprise the NCAA Consensus All-America team, including the WCFF and the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA).\nA week after being named a consensus All-American, Scarver was tabbed a first-team All-American at kick returner by Phil Steele Publications. He was also one of three Aggies to earn first-team all-Mountain West honors from Phil Steele.\nScarver was also one of two Aggies to earn first-team all-Mountain West honors last season as the 5-foot-11, 185-pounder led the nation in kickoff returns (33.7 ypr), and tied for second with a pair of kickoff returns for touchdowns.\nDuring the 2018 season, Scarver returned 22 kickoffs for 742 yards, including four returns of 50-or-more yards. His two kickoff returns for touchdowns (100 yards against New Mexico State and 96 yards at Wyoming) rank as the second-most in a single-season in school history, behind Kevin Robinson (three in 2007). In fact, Scarver and Robinson are the only Aggies in school history to have multiple kickoff returns for touchdowns in a single season.\nFor his career, Scarver has three total kickoff returns for touchdowns, which is also second all-time in school history behind Robinson (four from 2004-07). Scarver's career kickoff return average of 28.5 yards is the third-best in Utah State history.\nScarver, just the 10th player in school history to be named a first-team All-American, played in all 13 games for the Aggies in 2018, recording nine catches for 156 yards and one touchdown.

Joel Embiid isn\u2019t a lock to play Game 1: It might\u2019ve just been Sixers general manager Elton Brand playing coy, but given the chance to update Embiid\u2019s status for Game 1, he opted instead to skirt actually answering whether Embiid would play. PhillyVoice\u2019s Kyle Neubeck did a great job of summarizing what Brand said, but this quote gives the general gist: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that he plays this weekend. But it\u2019s a combination of how he feels. I think he\u2019ll present well and he\u2019ll be ready, but you don\u2019t know.\u201d\nEmbiid hasn\u2019t played much since the All-Star Break, only appearing in 10 of 23 games. It was purportedly due to \u201cload management\u201d but if he does miss Game 1 \u2014 which still seems unlikely \u2014 that would mean it was more than that.\nLatest NBA Mock Draft 2019: Zion Williamson to Knicks? Ja Morant or RJ Barrett at No. 2? Sixers get ACC wing? The NCAA Championship Game between Virginia and Texas Tech is over and now attention is turned toward the 2019 NBA Draft. Will the New York Knicks pick Duke's Zion Williamson first? Where will Murray State's Ja Morant, Duke's RJ Barrett and Texas Tech's Jarrett Culver be picked?\nEither way, it\u2019s clear that the Sixers didn\u2019t do a very good job of managing Embiid\u2019s playing time in the first half of the season. He averaged nearly 35 minutes per game in the first 20 of the season, and still was around 33 through the All-Star break. He missed eight games after playing in the All-Star game.\nTo be fair, even in limited time, Embiid has been stellar, averaging 28.8 points, 14.3 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.7 blocks, 1.4 steals and 1.5 3-pointers made per game. He absolutely deserves to be top-5 in the MVP race.\n2. D\u2019Angelo Russell could be a problem: The Sixers have generally done a good job on Russell in four matchups this season, though only one of those games came with Philadelphia\u2019s starting five \u2014 Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and JJ Redick \u2014 fully intact. Both before and after the Harris trade in February, the Sixers have faced significant struggles against opposing point guards.\nCoincidentally, Russell \u2014 an All-Star \u2014 has been playing the best basketball of career at the end of the season, averaging 27.2 points and 8.3 assists per game while shooting 40 percent from three-point range.\nNot to mention, the Nets also have Spencer Dinwiddie on the bench, who scored 31 and 39 points against the Sixers earlier this season.\nOver the last month or so, here\u2019s how some point guards have performed against the Sixers: George Hill (20 points), Trae Young (33 and 32 points), Kyrie Irving (36 points), Collin Sexton (26 points). That\u2019s not a huge sample size, but the Sixers\u2019 most important players have barely played together.\nReally, if Jimmy Butler can play better defensively than he has, he\u2019d be the ideal player to lock down Russell on defense.\n3. Have we met? The Sixers traded for Jimmy Butler on Nov. 12. They traded for Tobias Harris on Feb. 6. It created a starting lineup talented enough to rival any team outside of the Warriors. One problem: They\u2019ve barely played together, just 10 games.\nNow, in those 10 games, the Sixers are 8-2 and the team has a +17.6 net rating with them on the floor together. The talent is undeniable, their readiness to play together in the postseason is less clear.\nThe Sixers shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble against the Nets. It will be a good case study to see where this group is with each other before a much tougher series in the next round, likely against the Toronto Raptors.\nAfter all the trades decimated the Sixers\u2019 bench, the only shot this team has is if the starting five is working together. There\u2019s a good chance Brett Brown significantly shortens the rotation in the postseason by virtue of not having enough good players to even play.\n4. Zhaire Smith\u2019s role: The rookie only made his NBA debut on March 25 after a season-long battle with injury and illness. The Sixers are in such dire straits on their bench that Smith might have to play a key role in the playoffs. It\u2019s clear he still has plenty of development ahead \u2014 understandably \u2014 and is a liability on offense at this point, but he does have elite athleticism and length and might be able to help in spurts on defense.\nWith most everyone rested in the season finale against the Bulls, Smith managed an impressive 17 points on 7 of 13 shooting with four rebounds and five assists while shooting 2 of 5 from three.\nMore of that.\n5. Speaking of the bench ... So, who will actually be part of the rotation after the starting five? Here\u2019s a look at the candidates.\nPG T.J. McConnell: That\u2019s an easy one.\nF Mike Scott: It\u2019s not always pretty but he\u2019s one of the Sixers\u2019 most consistent shooting options and brings some toughness to the proceedings.\nC Boban Marjanovic: The fan favorite has played his role well offensively, especially of late, but he remains a liability on defense. He\u2019ll play as Embiid\u2019s primary backup, though.\nC Jonah Bolden: The rookie has shown some flashes recently as his role as increased. He\u2019s athletic, a developing shooter and probably a better option in most situations than even Boban.\nF Furkan Korkmaz: Korkmaz just returned from injury a few days ago. His shooting will be needed, though he doesn\u2019t help much on defense.\nF Zhaire Smith: We covered Smith extensively above, but it feels like there\u2019s at least a chance he at least plays a small role in the playoffs, something along the lines of Markelle Fultz at the start of last season\u2019s playoffs perhaps. He might not play at all, but with Ennis hurt and Simmons ineffective, Brown might not have a choice.\nF James Ennis: He\u2019s expected to miss another week or two with a quad contusion.\nG/F Jonathon Simmons: He\u2019s played in 18 playoff games, but has been fairly useless since getting acquired from the Magic at the deadline.\nG Shake Milton: Ideally the Sixers won\u2019t have to play the second-round pick at all in the playoffs. If any of the team\u2019s guards \u2014 namely McConnell \u2014 get injured, they won\u2019t have a choice.\nC Amir Johnson: As a veteran and respected leader, he might be the defensive option to replace Marjanovic in the event Embiid misses time. Otherwise it seems unlikely he plays very much.\nC Greg Monroe: In meaningless minutes, Monroe has been fairly effective since being signed. The last two games, averaging 16 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 21 minutes per game. He\u2019s a veteran and can provide some low-post scoring in a pinch, but it still seems unlikely he gets much playing time without an injury to Embiid or Marjanovic.\nF Haywood Highsmith: The two-way player won\u2019t be playing.\nAnd that right there is one of the worst bench units in the postseason.\nPray for good health.\nZack Rosenblatt may be reached at zrosenblatt@njadvancemedia.com.

And he is weak on the border wall as well.\u201d\nAs Varney and MacDonald noted, this isn\u2019t the first time that Francis has commented on political matters, especially when it comes to Trump\u2019s long-promised border wall. During the 2016 presidential election, Francis said it was \u201cnot Christian\u201d for a person to think \u201conly about building walls.\u201d\nTrump responded to that criticism by calling the pope\u2019s remarks \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and warning Francis of an impending ISIS attack, adding that \u201cthe Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Academics have mapped out a network of sanctuaries they say are required to save the world\u2019s oceans, protect wildlife and fight climate breakdown.\nThe study, ahead of a historic vote at the UN, sets out the first detailed plan of how countries can protect over a third of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030, a target scientists and policy makers say is crucial in order to safeguard marine ecosystems and help mitigate the impacts of a rapidly heating world.\n\u201cThe speed at which the high seas have been depleted of some of their most spectacular and iconic wildlife has taken the world by surprise,\u201d said co-author Prof Callum Roberts from the University of York.\n\u201cThis report shows how protected areas could be rolled out across international waters to create a net of protection that will help save species from extinction and help them survive in our fast-changing world.\u201d\nThe campaign to protect to protect 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 was backed by the UK government last year. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, welcomed the report, which is the result of a year-long collaboration between academics at York and Oxford universities and environmental group Greenpeace.\n\u201cFrom climate change to overfishing, the world\u2019s oceans are facing an unprecedented set of challenges,\u201d said Gove. \u201cIt is now more important than ever to take action and ensure our seas are healthy, abundant and resilient. I join Greenpeace in calling for the UK and other countries to work together towards a UN High Seas Treaty that would pave the way to protect at least 30% of the world\u2019s ocean by 2030.\u201d\nExperts say that in addition to a wealth of marine life and complex ecosystems, the high seas \u2013 those waters beyond national boundaries \u2013 play a key role in regulating the earth\u2019s climate, driving the ocean\u2019s biological pump that captures huge amounts of carbon at the surface and stores it in the oceans\u2019 depths. Without this process, they warn the atmosphere would contain 50% more carbon dioxide and become too hot to support human life.\nHowever, in recent decades, oceans have faced growing exploitation from a handful of mainly wealthy nations with intensive fishing and deep seabed mining combining with climate change, acidification and pollution to put marine ecosystems under serious threat \u2013 with potentially devastating consequences for the survival of humanity.\nOur oceans broke heat records in 2018 and the consequences are catastrophic Read more\nThe report breaks global oceans \u2013 which cover almost half the planet \u2013 into 25,000 squares of 100x100 km, and then maps 458 different conservation features including wildlife, habitats and key oceanographic features. Finally academics have modelled hundreds of scenarios for what a planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries, free from harmful human activity, would look like.\nThe move comes as the UN is hammering out the details of a new Global Ocean Treaty \u2013 a legal framework which would allow the creation of high seas ocean sanctuaries. The first of four UN meetings was held in September 2018, and a final decision on the treaty is expected next year.\nReport co-author Prof Alex Rogers, from the University of Oxford, said: \u201cCreating marine reserves is critical to protecting and conserving the diversity of marine life. The report puts forward a credible design for a global network of marine protected areas in the high seas based on knowledge accumulated over years by marine ecologists on the distribution of species, including those threatened with extinction, habitats known to be hotspots of biodiversity and unique ecosystems.\u201d\nSpeaking from negotiations at the UN, Dr Sandra Schoettner from Greenpeace\u2019s global ocean sanctuaries campaignsaid climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and pollution, meant oceans \u201care under threat like never before\u201d.\n\u201cWe urgently need to protect at least a third of our oceans by 2030, and what\u2019s so exciting about this research is that it shows it is entirely possible to design and create a robust, planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis is a blueprint for ocean protection that would safeguard the full spectrum of marine life, help tackle the crisis facing our oceans and enable their recovery.\u201d\nSchoettner said passing a UN Ocean Treaty next year would be a huge step in creating a sustainable planet as long as it has \u201cthe teeth to realise a network of ocean sanctuaries\u201d that were \u201coff-limits to harmful human activities\u201d.\n\u201cThis would give wildlife and habitats space not only to recover but to flourish,\u201d said Schoettner. \u201cOur oceans are in crisis, but all we need is the political will to protect them before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "This spring, and then again this fall, city council will be asked to decide on whether or not to rezone two sections of river valley land from \u201cparkland\u201d to \u201cindustrial,\u201d both changes at the request of Epcor.\nThe fall decision would involve the loss of approximately seven acres to allow Epcor to expand the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant (mostly for parking), even though land is available for expansion outside the city limits. The spring decision, scheduled for June 6, would involve the loss of 99 acres to allow Epcor to construct a solar power plant next to the E.L. Smith Water Treatment Plant in southwest Edmonton. These proposals reflect the \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d urbanist Jane Jacobs described, and they should be rejected.\nOver the past century, Edmonton has worked hard to de-industrialize the river valley. The city closed mines, brickyards and dumps, and resisted proposals for freeway systems and gravel pits. The river valley bylaw (7188) was created in 1985 precisely, as the bylaw itself acknowledges, to protect the river valley against municipal utilities projects:\nAs Edmonton grows and changes and as land becomes more valuable, the river valley may become threatened by industrial and commercial uses, as well as by civic uses such as public utilities. The municipal level of government has probably exerted the greatest development pressure on the river valley with public utility proposals and transportation plans.\nThese uses tend to be incompatible with the aims of nature preservation and parkland development. This (bylaw) begins a process for more effectively managing the future of the river valley and ravine system.\nThe first stated goal of the river valley bylaw is \u201cto ensure preservation of the natural character and environment of the North Saskatchewan River valley and its ravine system.\u201d To support this bylaw, Edmonton zoned most of the river valley land \u2014 whether public or private \u2014 as parkland.\nThe city also created land-use guidelines and sustainability master plans and made biodiversity commitments \u00ad\u2014 all with the goal of respecting the value of our natural heritage. Gradually, we restored the river valley to the \u201cribbon of green\u201d ecological corridor and recreational park system we all love today.\nThe two Epcor rezoning applications represent a major step backward from this achievement. These are precisely the kinds of threats foreseen by the river valley bylaw, and which Edmontonians have pushed back against, again and again, to protect our river valley.\nAs the Save Gold Bar Park group has found, up until 2017 the City of Edmonton had a long-standing plan to develop future wastewater operations at the Alberta Capital Region Facility outside the city; directing wastewater flows to that site makes far more sense than Epcor\u2019s intentions to expand industrial operations and sewage processing in a prime river valley location over the next 50-75 years.\nMeanwhile, the solar-power plant proposal seems disingenuous on multiple levels. Not only did Epcor\u2019s own business case show that it would be less expensive to invest in alternative energy off-site to power its operations, the proposal also disregards solar best practices, which state that habitat alongside rivers is not an appropriate location for solar panels.\nAs conservation organizations, we strongly support the shift to solar energy \u2014 on rooftops and brownfields. Such appropriate placement would prove Epcor\u2019s and the city\u2019s commitment to the environment. Epcor\u2019s plan instead to take over riparian habitat and public parkland disregards the unquantifiable ecological and social value of this land. It also runs against the city\u2019s acknowledgement in The Way We Green that, \u201cin a given year more natural areas are still lost than protected. With biodiversity on the decline around the world and in Edmonton, new tools are needed to achieve the city\u2019s biodiversity commitments.\u201d\nOne new tool is prioritizing environmental value over short-term economic value. The river valley corridor is the most important source of biodiversity in our city.\nWe urge city council to reject both river valley land rezoning proposals and protect our \u201cribbon of green.\u201d Let\u2019s focus our energy instead on further restoration of this incredible asset.\nKristine Kowalchuk writes on behalf of Edmonton River Valley Conservation Coalition.

{"text": "Mortal Kombat has earned a good bit of press as of late, what with the new game coming to all major consoles at the end of the month. We\u2019ve seen more details for Mortal Kombat 11 trickle out almost every few days. But a new, rapid-fire interview with series co-creator and industry legend Ed Boon is probably the biggest jackpot of information we've been granted since the game was first revealed back in December at the Game Awards.\nBoon, a Chicago native who has been an enduring presence in the gaming community for more than 30 years, fielded a series of 166(!) questions from Game Informer that spanned the history of the franchise, his life as a developer and producer, and, perhaps most significantly, some big details about his latest NetherRealm title. From those 166 questions, these are the seven most surprising nuggets that we uncovered from the interview about MK11 and the franchise overall.\nA script for a new Mortal Kombat movie exists.\nCould it be? Though MK has been a force of nature in the gaming world since MK1 premiered back in 1992, there have only been two ventures into the movie business. Though it\u2019s not perfect, the first Mortal Kombat movie is widely recognized as the best video game adaptation in film history. Boon told Game Informer's Ben Hanson that he\u2019s seen a script for a new Mortal Kombat film, and that he'll reject it if it's not good enough. With cinematic universes and superheroes all the rage right now, could we finally be getting a modern day MK: The Movie reboot?\nNeo will not be in MK11\u2014but he could have been in Injustice 2.\nFor many fans, us Mortal Kombat enthusiasts at Esquire included, Keanu Reeves\u2019 iconic Chosen One character in The Matrix seemed like he would have been a perfect fit for the Mortal Kombat universe. But, according to Boon, Neo will not appear in the new game. Strangely enough, though, Boon said the sunglasses- and trenchcoat-clad hacker was considered for NetherRealm\u2019s most recent title, Injustice 2.\nThere will be no Loot Boxes in MK11.\nHooray! Loot Boxes have been a stain on the gaming industry for years now. Although it was reported before, Game Informer got the words straight out the horse\u2019s mouth here: Boon confirmed there will not be any Loot Boxes in the next Mortal Kombat game. This most likely confirms that there won\u2019t be any microtransactions either. Thank god.\nMK11 will run at 60fps on the Nintendo Switch.\nIf there\u2019s anything we know about Nintendo, it\u2019s that third-party games are usually troublesome on its consoles. Lest we forget the horrendous motion-controlled Mortal Kombat: Armageddon on the Wii... When it was announced that MK11 would premiere on the Switch, it seemed clear that sacrifices had been made to get it on that console. According to Boon, frame rate was not one of them. The game will be running in 60fps in the Switch version, and according to Boon, it looks \u201cgreat.\u201d\nEd Boon at the Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo in March. Daniel Boczarski Getty Images\nNo version of the game will be censored\u2014probably.\nMortal Kombat owns the granddaddy of all censorship controversies in video games. The very first game practically forced the industry to adopt a rating system, so having a non-gory version of MK11 is certainly something that has been on fans\u2019 minds, especially since the title will be coming out on the Nintendo Switch. According to Boon, the game will not be censored in any of its various incarnations. That is, so far. Boon didn\u2019t 100-percent confirm that we will never see MK11 censored in some way.\nMortal Kombat 11 amazon.com $59.99 Pre-Order\nBoon wants to make a Marvel vs DC game.\nThis one is really fucking cool. Apparently Boon spoke with Marvel about making a fighting game. He even seemed a bit cautious to release that information, which means something big could be going on. Since NetherRealm is responsible for the Injustice games, which star heroes from the DC Comics universe, Boon certainly proved his skills in bringing superheroes into the fighting game mix. In the Game Informer interview, the iconic developer said himself that he really wants to do a Marvel vs. DC fighting game. Fans around the world are giddy with excitement right now.\nHe's \u201copen\u201d to the idea of cross-play in MK11.\nWith games such as Rocket League and Fortnite blazing new trails with their efforts to join all consoles onto one playing field, having a cross-platform Mortal Kombat certainly seems like a fun idea. According to Boon, cross-play will not be supported at launch\u2014it's hard enough as it is to build an online service fast enough to work for fighting games\u2014but Boon said NetherRealm is \u201copen to it.\u201d The thought of smashing through obsessive PC gamers from the comfort of my bed on my little Nintendo Switch screen is oh-so enticing.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Growing up, there were two flavors of Cheerios to choose from: Plain and Honey Nut. As time went on, the brand began to flesh out its flavors with options like Frosted Cheerios and Multigrain Cheerios (arguably the best flavor and no I will not debate this), and even, um, Protein Cheerios (sure, why not) appearing on store shelves. But the newest variety honestly has us scratching our heads a bit. Introducing: Blueberry Cheerios.\nUnlike other fruity cereals that include freeze-dried or dehydrated berry chunks (think Special K), Blueberry Cheerios are flavored through and through. The purple whole grain oat loops look a little psychedelic, but it\u2019s the blueberry flavor that we\u2019re skeptical of.

What sets this recipe apart is the use of real blueberry puree to flavor and color each bite, and if you\u2019ve ever had the taste-bud-shriveling misfortune of consuming artificial blueberry flavoring, you know that this change up is definitely a good thing.\nBut the only way to be sure if this new cereal is deserving of the hype? Try a bowl. You can pick up boxes of the new Blueberry Cheerios for $3.99, and the flavor is supposed to start rolling out to grocery stores nationwide this week.

{"text": "The possessed Annabelle doll is returning for round three, and this time, she's determined to claim a soul. Annabelle Comes Home might just be the most harrowing addition to the universe yet. I should know, because I heard all the ins and outs during my visit to the set in December 2018. What makes this film so different from the previous spooky entries in the series? Well, it seems like Annabelle will have a full arsenal of evil at her disposal, because the film takes place in the very heart of the Warren household: the fearsome Artifact Room that houses some of the most evil artifacts in the world.\nDuring my trip to the set, I spoke to producer Peter Safran about the exciting addition. Why, now, are we being thrust back into the world of the Warrens? After all, the first two Annabelle films take place long before the Warrens come into the picture. This time, they're appearing in special supporting roles.\n\"We always knew that was a story that we wanted to tell, and we felt that we'd told Annabelle's true origin story,\" Safran told me. \"We liked the opening of The Conjuring with the nurses. So we just thought, 'What happened? Let's start from there. That's at least the origin story of the Warrens and Annabelle.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nYes, Safran confirmed to me that the opening scene of Annabelle Comes Home will be the same as the opening scene in The Conjuring, and then it ramps up from there. So what, exactly, will happen?\nEd and Lorraine decide to take a night off from all their paranormal investigating, and leave their daughter, Judy (McKenna Grace), with a babysitter. In comes said babysitter, aka Mary Ellen, played by Madison Iseman. \"She's been babysitting Judy for a while now and is close to the Warrens,\" Iseman told me. But Judy and Mary Ellen aren't the only two hapless kids in the Warren household on this fateful night. Mary Ellen also brings along her friends, Daniela and Bob (Katie Sarife and Michael Cimino, respectively).\n\"Bob is just like this goofy, shy, nervous kid,\" Cimino told me during my visit. \"He's totally head over heels for Madison's character, Mary Ellen.\" Daniela, on the other hand, is a bit of a troublemaker. \"She's best friends with Mary Ellen, and she's outgoing and outspoken and fun,\" Sarife said.\nSo, now you know the time, the place, and the major players. Where does it all go wrong? Well, somehow, at the beginning of the night, Annabelle gets loose. And that's where the real fun \u2014 I mean trouble \u2014 begins.\nAs you may remember, Annabelle is locked away in a very special case in the Warrens' dangerous artifact room for safe keeping. When she gets unleashed, she begins to \"activate\" the other haunted objects therein. \"We always loved the artifact room,\" Safran said. \"We talked about it earlier: that we had given little tastes of it over the course of the other movies. And so, we always did have it in the back of our mind, what an incredible place to be the central point, the nexus, for a whole movie.\"\nSo here we are, with one manic possessed doll and a whole treasure trove of evil. Naturally, all hell breaks loose. \"The idea of Night at the Museum in the artifact room \u2014 it just felt great,\" Safran continued, \"and it's kind of been that the whole way through just from the script development, storyboards, and prepping the movie. Just every step of the way, we were like, 'This is really an interesting one and it just feels different.'\"\nThere's another interesting reason why this film feels so different than the other ones in the universe: it's all going down in one single night. \"Our film takes place over the course of 24 hours, so that hasn't been done before in this world,\" Iseman told me. \"It's just very different. I'm curious to see how people will react to it.\" Safran also noted the timespan as a pretty great device for the film: \"I think that the pressure of that is something that's interesting and fun if you ratchet up the tension, and you just never take your foot off the gas . . . I love the fact that it's young people. It's kids solving the problem for themselves.\"\nSounds like the Warrens won't be around this time to pick up all the pieces. And with an entire room of objects coming to life in addition to the powerful danger of Annabelle, we imagine we're in for more than just a bumpy ride. We just hope that house is still standing at the end of the night.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Health officials in rural parts of Ontario are bracing to learn how provincial funding cuts to public-health units will affect the services they can offer.\nThe Progressive Conservative government announced in the budget two weeks ago that it would downsize the number of public-health units from 35 to 10. Then last Thursday, Health Ministry officials told public-health representatives from across Ontario that provincial funding for some programs would be cut by as much as 50 per cent, with municipalities left to fund the gap.\nFormal consultations to \u201cmodernize Ontario\u2019s public health units\u201d will begin soon, as the government prepares to \u201cempower municipalities to have a stronger role in the delivery of public health,\u201d Hayley Chazan, a spokeswoman for Health Minister Christine Elliott, said in an e-mail.\nStory continues below advertisement\nBut some officials are worried that municipalities, particularly those in rural areas, will not be able to make up the province\u2019s funding cuts, which could leave important services for vulnerable populations at risk.\n\u201cOur fear is that our municipalities are going to be stuck with paying more, which they can\u2019t afford \u2026 and at the same time, we\u2019ll lose the ability to have localized flavour to deliver our services,\u201d said Paul Roumeliotis, medical officer of health and chief executive of the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, pointing to the smaller population size \u2013 and therefore budgets \u2013 of rural regions.\nDr. Roumeliotis\u2019s health unit represents 250,000 people across 17 municipalities in his area, which he says faces a greater demand for services such as pre- and postnatal care as it has among the highest rates of single mothers in the province.\nSome pockets of the region are also predominantly francophone, requiring bilingual health workers. In addition to budget cuts made on an \u201caggressive timeline,\u201d it\u2019s unclear how the new governance model of fewer public-health units will continue to meet local needs, Dr. Roumeliotis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to disentangle. It\u2019s a complicated, heterogeneous type of set-up in the province.\u201d\nNot all of the boards are structured the same way, with some public-health officials employed by the municipality and others directly by the independent health unit.\nAnother hurdle is that municipal budgets for the year have already been set, said Penny Sutcliffe, a medical officer of health and CEO for the Sudbury and Districts area. Her unit has put a freeze to hiring and non-essential expenditures until the province provides more information about how it will implement its plans.\nThe province is pledging that public-health units in rural communities \u201cwill be protected from any major cost increases,\u201d Ms. Chazan said. \u201cUltimately, the government\u2019s proposed plan will enable a better matching of public health needs with local realities.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nEquitable access to health care in the north, particularly among First Nations populations, is a focus for the Sudbury and Districts unit. Last year, its northern fruit and vegetable program served almost 20,000 students across 86 elementary schools, expanding to seven First Nations schools. The unit also reached hundreds of students on the dangers of opioids and launched a pilot program about mindfulness for middle schoolers.\n\u201cThese [programs] look different in different settings,\u201d Dr. Sutcliffe said, pointing to immunization services as an example of initiatives that are a particular focus for rural-health units because there are not others providing those services like there are in cities.\nWith reports from Jeff Gray\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Fourteen years ago, Savannah Ostler was a student at East Hollywood High School, a charter school in West Valley City, writing a screenplay she believed in.\n\u201cLoosely based\u201d on her life, the screenplay, titled \u201cTwice the Dream,\u201d told the story of two sisters pursuing their dream of becoming musicians, when family tragedy strikes. But as a teenager, Ostler could only take the screenplay so far.\n\u201cEver since then, it's been a roller coaster trying to get it made,\u201d she told the Deseret News. \u201c(I) had so many ups and downs and met a lot of producers that were interested in actually buying the script, but the caveat was (that) I couldn't be a part of it. And at the end of the day, since the script was so personal to me, I just couldn't sell it \u2026 so I decided to make it on my own.\u201d\nOstler, who dreamed of becoming an actress and director from a young age, was finally able to get the funding to make the film on her own terms and get it into theaters. Her beloved script is now a movie that will premiere in select Megaplex Theatres April 19. So for Ostler, it's safe to say \u201cTwice the Dream\u201d is fulfilling at least one dream.\nOstler stars as one of the sisters in the movie, which was filmed in Utah, with the other sister played by former Brigham Young University student Monica Moore Smith.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the sisters' journey and their very strong sense of sisterhood and bond and their pursuit of this musical dream,\u201d Ostler said. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, tragedy strikes that challenges the dream and in the end, (the family realizes) that it was the dream that was holding the family together.\u201d\nThe film's focus on achieving dreams has taken on new meaning for Ostler, whose journey to the big screen was far from straightforward.\n\u201cI remember one night in particular,\u201d Ostler recalled. \u201cI was just waiting tables as a cocktail waitress trying to help us get by and \u2026 we had another financing fall through. \u2026 It felt like the dozenth time, and it just really hit me. \u2026 It was really hard to get really excited, then to be let down, and then get excited again and then let down; it was just kind of like a vicious cycle.\n\u201cI remember being on the phone with my mom and I was bawling,\u201d she continued. \u201cI'm like, \u2018Why is it so hard? I just want to make this movie. We just want to make this movie. Why is it so hard?\u2019 And I remember being really hard on myself, thinking, \u2018Why am I so stupid to think I can actually do this?\u2019 And (my mom said), \u2018Well, can you?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018What are you talking about mom? Of course I can.\u2019\u201d\nDanno Nell Savannah Olsten directs \"Twice the Dream.\"\nThanks to her mother\u2019s tough love, Ostler decided to keep trying to find funding for the film, regardless of the emotional toll it was taking. That persistence proved worthwhile, as moviegoers will now be able to see the story that's been a part of her life for 14 years unfold on the big screen.\nAs far as who she hopes the film will reach? That answer goes back to her days as an aspiring filmmaker at East Hollywood High School.\n\u201cI (hope) ideally, a young tween or teen girl who may be struggling in school, maybe somebody who doesn't have a lot of friends or gets bullied will watch the film,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I was teased for my ambitions of being an actress and director. (People would say), \u2018Oh, you're never going to be it. You're never going to do it.\u2019 Kids (can be) so mean.\n\u201cI would love to show those young, impressionable kids with dreams, that dreams are possible,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt's not going to be easy. It's not going to be a walk in the park. But if I could just ignite that spark, especially in any young person, that would make it all worthwhile.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Image copyright Ellie Smith\nThey are a world away from UK grime - musically speaking - but self-proclaimed 'black feminist sistah punk' band Big Joanie are standing with Stormzy.\nThat's after the grime star cancelled a festival headline appearance in Austria late on last week, claiming members of his team had been racially profiled.\nIn an Instagram story, the rapper claimed his friends were targeted by security at the Snowbombing event, who were acting on reports of a weapon. Organisers responded by saying staff had acted in accordance to protocol.\nSpeaking after their own Record Store Day gig at Rough Trade east, the London-based punk three-piece have nothing but respect for the Glastonbury headliner's decision to walk away.\n\"I think Stormzy made the right decision - a brave decision,\" stand-up drummer Chardine Taylor-Stone tells the BBC.\n\"He could easily have sat quietly and done nothing but he's in a position of power in the industry now to actually make a positive change.\"\nShe adds: \"As people in bands there is an element of privilege being backstage and people don't tend to search you; no-one is searching Led Zeppelin!\n\"They [the festival] seem to think because they're black men playing a certain kind of music that they must be involved, which is absurd.\n\"You hear backstage stories of drugs and throwing televisions out the windows and Motley Crue's mad lifestyle... Would they have been searched? Unlikely.\n\"His people were just minding their own business and working.\"\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Stormzy: Doing his job\nBig Joanie, #72 in our list of Newbie Tuesday artists , consists of Chardine, bass player Estella Adeyeri and singer/guitarist Stephanie Phillips and they released their debut album, Sistahs, in November on Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore's new imprint.\nThe band met on Facebook and made their live debut soon after at First Timers Festival ; a workshop encouraging people from marginalised communities to come together and form bands.\nPhillips suggests that, as an all-black female rock band they've suffered similar treatment to Stormzy's team, while touring their new record in support of Parquet Courts.\n\"We always get searched at airports,\" says the singer, with a dismissive laugh.\n\"There's that thing when we are touring Europe, people staring at us loads and being taken aback by our presence, that was uncomfortable for me.\n\"Because we have a black tour driver as well, we just stood out and I don't think they could figure out what we were doing round there.\"\nWarning: Third party content may contain adverts\n\"We've also had a weird experience at a Bristol Festival,\" she adds, \"where everyone was doing weird cultural appropriation but didn't seem to notice - white dreads everywhere!\n\"Just as I was about to go on stage there was a white girl with a T-shirt that said 'I will never be a slave,' and I was like 'you can't wear that in front of me while I'm playing... take it off - that's not your history.'\n\"She was so scared, she was shaking. But that was just general ignorance and disrespect; just not connecting with who we are as a band or realising there might be some backlash if you're gonna be that stupid.\n\"We let people know that you can't really get away with that kind of thing.\"\n'If anyone needs punk right now it's black people'\nThe frontwoman credits bands like The Breeders and Throwing Muses; as well as 60s girl groups such as The Ronettes, The Crystals and The Supremes as big musical influences however admits that, deep down, she \"always wanted to have a black punk band.\"\nTheir mission is to set about re-writing certain chapters of rock 'n' roll history which, they believe, have been retrospectively whitewashed.\n\"We know our history and play music outside of what is traditionally known as black,\" Phillips explains.\n\"If you look back there's always been black people who have been making things happen and have been at the centre of the scene, playing what we now know as rock 'n' roll, back in the 40s.\n\"Poly Styrene [X-Ray Spex] was making all this radical music in the 70s, so there's always been people who have been integral to moving forward but history is always written by the same person; the same white, middle-class straight men basically who only see their own people and assume that everyone else is just there for fun.\n\"Talking about rebellion and fighting against what's wrong. If anyone needs punk right now it's black people.\"\nWarning: Third party content may contain adverts\nPhillips' band will perform at this year's Great Escape festival in Brighton, following a successful appearance, alongside the likes of Sam Fender, at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas, for BBC Music Introducing .\nWith their brilliantly-bolshy band manifesto, Big Joanie are not attempting to create an uber niche new subgenre of political rock. It simply serves, they say, as an \"honest\" and \"literal\" description of all three members.\nIn other words; what you see is what you get.\n\"The idea with Big Joanie is we're not necessarily performing our black political identity, it's just always there,\" Phillips states, matter-of-factly.\n\"I think when people hear that we're a 'black feminist sistah punk' band they want us to be saying some sort of 'we hate the white man' type rhetoric.\n\"It's just not necessary as we don't really think about it on an everyday basis, we think about what we're going through, our emotions and ourselves.\"\nSistahs is out now and Big Joanie have upcoming gigs in Manchester, London and Brighton\nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .

{"text": "In Part 1 of this series of articles, we introduced the nine types of personality that constitute the Enneagram and invited you to consider what your own number type is. But we also said that the \u201cOdyssey,\u201d through its narrative, reveals the Enneagram numbers as challenges to Odysseus and that in each case he had to overcome it. How he overcomes each number is indicative of how each of us, perhaps, might also overcome our own besetting \u201cdeadly sin.\u201d\nOdysseus encounters the sins in reverse order, so starting at type Nine, we travel round with Odysseus until at last we encounter the sin of type One.\nThus, in this Part 2, we start at the end and look at type Nine. As a reminder, Nines on the Enneagram\u2019s wheel of types see themselves as \u201cI am content.\u201d They wish to experience wholeness and be peaceful people. At their best, Nines are empathetic, reliable, and harmonious; at their worst, they are apathetic, listless, and stubborn, because their deadly sin is what the ancients called acedia\u2014the inability to take effective action. Part of this inactivity is due to their ability to see both sides of a position, and so to fail to choose either.\nThe Nines must overcome the deadly sin of sloth.\nThe Lotus-Eaters\nOdysseus has spent 10 years fighting in Troy and has at last, through his cunning and stratagem of the Trojan Horse, succeeded in overcoming the walls of Troy. What all the direct aggression of Achilles and the other great Greek fighters failed to do, Odysseus managed, because he, as Homer says, is the \u201cman of twists and turns,\u201d and of whom Zeus says, \u201cGreat Odysseus excels all men in wisdom.\u201d\nIt is this sense of resourcefulness, wisdom, and resilience that is the key marker in understanding how Odysseus is able to overcome what appear to be overwhelming odds.\nThe \u201cOdyssey\u201d itself begins in what is called in medias res, or in the thick of things, so that we don\u2019t start at the beginning but in the middle. It is only later, in Chapter 9, that we learn that on leaving Troy, one of Odysseus\u2019s and his crew\u2019s earliest encounters is with the Lotus-Eaters.\nUnlike the traditional enemies that they have met before\u2014typically, kings and soldiers who wish to kill them\u2014the Lotus-Eaters mean them no harm at all. Rather, they offer them the \u201choney-sweet fruit\u201d\u2014the Lotus\u2014that they themselves are eating. This fruit immediately banishes all their worries, concerns, fears, and yes, even their desires. Those of his crew who eat the fruit lose all desire to return to Ithaca, to home.\nIn a way, this temptation is a most brilliant example from the ancient world of what we are almost too familiar with in Western culture: our numbing out.\nInstead of being truly alive, we prefer our drug and drink options, or our sex and gambling obsessions, or even more low-key still, our addictions to TV and today\u2019s net surfing or social-media imbibing (really doing nothing at all), or workaholicism (never stopping the doing of something).\nIn the 1960s, as the West began its long descent into nothingness, Timothy Leary, the American academic, put it this way: \u201cDrop Out\u2014detach yourself from the external social drama which is as dehydrated and ersatz as TV. Turn On\u2014find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body. Go out of your mind. Get high. Tune In\u2014be reborn. Drop back in to express it. Start a new sequence of behavior that reflects your vision.\u201d In short, ignore reality and act as if illusion or delusion were where it would be better to be.\nApathy rules, and one is resigned to life at a low level of nonachievement.\nOvercoming Sloth\nThe deadly sin here, which all Nines must confront if they are to escape it, is sloth. How easy it is for Odysseus\u2019s men to fall for it and to think they have found paradise!\nOdysseus immediately grasps the enormity of the danger he and his crew face and swings into action. Indeed, action here is the key.\nHe does not \u201cexperiment\u201d with the lotus himself; he does not reason, \u201cWell that\u2019s a valid point of view\u201d; and he does not entertain the idea that his men have the right to their own opinions and that he should thereby leave them to it.\nFor one thing, he fully gets the implication of their behavior on himself and all their families awaiting them back in Ithaca. And instead, he issues decisive commands to those of his crew still unaffected and forces them all back to the ships. There, he lashes them into their seats and demands that they row like mad to get off the island.\nThe antidote to sloth is willpower: decision-making driving immediate action\u2014just do it! It is with the clear order to row, even though at this point Odysseus is not even sure to where\u2014only through this expedient\u2014that they can escape the grip of sloth.\nWhat sloth as a deadly sin manifests is the terrible and terrifying idea of a life unlived, a sort of permanent state of being divorced from reality. At perhaps its less extreme level, sloth becomes an acceptance of things as they are: the failure to want to innovate, to improve, whether it be the world or, primarily, oneself.\nIt is a sort of fatalism that saps the will to do, to achieve, and ultimately to succeed in life. And the ultimate success, of course, is to get \u201chome\u201d\u2014for the mind to find its own true soul and so be enraptured by its own beauty.\nThis is what Odysseus cannot forget: In Ithaca, his wife, his soulmate and also symbolically his literal soul, awaits him. No sacrifice must be spared to get there, as we shall see.\nKeep in mind that Odysseus sets off with 12 ships and full crew complements, but all of his men and his ships are lost on the voyage; he alone makes it home. That is why, to be a hero or heroine, we must adapt, as Odysseus did (remember the man of \u201ctwists and turns\u201d?) to each of the deadly sins that besets us.\nIn our next episode, we find Odysseus at number Eight, encountering a deadlier and much more ferocious enemy than sloth: the Cyclops, Polyphemus, and the sin of lust. Here, \u201cjust doing it\u201d would be precisely the wrong strategy to overcome the sin. Read Part 3 to find out how Odysseus twists and turns to overcome its irresistible strength.\nNote that I am strongly indebted for many ideas here to Michael J. Goldberg\u2019s wonderful book, \u201cTravels with Odysseus,\u201d and I strongly recommend it for those seeking more detailed information, although, curiously, Goldberg does not directly draw parallels with the Enneagram and only mentions it in the endnotes of his book.\nIn this multipart series, \u201cFinding the True Self,\u201d we will discuss nine types of personalities, their flaws, and show how Odysseus, through his adventures, overcame them to find his way back home.\nJames Sale is an English businessman and the creator of Motivational Maps, which operates in 14 countries.

{"text": "Spread the love\nDr Moras Urges All To Welcome Jesus With Clean Hearts\nBCCRS Celebrates Palm Sunday\nBengaluru: Archbishop emeritus Dr Bernard Moras called upon the faithful to prepare themselves to welcome Jesus into their hearts in the way Jesus entered Jerusalem temple gloriously.\nDr Moras was the main celebrant at the Palm Sunday celebrations organized by Bangalore Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services (BCCRS) here (in Bangalore) on Sunday, April 14. The curtain came down on the 40-day Lenten observance with intercession, Holy Eucharist in at least five languages, praise & worship, preaching and various other devotional pious practices.\nDr Morais in the homily spoke of the relevance of Palm Sunday including the triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Passion, crucifixion and resurrection.\nPalm Sunday is a commemoration of Jesus\u2019 triumphal entry into Jerusalem, coming in peace and riding on a donkey. Jesus\u2019 entry into Jerusalem coincided with the Jewish festival of Passover. He was met by crowds of followers and supporters who lined the road into the city and waved branches cut from palm trees. They laid palm fronds on the road and even laid down cloaks for Jesus to ride over. This entry into Jerusalem fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies promising that God\u2019s Messiah would enter the holy city and go to the temple.\nPalm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week and it falls on the Sunday before Easter Sunday. Western Christian churches often refer to Palm Sunday as \u2018The Sunday of the Passion\u2019, while Orthodox Christian churches may call the festival \u2018The Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem\u2019.\nDr Bernard Moras said the hardest of sinners come to the feet of Jesus. Everyone has sinned. All should have the awareness and realization that \u2018we are all sinners\u2019. Jesus washed away everyone\u2019s sins. All carried palms and entered the church. Jesus also entered the Jerusalem temple. Jesus may enter the temple at an unexpected time and one might miss him if not present and prepared to meet him. Jesus gloriously entered the temple and \u2018are we ready to welcome Jesus?\u2019 Dr Morais put forth for reflection that 40 days of lent and participation in the celebrations could make Jesus visit the church, families and society. Are we going to shout Hosanna with a sincere heart or are we going to say \u2018crucify him? Are we going to be carried away with what comes our way in fulfilling our wishes and desires?\nIn the year 300, Emperor Constantine granted freedom to Church. He was a good man but not a believer. Though he persecuted the followers of Christ, he issued a decree in which people were asked to choose between their job and Christ. The majority chose their job against Christ. Only one percent gave up the job. The emperor had a soft corner. He pointed out to the majority saying that if they were not faithful to their God, what guarantee they would give to be faithful to the emperor. This incident should help all to be faithful to God and strive towards building the Church. We should learn from the people of that time who said, \u201cWe have only Caesar and nobody else\u201d.\nPalm Sunday church services typically start with a procession of people carrying branches and palms. The palm branch is a symbol of victory, triumph, peace, and eternal life originating in the ancient Near East and the Mediterranean world. The palm was sacred in Mesopotamian religions and in ancient Egypt represented immortality. A palm branch was awarded to victorious athletes in ancient Greece and a palm frond or the tree itself is one of the most common attributes of Victory personified in ancient Rome.\nPalm Sunday is His last journey into the city before His death. Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. This choice of travel is very symbolic as Jesus wanted to show all the people that He came in peace. History shows that when a king rode into a city on a horse, he was entering for war. If a king came into a city on a donkey, he was coming in peace.\nMany people who heard Jesus was arriving in Jerusalem came forward to greet Him. In the Gospel of St. John 12:13, it is written that a great multitude \u201cTook branches of palm trees and went forth to meet Him and cried Hosanna. Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.\u201d Within some religions, it is stated that the palm leaves and robes were placed on the ground in front of Jesus as He entered Jerusalem similar to a \u201cred carpet\u201d greeting.\nThe history of Palm Sunday appears early in the eighth century. \u201cThis Palm Sunday procession and the blessing of palms seems to have originated in the Frankish Kingdom. The earliest mention of these ceremonies is found in the Sacramentary of the Abbey of Bobbio in northern Italy.\u201d After a few years, the celebration of this procession discontinued. What remains today is the blessing of the palms, a procession to the church and the celebration of mass.\nEarlier, DrMoras read out prayers and blessed the palms before people carried the same in procession. Fr Jacob Britto, Spiritual Director, BCCRS, read the relevant scripture and also he read out the Passion reading as part of the liturgy.\nPrayers in different languages were part of the \u2018Prayer of the faithful\u2019.\nBro. Cherian Ramapuram, Chairman, BCCRS, in his vote of thanks expressed gratitude towards DrMoras who started the Lenten prayer programme eight years ago. He thanked Fr John Abraham, parish priest, Ascension Church, who was also concelebrant of the Eucharist besides FrBritto. Bro Cherian, a successful businessman and a preacher himself thanked several priests, different choir, preachers, sister Sunita, Bro Varghese Joseph, vice chairman, the prayer warriors and the task force besides many others and groups that contributed towards the success of the 40-day programme.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Now that seems to be gradually changing, with a new project to create underwater museums. Divers will be able to tour certain shipwrecks and non-divers will experience the sites through virtual reality in information centres on land. Ancient amphoras at the bottom of the sea from a 5th century BC shipwreck. Recreational divers will be able to visit the wreck near the coast of Peristera, Greece. Credit:AP The first of these sites is the Peristera shipwreck, named for the uninhabited Greek island opposite Alonissos where it was discovered in the early 1990s. The cargo ship was laden with thousands of amphoras, or vases, probably containing wine, when it sank in the late 5th century B.C. All that survives is the cargo, the exposed parts of the wooden ship having long since rotted away. But the sight is spectacular.\nThousands of ancient vases, the vast majority intact, lie in layers. Fish, sponges and other sea creatures have made the amphoras their home, adding colour and life to the site. In some places, the cargo towers above divers as they pass along the perimeter of the wreck. \"It is very impressive. Even I, who have been working for years in underwater archaeology, the first time I dived on this wreck I was truly impressed,\" said Dimitris Kourkoumelis, the lead archaeologist on the project preparing the site for visitors. \"It's different to see amphoras ... individually in a museum and different to see them in such concentration.\" Lead archaeologist Dimitris Kourkoumelis dives to the shipwreck. Credit:AP The wreck still holds mysteries. Only a small part has been excavated, and experts have yet to determine how or why it sank, or what other treasures it might have carried beneath the estimated 4,000 amphoras in its hold. There are indications a fire had broken out on board, but it's unclear whether that contributed to its sinking.\n\"Was it a piracy act? Was it overloaded?\" said Elpida Hadjidaki, the first archaeologist to excavate the site. These questions remain unanswered. The Peristera wreck is the largest ship of its time to have been found and its discovery was of major significance to historians. \"Up to then, we thought that large ships that were carrying 1,500 amphoras and were up to 70 tons, they were built by the Romans in the 1st century BC,\" Hadjidaki explained. \"Well, now we have a ship that was not built in the 1st century BC, it was built in the 5th century BC, it carried 4000 amphoras and God knows what else and it's 126 tons.\" Hadjidaki said she is thrilled the wreck is being opened to visitors. Greece has a new project to create underwater museums accessible to visitors. Credit:AP\n\"It's fantastic. Twenty-five years ago, I was the first person that proposed that and people were jumping at me, they thought I was crazy,\" she said. \"Why should we keep it to ourselves? We have to give knowledge to people.\" The first test for guided tours of the wreck, which lies at a depth of about 22-28 meters (72-92 feet), was carried out last weekend with small groups of recreational and professional divers.

Credit:AP A thorough briefing, complete with historical information and the rules of the dive, preceded the short boat ride from the tiny harbor of Steni Valla on Alonissos to the site. On the wreck itself, explanatory signs have been suspended along the perimeter. The initial feedback has been positive.\n\"It was an amazing opportunity ... to dive at last on an ancient wreck,\" said Kostas Menemenoglou, a 39-year-old recreational diver from the central town of Volos. \"It was a fantastic experience. It's really like diving into history.\" Three other shipwrecks in the Pagasitic Gulf in central Greece are also included in the project, which is part of a European Commission-funded BlueMed program, which plans to expand the project to Italy and Croatia. More test dives will be held this summer and next year, with hopes of fully opening the sites to recreational diving in early 2021. \"Accessible archaeological sites are one of the most interesting projects - not just a Greek project but a worldwide project,\" said Kourkoumelis, who noted it has taken a long time to get to the point of allowing visitors to access an ancient wreck. \"It took years. And that's logical, because underwater ancient sites and particularly ancient shipwrecks are exposed ... and fragile,\" he said, noting it was crucial to properly set up the project and the dive conditions, making sure the sites are protected before they can be opened to the public. \"All the conditions must be ensured so that these sites remain safe in the future and for future generations,\" he added.\nAP\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "PARIS \u2014 Investigators sifting through the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris warned of potential weaknesses in the remains of the building Tuesday, as experts said it could take months just to identify the scale of the reconstruction task.\nWhile the building was assessed to be structurally sound overall, pictures showed gaping holes in the roof where the ancient vaulted ceiling had collapsed into the nave.\nFrench Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said experts had identified \u201csome vulnerabilities\u201d in the building, particularly in the roof, much of which has been destroyed, and part of the north transept.\nSome nearby residential properties were evacuated as authorities assess the scale of the damage from the blaze that engulfed the medieval landmark Monday night. Firefighters said it took more than nine hours before the flames were brought under control.\nIt was not immediately known what caused the fire, which began on Monday evening in the attic, according to the Paris Fire Brigade. The cathedral, and its central spire \u2014 an area where the fire was first visible to onlookers \u2014 had been surrounded by scaffolding amid construction work.\nScores of priceless artifacts were rescued from the flames, and will be taken to the Louvre museum for safekeeping.\nParis prosecutors have opened an investigation, but on Tuesday Prosecutor R\u00e9my Heitz said \u201cnothing shows that it\u2019s an intentional act,\u201d and that the start of the fire was \u201clikely accidental.\u201d Heitz also said that the investigation, which is in its early stages, is expected to be a long process.\nLt. Col.Gabriel Plus, a spokesman for the fire brigade, said internal security officers first heard the fire alarm at 6:20 p.m. (12:20 p.m. ET) and began to evacuate the cathedral, even though they didn\u2019t see any sign of fire.\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lochet, a 70-year-old worshiper, said the alarm interrupted a Mass. Lochet said he noticed visitors began to get ushered out but those who had gathered for the service remained and the priest resumed. He said Mass continued until a police officer went up and told the priest, \u201cThis is no joke. You\u2019ve got to get out.\u201d\nTwenty-three minutes later, the fire alarm rang again, Plus said. That\u2019s when the cathedral\u2019s security officers noticed the flames.\nFirefighters were unable to save the cathedral\u2019s 19th century spire, which burned to a blackened shell before toppling as thousands of Parisians who had gathered in the streets watched in horror. Two police officers and a firefighter suffered minor injuries, the brigade said.\nPledge to rebuild\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he wants the cathedral to be rebuilt in five years.\n\u201cWe will rebuild Notre Dame even more beautiful and I want that to be done in the next five years,\u201d Macron said in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday night.\n\u201cThroughout our history, we have built towns, ports, churches. Many have been burnt due to revolutions, wars, due to mankind\u2019s mistakes. Each time we have rebuilt them.\n\u201cThe fire of Notre Dame reminds us that our story never ends. And that we will always have challenges to overcome. What we believe to be indestructible can also be touched,\u201d Macron added.\nAt the scene of the fire on Monday night, Macron had vowed to reconstruct \u201cbecause that is what the French expect, that is what our history merits, and this is our deep destiny.\u201d\nBut Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L\u00e9toff\u00e9, the co-president of a group of French companies specializing in restoring historic buildings, cautioned that full restoration of the Gothic cathedral could take significantly longer \u2014 around \u201c10 to 15 years.\u201d\nHe told reporters earlier Tuesday that the site will need to be secured before any restoration work can take place.\n\u201cThis will require a lot of work since, beyond shoring and reinforcement, it will be necessary to build a scaffolding with an umbrella to be able to cover the entire roof that went missing, to ensure protection against weathering\u201d he added.\nPledges of funding to help the restoration work were flooding in on Tuesday, with more than $700 million in donations from French business leaders and businesses confirmed by Tuesday afternoon.\nThey include a \u20ac200 million ($226 million) donation by the family of French billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault and his LVMH luxury goods group, a \u20ac112.2 million (approximately $126.5) pledge from the French Heritage Foundation, and a \u20ac200 million ($226 million) donation from the Bettencourt Meyers family, L\u2019Or\u00e9al group and the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation.\nVal\u00e9rie Pecresse, president of the \u00cele de France region, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that the region will provide \u20ac10 million ($11.13 million) of emergency aid for Notre Dame, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she would host a fundraising conference at Paris City Hall in the coming weeks.\nFrench Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said it could take months to assess the damage.\nShock and horror\nOn Tuesday, the city was reeling from the aftermath of the blaze. Most French political parties suspended their European election campaigns.\nNathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister and a candidate for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cLa R\u00e9publique en Marche\u201d party, said the party\u2019s campaign would be suspended \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\u201cWe are going through a profound moment of sadness,\u201d Loiseau said in a tweet.\nMany people gathered near the site on Tuesday, paying their respects to a landmark that to Parisians, and to some 13 million visitors each year, is a symbol of the French capital.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s much more than stones, it\u2019s a part of myself that is burning,\u201d Paris resident Sarah Virot, 32, said as she looked up at the charred church in front of her.\nAs the fire raged on Monday night, thousands of Parisians and tourists stood, horrified, in front of the 850-year-old-Gothic masterpiece. Some sang hymns as, a few days before Easter, one of the symbols of French Catholicism burned in front of them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful to see such a symbol disappearing in front of you. It\u2019s been there for so many years and in a few minutes half of it disappeared,\u201d local Thibaud Binetruy said. \u201cParis without Notre Dame, madness.\u201d\nAnother witness, Anne Marie, spoke with tears in her eyes. \u201cIn Paris, it\u2019s a monumental symbol \u2014 every person with different religions are really moved and saddened,\u201d she said. \u201cParis without the cathedral is not Paris anymore.\u201d\nMessages of support and mourning have poured in from around the world. The Vatican said the Holy See learned with \u201cshock and sadness the news of the terrible fire that has devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, symbol of Christianity, in France and in the world.\u201d\nThe fire \u201cgoes beyond Paris,\u201d said the city\u2019s archbishop, Michel Christian Alain Aupetit. \u201cI received a supportive message from the chief rabbi of Paris. Everyone is writing in to share their feelings. This goes beyond Paris. People are reacting worldwide.\u201d\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described the fire as a \u201cdisaster for all humanity,\u201d while London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the British capital \u201cstands in sorrow\u201d with Paris.\n\u201cHeartbreaking scenes of Notre Dame cathedral in flames. London stands in sorrow with Paris today, and in friendship always,\u201d Khan said on Twitter.\nUS President Donald Trump also weighed in, calling it a \u201cterrible, terrible fire.\u201d His suggestions on how to tackle the conflagration were less welcome than his sympathy however. The French Civil Security Agency pushed back against Trump tweeting that \u201cflying water tankers could be used to put it out,\u201d pointing out that dropping water on the ancient church could cause its collapse.\nWorks of art, artifacts saved\nImages of flames engulfing the cathedral \u2014 a UNESCO world heritage site since 1991 and one of Paris\u2019s most popular tourist sites \u2014 were splashed around the globe. But as shocking as the scene appeared, it could have been so much worse.\nIts iconic facade and towers were salvaged, as were a host of invaluable artifacts and works of art stored inside, including the Holy Crown, believed by many to be from the crown of thorns placed on the head of Jesus during the crucifixion, and which the cathedral calls its \u201cmost precious and most venerated relic.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Culture Minister Franck Riester said the most precious works of art including the \u201ccrown of thorns\u201d and the \u201ctunic of Saint Louis\u201d had been moved from Notre Dame and are now being held under security at Paris City Hall. Speaking to reporters, Riester said the rest of the artworks would be moved to the Louvre museum.\nAmong the parts of the church worst affected by the fire was also one of the newest: The spire, which was built in the 19th century. That will have to be rebuilt entirely, as will the far older roof structure, known as \u201cthe forest.\u201d\n\u201cThe framework from the 13th century is called a forest, because it required a forest of trees to build it,\u201d said Patrick Chauvet, the rector of the cathedral. The framework was completely lost in the fire, he added.\nA symbol of France\nNotre Dame\u2019s foundation stone was laid in 1163 by Pope Alexander III, and the cathedral was completed in the 13th century. With its towers, spire, flying buttresses and stained glass, it is both an architectural jewel and a major religious and cultural symbol of France.\nLocated on the Ile de la Cite, a small island in the center of Paris, the cathedral is one of the city\u2019s most popular attractions, drawing an estimated 13 million visitors a year.\nEven as it fell into disrepair over the centuries, it was the site of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s coronation as emperor in 1804. A broad restoration effort was launched in the mid 19th century, partly buoyed by the success of Victor Hugo\u2019s novel \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame\u201d in 1831.\nFresh renovation works were underway before the fire. A small silver lining from the blaze may be that the restored spire and roof will be built to modern standards and better equipped to withstand future fires.\nExperts have pointed to other fires at historical sites, such as that which engulfed the UK\u2019s Windsor Castle in 1992, which were followed by comprehensive restoration projects. Windsor took five years to restore, but is now in a better state than before the blaze.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "news, federal-election,\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has called a May 18 federal election after meeting with the Governor-General in Canberra. In an early meeting on Thursday morning that lasted less than 10 minutes, Mr Morrison asked Sir Peter Cosgrove to dissolve federal parliament, paving the way for Australians to go to the polls. The prime minister left Government House and officially declared the election in a press conference. He and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have been traversing the country over the past week, pitching their economic plans a week after the budget was delivered. He released a video on Wednesday night entitled My Vision for Australia in which he says \"the next 10 years is going to determine people's lives\". Featuring his two young daughters and wife in the video, Mr Morrison promotes the government's policies on hospitals, education and the economy, saying it took the coalition a long time to \"get the country back on track\". The prime minister spent the day in Tasmania on Wednesday talking up his government's record on health. The Labor opposition laid out its health spending priorities in last week's budget reply, promising to make cancer treatments and scans significantly cheaper. Mr Morrison used his trip to the Apple Isle to announce more funding to cut elective surgery waiting lists, and improve maternity services and cancer treatment, especially radiation therapy. He said Labor would be offering \"lies and higher taxes\" while the government had a positive agenda. \"It's about how you keep the economy on track to guarantee the funding for the essential services that Australians rely on, whether it is schools, hospitals, Medicare or any of these things,\" he told reporters. Mr Shorten, who campaigned on the NSW north coast, said voters were ready to dump the government after six years in office. \"For goodness sake, mate, call the election,\" he said. \"We're ready, we've got the policies, I've got a united team, we've got a vision for the future. \"The Australian people actually want to make a choice - six years of instability, three prime ministers, 13 energy policies, enough is enough. Time's up, let's have an election.\" Labor and the coalition have already agreed to a campaign advertising truce over the Easter long weekend and Anzac Day. Opinion polls have Labor ahead by an average 53-47 per cent on a two-party preferred basis which, if translated at the polls, would see Mr Shorten governing with a comfortable majority in the 151-member House of Representatives. Neither major party is expected to win majority control of the Senate, with half of the 76-seat upper house up for grabs. After a national redrawing of seat boundaries, the coalition starts with a notional 73 seats (down from 74) with Labor on 72 (up from 69).

The numbers are similar.\nRemember when fans would gather around their coal stoves on a cold, winter evening and debate whether or not Dak Prescott should average $25 million in his next contract?\nAll valid, but this isn't about drawing a direct line from one contract to the other. The market is escalating quickly. Three years ago Andrew Luck's average of $24.6 million with Indianapolis led all quarterbacks.\nHe no longer ranks in the top seven.\nOakland's Derek Carr averages $25 million. Is Prescott better? Would you rather have the Cowboys quarterback over San Francisco's Jimmy Garoppolo ($27.5 million average) and Minnesota's Kirk Cousins ($28 million average)?\nPrescott has a 32-16 regular-season record since entering the league. He's been to the Pro Bowl twice and is respected in the locker room. He makes plays in the fourth quarter to win games. You might argue he's not a $28 million quarterback, but the market says otherwise. That figure appears to be the baseline in negotiations now that Wilson's extension averages $35 million. With Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, Philadelphia's Carson Wentz and Jared Goff of the LA Rams next on the horizon, the average is only going to go up.\nThere are other factors to keep in mind here. Prescott has been wildly underpaid relative to his performance. Part of his second contract will offset this discrepancy.\nIf you're still of the belief the Cowboys shouldn't fork out this much money for Prescott, if you advocate they dig in their heels, answer this: Who is the more reasonably priced alternative ready to take his place?\nWilson's average dips to $31.4 million when you add the final season of his existing deal. Prescott won't earn as much as the Seattle quarterback, but he'll be in the neighborhood.\nIt now takes $28 million to $30 million just to drive into that neighborhood.\nTwitter: @DavidMooreDMN\n", "label": "human"}

I just want to find a way to better communicate. Please don\u2019t get angry or frustrated or feel like I am trying to attack you because that is not the case.\nThe area I am writing about today is intimate relations. We have talked about them before and I\u2019ve really tried to provide the requested time, space and distance since last summer. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not seen any real improvements in this area. My purpose is not to criticize or cast blame or anything more than to clear the air and understand needs and expectations. We have virtually no sex life. I have been the \u201cinitiator\u201d in every encounter over the last few months. In the past year, you\u2019ve had three, possibly four overnight sleepovers at the homes of various female friends, leaving your husband and small child at home.\nMy bottom line is that I feel like we are roommates who sleep in the same bed and raise a child together. We seem to live our own lives other than that. My weight gain hasn\u2019t helped, and I know that, too.\nAt any rate, regardless of what the answers are, I really need you to be clear and honest with me, with respect to whether you have ever fulfilled your physical needs elsewhere since we got married 14 years ago, or even if you wanted to but didn\u2019t follow through. Have you been thinking about it? If so, and you\u2019ve yet to take action, is this something you want to explore? These questions keep me up at night. We need to talk about these things, no matter what the answers are. -- Mitch\nDear Mitch: While it\u2019s important to have eye-to-eye heart-to-hearts with your spouse, letters can be a great way to broach sensitive subjects that might otherwise arouse defensiveness. The format gives each partner space to organize and communicate his or her thoughts and feelings. So, yes, give your wife this letter, along with a day to herself to read, absorb and articulate a response.\nThat said, this is but one tool. A marriage counselor could equip you with a full kit for rebuilding the channels of communication and repairing the foundation of your marriage. I encourage you to ask your wife to attend. Please let me know how it goes.\nDear Annie: All my life, I focused on my career and nothing else. I\u2019ve lived all over the country and in Europe. I\u2019m also an Army veteran with a lot of memories that will never leave me, including children dying in their mother\u2019s arms. Those memories have shaped me into the person I am today.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images\nHere\u2019s a Trump White House immigration gambit that likely will shock, but not surprise you. The Trump administration, the Washington Post reported Thursday, came up with a cartoonishly villainous plan and then pressured immigration officials to carry out the Trumpian scheme of arresting undocumented migrants coming into the country and then busing them and releasing them on the streets of so-called sanctuary cities. The aim? Retaliation, of course, against political enemies and for not treating undocumented families like criminals.\nThe Trump folks tried to make this plan a reality on multiple occasions over the last six months, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and email messages reviewed by The Post.\nWhite House officials first broached the plan in a Nov. 16 email, asking officials at several agencies whether members of the caravan could be arrested at the border and then bused \u201cto small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities,\u201d places where local authorities have refused to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation\u2026 The attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE, with a top official responding that it was rife with budgetary and liability concerns, and noting that \u201cthere are PR risks as well.\u201d Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller discussed the proposal with ICE, according to two DHS officials. Matthew Albence, who is ICE\u2019s acting deputy director, immediately questioned the proposal in November and later circulated the idea within his agency when it resurfaced in February, seeking the legal review that ultimately doomed the proposal.\n\u201cThis was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,\u201d the White House statement said.

Should Spalletti get the boot, the favourite to take over the reigns at the San Siro is former Chelsea manager Conte. Meanwhile, Inter's star striker Mauro Icardi has been heavily linked with a move away from the Nerazzurri after multiple fall-outs with the club. Reports in Italy suggest that Icardi could be sold and Spalletti potentially also be shown the door in a summer of change.\nConte could then be tasked with the rebuild which, according to La Repubblica, would ideally see Lukaku recruited as Icardi's replacement. New permanent Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains unconvinced that the Belgian striker can cut it at the very top level. He prefers the pace of Marcus Rashford in his chosen system and would conceivably be open to letting Lukaku leave. Icardi also has pace to burn and United chiefs could be interested in engineering a cash plus player deal.\nRomelu Lukaku has been in and out of the team under Solskjaer (Pic: GETTY)\nMauro Icardi could be set to leave Inter Milan this summer (Pic: GETTY)\nThe Argentine striker has an infamously hot South American temprament and was stripped of the Inter captaincy in February.

Over time, they say, it will only worsen the problem.\nAt risk of falling on the chopping block are development programs that work to tackle the root causes driving migration: poverty, inequality, violence and corruption. These include outreach to at-risk youth to combat forced gang recruitment as well as programs to address gender-based violence and support education, workforce development and the uphill fight to root out endemic graft.\n\"It's illogical and it's irresponsible. ... You're talking about long-term challenges that are going to require long-term, sustainable solutions,\" said Adriana Beltr\u00e1n, a Central America specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America. \"So rather than helping to stabilize the situation and try to address these long-term challenges, the cut in assistance will only make the situation worse.\"\n\"Gutting important programs,\" she added, \"will eventually lead to more migration, more insecurity, more corruption, more impunity in these countries.\"\nMueller Report: 10 Instances of Possible Obstruction of Justice by Trump\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election included instances of potential obstruction by President Donald Trump. Here is a rundown of the ten mentioned in the report. (Published Thursday, April 18, 2019)\nIt's still not clear exactly what, when or how much could be cut.\nTrump said last week that \"we were paying them tremendous amounts of money and we're not paying them anymore because they haven't done a thing for us,\" and mentioned a figure of $500 million.\nState Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Tuesday that the amount affected by any aid cut would be $450 million from fiscal year 2018 as well as an as yet undetermined amount from 2017.\n\"The president has made clear that the decision is aimed at securing the United States borders and protecting American citizens,\" Palladino said. \"These programs have not effectively prevented illegal immigration from coming to the United States, and they've not achieved the desired results.\"\nThe aid is meant to promote democracy-building, good governance, trade, agriculture, education, health, public safety and law enforcement. Experts say all of those areas play a direct role in whether people feel they can get by or even survive in their home countries.\nReaction from the three governments has been muted so far, perhaps for fear of angering Trump.\nKey Moments From Barr's Presser Prior to Report Release\nAttorney General William Barr addressed the media prior to his department's release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress. (Published Thursday, April 18, 2019)\nBoth Honduras and El Salvador pointedly said they had not been formally notified of any specific cuts in U.S. aid. Honduran Defense Minister Fredy D\u00edaz said cooperation with the United States on security is \"unchanged,\" while the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the relationship has been \"solid, close and positive.\"\nSalvadoran Vice President Oscar Ortiz said Tuesday that an aid cut would not solve the migration problem but have the opposite effect. \"The best way to tackle the issue of migration ... is not with this type of decision,\" he said. \"The best way to tackle the issue is to keep working together.\"\nGuatemala, the source of much of the recent migration from the region, was particularly circumspect, with presidential spokesman Alfredo Brito saying simply that the official response was not to comment for the time being.\nBut those carrying out the boots-on-the-ground work are concerned.\nRick Jones, who works in El Salvador as the youth and migration policy adviser for Catholic Relief Services, counsels young people to keep them out of gangs and help them get jobs. He also runs behavioral therapy for inmates to deter them from returning to crime \u2014 all things that have \"a positive impact to help guys think about and change their behavior,\" he said.\nIt's seen as unglamorous but badly needed work, especially in a place like El Salvador, which has a homicide rate that is among the world's highest at more than 50 per 100,000 people last year.\nTrump Celebrates Mueller Report as Democrats Plan Next Step\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russia collusion today, but Democrats say this story isn't over and are already talking about their next step. The report, which totals over 400 pages, neither condemns nor exonerates the president. (Published Thursday, April 18, 2019)\nBut all $38 million that Catholic Relief Services gets from U.S. government agencies to run programs in the three countries \u2014 including ones on education and jobs \u2014 could disappear if the cutoff goes through.\nIf that happens, \"it will be sending the message, 'Help is not on the way ... and you're going to be left on your own,'\" Jones said. \"And basically people left on their own are going to be more desperate and more people are going to leave.\"\nLikewise, Vicki Gass, Oxfam America senior policy adviser for Central America and Mexico, said that axing funding for programs that have been running for years, would, in many cases, \"waste U.S. taxpayer dollars that have already been invested\" and \"foster the same instability that is making people flee in the first place.\"\nSome government programs aimed at persuading Central Americans not to emigrate have been put in place, in part in response to Trump's earlier criticism about the migrant caravans that brought thousands trekking toward the U.S. border, and the threatened aid cutoff does not take that into account, officials say.\n\"This goes against what we have seen in reports that show there have really been some decreases in migration, and that they are the result of the efforts being made on this issue,\" said lawmaker Yanci Urbina of the left-leaning FMLN party in El Salvador, the least populated of the three countries and a distant third in terms of how many migrants are heading for the U.S.\nSalvadoran Treasury Minister Nelson Fuentes said U.S. aid in his country includes $20 million in technical and fiscal funding over five years, and the government has not gotten word of any cuts. Another $200 million to spur growth and employment is managed in tandem with the World Bank, and it remains to be seen whether this will be reduced. Finally there are direct donations from Washington to the Salvadoran government and private organizations.\nSchiff: AG Did 'Grave Disservice' to US\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Thursday that Attorney General William Barr \"did a grave disservice to his own country by misrepresenting several parts of the Mueller report.\" (Published Thursday, April 18, 2019)\nFuentes said aid for security and migration could be affected, but that actively funded contracts should not be.\nIn Guatemala, the most significant aid comes in security assistance to fight drug trafficking \u2014 and that has already come under scrutiny recently over questionable use of armored vehicles donated by Washington. Other funds through USAID go to help programs on things like agriculture and education in poor rural communities, plus training for prosecutors, who have waged a high-profile fight against corruption in recent years, or for judges.\nHonduran political analyst Omar Garc\u00eda called U.S. aid to his country \"vital\" and said the threatened cuts show that Washington is \"an unreliable ally for Honduras.\"\nLike Guatemala, Honduras has backed the Trump administration on key issues such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and on the political crisis in Venezuela. It remains to be seen whether such support could waver.\n\"A sense of nationalism is surging in this country ... and that could be a good thing,\" Garc\u00eda said.\nBeltr\u00e1n noted that most of the assistance now in jeopardy does not go directly to the three countries' governments but to agencies, NGOs, church groups and others.\nNadler: Barr Undermined His Own Department to Protect Trump\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-NY, said after the release of the redacted Mueller report that Attorney General William Barr has \u201cshown an unsettling willingness to undermine his own department in order to protect President Trump.\u201d (Published Thursday, April 18, 2019)\nShe predicted that an attempt to cut aid could face pushback in Congress if funds are reprogrammed without lawmakers' consent. Particularly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, members and committees could try to place holds on money in the next funding bill, she said.\n\"It is going to ensue into a battle,\" Beltr\u00e1n said, \"because it is Congress that at the end of the day has the power of the purse.\"\nAssociated Press writers Sonia Perez D., Freddy Cuevas, Matthew Lee, Mark Stevenson and Peter Orsi contributed to this report.\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has advised the general public to be vigilant in order not to fall victim to new tricks deployed by car thieves to dispossess unsuspecting Nigerians of their vehicles.\nThe EFCC's acting spokesperson, Tony Orilade, in a statement yesterday in Abuja said the alert was borne out of shocking discoveries made during investigations into the allegations of crime leveled against one Babatunde Oluwatope Oni (a.k.a Olu Daniel, Oni Daniel Oluwatope).\nAccording to Orilade, Babatunde, who hails from Odo Eri, Yagba West Local Government Area of Kogi State, was recently arrested by the Ibadan zonal office of the commission for alleged conspiracy, stealing and issuance of dud cheque following a petition received from one Kamoru Yekini on November 21, 2018.\n\"It was alleged that on October 16, 2018, two men approached him at his shop at Iwo town, Osun State, to indicate interest in purchasing a 2006 Toyota Matrix car he displayed for sale. After negotiation on the price, the two parties agreed on N1,580,000, and a post-dated First Bank cheque was issued supposedly to cover the cost. The cheque bore the name Rabiu Bamidele Lateef as the account owner.\n\"But, in order to veil his criminal intention, Babatunde allegedly acted as a driver to the other suspect (now at large), with whom he came for the negotiation. The other man falsely introduced himself as the account owner and a doctor at Bowen University, Iwo.\"Having agreed on the price, Bamidele left the scene to 'deposit' the money and later came with a copy of the deposit slip as an evidence of payment of the agreed sum.\n\"Though not comfortable with the payment arrangement, the car dealer still reluctantly released the vehicle and the custom duty papers, hoping that he would contact the 'buyer' through his phone number should any issue arise.\"It was until the following day that he got a call from his bank that the cheque has been returned unpaid due to insufficient funds. All efforts he made to get the suspects proved abortive since all the information given turned out to be false.\n\"That led him to petition the EFCC for assistance. The commission swung into action on receipt of the complaint and recovered the car in Abuja where it was already sold to a lady for N1,800,000. \"Further investigations tracked the car back to Babatunde, who was later arrested in his hideout in Abuja. While Babatunde was already in the EFCC's custody, another complainant surfaced with a similar issue.\n\"According to the complainant, on September 7, 2018, two men came to his filling station around Mokola, Ibadan, Oyo State, to negotiate for a 2007 Toyota Avensis car he displayed.\"He alleged that after the negotiation, they agreed for N2,000,000. Again, Bamidele immediately issued a cheque of N2 million, purportedly as payment for the car.\n\"Just as he did in the other case, Babatunde, again acted as the driver to a 'big man' he came with. He also took the cheque to the seller's bank to 'deposit' the sum, and came back with a deposit slip.\"While they were already testing the car, the car dealer told the suspects to hold on for him to confirm the status of the deposit from his account officer.\n\"But before he could do that, Bamidele and his partner zoomed off with the car since the car keys and papers had already been handed over to them. The cheque with which he made the 'payment' was later returned unpaid and all efforts made to contact the men proved abortive.\n\"Investigation by the EFCC revealed that Babatunde's modus operandi was to issue cheques to car dealers and leave with the car. Such cheques were either stolen from unsuspecting Nigerians or are linked to unfunded accounts. For instance, the cheque bearing the name of Rabiu Bamidele Lateef issued in the first case was stolen, as the owner, a pastor, had made statement to the commission to deny knowledge of issuance of his cheque for the said transaction.\"\n\"Apart from stealing people's cheques and issuing dud cheques to commit acts of fraud, investigations also show that Bamidele often uses fictitious names in some of his criminal transactions.\"When asked about the identities of his accomplices in the operations, Bamidele gave the name of one Santar Ademola, who, he alleged, was late at the time of his arrest.\n\"The suspect appears to be a serial car thief as further investigations revealed that sometimes in 2017, he was prosecuted by a sister agency for similar offence.

I know how he thinks.\u201d\nEl Chapo was convicted in Brooklyn federal court in February on all counts related to drug trafficking, and Donovan is clearly proud of having helped bring him to justice.\nOn one wall of his Chelsea office, framed photos from the mission are arranged alongside the sand-colored Mexican prison T-shirt the ruthless drug dealer wore when he was extradited to the US in January 2017. The shirt is folded to show El Chapo\u2019s prison number \u2014 3912 \u2014 written in magic marker.\nUnder it is a quote attributed to Genghis Khan: \u201cOne arrow alone can be easily broken, but many arrows are indestructible.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a collective operational mission,\u201d said Donovan, who has Irish and \u00adPuerto Rican roots and grew up in The Bronx.\nHe graduated from St. John\u2019s University in 1993 with a degree in criminal justice and began his career as a US Border Patrol agent in San Diego in 1995.\nTwo years later, he became a special agent with the DEA\u2019s New York Drug Task Force, the largest and oldest in the US.\nNow Donovan is focused on what he called his greatest challenge: Ending the explosion of thousands of kilos of heroin and fentanyl in the city.\nHe knows the opioid trade well. He was one of the original managers of a DEA task force that investigated the trafficking of heroin and fentanyl across the country and the world.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, there was a 273 percent increase in the seizure of fentanyl, he said.\n\u201cOur number one priority at DEA is to save lives,\u201d said Donovan, who oversees the work of 1,100 agents across the state. \u201cMy people are focused on heroin and fentanyl, which is killing Americans.\u201d\nSome of the fentanyl arrives in courier packages from China, where many of the chemicals used in the manufacture of the synthetic opioids originate. Both fentanyl and heroin also make their way to the city in tractor-trailers and rental cars, Donovan said.\nSynthetic opioids are also manufactured by Mexican drug gangs, like the Sinaloa cartel, and shipped to New York, where they are distributed by Chinese and Dominican gangs working mostly in Flushing and Brooklyn, he said.\n\u201cChinese criminal gangs have these strong connections to the Mexican cartels going back to the 1980s,\u201d Donovan said.\nWhile the illicit drugs that stream across southern border have changed since Donovan began his career as a Border Patrol guard in the 1990s, New York remains one of the biggest drug markets in the world.\n\u201cWe need to end the flow of drugs before it kills a lot more people,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In the cliched shorthand of Brexit, it is five minutes to midnight, again. Britain is due to leave the EU at 11pm on Friday, unless Theresa May can pull off another extension when she meets European leaders today.\nDiscussions between the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn had failed, at the time of writing, to produce a breakthrough, though it was encouraging that the pair were still talking.\nBut if the PM does ever reach an agreement with the Labour leader, her own MPs are almost certain to find it unacceptable.\nAhead of the emergency summit in Brussels, May was seeing French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris and Berlin.\nIn another move, a bill brought by the Labour backbench MP Yvette Cooper, passed in the Commons on Monday, forces the PM to request a Brexit extension rather than leave without a deal.\nEuropean elections are looming and it is looking increasingly likely that Britons will face a ballot for a parliament in which it has already voted not to participate.\nBritish politics, as they continue to revolve around European withdrawal, are in crisis mode and our democracy is being tested to its limits, on the domestic and international stage. This, for good or bad, is the real world.\nMeanwhile, on another planet, somewhere in Scotland, the Green Party has just emerged from its annual get together.\nIn many parts of Britain, a Green gathering is a relatively benign event, where plans are advanced for a citizens\u2019 democracy, zero growth and a car-free future.\nPeople who don\u2019t much like any of the mainstream parties \u2013 and their number must have grown recently \u2013 often opt for the Green Party as the least offensive alternative.\nIn Scotland, however, the Greens represent a far more radical constituency. They have harnessed themselves to the independence movement and evolved into the most bellicose proponents of separation at all costs.\nAs they only secured 3.6% of the vote at the last Scottish elections, and six seats in Holyrood, their demands should be easy to dismiss.\nYet thanks to the current parliamentary arithmetic, whereby the SNP no longer have an overall majority, the Greens hold the balance of power \u2013 but it is power without responsibility.\nOver the weekend, Patrick Harvie, Scottish Green co-convenor, said Nicola Sturgeon was missing an opportunity in delaying a second referendum on independence.\n\u201cIf we leave it even a few months longer we will have run out of time,\u201d he urged, while his co-leader, Maggie Chapman, called for a Catalonia-style \u201cwildcat\u201d plebiscite orchestrated by Holyrood without Westminster\u2019s permission.\nNo doubt Green activists attending the conference were whipped into a state of frenzied excitement at the prospect of direct action, but outside, on earth, the people are less enthusiastic.\nA recent poll commissioned by a nationalist think-tank Progress Scotland found that support for independence had dropped below 40% for the first time in five years to 30%, with 52% preferring to stay in the UK.\nAgainst the backdrop of Brexit, this must be deeply depressing for Sturgeon, who had hoped to enlist europhile Scottish voters to her cause by now.\nShe understands the numbers though, and has said before that she won\u2019t seek a new independence vote until there is clear and consistent evidence that a majority of Scots want to break up the union.\nThis change in public opinion is still a distant dream and Sturgeon has had to manage the expectations of her more naive grassroots, who clamour for a re-run of 2014 without any thought of the repercussions.\nAmong the Greens, it is the leadership that clamours the loudest because they have nothing to lose in the event of a second, inevitable defeat.\nHarvie and his cohorts were convenient partners for the SNP when the Yes campaign was in full flow, but they have become a menace, making unreasonable claims on government and threatening to withdraw their small, but vital (to the SNP) block vote if they don\u2019t get their way.\nIn beating the drum for Indyref2 when there is obviously no desire in the country for a divisive repeat vote, Harvie displays as much contempt for the electorate as for his political allies.\nHis is a party that appeals mostly to the eco conscious middle classes, who throw away their second vote on a Green candidate to offset their air miles.\nHarvie\u2019s grandstanding does not reflect the wishes of ordinary working people, who are more concerned with the smooth running of their public services than a call to arms.\nWe must conclude, then, that in trying to stir up passions for a poll they can\u2019t win, the Greens, under Harvie\u2019s influence, relish the confrontation more than its consequences.\nIs that what a party founded on peaceful ecological principles is now about in Scotland?\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Share:\nWASHINGTON-NASA has made it clear they want astronauts back on the Moon in 2024, and now, they are zeroing in on the Red Planet -- the US space agency confirmed that it wants humans to reach Mars by 2033.\nJim Bridenstine, NASA\u00b4s administrator, said Tuesday that in order to achieve that goal, other parts of the program -- including a lunar landing -- need to move forward more quickly.\n\u201cWe want to achieve a Mars landing in 2033,\u201d Bridenstine told lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cWe can move up the Mars landing by moving up the Moon landing. The Moon is the proving ground,\u201d added the former Republican congressman, who was appointed by President Donald Trump.\nNASA is racing to enact the plans of Trump, who dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to announce that the timetable for once again putting man on the Moon had been cut by four years to 2024. The new date is politically significant: it would be the final year in Trump\u00b4s eventual second term at the White House. Many experts and lawmakers are concerned that NASA cannot make the deadline, especially given the major delays in development of its new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System, which is being built by aerospace giant Boeing.\nAny mission to Mars would take at least two years, given the distance to be traveled. Getting there alone would take six months, as opposed to the three days needed to reach the Moon.\nA round trip to Mars can only take place when the Red Planet is positioned on the same side of the Sun as Earth -- that occurs about every 26 months, so the dates are 2031, 2033, and so on.\nIn 2017, a NASA budget bill set 2033 as the target date for the first manned mission to Mars, but NASA itself has talked about the \u201c2030s\u201d in its roadmap.\nNASA wants to learn how to extract and use the tons of ice at the Moon\u00b4s south pole. \u201cWater ice represents air to breathe, it represents water to drink, it represents fuel,\u201d Bridenstine said.\n\u201cThe intent of course is to not just get humans to the surface of the Moon but prove that we can live and work on another world.\u201d Democratic lawmaker Eddie Bernice Johnson, the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, asked Bridenstine to put a price tag on the new schedule.\nThe NASA chief said he would make his updated budget request by April 15.\n", "label": "human"}

He was 33.\nPolice said Hussle was one of three men shot Sunday outside Marathon Clothing, his store in South Los Angeles; the other two were in stable condition. A large crowd gathered outside the store as night fell. Detectives were canvassing the area for witnesses and looking to see if any surveillance video captured the shooting, police Lt. Chris Ramirez said.\nHussle, who had two children and was engaged to actress Lauren London, was an Eritrean-American whose real name was Ermias Asghedom.\nA large crowd of fans and residents gathered behind police lines as night fell. Detectives were canvassing the area for witnesses and looking to see if any surveillance video captured the incident, police Lt.

Hussle said he got involved in street life as he tried to support himself, and he joined the gang Rollin 60\u2019s Neighborhood Crips as a teenager.\n\u201cThe culture of my area is the gang culture \u2026 so by being outside, being involved with hustling, being in the hood, doing things to try to get money, being young, you know riding your bike through the hood, getting shot at, your loved ones and homies that\u2019s your age getting killed, getting shot at \u2026 it\u2019s like, we were just raised like if you with me and something goes now, I\u2019m in it, whether I\u2019m from the (expletive) or not,\u201d he said in a 2014 interview with VladTV. \u201cSo after a while it just be like you always in the middle of some (expletive), you might as well, you know what I mean \u2026 be part of it. Or don\u2019t be a part of it and get the (expletive) out the way.\u201d\nWatching Nipsey inspired me to invest and own in our communities. He was a solid man who loved his woman, his family and his community. This hurts. \u2014 Issa Rae (@IssaRae) April 1, 2019\nMusic eventually happened for Hussle. The proud West Coast rapper released a number of successful mixtapes that he sold out of the trunk of his car, helping him create a buzz and gain respect from rap purists and his peers. In 2010 he placed on hip-hop magazine XXL\u2019s \u201cFreshman Class of 2010\u201d \u2014 a coveted list for up-and-coming hip-hop acts \u2014 alongside J. Cole Big Sean, Wiz Khalifa, Jay Rock and others.\nHussle continued to build more hype for himself, and Jay-Z even bought 100 copies of Hussle\u2019s 2013 mixtape \u201cCrenshaw\u201d for $100 each, sending the budding rapper a $10,000 check.\nBut Hussle, who was once signed to Sony\u2019s Epic Records, hit a new peak with \u201cVictory Lap,\u201d his critically acclaimed major-label debut album on Atlantic Records that made several best-of lists last year, from Billboard magazine to Complex. The album debuted at No. 4 on Billboard\u2019s 200 albums charts and featured collaborations with Kendrick Lamar, Diddy, CeeLo Green and more.\nYou were about something..positive and for your community in every chance you had to speak..and because of that You inspired millions..millions who will uphold your legacy forever. rest amongst the stars. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe https://t.co/7gZ795wcQT \u2014 Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) April 1, 2019\nAt this year\u2019s Grammy Awards, \u201cVictory Lap\u201d was one of five nominees for best rap album in a year that hip-hop dominated the pop charts and streaming services and a number of top stars released projects, including Drake, Eminem and Kanye West. Cardi B\u2019s \u201cInvasion of Privacy\u201d won the honour last month, while the other nominees were Travis Scott, Pusha T and Mac Miller.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my debut album so for my first one (to be nominated) out the gate, it\u2019s like, it was overwhelming a little bit. It was \u2026 inspiring, humbling,\u201d he said in an interview with the Recording Academy on the 2019 Grammys red carpet.\nHussle attended the Grammys with his daughter. The rapper was engaged to actress Lauren London.\nThe world mourned his death on social media Sunday. NBA star Steph Curry tweeted, \u201cGod please cover and restore @NipseyHussle right now!!!\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t make any sense! My spirit is shaken by this!

{"text": "TORONTO \u2014 After two different games to open the series on home ice, Monday night\u2019s Game 3 in Toronto took on a life of its own.\nThe Bruins trailed to start the game for the first time all series, and though they came back once, failed to get the equalizer in the third period and fell to the Maple Leafs, 3-2, to go down 2-1 in the series.\n\u201cIt was a good first period, there was physicality on both sides, they came out skating hard,\u201d Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. \u201cThey won more pucks than us. We got through it, took a few penalties we weren\u2019t able to kill. That was the difference in the game. Had a chance to clear one, they kept it in, the other one we were a little aggressive down low and they were able to finish.\u201d\nUnlike Game 2 when the Bruins came out playing physical with purpose, they lacked some energy early, allowing the Maple Leafs to feed off of the home crowd. Though the Bruins tied it, Toronto took advantage of a weaker, shorthanded defensive effort, with several of the Bruins blueliners caught watching plays on the final two Maple Leafs power play goals.\n\u201cThe first goal I think is one we kind of stopped playing,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cTheir fourth line had a real good shift for them, real hard on the puck, we didn\u2019t get it out when we had a chance. I don\u2019t know if we stopped playing but allowed them to stand firm to the net, didn\u2019t clear it out, then I don\u2019t know if Tuukka (Rask) lost it, but a one-goal game it could be the difference in the game.\u201d\nGame 2 featured an intensity the Bruins held throughout the game, with Toronto losing its composure and ultimately losing Nazem Kadri for the series with his suspension.\nWithout that same energy Monday night, the Bruins never really got going.\nBoth games in Boston resulted in a quick goal from the Bruins side, but it took until the 2:38 mark of the second period for the Leafs to reach the scoreboard in Game 3 and take the lead.\nTrevor Moore pushed a loose puck to Rask\u2019s right past him from the edge of the goalmouth to give the Leafs a 1-0 lead for the first time in the series.\nThe Bruins quickly responded, with Karson Kuhlman deflecting the puck off Jake DeBrusk, who whiffed on a shot but it bounced to David Krejci for a 1-1 game just 52 seconds later.\nThe deadlock didn\u2019t last long.\nDavid Backes went to the box for a high stick with 10:00 to go in the frame, and 12 seconds later, Auston Matthews potted his first goal of the postseason.\nRask suffered a scare earlier in the period. With 14:56 to go, John Tavares was left open right under the slot and as he went toward net, his shot was stopped but Charlie McAvoy collided with him right into Rask. The Bruins goalie stayed down for a moment but remained in the game.\nMatt Grzelcyk was whistled for a hook with 4:01 to go in the period, and Andreas Johnsson capitalized with his second goal of the postseason. Brandon Carlo and Steven Kampfer were caught behind the net, and Tavares slid the puck to an open Johnsson, who put the Leafs ahead 3-1 with 2:48 to play in the middle frame.\nThe Bruins weren\u2019t ready to give in yet, though.\nA late Jake Muzzin holding call gave the Bruins the chance to score a power play goal of their own. Grzelcyk shot wide from the point, and Danton Heinen got a stick on it before Charlie Coyle put it underneath the crossbar for his second goal of the playoffs with 37 seconds left in the period.\nUltimately, that\u2019s as close as they would get.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was much different (from the first two games),\u201d Krejci said. \u201cThere are some positives we can take from this game. We didn\u2019t give them many offensive chances, we kept them to the outside. \u2026 All three goals from the crease, those are tough ones, but we kept them to the outside. But at the same time, we have to find the offense here, especially when down a goal.\u201d\nNikita Zaitsev gave the Bruins a power play just five minutes into the third, flipping the puck out of the Leafs defensive zone into the crowd, but the B\u2019s power play looked out of sync and they couldn\u2019t tie the game.\nOnce again, the top line was held in check. The Brad Marchand-David Pastrnak-Patrice Bergeron trio combined for six shots on goal, but couldn\u2019t get past the struggles they\u2019ve had all series.\nGame 4 is Wednesday night in Toronto before shifting back to Boston for Game 5 on Friday.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "America\u2019s war on the world continues to escalate. The arrogance of mad emperor Trump and his minions seemingly knows no bounds. The cowardice and insanity of the \u201cresistance\u201d is revealed yet again in their support for Trump\u2019s plot to destroy Venezuela. Fake socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made laughingstocks of themselves by supporting the coup in words that made clear they were either shameless liars or completely ignorant of the history of America\u2019s centuries long war on Latin America.\nThis history extends from the time of the Monroe Doctrine, through the endless invasions and coups of the 19th and early 20th century. To the more recent history of coups followed by bloodbaths as in Guatemala, Chile, and many more countries culminating in Operation Condor and related schemes to rule all of Latin America through torture terror and assassination. The United States has brought untold misery and horror to it\u2019s neighbors. But even in those dark times when hundreds of thousands were murdered, raped, tortured and the vast majority of hundreds of millions more were kept in crushing poverty and misery America did not claim the right to appoint the presidents of the nations in it\u2019s \u201cbackyard\u201d. Instead it overthrew them in secret. It is even more alarming since for 70 years nearly the entire world has been absorbed by the American empire the whole world is now \u201cAmerica\u2019s Backyard\u201d as they mockingly refer to Latin America how many more countries will have fake governments appointed for them as an excuse for America to seize their assets?\nThe people of Venezuela are no longer fighting just for the future of socialism in their country. They are not only fighting for the liberation of Latin America from the tyranny of the American Empire. They are now battling for the freedom of the entire world. Mad Emperor Trump has already extended the principle by giving Syria\u2019s Golan Heights to Israel which has been illegally occupied by Israel since 1967. In addition to torturing and imprisoning the local population Israel used the Golan Heights to funnel terrorists into Syria. America like Israel is a rogue state in violation of international law and acting in defiance of the whole world and even of it\u2019s own agreements.\nVenezuela has faced a seemingly endless series of coup plots since Hugo Chavez came to power 20 years ago. Nothing so enrages the empire as the attempt to improve the lives of ones\u2019 people. The Bolivarian revolution provided the people of Venezuela with housing, healthcare, subsidized food, cheap fuel and perhaps most importantly a chance to shape their own destinies. For the first time Venezuela\u2019s poor were free to hold their heads up with pride, they were mobilized to demand a better future and were empowered by Venezuela\u2019s brand of direct democracy. It was the people of Venezuela not a bunch of slave owning imperialists who wrote their new constitution.\nIn response to US attempts to launch a coup or plunge the nation into a CIA backed civil war President Nicolas Maduro called on the people of Venezuela to once more rewrite their constitution to enable them to meet these new threats. Venezuela began to recover to the horror of the empire and last year Nicolas Maduro won the Presidential election yet again. The opposition had so thoroughly discredited itself that America ordered it\u2019s pawns to boycott the elections since they stood no chance. The empire has responded to this turn of events by redoubling it\u2019s efforts. Last fall it attempted to assassinate President Maduro with a drone bomb utilizing it\u2019s Colombian and Venezuelan proxies. It was yet another insane precedent as if it\u2019s criminal global torture and assassination program was not bad enough (90% of it\u2019s victims being innocent civilians) now the US claims the right to openly assassinate any head of state that does not bow to it\u2019s will.\nWhen that didn\u2019t work convicted criminal Elliott Abrams was brought in to design a full on covert war against Venezuela. Abrams became infamous in the 1980\u2019s for his attempt to cover up the brutal dirty wars the US was fighting in El Salvador and Guatemala in defense of fascist regimes that murdered, raped and tortured their people.\nAll so that american corporations would have cheap labor and access to the regions rich natural resources. 70-80,000 were killed in El Salvador 100,000 people were killed in Guatemala during the Reagan era. Elliott Abrams job was to turn truth on it\u2019s head claiming that the human rights situation was gradually improving while it was actually growing steadily worse. When anyone in the press dared to expose the slaughter Elliott Abrams would try to get them fired or would try to discredit them with blatant lies. Abrams work in the 1980\u2019s played no small part in forever destroying mainstream investigative journalism ruining the careers of Raymond Bonner who exposed the El Mozote massacre.\nEl Mozote where El Salvadoran troops trained by the US killed 1,200 people on orders \u201cto kill anything that moves.\u201d The same strategy the US had used in Vietnam, Korea, Greece and other countries. He was also involved with smuggling weapons in to the Contras and drugs out with his good friend Oliver North. Convicted of lying to Congress during the Iran/Contra affair when he denied soliciting funds for the contras but was revealed to have personally asked the Sultan of Brunei for 10 million dollars which mysteriously disappeared. He was pardoned by Iran/Contra mastermind then President George H.W Bush. He floated around Academia and think tank land working for the CFR and PNAC where he lobbied for the Iraq war during the 90\u2019s. After George W. Bush stole the 2000 elections Elliott Abrams was once again back in government. In the brutal Iraq war the \u201cEl Salvador option\u201d was employed brutal death squads were trained by Abrams colleagues from Central America in the 1980\u2019s and Iraqis faced a campaign of torture and assassination. Abrams launched coups in Venezuela and Haiti. In Venezuela however the people rose up flooding the streets demanding the return of Hugo Chavez. Haiti was not so lucky in 2004 President Jean Bertrand Aristide was kidnapped by the US military and since then Haiti has been ruled by a succession of corrupt puppets.\nHaiti and Venezuela are far more interconnected then most people realize. It was Haiti which was the site of the first anti-imperialist revolution and had defeated the French, British, and Spanish empires after Haiti\u2019s slaves rose up and liberated their country. Haiti supplied weapons, ships, troops and advisers to Simon Bolivar \u201cthe Liberator\u201d who sought to liberate and unite Latin America. In exchange for this invaluable assistance Bolivar promised to abolish slavery. Simon Bolivar would be the inspiration for Hugo Chavez\u2019s Bolivarian revolution who for a time came close to realizing Bolivar\u2019s dream of a united and liberated Latin America.\nChavez\u2019s vision embraced not just Latin America but the islands of the Caribbean like Cuba and Haiti which Venezuela hoped to help unite and develop. In truth Chavez\u2019s vision embraced the whole world and one could write a whole book on his work to support Iraq, Libya, Palestine, and Syria. However returning to Haiti America had invaded and occupied the island shortly before WW1 and later installed brutal father and son military dictators Francois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier and Jean Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier who ruled through torture assassination and death squads a familiar pattern. Incidentally at the same time America invaded Nicaragua in an attempt to capture the revolutionary General August Sandino who would later inspire the Sandinistas to overthrow Nicaragua\u2019s version of the Duvalier family the Somozas.\nThe same Sandinistas Elliott Abrams was waging covert war on in the 1980\u2019s and which america targeted with a failed coup attempt last year. Aristide in Haiti would come to power through elections not a revolution but America would still target him with two coups and unleash death squads to massacre his supporters. The latest episode occurred last October through November 2018 in the Lasalin neighborhood 231 people were killed over a month long period with most killed on November 13 2018. Lasalin which has been targeted with a half a dozen of these massacres since the 1950\u2019s the last following the 2004 coup against Aristide masterminded by Elliott Abrams. The massacre was in revenge for the massive uprising against President Juvenal Moise who the US helped steal the 2017 election through massive fraud and vote suppression causing people to rise up in 2017 as well. On July 6 2018 the people rose up again to protest fuel price hikes and demand Moise\u2019s resignation.\nIn revenge the people of Lasalin were massacred. The US and UN are waging a brutal dirty war on Haiti training police to torture and murder and bringing in shadowy mercenaries to help their Haitian death squads suppress a revolution. Now the people of Haiti are rising up again in response to the theft of 3.8 billion in petrocaribe funds that Venezuela had given to their impoverished country. In response the US has been ordering it\u2019s haitian proxies to wage a terror campaign on the people of Haiti. The world must demand an end to the UN occupation of Haiti and the looting of the country by American and Canadian businessmen.\nReturning to Venezuela with the failure to Assassinate Maduro and the installation of infamous war criminal Elliott Abrams a plan was hatched to wage everything short of full scale war on Venezuela. A media war, an economic war and an escalation of the covert war using Colombian death squads and Venezuelan fascists to murder loyal Venezuelans. A war of sanctions that seek to strangle the country and prevent it from selling it\u2019s oil. On January 23 the US declared a parliament member who had not even run in the election Juan Guaido as the President of Venezuela convincing a dozen countries to go along with the farce and ignoring the rest of the world who refused to support this latest outrage. They had been grooming Guaido for years through various CIA/NED funded NGO\u2019s. The vast majority of Venezuelans completely rejected this american appointed puppet nor did the military commit treason by backing Guaido. However by pretending Guaido was president the US now had an excuse to seize CITGO the Venezuelan state owned oil company in the US with assets worth 30 billion. After robbing the people of Venezuela the US now offered them charity in the form of \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d which included equipment the opposition has used to murder their fellow Venezuelans. The US demanded Venezuela let the \u201cAID\u201d in threatening war otherwise. The opposition then burned their own AID trucks in a failed attempt to justify a war. USAID has long been used as a CIA front used as a cover for both the Phoenix program in Vietnam and Operation Condor in Latin America and is thus implicated in the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people a fact that should always be remembered whenever the topic of American \u201cHumanitarian Aid\u201d is brought up.\nHowever thanks to the bravery of the Iraqi resistance which inflicted a humiliating defeat on the US military 2003-2011 it is unlikely the US will actually invade Venezuela which is roughly the same size as Iraq with a huge city Caracas full of armed Chavistas who could be counted on to resist any occupation for years. Worse for the empire Chavez the internationalist long ago forged friendly military ties with Russia who have provided S300 air defenses, Russian fighter jets, trainers, and advisers. America\u2019s fascist puppets Colombia and Brazil would prefer to use their militaries to murder defenseless peasants and labor leaders not risk a military disaster by invading Venezuela at least for now. Thus Mad Emperor Trumps hopes for a full scale war on Venezuela have been rejected by his own military. However they will continue to wage a covert war on Venezuela involving sabotage assassination and terror.\nAs a punishment for the Venezuelan people for failing to rise up and overthrow their own government and install an American puppet the US launched a much more ruthless strategy. The whole country is being put under siege as the electric grid is being sabotaged through cyberwarfare, electromagnetic warfare, bombings, and sabotage. Like the people of Gaza or of Iraq the entire country has lost power with the first attack occurring on March 7. The empire hoped the country would be plunged into chaos but instead the people of Venezuela have largely united to meet this new challenge. This attack on Venezuela\u2019s electricity is utterly criminal and has deprived many Venezuelans not just of power but of water, money, transportation, and food. Thankfully many of the revolutionary socialist projects that Chavez and Maduro have set up have moved in to deal with the crisis. Collectives are growing their own food. Neighborhoods are already organized to meet the challenge. The people of Venezuela have provided an example of cooperation and heroism to the entire world.\nAmerica\u2019s war on the planet continues around the world in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Yemen, the Philippines, the Congo, Afghanistan, Haiti, Venezuela and many other places. Defeated in Syria the empire seeks to recolonize the entire western hemisphere so it can rob the people blind and reduce them to misery. At home the country is falling apart, the populace has been driven insane by years of propaganda. Prisons, immigrant detention camps, police murdering with impunity, ever escalating internet censorship, total surveillance, tent cities, corrupt, cowardly, dishonest politicians, poisoned water and air, ignorance, poverty and homelessness ever on the rise. This is the wonderful system that must be exported to every corner of the globe at the cost of millions of lives and trillions of dollars. A system that robs the poor to give to the rich and rolls on endlessly like a juggernaut destroying country after country.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

{"text": "Prince Charles to visit Rwanda, a place Duchess Meghan loves, in 2020 By Zach Harper\nThe Prince of Wales has announced he'll visit Rwanda next year, where Duchess Meghan travelled for her humanitarian work in 2016. Charles has also sent Paul Kagame, the country\u2019s president, his condolences with a letter to mark the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. \u201cMy wife and I particularly wanted you to know how much the people of Rwanda are in our thoughts and prayers at this special time of remembrance and reflection,\u201d Charles wrote.\n\u201cI can only say how deeply I admire the strength and resilience of the Rwandan people over these past twenty-five years, together with your commitment to reconciliation and your determination that the atrocities of the past must not define the future to which you aspire,\u201d Charles continued. \u201cIn this regard, if I may say so, Rwanda, as an indispensable member of our Commonwealth family, offers an aspiring and deeply humbling example to us all.\u201d\nThis week is the beginning of an annual national commemoration period in Rwanda, in which the country recognizes past violence against its minority Tutsi and Twa populations. An estimated 500,000 to 1 million people \u2013 most of whom were Tutsi \u2013 were killed in the genocide, which took place over a 100-day period from April to July 1994.\nCharles will be in Kigali, the country\u2019s capital, which will host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2020. Although Rwanda was not initially a member of the Commonwealth, it joined the global body in 2009.\nThis will give Charles a chance to bond over something else with daughter-in-law Meghan, and ask her what he needs to know about travelling to the country. Meghan visited Rwanda in 2016 as a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada. While there, she spent time with children at a school that had been given clean water through a pipeline set up by the charity, and also painted watercolour pictures with them.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a misconception that access to clean water is just about drinking water; which, of course, it is,\u201d Meghan said of her visit in 2017. \u201cBut it\u2019s so much more than that. Access to clean water in a community keeps young girls in school, because they aren\u2019t walking hours each day to source water for their families.\u201d\n\u201cMeghan is a true humanitarian,\u201d Lara Dewar, chief marketing and development officer for World Vision, said in a statement about the Rwanda visit in 2017. \u201cI personally witnessed Meghan\u2019s passion to improve the lives of children, and know her heart to advocate for the rights of girls \u2013 to hear and amplify their important voices.\u201d\nHeartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle (our ambassador for the past 2 years) on her engagement to Prince Harry!

In 2018, she and Prince Harrymet Priscilla Ruzibuka,who set up a children\u2019s clothing project that employs underprivileged women in Rwanda. Priscilla later said the couple told her how much they love her home country, and said they told her they look forward to visiting it together one day.\nCharles is also known for his humanitarian work. He is president of 17 different charities that help disadvantaged children and youth, and also work to improve education and the environment.\nAnd of course, no one can forget the humanitarian work of Princess Diana, Harry's late mother. The Princess of Wales was a patron of The HALO Trust, which removes debris such as landmines that are left behind after wars and armed conflicts. Diana famously visited Angola in 1997, and toured a minefield while wearing a helmet and flak jacket. In 2010, Harry followed in his mother's footsteps, visiting former landmine fields cleared by HALO in Mozambique.\nDiana also visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was itself the site of a genocide in 1995, with the Landmine Survivors Network in 1997. The International Review of the Red Cross described Diana\u2019s passion for the cause as highly influential in the signing of the Ottawa Treaty, which bans the use of landmines worldwide.\n", "label": "human"}

The jury decided the six children, 12 to 19, died at the hands of another and not by accident.\nREAD MORE: Details emerge on deaths of Hart kids; mother drunk, victims were drugged, pathologist says\nAuthorities had indicated they believed the crash was deliberate but wanted a jury to make official findings.\nA coroner\u2019s inquest is generally used in cases involving in-custody deaths or officer-involved shootings where public interest is high and the need for transparency critical, said Mendocino County sheriff\u2019s Capt. Gregory L. Van Patten.\nThe deaths drew national attention, partly because the women were alleged to have abused their children. The body of Devonte Hart, 15, who was Black and had gained attention when he was photographed in tears while hugging a white police officer during a 2014 protest in Portland, Oregon, has not been recovered.\nJurors were instructed to choose from four manners of death for each of the eight people: natural causes, suicide, accident or an intentional act by another.

The bodies of both women were found in the vehicle, which landed below a cliff located more than 160 miles (250 kilometers) north of San Francisco.\nThe Hart family had fled their Woodland, Washington, home March 23 after a visit from social workers that day.\nSarah Hart searched suicide, drowning, Benadryl dosages and overdose methods on the internet throughout the drive to California, California Highway Patrol investigator Jake Slates said. She also queried whether death by drowning would be painful. Authorities recovered the deleted searches from her phone.\n\u201cThey both decided that this was going to be the end,\u201d Slates said. \u201cThat if they can\u2019t have their kids that nobody was going to have those kids.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Six children and two women assumed dead after SUV plunged off California cliff\nThe bodies of siblings Markis, Jeremiah and Abigail were found the same day near the car.

Padre Pio gave us access to his hospital in Cayambe, Ecuador.\u201d\nInitially, the group travelled with an anaesthetist, an ear, nose and throat resident and operating room and recovery room nurses.\nThey helped poor deaf people hear and tackled \u2014 sometimes life-threatening \u2014 nose and throat problems.\nThe group has now helped 500 patients a year for the last 10 years, people who might otherwise have lived all their lives with major medical handicaps.\nOver the years, CVIDS has morphed more into the humanitarian field.\nIt has built schools, homes for the elderly, a kitchen to provide 300 meals each day, a new physiotherapy building, renovated operating rooms and contributed operating room equipment, donated a 34-seat bus to move young children safely and provided funds for anti-parasitic medication and dental health.\n\u201cRecently we have been concentrating on providing clean, safe water to various communities in Ecuador and Bolivia,\u201d said DiToppa.\n\u201cA $10,000 donation will build a 45-kilometre aqueduct from a spring in the mountains to provide safe chlorinated water to more than 1,000 people.\u201d\nAmazingly within minutes, $40,000 was raised to help four villages last week, with DiToppa and former restaurateur Claude Buzon partnering to help.\nJudging by the bidding on some auction items offered by emcee and auctioneer Danny Hooper, support for future CVIDS missions looks good.\nHe sold a Rocky Mountain \u201cBeginning of Spring\u201d painting by Calgary artist Jack Rigaud for $6,700, asking for a $100 donation from everyone wanting to support future endeavours.\n\u201cWe are a very small group and know our projects to help the less fortunate could not have been realized without the generous help of Edmontonians,\u201d said DiToppa.\n\u201cEveryone pays their own way on our missions and we always return with photos of projects that have come to fruition.\u201d\nStudent scholarships\nThe 27-member Edmonton Consular Corps has its black-tie Consular Ball on April 27 at the Chateau Lacombe where winners of three scholarships will be announced.\n\u201cWe receive some 25 to 45 applications each year from University of Alberta students seeking to travel abroad to work,\u201d said Victor M. Tanti, the Hon. Consul of Malta and chair of the Edmonton Consular Corps.\n\u201cWe are always very impressed with the level of applications we get from students who would like to spend a couple of months or so in a developing country and share their expertise.\n\u201cThey are valued and respected and contribute to Canada\u2019s reputation as a caring nation.\u201d\nStudents grades are considered in awarding the $3,000 scholarships. Also studied is how the award will enhance the knowledge of a student in such areas as international diplomacy, conflict, trade and cultural relations as well as Canada\u2019s role in advancing world peace and economic development.\nChair of this year\u2019s event is Ireland\u2019s Hon. Consul General Doodie Cahill, the longest serving member of Edmonton\u2019s consular corps.\n\u201cWe have held very successful consular corps balls every year since 1985,\u201d said Cahill. \u201cAlberta beef is, of course, on the menu.\u201d\nBig stink\nEdmonton\u2019s air is expected to be rank for a month beginning April 25 when Sorrentino\u2019s Restaurants celebrates 40 years of business with its annual Garlic Festival kickoff.\n\u201cOur Big Stomp dinner-dance will be held at the Edmonton Expo,\u201d said Stella Rago, who owns the restaurants with husband Carmelo Rago. \u201cFunds raised will help the Roozen Family Hospice Centre, a much-needed residence to be built for end-of-life patients.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

But they have now cut out the Sri Lanka leg of her holiday - at the cost of \u00a3863 (\u20ac1,000).\n\"To think that the hotel we were due to be staying in a few weeks time got bombed and that that could have been us doesn't bear thinking about,\" said trainee GP Ms Goodman.\n\"It's been an emotional few days for us. I don't know how I would've felt travelling around Sri Lanka after what's happened. We could have been putting our lives at risk, anything could happen.\n\"We've been really lucky and have managed to get our trip changed for a fee.\"\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he hoped to be able to change the travel advice once the current security operation had concluded.\n\"My first priority will always be the security of British citizens living and travelling abroad.\n\"We all hope the situation will return to normal very soon, and that the Sri Lankan tourism industry is able to get back on its feet following the terrorist attacks.\n\"We will do all we can to help the Sri Lankan authorities in the meantime,\" he added.\nTravel expert Simon Calder said tourism was the third most important industry to the Sri Lankan economy, particularly in terms of employment and foreign exchange.\nIn 2017, more than two million tourists visited the island, an increase from fewer than half a million in 2009.\nSri Lanka's tourism sector was worth just $350m (\u00a3270m) in 2009, growing more than 10 times to be worth $4.4bn (\u00a33.4bn) in 2018, according to figures from the Sri Lankan central bank .\nAccording to ONS figures, \u00a388m was spent on tourism in Sri Lanka in 2017 by UK residents , who made 86,000 visits.\nMr Calder told the BBC the UK travel warning would \"send a signal to the rest of the world\" and \"almost certainly have a detrimental effect\" on the industry.\nHe also pointed out that it can take years for a ban to be lifted. \"It took two years for Tunisia to get off the no-go list ,\" he said.\nThere will also be a short-term impact on the travel industry, he added.\n\"People that have a package holiday booked in the next few weeks will not be expected to travel and the travel company will have to make arrangements to give a full refund or provide an alternative holiday - it's your choice,\" he said.\nHowever, travel trade organisation Abta said anyone who booked their flights and accommodation separately will need to discuss their options with the individual companies.\nHolidaymakers with travel insurance may be able to claim for losses depending on the terms of their policy.\nTour operator Tui said it has started to contact customers in Sri Lanka and those due to travel in the next seven days to discuss travel arrangements.\nImage caption Eight Britons died in the attacks: Alex, Anita and Annabel Nicholson, Daniel and Amelie Linsey, Dr Sally Bradley and Bill Harrop, and Lorraine Campbell (clockwise from top left)\nAmong the victims of Sunday's bombings were Anita Nicholson and her children Annabel, 11, and Alex, 14, who were visiting Sri Lanka on holiday from their home in Singapore.\nDr Sally Bradley and William Harrop were also on holiday from western Australia where they were living.\nIT director Lorraine Campbell, 55, from Greater Manchester, was staying at Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel on a business trip when she died.\nLondon siblings Daniel and Amelie Linsey died after their father tried to rescue them from one of the bombings.\nIn an interview with the BBC on Thursday, their brother, David, paid tribute to 15-year-old Amelie, who was \"beautiful in every way\" and \"always a daddy's girl\".\nHis 19-year-old brother, Daniel, lived his life in the service of other people and would always go out of his way for others, David said.\nTheir father, Matthew Linsey, said he wanted the UK government to bring their bodies back to the UK as soon as possible. \"We want to reunite them with their family,\" he said.\nA team of family liaison officers has been sent to Sri Lanka to support the families of British victims and help repatriate the deceased.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "AP-US--Obit-Wolman,3rd Ld-Writethru\nJonathan Wolman, who over more than 45 years in journalism served as editor and publisher of The Detroit News and previously worked as a reporter, Washington bureau chief and executive editor at The Associated Press, died Monday in Detroit. He was 68.\nHis family told the News that Wolman died of complications from pancreatic cancer.\nWolman had been editor and publisher of the News since 2007, running the newspaper during a financially challenging period that included staff layoffs, a cutback to only two days a week of home delivery, and a relocation from the massive headquarters building that it had occupied for nearly a century.\nHowever, Detroit \u2014 even as it careened into and then out of bankruptcy in 2013-14 \u2014 has survived as one of a shrinking number of U.S. cities with more than one major daily newspaper. The News has a joint operating agreement with its rival, the Detroit Free Press, in which the newspapers consolidate business operations while fielding separate editorial staffs.\n\"Jon came to Detroit at a time of incredible uncertainty, not only for the News, but for the industry,\" said the News' managing editor, Gary Miles. \"He was a steadying, calming influence who put a priority on the big picture: the accuracy and fairness of our news report.\"\nMiles recalled Wolman's \"painstaking analysis\" as the paper's management grappled with budget cuts and staff reductions. Even amid the austerity, Miles said, Wolman oversaw expansion of the paper's investigative and projects unit, and maintained a strong focus on national and world news at a time when many regional papers were cutting back.\n\"He was incredibly kind,\" Miles said. \"Some decisions clearly pained him. But he kept the long-term interests of the News, its staff and its readers, paramount.\"\nPeter Bhatia, editor of the Free Press, praised Wolman as \"a magnificent person and an outstanding journalist.\"\n\"He has kept his newspaper relevant and engaged in the community and has been a fierce and appropriate advocate for the News in its partnership with the Free Press,\" Bhatia said.\nWolman's tenure in Detroit encompassed one of the most turbulent periods in the city's history. The bankruptcy filing was preceded by years of plummeting population and tax base; more recently there's been an incomplete but inspiring recovery.\nWolman came to Detroit from Denver, where for three years he was editor of the Denver Post's editorial page.\nPrior to his job in Denver, Wolman had a nearly 31-year career with AP, starting in 1973 as a reporter in Madison, Wisconsin.\nFrom 1975 until late 1998, he worked at AP's Washington bureau, rising from reporter to news editor to a powerful bureau chief who focused coverage squarely on politics, the White House and campaigns. He held that post for nearly 10 years before moving to New York to become AP's managing editor, and was promoted to executive editor in May 2000.\nIn 1981, he was praised by AP managing editor Wick Temple for overseeing coverage of the space shuttle Columbia's first flight.\n\"Jon pulled it together from all sites, got no bylines and worked 22 hours a day,\" Temple wrote to other AP managers. \"He was a delight.\"\nLater, Wolman helped oversee AP's 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winning report about the 1950 No Gun Ri massacre during the Korean War, as well as AP's coverage of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nBut it was political coverage that was Wolman's career-long obsession and his focus as a journalist.\nSome colleagues suggest that one of his finest moments came late on Election Night in 2000, when it was clear that the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore had come down to the closely fought state of Florida. At 2:16 a.m. on Nov. 8, Fox News Channel declared Bush the winner in Florida, and within minutes NBC, CBS, CNN and ABC did the same. The AP said the race was still too close to name a winner.\nWolman, then AP's New York-based executive editor, was in the Washington office at the time while his successor as bureau chief, Sandy Johnson, faced intense pressure to join the networks in calling the election for Bush. But based on input from experienced colleagues, Johnson knew the Florida outcome wasn't clear and stood her ground; Wolman backed her completely. Many news organizations, including AP, had already had to backtrack once after exit polls and an analysis of early returns wrongly indicated that Gore had won Florida.\n\"He could have pulled rank on Sandy and called it \u2014 but that night he knew he was working for her,\" said Ron Fournier, whose byline was on the main election story. \"Jon deserved credit for knowing to trust his people.\"\nAP's non-call was vindicated as the nearly deadlocked election outcome became entangled in a long legal battle before being decided in Bush's favor by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nJohnson credited Wolman with building a strong AP staff in Washington.\n\"He took a chance on people, putting them in roles that perhaps they weren't obviously ready for, including me,\" she recalled. \"He created an esprit de corps in Washington that in turn set the bar higher for all of us.\"\nLouis D. Boccardi, AP's president from 1985 to 2003, said that Wolman \u2014 for all his versatility in management \u2014 \"was at heart a reporter.\"\n\"I never saw him happier than when he was working with writers on a big story or with a team shaping a report on a major investigation,\" Boccardi said. \"He was a newsman, through and through.\"\nCarole Feldman, a veteran reporter and editor at the Washington bureau, described Wolman as a supportive boss \"who mentored new people coming into the bureau and put his trust in them to handle the biggest story.\"\nTerry Hunt, whose 46-year AP career included 25 years as chief White House correspondent, said Wolman was \"incredibly smart, very analytical and had a solid grasp of politics.\"\n\"He read more than anyone I know. He didn't sleep much,\" Hunt recalled. \"He was demanding, sometimes blunt and direct. But always fair.\"\nAP's current executive editor, Sally Buzbee, who worked for Wolman in AP's Washington bureau, said he never lost his intense interest in national politics, remembering a coffee after Donald Trump won the presidency where Wolman cited election results, county-by-county, in Michigan.\n\"He lived and breathed politics, and he made the Washington bureau a strong, competitive force in national political coverage,\" Buzbee said.\nWolman grew up in a newspaper family. His father, Martin Wolman, sold papers as a boy and was publisher of the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison from 1968 to 1984.\nJon was among five children of Martin and Anne Wolman. One of his siblings, Jane, died in a car crash in 1967; the others include Nicky, Lewis and Ruth.\nWolman attended the University of Colorado for two years before transferring to the University of Wisconsin's main campus in Madison, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1972.\nHe is survived by his wife, Deborah Lamm; three children: Jacob, Emma and Sophia, and Emma's husband, Ian Irvine.\nA service will be held Wednesday at 11 a.m. at Temple Beth El in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Donations in Wolman's name may be made to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the University of Wisconsin School of Journalism and Jewish Family Services of Metro Detroit.\n", "label": "human"}

Quebec\u2019s civil protection authority is warning all riverside municipalities to immediately report any flooding or other abnormality as quickly as possible.\nFinally, high tides begin Thursday, and any heavy rainfall coupled with rising water levels could cause flooding in the Quebec City area.\nCivil protection authorities are in constant communication with their regional offices and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, which manages the dams in its power distribution network, as well as Environment Quebec.\nThe province\u2019s warning on Wednesday coincided with what appears to be the beginning of the end of the worst flooding in decades in the town of Beauceville, about 90 kilometres south of Quebec City. The flooding threat to the town isn\u2019t over as long as an ice jam remains on the Chaudi\u00e8re River.\nA large section of the town\u2019s main street was submerged and remained closed Wednesday even though the waters had receded and the residents of 230 homes who had been forced by the flooding to leave had yet to receive authorization to return.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Other reviews similarly call the blood cream 'magic.'\nHailey Baldwin is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world, with a successful modeling career and over 19 million Instagram followers.\nHowever, a beauty secret she shared in a March interview with Marie Claire has recently gotten some renewed attention.\nAs previously written by The Inquisitr, the interview covered the basics of the model\u2019s self-care routine, including tips about exercise, a \u201cless is more\u201d look, and sharing shampoo with her husband, Justin Bieber.\nBut the model also shared a less common tip \u2014 using a moisturizer formulated with blood.\n\u201cI moisturize with a cream by Dr. Barbara Sturm that\u2019s formulated with my blood\u2026 At home, I use a good hyaluronic-acid serum, SPF, and my blood cream.\u201d\nThough the moisturizer may sound creepy, it has a cult following with Hollywood celebrities. The \u201cblood cream,\u201d officially called MC1 cream, was created by Barbara Sturm, an orthopedic doctor who went on to become a skincare scientist.\nIt\u2019s not just celebs who are obsessed with the skincare product. An Into The Gloss review, which covered both the process and results, concluded that the face cream was \u201cmagic.\u201d\nThe procedure involves extracting a client\u2019s blood and putting it through a process that \u201cstimulates the blood to react like you\u2019ve been injured.\u201d This creates healing proteins, known as platelet-rich plasma, which are then separated and blended with the moisturizer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Neosporin for your face. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve been using,\u201d Into The Gloss\u2018 Alyssa Reeder was quoted as saying.\nThe rave review mentioned that \u201chealing scabs looked 50 percent better\u201d by the next morning and that any fine lines and wrinkles were \u201cnowhere to be found.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the miracle cream does come with a negative \u2014 its price. The reporter admitted that the cost of $1,400 made it difficult for her to purchase again, despite the glowing effect.\nDr. Sturm is not only known for her face cream. She also pioneered the \u201cvampire facial\u201d that has been used by celebs like Kim Kardashian.\nThe facial works by piercing the skin hundreds of times with tiny needles filled with blood that has undergone the same process as in the cream.\nHowever, the famous reality star has since confessed on her personal website, KimKardashianWest.com, that she regretted the treatment. Kim explained that she had found out she was pregnant shortly before the facial, meaning the numbing creams and painkillers that most patients were used were off-limits.\n\u201cIt was really rough and painful for me. It was honestly the most painful thing ever! It\u2019s the one treatment that I\u2019ll never do again.\u201d\nNonetheless, she admitted that the facial gives good results and that it has \u201cso many benefits\u201d for the skin.\nThe vampire facial also comes with a hefty price tag, averaging $1,300 nationwide.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Given how dramatically containerized apps and microservices can simplify software management, it comes as no real surprise that enterprise adoption is on an upswing. According to 451 Research, the app container market could be worth a whopping $2.7 billion by 2020 (up from $762 million in 2016), and Portworx reports that over 30 percent of companies spent $500,000-plus on license and usage fees for container tech in 2017. Moreover, analysts at Gartner predict that in the next year, roughly 50 percent of companies will use containers in some form.\nPixeom, for one, is riding the wave pretty successfully. The Santa Clara, California-based startup, which develops edge computing software for enterprises, today announced that it\u2019s raised $15 million in funding led by Intel Capital, following investments from Samsung\u2019s Catalyst Fund and energy delivery company National Grid. It comes after revenue grew four times year-over-year to hit \u201cdouble-digit millions,\u201d and shortly after Pixeom crossed a major milestone: over one million deployments.\n\u201cWhile there are other cloud services on the market today, Pixeom is transformational,\u201d said cofounder and chairman Sam Nagar, who previously worked as a software engineer at Microsoft on Hyper-V and PowerShell, developing the large-scale virtualization and management capabilities of Windows Server. \u201cWe have created a truly boundary-less \u2026 platform without rules and limits imposed on its users by other cloud service providers.\u201d\nPixeom\u2019s edge computing platform enables cloud service providers to package and orchestrate containerized apps like those found in Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure, so that they\u2019re able to run on edge infrastructure comprising a range of hardware and operating systems. Using \u201cedge versions\u201d of AI, data processing, messaging, stream processing, and analytics services recreated to match on-premises APIs, admins can create and submit containerized apps (or adapt existing apps) and publish them to public or private portals, from where they can be installed to edge devices and managed on-premises.\nPixeom\u2019s service as it exists today is something of a pivot for the startup, which in 2014 launched a Kickstarter for what Nagar described as a personal, encrypted cloud device. The eponymous Pixeom X1, which packed a Raspberry Pi, plugged into a network via Ethernet and enabled customers to join a wider Pixeom community through which they could share apps and content.\nThe crowdfunded peripheral raised over $75,000 in the end, exceeding its goal by over $15,000. But despite the early success, Nagar and his sister and cofounder Karishma Nagar made the strategic decision in the intervening years to pursue a hardware-agnostic route. It paid dividends: Pixeom \u2014 which counts Google, Samsung, Honeywell, Comcast, and Vodafone among its ecosystem partners \u2014 now has \u201cdozens\u201d of Fortune 500 companies in the energy, telecom, manufacturing, security, retail, and health care sectors, and employs a workforce of more than 80 people.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A South Island mayor is questioning why ratepayers and taxpayers are footing the bill to clean up industrial waste.\nPhoto: RNZ / Tess Brunton\nStock effluent disposal sites are used to keep animal waste off New Zealand roads and prevent it from seeping into the environment.\nBut local authorities and the Transport Agency are responsible for covering the cost, not industry.\nCentral Otago District Mayor Tim Cadogan said most people were unaware they were paying to keep industrial waste off our roads.\n\"The real question is why are ratepayers or taxpayers anywhere paying for these things to be built and the last one that we got built here was $840,000. That's yet to be commissioned.\n\"They're dotted all over the countryside and they're there to collect the industrial waste of the dairy farmers at the taxpayers cost,\" Mr Cadogan said.\nBy 2015, there were more than 30 stock effluent disposal facilities across the country with about 18 either in the works or being considered.\nRates and taxes were being used to pay to build and maintain these sites, he said.\nThe Otago Regional Council (ORC) confirmed about a quarter of its proposed $840,000 site will be paid for by its ratepayers with funding from the Transport Agency covering the rest.\n\"Central Otago has a very small dairy industry, but because we geographically in the middle a lot of trucks going from Southland to Westland or vice versa pass through and need empty.\n\"So our ratepayers, through their ORC rates, are getting charged directly for the emptying of industrial waste from other parts of the lower South Island,\" Mr Cadogan said.\nIn the North Island, Waikato ratepayers contribute up to $15,000 a year to maintain four of the region's sites - and there are plans to build two new sites in the future.\nSouthland Regional Council ratepayers forked out more than $12,000 last year to pay for maintenance of the region's only site at Five Rivers - the remainder of the $26,914 cost was paid by the Transport Agency.\nTaranaki Regional Council doesn't contribute financially to the area's three disposal sites, saying they are managed and mostly paid for by district councils with the government funding about 50 percent of two of the sites.\nThe stock effluent management plans are regionally organised and catching spillage culprits can be difficult.\nRoad Transport Association NZ chief executive Dennis Robertson said road user charges - including truck drivers - paid for building disposal sites through the Transport Agency's national road transport fund.\n\"The maintenance of those sites is conducted by the local councils mainly through the regional councils and they have a responsibility to have an environmental component and everybody pays for that. Farmers pay rates, truck drivers pay rate. So that's just the way it is. It would be very, very difficult just to bill individuals for that and probably very costly to do so,\" he said.\nThe country needed more stock effluent disposal sites to prevent waste hitting the road, minimising the road safety and environmental impacts, Mr Robertson said.\nTransport Agency South Island director of regional relationships Jim Harland said using rates and charges was not an ideal situation, but it kept effluent off the highway.\n\"We're promoting ourselves as 100 percent pure and obviously effluent on roads and falling off tracks doesn't really fit that image,\" Mr Harland said.\n\"Effluent on the road is very slippery, it's a hazard to motorists so for both of those reasons, it's important for effluent to be disposed on in an appropriate manner.\"\nStock truck drivers don't have to use the disposal sites, but Mr Harland said the alternative was much worse for motorists.\n\"We fund them on the basis under a principle of exacerbaters should pay and the exacerbater in this case is the original owner of the stock, who benefits from the sale that stock once it's processed. But there is no that there is no cost effective method for levying that sort of ... pollution effect.\"\nUsing local rates was an easier and fairer method to cover costs - which were also assisted by road user charges and petrol taxes, he said.\nAnd until a better solution is found, the public is picking up the cost to keep New Zealand's roads clean.\n", "label": "human"}

(Morung File Photo)\n\u2018The Gordon Graham award recognizes the worth of Naga literature,\u201d she emphasizes and talks about the contribution it has for the future by helping create awareness for the need to have more Naga stories written down. Towards this end, she expresses hope that there will be governmental efforts towards encouraging each village to write down their history and their lore.\nStating that the prize gives incentive to young and aspiring writers, she strongly feels that scholarships should be made available as they begin to write seriously. Different universities in the state of Nagaland, she says, can also institute residencies for writers so that they can get a month or two of boarding and salary and the space to write. \u201cWriters in residence can reciprocate by delivering lectures on relevant topics. These are matters that the Naga writers can get together to discuss fruitfully\u201d, she adds.\n\u201cI keep discovering that non-fiction feeds fictional writing\u201d, she shares while elucidating that \u201cwhen reading anthropological accounts, and also tribe histories, they include anecdotes of the tribe which mingle the spiritual or the para normal with the historical.\u201d These anecdotes, she says are like seeds for fictional works to sprout forth from and towards this end, urges students to read, read, read while stating that it is such a wonderful activity, \u201cit keeps you from quarrelling with your neighbours or gossiping about people at the office and, it puts good seeds in you.\u201d\nOn being awarded the Gordon Graham Prize, Kire feels very grateful to God and to the KET/KES, and is especially happy that they chose \u2018When the River Sleeps\u2019, it being one of her favourites. Highlighting the journey of the book, she says, \u201cwhen I was writing the book, I had the experience of the world of the hunter becoming very real to me, in fact so very real on several occasions that I had to leave the house and go out into the city and reconnect with the real world.\u201d With many discerning readers asking what happens to Vilie, she says, \u201cI can now say he is around and ready to come back very soon.\u201d The sequel to \u2018When the River Sleeps\u2019 titled, \u2018Journey of the Stone\u2019 is coming soon.\nKire is also in the process of finishing a nonfiction book which is a study of the sixteen tribes of Nagaland and commissioned by Aleph books as a series of books on different states. Putting across that it is like a travel book, she hopes it will benefit students in colleges and universities, as well as tourists and newcomers to Nagaland. Besides this, a volume of short stories (an illustrated edition) with Seagull publishers is also in the offing.\nHope the book would give new conception of forgiveness & politics: Kevichusa\nKethoser Aniu Kevichusa delivering the Morung Lecture on \u0091Forgiveness and Politics\u0092 at Elim Hall, DABA on February 2, 2018. (Morung File Photo)\nKethoser Aniu Kevichusa hopes that readers would have a new understanding of forgiveness and politics after reading his book- \u2018Forgiveness and Politics: A Critical Appraisal\u2019 that won the Gordon Graham Prize for Naga Literature in the non-fiction category. \u201cWhen we say forgiveness or politics, everybody thinks they know what forgiveness and politics is, but I would hope that the book would give people a new conception and understanding and even correct some of their misunderstandings both of forgiveness and politics.\u201d\nAnd because Nagas are so interested in politics \u2018and we think we know politics\u2019, he also hopes that \u201cwe regain a new vision and the high calling that politics is\u201d while asserting that \u201cit really is a noble calling and people who are called to do politics should keep their eyes on that.\u201d\nHe says that one of the challenges with writing is that \u201cyou don\u2019t really know where it is going; writing is not a transference of idea from the head into the paper. It is not so much you leading, but the book leads you.\u201d\nHowever when it did come out in book form, he expresses that it gave him quite a lot of satisfaction and confidence, but also some insecurities because, in his words- \u201cyou have written it and now people can look into it and with my book, to be honest, it\u2019s a pretty obscure book but now that it has some measure of visibility, I know there will be a lot of people out there who will not really agree with a lot of things I have to say.\u201d\nBut winning the prestigious award has also reaffirmed that he should continue writing and readers can look forward to more of his books in the days to come. He has no doubt whatsoever that the Gordon Graham Prize will encourage writers even while amusingly stating that, \u201ceveryone who writes will now write with one eye in their work and one eye on the prize.\u201d On the other hand, he believes that the Prize will definitely boost the quality of both writing and publishing in the state.\nAmong Nagas, he observes that there are a lot of creative people but with creativity also, he emphasizes, \u201cwe need the other side of getting the simple grammar, punctuation, the almost arithmetic side of language right, because you can have brilliant ideas and write very flowery language but if your grammar is wrong, that kinds of put you off.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "We're calling it right now: 2019 is Lily Collins's year. For starters, she is starring alongside Zac Efron in the extremely eerie film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. In case you haven't heard, Efron is taking on the role of one of the worst serial killers in US history, Ted Bundy, and Collins is starring as his girlfriend, Liz Kendall (aka Elizabeth Kloepfer). The film will be released in both theaters and on Netflix on May 3, so if you're looking for a follow-up to Netflix's Conversations With a Killer, mark your calendars.\nAdditionally, Collins has a starring role alongside Nicholas Hoult in the upcoming film based on J.R.R. Tolkien's formative years, called Tolkien, which hits theaters May 10. And finally, Collins's role as the orphan Fantine in the PBS adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables finally debuted on April 14 (we could hardly wait \"one day more\").\nBecause we can't get enough of Collins, we've been mining her Instagram feed to catch more glimpses of the impressive Hollywood sensation, and we've come to the conclusion that her life is our new manual for major life decisions.

Despite the Blue Devils\u2019 loss to the Michigan State Spartans in last week\u2019s Elite Eight game, basketball commentators and pundits are expecting Zion to end up as the No. 1 pick when the draft rolls around. While that might be true, it looks like the young NBA hopeful has some other problems to sort out first, if recent rumors are to be believed.\nAs recently reported by USA Today, Duke University officials have begun \u201clooking into\u201d rumors and claims that Zion Williamson\u2019s mother, Sharonda Sampson, took bribes in exchange for her son choosing to play at Duke.

To date, he is best known for representing Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against Donald Trump.

Thx. \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) April 6, 2019\nKevin White, the current director of athletics for Duke University, released a statement explaining that the school is looking into the allegations.

{"text": "Updated\nIf one Australian biochemist has his way, thousands of people who suffer strokes each year could have a fighting chance of survival thanks to spider venom.\nThe Fraser Island funnel-web produces venom that holds a molecule that stalls the effects a stroke has on the brain.\nProfessor Glenn King from the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience said the venom would be used to develop a drug to prevent brain damage.\n\"When someone has a stroke, at the moment no treatment can really be given until they are in the hospital,\" he told ABC Radio Brisbane's Rebecca Levingston.\n\"Their brain is imaged and the doctor decides which stroke it is and determines the course of treatment.\n\"If you're in a country area, it can take hours to get to a hospital and your brain is dying during that entire time and no drugs can be given.\"\nProfessor King said the new drug could be administered to patients by paramedics within minutes.\n\"This potentially could be the most profound application of this molecule,\" he said.\n\"We think this molecule will be suitable for both haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic strokes and could be given to the patient at the point of being found, and the brain would be protected in the transport time before getting to the hospital.\"\nCreating a window of hope\nAccording to the Stroke Foundation, stroke is the third biggest killer in Australia and in 2017 more than 56,000 people experienced new or recurrent strokes.\nDoctors currently have a four-and-a-half-hour window to be with a specialist ready to administer the only available stroke drug.\n\"When you have a stroke, oxygen doesn't flow to certain parts of the brain and the brain switches the way it uses its fuel and you get lactic acidosis and the brain becomes acidic,\" he said.\n\"Venoms are extremely complicated mixtures of ion-channel modulators, in this case the spider venom shuts off a specific ion pathway in the brain that is responsible for triggering massive cell death after stroke.\"\n\"You can't stop neurons that have already died, but you could give this drug eight hours after stroke and still get massive protection of the brain.\"\nExciting discovery\nProfessor Glenn King said the discovery was serendipitous and occurred while he was working with a PhD student who had been working on another venom peptide from a tarantula.\n\"She was looking at the venom of the funnel-web spider to also understand why it's so complex when she found a molecule that looked similar to the one we were working on.\n\"It turned out it was much better than the one I was working on.\n\"It was a very exciting moment and probably one of the most exciting things we've discovered since we started working on venoms.\"\nA little like brewing beer\nProfessor King said the drug was still several years off medical trials, yet experiments with rodents had been successful.\n\"Currently to create the drug we take a gene that encodes that protein and we put it into a bacterium and we instruct the bacterium to make it,\" he said.\n\"If we were to get to large production, we would use yeast.\n\"We would place the gene into yeast and it would be fermented like beer and we would get it to make lots of this protein.\"\nOn Fraser Island\nThe spider is unique to Queensland and can grow up to a couple of centimetres long and live in burrows beneath the soil.\n\"If you're in clay soils it makes it hard to find them, but Fraser Island being the largest sand island in the world makes it a great place to collect spiders that live in the ground.\n\"They are only found on Fraser Island, there are related populations on the mainland, but it's largely on Fraser Island \u2014 we don't tell tourists that though.\"\nThe team is hoping to begin a drive to raise money to fast-track the development of the drug candidate.\n\"We are talking millions of dollars to get the drug to the point of clinical trials and we have been funded by the Queensland Government and supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council, so it is helping things,\" Professor King said.\nTo help get the drug through clinical trials, the Not if, When \u2014 the Campaign to Create Change has been launched by UQ.\nTopics: stroke, invertebrates---insects-and-arachnids, medical-research, animals, animal-science, diseases-and-disorders, human-interest, st-lucia-4067, brisbane-4000\nFirst posted\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "BC-US--College Admissions-Bribery,4th Ld-Writethru\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 \"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that they paid $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters into the University of Southern California.\nThe couple is among 50 prominent parents, athletic coaches and others charged in a sweeping college admissions bribery scam that has embroiled elite school across the country, such as Stanford, Georgetown and Yale.\nLoughlin and Giannulli filed court documents Monday waiving their right to appear for an arraignment and entering not guilty pleas to the two charges against them. The judge granted their requests, meaning they will not have to show up at Boston's federal court to be arraigned.\nThirty-three wealthy parents were charged last month in what authorities have called the biggest college admissions case ever prosecuted by the Justice Department. They are accused of paying admissions consultant Rick Singer to rig standardized test scores and bribe college coaches and other insiders to get their children into selective schools.\nLoughlin and Giannulli are charged with paying bribes to have their daughters designated as crew recruits to USC, even though neither of them is a rower. Authorities say Loughlin and Giannulli helped create fake athletic profiles for the teens by sending Singer photos of their teens posing on rowing machines.\nAfter their older daughter was admitted to USC, authorities say Giannulli, whose Mossimo clothing had long been a Target brand until recently, sent Singer an email with the subject line, \"Trojan happiness,\" thanking him for his \"efforts and end result!\"\nLoughlin, who played Aunt Becky on the sitcom \"Full House,\" and Giannulli haven't publicly addressed the allegations against them.\nTheir daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli \u2014 a social media star who has a popular YouTube channel \u2014 was dropped from deals with cosmetics retailer Sephora and hair products company TRESemme after her parents' arrest.\nProsecutors last week added a money laundering conspiracy charge against Loughlin, Giannulli and more than a dozen other parents who are still fighting the case, increasing the pressure on them to plead guilty. Several other parents who were indicted alongside Loughlin and Giannulli have also filed court documents entering not guilty pleas.\nEach of the charges Loughlin and Giannulli faces call for up to 20 years in prison, although first-time offenders would get only a small fraction of that if convicted.\nFellow actress Felicity Huffman, who starred in ABC's \"Desperate Housewives,\" and 12 other parents announced last week that they have agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Huffman is scheduled to appear in Boston on May 21 to enter her plea.\nProsecutors have said they will seek a prison sentence on the low end of four to 10 months for Huffman, who was charged with paying $15,000 to boost her daughter's SAT score.\nOn Friday, a former Florida prep school administrator pleaded guilty to taking entrance exams for students, or correcting their answers, as part of the scam. Prosecutors have said they will seek between 33 to 41 months in prison for Mark Riddell, a Harvard graduate oversaw college entrance exam preparation at IMG Academy.\n____\nFollow Alanna Durkin Richer at http://www.twitter.com/aedurkinricher\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Share\nIt looks like Google is considering taking more steps into augmented reality. The company is perhaps best known for the Google Glass AR glasses, but the days of Glass are long gone \u2014 and Google could be looking to release something else. In fact, Google has been awarded a patent for a \u201chead-worn augmented reality display.\u201d\nThe patent specifically notes the use of a device that can superimpose computer-generated content over real-world objects. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t get much more specific than that. The patent does mention the use of a frame and reflective surface, along with the fact that it has a microdisplay \u2014 but that\u2019s something pretty much all augmented reality headsets would need.\nOf course, if Google does end up releasing an augmented reality headset, it could eventually be in direct competition with Apple. Rumors about the development of an Apple augmented reality headset have been popping up for some time now. According to those rumors, the Apple headset could be released as soon as 2020 and could function similar to the Apple Watch \u2014 as a device that\u2019s paired to the iPhone and used for displaying notifications and possibly even for some fitness tracking. Eventually, it\u2019s likely the headset will be independent from the iPhone and feature its own operating system.\nGoogle would also be competing with the likes of Microsoft. Microsoft is currently on its second generation of the Hololens headset, however, the headset costs $3,500, making it much less of a consumer device and more focused toward businesses and enterprise customers.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that Google\u2019s augmented reality headset will be anything like this. Google has been shifting its attention toward hardware lately, so it\u2019s plausible that the company could be working on a headset to be paired with Google Pixel phones. Google has also started taking gaming more seriously, with the announcement of its Stadia gaming streaming platform, so it\u2019s also possible that the headset could be more gaming-focused.\nAugmented reality, in general, is expected to grow a lot over the next few years, as companies miniaturize technology and can fit it into a product that is stylish enough for consumers to buy.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The plaintiffs allege that despite knowing a jailhouse takeover would impact the lives of inmates, Fox nevertheless took a crew of more than 200 for two weeks of shooting.\nTelevision production in youth prisons hardly makes for a typical class action lawsuit. Nevertheless, on Friday, the lead plaintiffs in a nearly three-year-old lawsuit against 20th Century Fox asked a federal judge in Illinois to certify a class of juveniles who had their lives disrupted when Empire filmed scenes of the hit drama at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.\nThe teenagers allege violations of their due process rights when for 13 days in 2015, Fox repurposed the prison as a film set. The kids were allegedly confined into \"pods,\" had outdoor recreation eliminated and denied schooling. Prison officials allegedly engaged in bulk transfers of intake detainees, overpopulated the detention center, stopped psychological screening to identify detainees who were at risk to themselves or others and on and on.\nIn October 2017, U.S. District Judge Amy J. St. Eve rejected Fox's motion to dismiss. She ruled that the named plaintiffs \u2014 known as T.S. and Q.B. in the court papers \u2014 had sufficiently alleged that Fox had induced a breach of the government officials' duties towards the youth. The plaintiffs have also survived on a claim that Fox was unjust enriched by its conduct.\nNow, after the kids learned more about Fox's takeover of the prison via the discovery process, plaintiff attorneys are shooting for a larger lawsuit that would represent an estimated 300 kids.\n\"Common evidence shows that Fox knew that filming at the JTDC would disrupt the JTDC\u2019s operations and impact all detainees by, for example, eliminating detainee access to the outdoor yards,\" states a motion in support of class certification. \"In written communications, Fox\u2019s experienced locations experts recognized that a film crew of even 30 people at the JTDC would be disruptive. But to film in the way it wanted, Fox opted to bring crews of 200 or more into the JTDC for the filming.\"\nIf this gets to trial, the plaintiffs say they will show that the filming of Empire in a youth detention center was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective, with experts testifying that the additional restrictions on movement and the overpopulation were detrimental to the youth.\nHoping to foreclose class certification, Fox states in its own court papers that the filming was a one-off occurrence that has not been repeated and that there are no actual damages. Fox adds that some of the inflammatory allegations are false and that testimony from the plaintiffs in depositions show anecdotal and individualized harm.\n\"Plaintiffs trivialize the concept of civil rights violations,\" states the defendants' brief, which adds that Fox paid $1,500 per day plus reimbursement of personnel costs and out-of-pocket expenses for access to the facility.\nAttorneys for the youth argue the case makes for a suitable class action.\nThe brief (read here) adds, \"While Defendants dismiss as inconsequential the denial of access to the outdoors and the punitive increase in pod confinement, these restrictions worsen incarceration\u2019s negative impact on young people. What is especially galling \u2014 and legally determinative here \u2014 is that these heightened restrictions at the JTDC entirely lacked justification. Imposing deprivations on kids to film a television drama is not a legitimate exercise of government power. The law on this point is clear.\"\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has alerted the public to the new tricks used by car thieves to dispossess unsuspecting Nigerians of their vehicles.\nThe alert, the commission said, was borne out of investigations into alleged crime levelled against a suspected car thief, Babatunde Oluwatope Oni (aka Olu Daniel, Oni Daniel Oluwatope).\nBabatunde, who hails from Odo Eri in Yagba West Local Government Area of Kogi State, was arrested by the Ibadan zonal office of the commission for alleged conspiracy, stealing and issuance of a dud cheque.\nThis followed a petition the EFCC said it received from a car dealer, Mr. Kamoru Yekini, on November 21, last year.\nThe petitioner alleged that on October 16, last year, two men approached him at his shop in Iwo town of Osun State, indicating interest to buy a 2006 Toyota Matrix car he displayed for sale.\nAfter negotiation on the price, the two parties reportedly agreed on N1,580,000.00, and a post-dated First Bank cheque was said to have been issued to cover the cost.\nThe cheque bore the name of Rabiu Bamidele Lateef as the account owner.\nIt was learnt that Babatunde allegedly acted as a driver to the other (fleeing) suspect with whom he negotiated to buy the car.\nThe other man was said to have falsely introduced himself as the account owner and a doctor at Bowen University, Iwo.\nAfter agreeing on the price, Bamidele reportedly left the scene to \u201cdeposit\u201d the money and later returned with a copy of the deposit slip as evidence of payment.\nThough not comfortable with the payment arrangement, the car dealer was said to have reluctantly released the vehicle and the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) duty papers, hoping that he would contact the \u201cbuyer\u201d through his phone number, should any issue arise.\nIt was learnt that the car dealer got a call from his bank the following day that the cheque had been returned unpaid due to insufficient funds.\nYekini\u2019s efforts to get the suspects proved abortive as the information they provided was said to be false.\nThis propelled him to petition the EFCC for assistance.\nThe commission reportedly recovered the car in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, where it had been sold to a lady for N1,800,000.00.\nFurther investigations, the EFCC said, tracked the car back to Babatunde, who was arrested in his hideout in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\nWhile Babatunde was in the EFCC\u2019s custody, another complainant was said to have surfaced with a similar issue.\nAccording to the complainant, on September 7, last year, two men were at his filling station at Mokola, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, to negotiate for a 2007 Toyota Avensis car he displayed.\nHe alleged that after the negotiation, the \u201cintending buyers\u201d agreed to pay N2,000,000.00. Again, Bamidele reportedly issued a cheque to pay for the car.\nJust as he did in the other case, Babatunde also acted as the driver to the \u201cbig man\u201d he accompanied.\nThe suspect took the cheque to the seller\u2019s bank to \u201cdeposit\u201d the money and came back with a deposit slip.\nWhile they were testing the car, the car dealer told the suspects to hold on for him to confirm the status of the deposit from his account officer.\nBut before he could do so, Bamidele and his partner zoomed off with the car, since its keys and papers had been handed over to them.\nThe cheque with which he made the \u201cpayment\u201d was returned unpaid and efforts to contact the men were abortive.\nEFCC said its investigation revealed that Babatunde\u2019s modus operandi was to issue dud cheques to car dealers and abscond with the vehicles.\nSuch cheques were said to have either been stolen from unsuspecting persons or were linked to phoney accounts.\nThe EFCC said the cheque bearing the name of Rabiu Bamidele Lateef was stolen, adding that the owner, a pastor, had made statement to the commission to deny knowledge of issuance of his cheque for the transaction.\nApart from stealing people\u2019s cheques and issuing dud cheques to commit fraud, the commission said its investigations also revealed that Bamidele often used fictitious names in some of his transactions.\nWhen asked about the identities of his accomplices, Bamidele reportedly gave the name of Santar Ademola, said to have died.\nThe suspect was said to have committed a similar offence in 2017, when he was prosecuted by a sister agency for car theft.\nBut he was reportedly released from prison custody when the complainant stopped showing interest.\n\u201cMembers of the public are, by this report, advised to be wary when transacting business with people they do not know.\n\u201cThe commission is making frantic efforts to get other culprits arrested. They will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded,\u201d EFCC said.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Schools will be flooded with hundreds of extra pupils in the next two years, heaping pressure on stressed-out staff and creaking classrooms.\nRecruitment across the north and north-east has been a major problem, with teaching vacancies frequently re-advertised and authorities even flying to Canada and Ireland in the hope of attracting staff.\nIn some places, such as Longhaven, near Peterhead, schools have been mothballed due to the difficulties in finding teachers.\nAnd in Aberdeen, recent figures showed 2,846 staff days have been lost due to teacher stress since September last year.\nNow new figures, published by Scape Group, have suggested secondary schools in Aberdeen will experience one of the highest increased rolls in Scotland over the next two years \u2013 with 1,400 extra pupils. That is the equivalent of one new school, or 47 classrooms.\nIn Aberdeenshire, 800 extra pupils are expected by 2020/21 \u2013 equating to 27 new classrooms, or one school.\nA further 400 will join secondaries in the Highland Council area, while Moray Council \u2013 which is already building one new school with another two in the pipeline \u2013 is predicted to have another 300 pupils on the rolls.\nAccording to Scape\u2019s The School Places Challenge 2019 report, 13,600 additional pupils will join the secondary system by 2020/21.\nLast night Councillor Martin Ford, who sits on Aberdeenshire Council\u2019s education committee, said the figures indicated an \u201cextraordinarily rapid rate of growth\u201d that would be a challenge.\nHe said: \u201cIt is not just an issue of space, although it will require additional space, but also one of teaching staff and there are budgetary and resource implications for that.\n\u201cThe council will, of course, get additional grant funding from the Scottish Government but nevertheless this represents a major challenge to the council which it will simply have to meet.\u201d\nNorth East MSP Tom Mason \u2013 who is also an Aberdeen councillor \u2013 said he hoped the new Lochside Academy and plans for a new secondary at Countesswells would ease the pressure, but admitted the study was worrying.\n\u201cThis does highlight the huge challenge faced by the council in filling those classrooms with teachers. Staff shortages have led to a huge increase in stress-related absence in the last year,\u201d he said.\nBut city council co-leader Jenny Laing said the authority did not recognise Scape\u2019s figures, with their own data suggesting a 1,188 rise by August 2021 \u2013 which she insisted was provisioned for.\nMrs Laing said: \u201cThe current total pupil capacity across our secondary school estate is 10,678, so there is sufficient space within the existing estate to accommodate the predicted increases in pupil numbers until at least 2022.\u201d\nEducation committee member Martin Greig however, was concerned by the data and called for action to reduce pressure on staff and bulging classrooms given the ongoing housing developments in the Greenferns, Countesswells and Grandhome areas of the city.\n\u201cThe council needs to get a move on with planning and providing suitable accommodation for new pupils,\u201d Mr Greig said.\nLarry Flanagan, general secretary of teaching union EIS, said the oil industry\u2019s tendency to drive up wages meant that it had been difficult to recruit teachers to the north-east.\nMr Flanagan said. \u201cThe north-east has faced its own recruitment challenges and any increase in pupil numbers will exacerbate the challenges that are faced.\u201d\nIn Moray, the council has already committed to covering the rise in school pupils by building a new Linkwood Primary in Elgin and planning for two others to deal with the population boom.\nAn expanded Lossiemouth High School is also being built that will have an increased capacity of 800 pupils.\nBut Elgin City North Councillor Frank Brown said the prospect of a further 300 pupils would heap pressure on the already over-burdened teachers.\n\u201cThere is already a big problem with teacher recruitment in Moray at the moment for certain subjects and it is a bit like a postcode lottery for pupils at schools on what subjects are available to them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have specific problems with modern languages for example and to have 300 more children could restrict this availability even more.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get additional teachers then classrooms could expand even more.\u201d\nCouncillor George Alexander, a former teacher, however was \u201cfairly confident\u201d that Moray\u2019s eight secondary schools would have capacity to cope with the projected figures.\nCouncillor John Finlayson, chairman of Highland\u2019s Learning Committee, echoed Mr Alexander\u2019s stance.\nHe said: \u201cWe have 29 secondary schools and obviously we have to keep an eye on capacity as building continues in the area, but we have no undue concerns about the issue at the moment.\u201d\nA Scottish Government spokesman said: \u201cWorking with local councils since 2009 we will deliver 117 new school projects, benefitting 60,000 pupils, by March 2020, and we will look to build on that progress, investing a further \u00a31billion to rebuild and refurbish our schools.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

(Due to dynamic pricing, ticket prices are subject to change.)\nGarth Brooks\nMay 3-4: Garth Brooks, one of the most successful musicians of any genre, sat out much of the \u201900s and early \u201910s, vowing to remain semi-retired until his youngest daughter finished high school. He clearly missed the stage, as he launched a massive tour in 2014 that included 390 performances across more than three years, with more than 203,000 fans showing up to his 11 shows at Target Center. He has yet to score another breakthrough single that matches his early days, but there\u2019s still an obvious thirst among fans to see him live.

She\u2019s been a consistent hitmaker since her 2013 single \u201cThe Way\u201d went triple platinum.

They launched their farewell tour in May 2018 and played St. Paul\u2019s Xcel Energy Center in October. \u201cThis farewell tour has already been the perfect end to an incredible run,\u201d Rossington said in a news release last year. \u201cThere is still lots of road to go and lots of fans to see one last time.\u201d Like-minded jam band Gov\u2019t Mule is also on the bill. Initially a side project of the Allman Brothers Band, guitarist Warren Haynes has kept the group going for 25 years. 6 p.m.; Treasure Island Casino Amphitheater, 5734 Sturgeon Lake Road, Welch; $79-$32.50; 877-849-1640 or ticasino.com.\nMore double-headers: Coheed and Cambria and Mastodon (6:30 p.m. June 15; Armory; $159.50-$42.50), Michael McDonald and Chaka Khan (8 p.m. July 7; Mystic Lake Casino; $99-$49), Ben Folds and Violent Femmes (5 p.m. Aug. 14; Surly Brewing Festival Field; $49.50) and Hootie and the Blowfish with Barenaked Ladies (7:30 p.m. Aug. 22; Minnesota State Fair Grandstand; $90-$51).\nBackstreet Boys\nJuly 20: Grown-up boy band the Backstreet Boys return to St. Paul\u2019s Xcel Energy Center more than four years after their last full-length Twin Cities concert. Formed in Florida in 1993, the Backstreet Boys quickly rose to the top of the pop world, first in Europe and then the States. They peaked at the end of the \u201990s, with their first two albums each topping 10 million in sales.

Father John Misty, aka Joshua Tillman, recorded a series of albums as J. Tillman in the \u201900s and was a member of Fleet Foxes before he adopted his latest stage name, widening his audience in the process. Jason Isbell began his career as a member of the Drive-By Truckers and left the group in 2007 to start his solo career.

Some paid hundreds to see her perform at a Minneapolis club during last year\u2019s Super Bowl, but it turned out to be just an appearance, with the rapper standing on stage and posing for photos. She was also scheduled to open for Bruno Mars in September at St. Paul\u2019s Xcel Energy Center, but took herself off the tour after the birth of her daughter in July. Cardi B\u2019s first seven singles, from \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d to \u201cMoney,\u201d each went platinum or better and she\u2019s currently on the charts with \u201cPlease Me,\u201d a song featuring Mars. 7 p.m.; Target Center, 600 First Ave. N., Mpls.; $125-$49.50; 888-929-7849 or targetcenter.com.\nMore hip hop and R&B: Legends of Hip Hop (8 p.m. April 13; Target Center; $128-$55), Prince: In Concert on the Big Screen (8 p.m. April 26; Armory; $199-$69), Snoop Dogg (8 p.m. April 26; Treasure Island Casino; sold out), B2K (8 p.m. May 1; Target Center; $253-$52.50), Lizzo (8 p.m. May 5; Palace Theatre; sold out), Bobby Brown and Bell Biv DeVoe (8 p.m. May 10; Armory; $279-$52.50), Juice Wrld (8 p.m. June 1; Armory; $149.50) and the Roots (8 p.m. June 30; Mystic Lake Casino; $84-$49).\nRingo Starr and His All Starr Band\nAug. 22: Not that he\u2019s talked about retiring, but one can\u2019t help but wonder how much longer legendary drummer Ringo Starr plans to tour, given that he\u2019s turning 79 in July. He\u2019s currently performing with the 14th version of his All Starr Band, which he founded 30 years ago. It includes Colin Hay (Men at Work), Steve Lukather (Toto), Gregg Rolie (Santana, Journey), Hamish Stuart (Average White Band), Warren Ham (Bloodrock) and Gregg Bissonette (David Lee Roth).

He\u2019ll be singing songs from throughout his career in an evening dubbed \u201cThe Man. The Music. The Show.\u201d The Australia native\u2019s role in a 1988 Royal National Theatre production of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in London helped raise his profile outside of his home country. Two years later, he broke through on a massive scale playing Wolverine in \u201cX-Men,\u201d the first of many times he would portray the Marvel Comics superhero. Jackman went on to become one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, while continuing to do live theater on the side, including his Tony-winning role in 2004\u2019s \u201cThe Boy from Oz.\u201d Expect to hear Jackman sing numerous songs from his 2017 film \u201cThe Greatest Showman.\u201d 7 p.m.; Xcel Energy Center, 175 W.

Lynne and keyboardist Richard Tandy formed a new version of ELO in 2000 and announced plans for a tour that was subsequently canceled, leaving fans wondering if Lynne would ever hit the road again. But in 2014 \u2014 now under the billing Jeff Lynne\u2019s ELO \u2014 another new lineup sold 50,000 tickets to a London concert, opening the door for an album (2015\u2019s \u201cAlone in the Universe\u201d) and more new shows, including a summer North American tour.

Dubbed the Legacy of the Beast World Tour, the band\u2019s current outing was inspired by Maiden\u2019s mobile game and comic book of the same name. The set list focuses on the band\u2019s \u201980s output with some newer material included. Iron Maiden\u2019s most recent album, \u201cThe Book of Souls,\u201d hit No. 1 in two dozen countries and No. 4 in the U.S., where it set a first-week sales record for the group. 7:30 p.m.; Xcel Energy Center, 175 W.

{"text": "A protester at a 2017 demonstration against the repeal of net neutrality in Washington. Alex Edelman/Getty Images\nThe fight to bring net neutrality back from the dead got a major, if perhaps symbolic, boost on Wednesday. House lawmakers passed the Save the Internet Act, a Democrat-backed bill that would prohibit companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from slowing down, blocking, or charging websites to reach users at faster speeds, with a vote of 232 to 190. The act would restore the Obama-era net neutrality rules that Trump\u2019s Federal Communications Commission repealed in 2017. Right now, it\u2019s perfectly legal for internet providers to manage their traffic however they want, so long as the terms of service say they reserve the right to do so.\nBut the bill is unlikely to succeed in the Senate, where Republicans are in control. Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday that the Save the Internet Act would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d when it reached the Senate. On top of that, on Monday White House aides issued a recommendation that Trump veto the bill if it reaches his desk. But that hasn\u2019t dissuaded net neutrality advocates from encouraging people to contact their senators.\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai repealed the net neutrality rules in December 2017, despite a scandal-strewn public comment process that was rife with bot activity and faked participation, including comments posted with the names of dead people and foreign email addresses.\nDespite McConnell\u2019s statement, not all Republicans are against restoring the open internet rules. In 2018, lawmakers attempted to undo the FCC\u2019s net neutrality repeal by passing what\u2019s called a Congressional Review Act resolution, which allows Congress to overturn regulatory actions. The resolution narrowly passed the Senate, thanks to three Republicans\u2014Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, John Kennedy of Louisiana, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. But it failed to get the votes needed in the then\u2013Republican majority House. There may be a chance of mustering some bipartisan support again in the Senate.\nThe issue is wildly popular among Democrats, who have submitted millions of comments to the FCC in favor of supporting net neutrality protections. Democrats may see the issue as a way to keep voters engaged and as a mobilization strategy leading up to the 2020 elections.\nEven this legislation fails, there may still be some hope in the judiciary. The net neutrality repeal sparked a wave legal challenges, including from 22 state attorneys general and consumer advocacy groups. A federal appeals court in Washington heard arguments to undo the FCC\u2019s net neutrality repeal earlier this year and is expected to issue a decision at some point this summer.\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Mock drafts aren\u2019t just performed by media members looking for clicks or fans searching for entertainment.\nFor the Buffalo Bills, they help prepare for the real thing. During his annual pre-draft press conference Monday, General Manager Brandon Beane explained how he conducts a mock draft to get an idea of what might happen before the Bills go on the clock.\n\u201cWe give every scout [a] team,\u201d Beane said. \u201cYou're the GM of the Giants, the Raiders, whoever. Our pro guys go through what each team's needs are \u2013 what we see their needs are. Obviously, you're not necessarily supposed to draft for need, but teams still do it. At that point, you start looking and see where need and skill level fits. It's nice when you still fill a need.\n\"So they go down, and sometimes guys will pick it the way a lot of the mocks have it, sometime guys will do it how they have it in their mind. \u2026 We'll have some discussion on it. I'll make whoever is the GM of that team explain why their pick was if it's something out of the ordinary. I'll also put somebody in charge of the Bills, not me, and when they get to that pick, they'll have to explain what their thinking was, especially if it's something that wasn't obvious on the board.\u201d\nBeane sometimes will implement rules before his scouts make their picks, so that each exercise has a different outcome.\n\"I do dictate the mocks \u2013 sometimes I'll say, all right, you can't take this player or these three players have to be gone before we pick, something like that, just to mix it up, so that we don't get the same thing going,\u201d he said.\nThe idea is for the Bills to prepare for every situation that might unfold on the night of the draft.\n\u201cIf you do it enough times, it naturally will present different scenarios,\u201d Beane said. \u201cSometimes maybe you get a scenario you didn't think about. At No. 9, there's probably going to be less scenarios than what we were dealing with last year.\u201d\nThe Bills held the 12th and 22nd picks in the first round of the 2018 draft. Beane ultimately traded both selections, moving up from No. 12 to No. 7 in a trade with Tampa Bay that also cost the Bills two second-round picks and returned quarterback Josh Allen. The second trade up, though, is one that Beane admits he didn\u2019t prepare for. With linebacker Tremaine Edmunds slipping down the board, the Bills moved from No. 22 to No. 16, giving the Baltimore Ravens a third-round pick and getting a fifth-rounder in return.\n\u201cThere was no scenario where we got Josh and Tremaine,\u201d Beane said. \u201cI screwed that up last year. \u2026 We did all sorts of trade ups and trade backs with the first one, but I never did it with pick 22. We always made a pick at 22 or in scenarios, we used that pick to move up, so we didn't have it.\u201d\nMost mock drafts have a hit rate that fluctuates between atrocious and awful. Beane wasn't letting on how the Bills\u2019 predictions finished.\n\u201cWe got Josh,\u201d he joked.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\u00d7 Lincoln Hills civil rights complaints closed without charges\nMADISON \u2014 A federal investigation into alleged civil rights violations at Wisconsin\u2019s troubled youth prison has ended without charges, prosecutors announced Friday.\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Madison said an investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division found insufficient evidence that staff members at Lincoln Hills School had used unreasonable force against inmates repeatedly. The attorney\u2019s office said in a statement that prosecutors faced a heavy burden in proving that staff members willfully used more force than necessary.\n\u201cFederal prosecutors must not only prove that the force was excessive, but must also prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the staff member acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn this instance, there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a violation of the federal criminal civil rights statutes.\u201d\nProblems at the youth prison outside Irma in northern Wisconsin have been building for years. Workers say conditions got worse in 2011 when two juvenile prisons near Milwaukee closed and teens were consolidated at the facility. The FBI launched the probe in 2015.\nThe prison also has been the subject of multiple lawsuits, including one that resulted in a federal judge ordering sweeping reductions in the use of pepper spray, solitary confinement and shackles on juveniles.\nValerie Landowski, a spokeswoman for American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 6, which represents guards at the prison, said the union is satisfied with the a decision not to prosecute anyone. She said conditions at the prison have been deteriorating because former Gov.-Scott Walker\u2019s signature law stripping public workers of their collective bargaining rights has prevented the guards from negotiating to improve morale and safety, leaving them overworked.\n\u201cWhether or not they\u2019re exonerated in this particular case, we\u2019ll let the investigation speak for itself,\u201d Landowski said.\nWalker signed a bill last year that requires the Department of Corrections to close the prison by 2021 and allows the agency to borrow up to $40 million to build smaller regional facilities to house serious juvenile offenders and expand the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center in Dane County.\nCurrent Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has said the closure timeline is too aggressive. He wants to keep the prison open indefinitely until replacement facilities are built. The corrections department announced last month that it plans to build two new facilities in Milwaukee and Outagamie counties to house serious juvenile offenders.\nRepublican state Rep. Michael Schraa, chairman of the Assembly\u2019s corrections committee and one of the bill\u2019s chief sponsors, said he was pleased to hear the federal investigation had ended without turning up enough evidence to prosecute anyone.\n\u201cIt was a black cloud hanging over the (Department of Corrections) for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we visited the (youth prison) two years ago, that was one of the things they said, they felt like they were walking on eggshells. They didn\u2019t know when the hammer was going to fall. Now that it is concluded and there\u2019s no indication excessive force was used, I think the anxiety level for the (guards) will go down. That makes a better environment.\u201d\nSen. Lena Taylor, a Milwaukee Democrat who sits on the Senate judiciary committee, said in a statement that she doesn\u2019t have \u201ca ton of confidence\u201d in the information provided to investigators.\n\u201cWe know that something was very wrong at Lincoln Hills,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lawsuits, injured youth and records of excessive use of pepper spray and solitary confinement to support that belief.\u201d\nEvers\u2019 spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, issued a statement saying the governor looks forward to working to get juvenile inmates the support they need in settings closer to home.\nCass Bowers, the communications director for the Wisconsin chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit resulting in the reduction in the use of pepper spray and solitary confinement. He said in an email that the investigation doesn\u2019t affect their case but a decision not to file charges \u201cdoesn\u2019t amount to an endorsement of the practices that allegedly took place back before 2015.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

What I have done is, the mahurat was for 12.38 p.m., I have postponed it for 3.02 p.m., so that we need not offer food to the visitors,\u201d Naik told IANS.\n\u201cMy opponents had complained to the Election Commission because they know I am winning. This is not right. It must be the first time in history that such a thing is happening,\u201d Naik said.\nThe Congress has slammed the state poll authority for interfering in a private event organised by their leader and going overboard.\n\u201cHow does a wedding ceremony of a private individual, even though it is being organised for the son of our Shiroda bypoll candidate, affect the elections? We protest this interference. The election authorities have exceeded their brief in this case,\u201d Congress spokesperson Trajano D\u2019Mello told IANS.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A nagging challenge Rio Grande Valley officials face is a misperception of the area among people who have never been here. Wrong ideas of the Valley can cause people to decide not to bring their businesses and families here. We lose valuable investment, and they lose a chance to find a strong market for their wares and stable home for their families.\nThus, many people are justifiably irked at a recent report that paints the McAllen area as a haven for drug dealers and human smugglers.\nThe article, written by Isabel Vincent, appeared over the weekend in The New York Post, that city\u2019s alternative newspaper. It\u2019s a tabloid, in every sense of the word, with a reputation of basing articles more on rumor than on research.\nIt appears that Vincent originally came to the Valley to report on the asylum-seekers crossing our borders from the south and being brought by federal officials from the north. But she wrote another article describing McAllen as an \u201coasis of wealth and luxury,\u201d concluding that it \u201cthrives on trafficking near (the) border.\u201d\nVincent, like many visiting reporters, notes Hidalgo County\u2019s high poverty rate, with 34% of the population living in poverty.\nShe then points out that the area boasts a Maserati dealership and that McAllen\u2019s airport contains ads promoting Rolex and Cartier watches. There\u2019s even a polo club, and the city\u2019s only retail mall is described as \u201cupscale.\u201d\nThe writer concludes that such opulence can only come from illicit activities, and supports the conclusion by noting the conviction of former Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevi\u00f1o, his son and others involved in the notorious Panama Unit drug task force that was marred with corruption.\nVincent isn\u2019t the first reporter to apparently bring errant assumptions to South Texas. And sometimes those assumptions color perceptions. For example, people who hear of poverty-level residents and expect to see squalid slums aren\u2019t likely to find them. Hidalgo County\u2019s poverty is more heavily present in the rural areas; McAllen and surrounding cities are among the nation\u2019s fastest growing in area, population and wealth.\nA distinction also needs to be made between people who have no income and those with low income, like most Valley residents. They have jobs, although wages are at or near minimum. And somehow they are able to buy cars and even homes.\nIn addition, 34% is a high level of poverty, but it\u2019s obvious that two-thirds of the population lives above that level. And many McAllen-area residents, including doctors, lawyers, land developers and others, have reached enough success to afford a luxury automobile.\nYes, drug and human smugglers can be found here, just like they can be found in Houston, Chicago and other cities. But to suggest that all the area\u2019s wealth comes from illegal means obviously ignores the investment of time, energy and resources that carries many local residents to success.\nFortunately, The New York Post has a reputation of producing questionable information. We trust that most people will note the source, and recognize that this description of the McAllen area doesn\u2019t warrant serious consideration.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Dr. John Peter Robinson, a retired University of Maryland sociologist who found that people have more leisure time than they admit, died of stroke complications March 22 at Glendale Adventist Hospital in Glendale, Calif. The former Columbia resident was 83.\nCalled \u201cFather Time\u201d by his academic colleagues, Dr. Robinson spent most of his career at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was a professor of sociology and the director of the Maryland Survey Research Center.\nBorn in Rochester, N.Y., he was the son of Clifford Robinson, a phone company technician, and his wife, Frances Catherine, a homemaker. He was a 1953 graduate of the Aquinas Institute of Rochester. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and went on to receive three master\u2019s degrees: in mathematical statistics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, in psychology and another in sociology from the University of Michigan. In 1965, he received a doctorate in mathematical social psychology, also from University of Michigan.\nAccording to his academic biography, he was a professor of communication and director of survey research at Cleveland State University and an assistant professor in the department of journalism at University of Michigan before joining the faculty of the University of Maryland, College Park in 1980.He also was the director of the Americans Use of Time Project and of the Internet Scholars Project.\nHe was a co-author of the 1999 book, \u201cTime for Life: The Surprising Ways Americans Use Their Time.\u201d He also wrote scores of articles in social science journals related to time use. He made numerous appearances on radio and television outlets, including \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\nIn 1991 he was interviewed by a Chicago Tribute reporter.\n\u201cPolls and surveys consistently show that Americans are convinced that their leisure time is decreasing, Robinson says. But 24-hour behavioral diaries tracking what thousands of men and women actually do with their time tell a different story, the time expert says,\u201d the article said. \u201cAmericans have about 40 hours of free time a week, compared to 34 hours in 1965.\u201d\nThe article asked why does more time feel like less?\nDr. Robinson suggested a pace-of-life theory as explanation for the discrepancy.\n\u201cWe insist on trying to accomplish more,\u201d he said in 1991. \u201cBut the 24-hour day stubbornly refuses to accommodate us. Even apart from the demands of work and family, the activities crying out for a share of our leisure time can be overwhelming.\n''There are self-improvement courses, entertainment going on all over the place, new sporting activities and sporting goods, options for new hobbies, new magazines to read, even more channels to watch on television,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''We have more choices and more options in terms of things to do.''\nGeoffrey Godbey, a Pennsylvania State University professor who collaborated with him, said, \u201cJohn Robinson was a world authority on how people use time in daily life. His work shaped our understanding of what humans actually do in time and space. He was a pioneer in the use of time diaries and online methods of measuring people's use of time and how they perceived it.\u201d\nDr. Godbey recalled him as a colorful person who attended Burning Man Festivals, crossed the Soviet Union by car in winter, and was an authority on beer and the brewing of beer.\n\u201cMy father was an eccentric and an extravert. He would tell you, \u2018If you want to get something done, ask a busy person,\u2019 \u201d said his son, Stephen P. Robinson of Los Angeles. \u201cHe grew up in the Depression and as a result was frugal. He loved to buy things on sale and buy something scratched at a Woodward and Lothrop warehouse sale. He liked getting a good deal.\u201d\nProfessor Robinson was an avid beer aficionado who wrote articles for microbrewery magazines and was an investor in the Victory Brewing Co. of Pennsylvania. He was a world traveler whose favorite locations were London, Paris and Belgium \u2014 where he favored the beer. He was also a collector of British pub signs and other tavern-related memorabilia.\nDr. Robinson lived for many years in Columbia and later settled in Hyattsville. He also had a residence in Berkeley, Calif.\nA life celebration is being planned for September in Rochester.\nIn addition to his son, survivors include two sisters, Mary Daly and Shelley Oliver, both of Rochester; a brother, Paul Robinson of Atlanta; and two grandchildren. A daughter, Jennifer Lyn Robinson died in 2018. His marriage to Nancy Hagan, a writer, ended in divorce.\njacques.kelly@baltsun.com\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "SINGAPORE - Singapore\u2019s non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) slumped 11.7 per cent in March, after a short-lived rise of 4.8 per cent in February, on the back of the biggest year-on-year drop for electronics exports since 2013.\nEnterprise Singapore noted the \"high base\" effect from a year ago as it released the export data on Wednesday (April 17).\nStill, the March figure was way worse than the 2.2 per cent drop expected by analysts polled by Bloomberg. It is also the biggest year-on-year monthly fall in Nodx since the 12 per cent fall in October 2016.\nBefore February, exports had slid year on year for three straight months: 10.1 per cent in January, 8.5 per cent in December and 2.8 per cent in November.\nMarch\u2019s dismal showing was led by the 26.7 per cent year-on-year plunge in electronic exports, following the 8.2 per cent drop in the previous month, which means that this sector has contracted for about a year.\nIntegrated circuits (-22.2 per cent), personal computers (-46.3 per cent) and disk media products (-40.3 per cent) contributed the most to the electronics slump.\nHowever, experts suggest this could be indicative of the regional electronics market.\nMaybank economist Lee Ju Ye told The Straits Times: \u201cWe are seeing more signs of fading for the electronics sector, not just in Singapore but also in electronics powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan.\u201d\nShe added that the electronics downcycle may be nearing its bottom and that weak recovery in the industry may be seen in the second half when the US-China trade deal is finalised in May.\n\u201cThere are tentative positive signals, with PMIs (Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index) for most of Asia showing an improvement in March,\u201d she said.\nNon-electronic exports declined 7 per cent year on year, reversing from the 9.4 per cent increase seen in February. This was mainly due to shipments of pharmaceuticals (-36.5 per cent), specialised machinery (-24.4 per cent) and petrochemicals (-15.1 per cent).\nHowever, DBS senior economist Irvin Seah said: \u201cThe drag from pharmaceuticals can be discounted given its volatile nature and weak linkages with the rest of the economy.\u201d\nHe added that the 11.7 per cent plunge can be attributed to the \u201clingering effect of the trade war\u201d as well as a high base and ongoing slowndown in China.\n\u201cA turnaround in the sequential month-on-month figure as well as electronics demand will be crucial for an improvement in the overall manufacturing sector performance,\u201d he said.\nHe also sounded a more optimistic note looking ahead.\n\u201cWhile there could be more downside risk ahead, the ongoing trade negotiation between the US and China is seeing light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said, pointing to labour market conditions in the US remaining firm.\n\u201cStimulus measures from China could also start to spill over to Singapore\u2019s export performance in the coming months,\u201d he added.\nNonetheless, some other experts warned of slower growth ahead.\nNomura research analysts Euben Paracuelles and Charnon Boonnuch noted that the fall in Nodx growth was reflected in \u201clower-than-expected\u201d estimated GDP (gross domestic product) growth of 1.3 per cent year on year in the first quarter of this year, based on the Government\u2019s advance estimate.\n\u201cOverall, we remain cautious on the growth outlook,\u201d they said in a statement, forecasting GDP growth this year to be at 2.5 per cent, slowing from last year\u2019s 3.2 per cent. \u201cWe expect a deepening in the global tech downturn, which would leave the manufacturing sector vulnerable over the next few months.\u201d\nSingapore\u2019s non-oil exports to the majority of the top markets shrank in March, except for the United States (+23.1 per cent), said Enterprise Singapore on Wednesday.\nExports to Japan declined the most, at 36.6 per cent, following February\u2019s 42.6 per cent contraction. The other markets that saw large drops were Taiwan (-27.4 per cent) and Hong Kong (-22.4 per cent), while shipments to China shrank 8.7 per cent.\nNon-oil re-exports grew 5.9 per cent in March, following February's 7.2 per cent increase, due to growth in non-electronic re-exports which outweighed the decline in electronics.\nTotal trade decreased over the year by 0.9 per cent in March, with exports declining by 3 per cent while imports grew 1.5 per cent. On a seasonally adjusted basis, total trade reached $84.2 billion in March, lower than February's $87.1 billion.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It's fair to say that Donald Glover's summer 2018 Childish Gambino jam, \"This Is America,\" shook the internet.\nThe music video was packed with symbolism and it arrived like a crash of lightning, electrifying an audience hungry for a better understanding of the song's intent. Now, in Glover's new film Guava Island, a \"This Is America\" performance woven directly into the text helps us fine-tune that understanding.\nThe original music video that premiered in May 2018 was widely read as a commentary on systemic racism in the United States. The music's shifting moods \u2014 alternating between an African folk-inspired melody and a pulsing trap beat \u2014 were accompanied by imagery that leapt from joyful singing and dancing to scenes of violence and back again.\nMany saw that central dichotomy as a comment specifically on the experience of living as a black person in the United States. The song's lyrics explore that tension as well, with the chorus delivering a growling warning of \"This is America / Don't catch you slippin' up\" while Gambino later sings the cheery refrain, \"Get your money, black man.\"\nNow we have Guava Island, an hour-long fable set on the titular tropical paradise island that doubles as a sweatshop for a wealthy local family's rare silk export. Glover is Deni, one of the island's many unwilling silk workers who also happens to moonlight as a singer and performer.\nThe film is notably directed by Hiro Murai and written by Stephen Glover, Donald's brother. This trio is also a key creative force behind some of the most successful episode of the the FX series, Atlanta.\nIn an early scene, Deni reports to his job \u2014 at what looks like a factory that produces shotgun shells \u2014 and gets into an argument with one of his co-workers. The other man talks about how he wants to leave the island, because in America \"people are their own bosses.\" So he wants to bribe his way off the island, settle in the U.S., and start a business.\nDeni scoffs at this plan. \"This is America. Guava's no different than any other country,\" he says. \"America is a concept. Anywhere where, in order to get rich you have to make someone else richer, is America.\"\nTheir back-and-forth leads directly into Deni getting up on a wooden box and singing the opening \"We just want to party\" lines from \"This Is America.\" But this time, everything's different. The melody is slightly different. The song's slickly produced beats are replaced by the rhythmic whirs of factory machines. The dancers, the supporting cast, are all factory workers.\nThe shift in context makes all the difference. Deni is specifically not in America, nor is he a United States citizen in Guava Island. He's standing on the manufacturing floor of a bullet factory in a foreign country with an (as far as we're shown in the movie) all-black population. His job \u2014 everyone's job, really \u2014 is provided by a wealthy local family that we're led to understand demands total subservience in exchange for life's essentials.\nGuava Island is broadly about Deni's point that \"America is a concept.\" The people who live on the island are trapped into the same kind of system, even if they lack the luxuries \u2014 what Deni would probably refer to as the illusion of freedom \u2014 that people in the U.S. take for granted.\nThat's why Deni argues against leaving for America's supposedly greener pasture. He'd rather see his community fight for that freedom in their own home. As he says earlier in the \"This Is America\" scene, before breaking into song: \"[W]e live in paradise, but none of us have the time or means to actually live here.\"\nThe movie's remixed \"This Is America\" drives that point home. It wasn't ever about a specific place. It's really about this universal reality that oppression is a product of systems built to enrich a few on the backs of the many. That's as true in Guava Island as it is in the United States.\nGuava Island is now streaming for all Amazon Prime Video subscribers.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Read: Peter Strzok rejects accusations of anti-Trump bias\nOther than a cryptic comment during a Senate hearing that he was \u201clooking into\u201d potentially \u201cimproper surveillance\u201d of the Trump campaign, there is no indication so far that Barr plans to open such an investigation. But it seems that Republicans will grow only more vocal in their demands for it\u2014at least in part because they think it will help the president politically. On Friday, Trump himself tweeted that it was \u201cfinally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason.\u201d\nMany Republicans in Washington stressed to me that there are substantive things to be gained from an investigation. One senior House Republican aide\u2014who, like others I talked to for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to be frank\u2014told me it was important to many lawmakers that there be \u201caccountability\u201d for the likes of former FBI Director James Comey, former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and the former agent Peter Strzok, whom Republicans have long accused of improperly investigating and surveilling the Trump campaign because of their personal bias. Offering an example, Giuliani told me that an investigation could help determine why George Papadopoulos\u2019s conversation with an Australian diplomat\u2014in which the Trump campaign staffer said he\u2019d learned that Moscow had thousands of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails\u2014justified launching the Russia probe.\nBut Giuliani also suggested an alternative motivation that\u2019s gaining a foothold in Republican circles: that an investigation would keep Mueller\u2019s findings alive in a way that\u2019s helpful to the president. When I asked him what investigating the investigators would ideally accomplish, he said, \u201cGetting Jerry Nadler to be a household presence,\u201d referring to the House Judiciary Committee chairman, who is leading one of the congressional inquiries into the president. Giuliani then added, sarcastically, \u201cThe more people see Jerry, the more they will love him. He\u2019s so objective.\u201d\nIndeed, the more Republicans I spoke to for this story, the more obvious it became that their party\u2019s pleas for Democrats to put Mueller behind them may be little more than lip service. One Trump-campaign adviser said that they are more than happy for Democrats to hold firm and continue broadcasting their opinions about collusion and obstruction.\nOne former White House official told me that an investigation would allow Trump-campaign staffers to frame their message in much the same way they did in 2016, claiming that \u201cthe system is rigged against them.\u201d \u201cEveryone needs a bogeyman, and this gives them something to hang on to,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that everyone and their mother knows who Robert Mueller is, but if you told a Trump supporter that Democrats had used phony information to launch an investigation into their guy, it would absolutely fire them up.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\nIf you own a TV, and a sound system to go with it, you may have noticed cable creep, smudgy screen, dust bunnies and other horrors. Taking care of them is easy, and doesn't need to cost very much money.\nHere are five tips to keep your TV and home theater equipment in tip-top shape, ranging from from \"free\" to \"not so free.\" Where links to Amazon and other retailers are included, note that CNET may get a share of revenue from the sale of the products in question.\nKeep it clean\nHome theaters are literal dust magnets with the amount of static electricity flying around -- especially on TVs. Cleaning your system can not only help it look better, but many AV components will work better after a little maintenance: the most obvious being your TV screen.\nIf the television has grease spots from fingerprints, use a mild solution of soap and water -- you don't need a specialized screen cleaner -- and a damp but not wet cloth. Wipe it dry.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nThe next step is to remove dust around the TV and any associated equipment like an AV receiver or cable box. While manufacturers do make specialized wipes, a duster or the same lint-free cloth will also work.\nIf you have devices with cooling fans, these can collect a lot of gunk over time -- cleaning them will help them run better. Buy a can of compressed air to clean these fans efficiently from the outside -- don't open it up -- but make sure to unplug the device first. The \"air\" can have a lot of moisture in it, and you don't want to risk shorting your equipment.\nHide your cables\nCables are the lifeblood of any home theater or TV system, but no one likes looking at them. Hiding them away not only reduces clutter but also prevents potential tripping hazards.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nCable ties are a cost-effective way to organize the cables leading from the TV to other parts of an AV system. But don't buy single-use plastic ties -- instead get Velcro or even wire-based twist ties, as these are adjustable.\nWhen running cables together, try to keep AV interconnects and electrical cables separate. That prevents electrical interference, which can result in a degraded audio or video signal. Use the ties to fix the cables along the natural boundaries of AV furniture and walls.\nWhen wall-mounting a TV, you probably don't want a power and HDMI cable dangling down from the bottom. If you don't want to drill holes in your wall, use cable channels that attach to the wall and can be painted to suit your decor. Even better, buy white HDMI and power cables, which will also provide a cleaner look.\nIf the system includes surround speakers or Ethernet, the cables can go under rugs, along skirting boards, or inside specialized rubber duct covers that run across your floor. Mounting clips can be used to fix cables to the wall so they don't wander off. As one reader suggests, don't run power cables underfoot.\nBuy a surge protector\nSarah Tew/CNET\nConsider buying a dedicated surge protector that has enough outlets for all of the system's components. While power conditioners can run into the hundreds or thousands of dollars, you don't necessarily need these.\nPlenty of highly-rated surge protectors are available from about $30. Look for ones with 10 to 12 outlets. The Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge Protector\u200b pictured above has \"only\" 8, but it also offers space for large \"wall wart\" power packs, which is another key selling point. CNET's Geoff Morrison covers the things to look for when buying a surge protector here.\nBe aware that these devices can't really protect equipment from direct lightning strikes: A small wire fuse can do little to hold back the unrelenting power of Mother Nature. For the same reason, don't worry too much about plugging USB, Ethernet, or coaxial cables into your surge protector to protect from lightning. Some models offer connected devices warranties that may offer some comfort, but one CNET reader found it was like trying to get blood from a stone when they tried to make a claim.\nWall-mount the TV\nSarah Tew/CNET\nMounting a TV on the wall is one of the easiest ways to reclaim space in a living room, and not only does it look great, but it's really simple to do. (The harder part is hiding the wires, but that's what the aforementioned cable channels are for.) Here's everything you need to know about mounting a TV. OmniMount is a good starting point when shopping.\nGet a new TV stand\nSarah Tew/CNET\nIf you're using a table or even the floor(!) to house the TV and associated components, it might be time to invest in a dedicated TV stand. Ikea is usually the default, but also consider products from specialist companies such as Bell'O, Sanus and Salamander. If you're especially passionate about the look, you could enlist a local cabinet maker to build something custom.\nHere's what to look for:\nPlenty of ventilation\nIntegrated cable management\nShelves with line of sight for remote controls without having to leave doors open\nEnough room for all of the cable boxes, consoles and video streamers\nMost TV stands are grouped according to the size of your screen, which helps keep things looking neat, but be aware that if you're using discrete speakers, a really wide AV unit might mean the speakers are too far apart for a convincing stereo effect. In this case investigate mounting bookshelf speakers on the unit itself and wall-mounting the TV.\nHave kids? Tether those cabinets\nIf you have small children, or particularly boisterous friends, it's a good idea to tether the cabinet to the wall as well. Some units come with furniture tethering kits, but if not, these kits are available from places like Amazon or Home Depot for very little money.\nOriginally published March 2017.\nUpdated April 5, 2019: Adds more tips, new links.\n", "label": "human"}

Originally intended to complete a trilogy, Stormbird has been reworked so it can stand alone as a historical romance or still be read as connected to Turner's earlier works. IN OTHER NEWS: Set in Yorkshire in 1941, the book outlines an unexpected relationship that builds between a British war widow and a German fighter pilot in hiding, despite their countries' differences. \"People coming together, both having a need, having a loneliness, he's away from home, she's lost her husband,\" Turner said. \"It's relevant today as well, you know, these were just people ... remembering that people were just trying to live.\" The choice of time and place was quite deliberate, being the year and location the author's mother was born. \"A lot of the anecdotal imagery and the pictures and the descriptions of Leeds and the villages, what was going on and what life was like was exactly as my mum described,\" Turner said. \"Growing up in the rubble of people's homes was like we'd go to the park, it was what they did. \"My grandmother drove an ambulance around Leeds during the bombing raids, and it was full-on, everybody pitched in and I've tried to involve that in the story.\" Turner relocated to the Border in 2017 but has been a regular visitor all her life through family links. She has been pleased by the early response to her manuscript, which was shortlisted in the Emerald Pro Awards run by Romance Writers of Australia. As well as a Melbourne event, Stormbird will be launched at Wodonga Bowling Club on May 5 from 2pm, email info@karenturner.com.au to RSVP. \"Since moving up here, I've found an awful lot of support,\" Turner said. \"I love living up here and felt the need to give back.\" Receive our daily newsletter straight to your inbox each morning from The Border Mail.

{"text": "Over 1,100 Jet Airways pilots, who threatened to stop flying from Monday as they have not been paid salaries for the past three months, said they have deferred the decision as they wanted to give the debt-ridden airline \u201ca chance of survival\u201d. The move comes the same day as the airline suspended operations in SAARC and ASEAN regions indefinitely, besides extending suspension of its services to Toronto and Paris from Chennai and back.\nThe National Aviator\u2019s Guild (NAG), which these pilots are a part of, said that they reconsidered their strike in view of a \u201ccritical meeting\u201d planned on Monday between the airline management and the State Bank of India, which is leading the consortium of the airline\u2019s lenders.\n\u201cIt has come to our notice that there is a critical meeting planned tomorrow morning with the airline management and SBI. In light of the meeting, the members have requested, through their team leaders, that the call of \u2018No Pay No Work\u2019 be deferred to give the airline a chance of survival,\u201d a statement released by NAG said.\nJet has been reeling under a severe liquidity crisis, which has compelled it to ground jets for which leases have gone unpaid. On Friday (April 12), Jet had extended suspension of its international flights till Monday (April 15).\nThe airline is currently operating only seven aircraft (one Boeing 737 and six ATRs) across the country, which requires a minimum of 150 pilots. As of now, the airline has 1,450 pilots.\nSaddled with more than $1.2 billion of bank debt, the airline has been teetering for weeks and has yet to receive a loan of about $217 million from its lenders as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.\nThe pilots, along with engineers and senior management, have not received salaries since January. The debt-ridden carrier has also not paid March salary to employees of other categories.\nThe NAG had in late March called for no flying from April 1 over non-payment of salaries. However, on March 31 it deferred the agitation to April 15, saying it wanted to give more time to the new management.\nOn Friday, around 500 ground staff working at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) marched from the terminal to the airline\u2019s office in Andheri seeking clarity on the company\u2019s future. The management met with the pilots after the protests, but it did not prove to be fruitful.\n\u201cWe do not think the management will pay our salaries anytime soon. If the airline has no money and no salary is being credited, there is no point in flying. So we have decided to stop flying until we get an assurance from the management,\u201d a senior pilot associated with NAG said on condition of anonymity.\n(with agency inputs)\nFirst Published: Apr 14, 2019 15:25 IST\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "President Donald Trump has made clear that he does not want to spend more money on Puerto Rico \u2014 and Democrats won\u2019t agree to a massive bill providing relief for those affected by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires without it.\nThe deadlock has only become clearer in the days since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saw their own bills fail to pass on Tuesday, as Trump continued to criticize Puerto Rico and its handling of hurricanes Maria and Irma since they devastated the US territory in 2017.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody gains by a protracted standoff where both sides are pointing fingers,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, the Republican Whip, earlier this week. \u201cI hope that Schumer and McConnell can sit down and come up with a path forward.\u201d\nBut the White House escalated its attacks on Puerto Rico this week. On Monday, Trump called San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz \u201ccrazed.\u201d (Cruz responded on CNN, \u201cThe President lives in an alternative world where he tries to pin people against one another.\u201d) On Tuesday, Trump called Puerto Rico\u2019s politicians \u201cgrossly incompetent,\u201d who \u201cspend the money foolishly or corruptly.\u201d And on Thursday, the White House put out a \u201cfact sheet\u201d describing Puerto Rico\u2019s \u201cextensive history of mismanagement and corruption\u201d going back to 1999.\n\u201cCongress does not need to appropriate more funds for the recovery effort in Puerto Rico,\u201d stated the White House paper, arguing that the territory has not spent billions of dollars the federal government has already allocated.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have not taken such a hard line.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to shortchange Puerto Rico,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cBut in the meantime, we have other states that need help and I\u2019d like to see us go ahead and help everybody.\u201d\nThe GOP legislation authored by Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Richard Shelby would\u2019ve spent roughly $13.5 billion for rebuilding and recovery from natural disasters. The legislation also included $600 million to pay for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico, which Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 requested in November to protect the food stamp benefits of more than a million people.\nThe legislation was aimed at helping more than just the people of Puerto Rico. Sen. Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said that the handful of Democratic senators running for president should\u2019ve voted for the GOP bill to provide aid to the flood-ravaged parts of her state.\n\u201cA number of my Democratic colleagues have been finding their way all across Iowa, telling Iowans how important they are to them as the presidential caucuses are nearing,\u201d Ernst said, according to the Omaha World-Herald. \u201cAnd yet they voted to block the very funding that would help these families out.\u201d\nIn voting against the bill, Democrats argued that the GOP relief effort provided insufficient funding for Puerto Rico because it fails to include a variety of measures that were part of the roughly $14.2 billion relief package passed by Democrats who control the House in January. Those measures include funds that could be used by Puerto Rico to rebuild water systems and other infrastructure projects.\nSen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, has since offered to add a couple billions dollars for other disasters, including tornadoes that have hit the southeastern United States and flooding in the Midwest, to satisfy Republican concerns.\n\u201cOur opinion is that it is clear that the President is holding disaster aid to all American communities hostage over a petty, political grudge with the American citizens of Puerto Rico,\u201d said Leahy spokesman Jay Tilton.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Anyone happy with a season in which the Canadiens miss the playoffs isn\u2019t a real Habs fan.\nThis isn\u2019t house-league hockey for 6-year-olds. It\u2019s the best hockey there is in the world and it\u2019s worth reminding the more delusional fans around these parts that sports is all about winning. That\u2019s why we keep score.\nI agree that it was an exciting season, a vast improvement over last year, and you have to give credit to a team that finished 25 points higher than the season before. But a real turnaround season is what happened in Long Island/Brooklyn, N.Y., and Raleigh, N.C. Those places saw the Islanders and Hurricanes, respectively, fight back from bad seasons and claw their way back into the playoffs. If you want an inspirational story, look to the Isles. They lost their franchise player, John Tavares, and yet bounced back in ferocious fashion.\nI like this edition of the Canadiens way more than last year\u2019s team and I give props to general manager Marc Bergevin for bringing in Max Domi and Tomas Tatar \u2014 with Nick Suzuki in the wings \u2014 and ditching Alex Galchenyuk and Max Pacioretty. But missing the playoffs in three of the last four seasons is unacceptable.\nI am well aware that owner Geoff Molson won\u2019t be firing his GM any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we have to be high-fiving these guys. Are you still going to be a happy-go-lucky fan if they miss the playoffs again next season? Because it might happen.\nEnough of this malarky about how great the Montreal prospects are. Sure they\u2019re good, but as my fellow contrarian thinker, Simon Boisvert, said on the morning show on 91.9 FM Monday, there is no Sidney Crosby or Connor McDavid among those up-and-comers.\nI loved Saturday night\u2019s game as much as the next guy and I too jumped out of my seat with my hands in the air when Ryan Poehling scored his fourth goal of the night and won the game for Montreal in the shootout. Mais on se calme. This 20-year-old kid is going to be a good addition to the roster, but we\u2019re looking at a decent third-line centre here. And that is, of course, if Claude Julien doesn\u2019t stifle his development.\nThis is the most conservative hockey team in the universe and ever since they ran Guy Lafleur out of town, they\u2019ve remained obsessed with fitting every offensive talent into a defence-first cookie-cutter mold. Julien lives and breathes that tradition, as does Bergevin. They\u2019re allergic to exciting talent.\nYour Honour, I present as exhibit No. 1 Jonathan Drouin. It\u2019s a scary thing to see how this approach has sapped everything out of this young player. How do you expect him to shine playing with the youngest guy in the league \u2014 Jesperi Kotkaniemi \u2014 and Joel Armia? There is a lot of talk about trading Drouin, but that\u2019s absurd. With his contract and his pitiful performance during the final third of the season, they\u2019ll get nothing in return for him.\nThis management group needs to start being a little more innovative and a lot more aggressive, two things not normally found in the Molson/Bergevin tool box. They were conservative at the trade deadline and that was a mistake. One impact player could\u2019ve got them into the playoffs. Heck, one decent backup goalie would\u2019ve pushed them ahead of Columbus.\nMolson needs to stop hoarding his cash and open up the chequebook. There are some great free agents eligible to enter the market and they have to go hard after the big fish. That means taking a run at players such as Jordan Eberle, Matt Duchene, Jeff Skinner and especially Artemi Panarin.\nThe Canadiens aren\u2019t rebuilding. What this season showed is they\u2019re trying to contend and given that, they need to spend to the salary-cap ceiling and stop penny-pinching. Mostly they have to stop making excuses. Molson and Bergevin are doing their post-mortem Tuesday, but I can already tell you what they\u2019ll say.\nThat the kids gave us exciting games, showed real character and the future\u2019s so bright that everyone in the executive suites of the Bell Centre has to wear shades. That\u2019s just a public relations spin cooked up by their media-relations spinmeisters.\nOne reader wrote me to say that Buffalo has Jack Eichel, Sam Reinhart and Rasmus Dahlin \u2014 better than any player in the Habs\u2019 pipeline or on the roster \u2014 and how did that work out for them? Great prospects and $4.50 will get you a milky latte at Starbucks.\nThis management team wants to compete now, so they need the players to really compete with the big boys like Tampa Bay, Toronto and Boston. Otherwise we\u2019ll be sitting here at the same time next year once again wondering why the Habs are out and 16 other teams are in.\nbkelly@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/brendanshowbiz\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As an actress in the public eye, Meghan (n\u00e9e Markle), Duchess of Sussex understood that celebrity status, even if you\u2019re at the bottom of the rung, comes with some good, some bad and a whole lot of ugly. And in the three years since Meghan\u2019s relationship with Prince Harry catapulted her to global superstardom, she\u2019s weathered storm after shit storm of bullying on social media and in the tabloid press. If anonymous sources in questionable media outlets were taken at their word, the British monarchy is THIS close to toppling over because of a former Suits actress from California.\nBut as ugly as things have been, they just got way, way worse. That\u2019s because in the darkest corner of Twitter and YouTube, an ugly conspiracy theory has given birth to Meghan Markle pregnancy truthers who are convinced the duke and duchess are using a secret surrogate and that Meghan\u2019s growing belly is just Hollywood-level prosthetics. Per Elle, YouTube videos dedicated to proving Meghan\u2019s pregnancy is fake have amassed hundreds of thousands of views. Over on Twitter, truthers use hashtags like #Mexit, #Moonbump, # CharlatanDuchess and the very direct # meghanmarkleisNOTpregnant as a bat signal of sorts for fellow conspiracy theorists. Worst of all, Meghan\u2019s already oft-criticized gesture of cradling her belly, a natural maternal instinct, has been used as proof that she\u2019s just using it to hold up her fake prosthetic belly.\nFollowing Meghan and Harry\u2019s announcement of a plan to eschew the postpartum photocall for a more private celebration, truthers are doubling down and growing louder and more defiant online. And while it may seem easy to dismiss a small sect of Meghan Markle haters \u2014 you can\u2019t just Amazon Prime a secret baby to Frogmore Cottage, guys \u2014 it\u2019s actually dangerous and damaging. The press and public has already put Meghan through the wringer: she has to be good enough for Harry, regal enough for the British royals, attractive enough to compete with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and educated enough to take on the grind of royal work. Now they want her to prove she\u2019s really pregnant? No, I don\u2019t think so. This is where the Sussexes draw the line and their move to keep their birth private should be met with up-roaring applause by everyone, but especially women. The last thing a pregnant woman needs is additional stress, and these rumors are bound to impact Meghan.\nUnfortunately, living in a society obsessed with policing women\u2019s bodies means Meghan is not the first famous woman to be accused of faking a pregnancy. Back in 2011, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s every move was scrutinized by truthers who believed she was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy, using shadows and folds on a dress as proof that her pregnant belly was just a silicon prosthetic.

So, Logan County Deputy Casey Swingle set out against the odds, in the middle of the blizzard, to drive the medicine to the baby and make sure he survived.\n\u201cI\u2019m a father of three kids,\u201d Swingle said. \u201cIt was kind of one of those things. If I can make a difference, I can do it.\u201d\nBaby Edwin had a difficult road from the start. His mom, Riley, went into labor in Sidney, Nebraska, right at the height of the blizzard last month. There were white-out conditions when she and her husband tried to drive to the hospital, so they had to stop and call 911 for help.\nOfficers got them to the hospital in Sidney, where Edwin was born. But he was 12 weeks premature and his lungs were not developed. He needed a specific medication to survive. The hospital in Sidney did not have it, but Sterling Regional MedCenter did.\nDeputy Swingle knew how dangerous the roads were, but he was determined to do what needed to be done. He picked up the medication and headed toward the Nebraska state line.\nThe roads were covered in snow and ice. The winds were whipping.\n\u201cIt was gusts up to about 70 mph,\u201d Swingle said. \u201cThere were some snow drifts that were almost up to my truck's mirrors on the sides, crossing them, so like I said. I don\u2019t really know how I made it up there.\u201d\nBut he did make it. He met a Nebraska deputy at the border, who took the medicine the rest of the way.\nWhen Deputy Swingle tried to head back in the storm, he was blown off the road and into a ditch, where he was stuck in the storm for hours.\n\u201cIt was blowing and shaking the truck the whole six hours until CDOT actually came to my rescue with their bulldozer,\u201d Swingle said.\nIt was quite an ordeal, but those two deputies in two states made all the difference. Little Edwin got his medication and survived the night.\nThe next day, when the weather improved, he was flown to Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children in Denver where he is currently receiving care.\n\u201cThis baby is alive because of them,\u201d said Dr. Anna Zimmermann.

The American Red Cross set up a shelter at St. Eugene's Congregation and School near Port Washington Road and Calumet Road to help those who lost everything.\nNorth Shore Fire officials responded around 12:15 a.m. after 911 callers reported a significant fire in the building that was rapidly growing in the 62-unit building that's part of a four-building complex between Port Washington Road and I-43, just north of Brown Deer Road.\n\"I could see there was this bright orange light coming from this side, from around the corner,\" said Jaja Jarrar, tenant.\nBayside police officers on routine patrol arrived within four minutes of the call and reported a large body of fire on all three floors of the building -- extending to the attic.\n\"From 12:15 to 12:40, the whole apartment was ablaze.

We each took a cat -- threw them out the window,\" said Jarrar.\nIt wasn't easy for this couple to see what was left of their home.\n\"My heart broke. I thought maybe because we were on the first floor that maybe there would be some way something could be salvageable,\" said Jarrar.\nTheir two cats made it out of the fire that officials fought for nearly 10 hours.\n\"I think we were in a mode -- 'we have to keep moving,'\" said Jarrar. \"I don't want to think too hard about the things that I lost, because the cats are OK and that's what's important is that we're all OK.\"\nFire officials said the blaze started on a balcony, and it may have been electrical in nature.

And he couldn\u2019t hold it in.\n\u201cThat song came up, and I remember sitting on the deck, just crying my eyes out,\u201d said Vilardo. \u201cIt was lonesome. Being the youngest of nine, we were always doing things together, and to be separated like that, that was hard.\u201d\nVilardo\u2019s destination turned out to be the Philippines, where he spent one year, including the final months of World War II, after training stateside for two years.\n\u201cWe got there a week or two later after everything was over,\u201d Vilardo said of the fighting against Japanese troops near Manila. \u201cThere were still sniper shots \u2013 we could hear rifle shots. ...

The battalion never served in that capacity during wartime, however; it was sent to the Philippines as infantry replacements, Vilardo said.\nThe battalion was comprised of radar, searchlight and artillery units that used 90 mm guns. They participated in exercises in Texas but also had special training in Orlando. Vilardo, a radar operator, said his battalion had to construct and deconstruct a large radar unit \u2013 radar was a new technology at the time \u2013 that needed to be transported via truck. In exercises held at night, planes would take off from nearby airports, Vilardo and his fellow soldiers would track them on radar, helping searchlight crews find them for the anti-aircraft gunners.\nA staff sergeant, Vilardo described his military service as a time \"of honor, and of pride.\"\nHis unit was supposed to meet up with Gen.

{"text": "An illustration showing how a sliver of cometary building block material was swallowed by an asteroid and preserved inside a meteorite, where it was discovered by a Carnegie-led team of scientists. (Larry Nittler and NASA)\n(CN) \u2013 Much like the popular movie scene where scientists discover an ancient insect preserved in amber, a Carnegie Institution for Science research team announced its discovery of primitive dust particles from a comet encased inside a meteorite found on Antarctica.\nThe findings, published by Nature Astronomy on Monday, may offer clues to the formation and evolution of our 4.5-billion-year-old solar system. The ancient sliver of the building blocks from which comets formed was discovered inside a primitive class of meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites, thought to have formed beyond Jupiter and landed in Antarctica\u2019s LaPaz Icefield.\nScientists describe the LaPaz meteorite as a particularly pristine example showing minor weathering since landing on Earth\u2019s surface. By studying a meteorite\u2019s chemistry and mineralogy researchers can reveal details about its formation and how much heating and other chemical processing it experienced during the solar system\u2019s formative years.\n\u201cBecause this sample of cometary building block material was swallowed by an asteroid and preserved inside this meteorite, it was protected from the ravages of entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\u201d Carnegie study lead author Larry Nittler explained. \u201cIt gave us a peek at material that would not have survived to reach our planet\u2019s surface on its own, helping us to understand the early solar system\u2019s chemistry.\u201d\nNittler\u2019s team described finding a very carbon-rich slice of material that bears some striking similarities to extraterrestrial dust particles that are thought to have originated in comets that formed near the Solar System\u2019s outer edges. This object \u2013 about one tenth of a millimeter across \u2013 was captured by the growing asteroid from which the meteorite originated about 3 to 3.5 million years after the solar system formed, but long before Earth finished growing.\nScientists conducted sophisticated chemical and isotopic analysis of the material to determine that the encased material likely originated in the icy outer solar system along with objects from the Kuiper Belt, where many comets originate. Defined by NASA, the Kuiper Belt is a donut-shaped region of icy leftover bits from the early days of our solar system that astronomers are just beginning to explore.\nThe existence of this primordial material inside the meteorite indicates that due to the drag caused by the surrounding gas, particles like it migrated from the outer edges of the solar system where comets and Kuiper Belt objects formed, to the closer-in area beyond Jupiter where the carbonaceous chondrites formed. The material reveals details about how our solar system\u2019s architecture was shaped during the early stages of planet formation.\nMeteorites were once part of larger bodies, asteroids, that broke up during collisions in space and survived the trip through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Their makeup can vary substantially, reflecting their different origin stories from parent bodies that formed throughout the solar system.\nAsteroids and comets both formed from the disk of gas and dust that once rotated around our young sun, but they clustered together at different distances from the sun, each with a differing chemical makeup. Comets contain larger fractions of water ice and far more carbon than asteroids.\nCarnegie scientists Conel Alexande and Jemma Davidson, now at Arizona State University, Rhonda Stroud and Bradley De Gregorio of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and Josep Trigo-Rodr\u00edguez, Carles Moyano-Cambero, and Safoura Tanbakouei of the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona, Catalonia, made up the full research team.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "human"}

He\u2019s been sidelined since March 20 with a strained right calf and just completed a six-game rehab assignment with Class AAA Columbus. Brad Miller was designated for assignment to make room for Kipnis.\n\u201cBetter late than never,\u201d said Kipnis, who hit sixth in manager Terry Francona\u2019s lineup against the Mariners on Monday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the injury was going to be really serious when it happened.

I\u2019m excited to be back and hopefully we can have a good healthy season from here on out.\u201d\nMiller was given the bad news after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Royals. Kipnis, meanwhile, hit .136 (3-for-22) with two RBI at Columbus.\nFrancona, with the return of Kipnis, can finally see his lineup taking shape. Veteran outfielder Carlos Gonzalez joined the team Sunday in Kansas City, while shortstop Francisco Lindor is scheduled to start a rehab assignment with Columbus on Tuesday night in Louisville as he recovers from a strained right calf and sprained left ankle.\nThe Indians can use all the help they can get on offense.

We\u2019re going to have to do the little things, the dirty stuff.\n\u201cI like the guys they\u2019ve brought in -- Hanley Ramirez and Cargo (Gonzalez). Their leadership has come into play already. I think this team could use a little boost in the dugout and on the field. I\u2019m hoping to be that for them.\u201d\nWhen Manny Acta managed the Indians, he gave Kipnis the nickname \u201cDirt Bag\u201d because his uniform was always dirty from the way he played the game. He says he can still play that style of baseball.\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018He never goes first to third anymore,\u2019 \u201d said Kipnis. \"Well, I was having trouble getting to first base. I\u2019ve got to get there first.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s not up to other people to tell me how my body feels or how old (32) I am. I think my body tells me, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve still got a lot to give. That makes me excited with the way it has responded. I feel healthy and hopefully it responds out in the field.\u201d\nKipnis joined the Indians in Kansas City on Sunday, but didn\u2019t come to Kauffman Stadium. He went straight to the airport and waited for the team to finish its three-game series against the Royals. Meanwhile, the Indians were telling Miller that he\u2019d been DFA\u2019d because Kipnis was going to be activated.\nMiller was not happy and voiced his displeasure to reporters saying, \u201cobviously, they don\u2019t want the best players up here.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame him for not being happy,\u201d said Francona. \"It\u2019s not the news anybody wants to get. You\u2019ve got to remember a couple things. One, you catch a kid after he\u2019s just been let go and he\u2019s emotional. We look at it from a team perspective and he looks at it from his own perspective. I understand that.\n\"He was starting to hit the ball a little bit. But when you get a left-handed second baseman (Kipnis) back, we need to make sure our utility guy can play shortstop and Frankie (Lindor) is coming back pretty soon. So there are other things to think about.\n\u201cYou always want to be honest with a guy, but you can\u2019t tell him everything. He handled it really well with me. I know he was disappointed.

In a new interview with Elle, the 38-year-old reality star revealed the details of her children\u2019s wild April Fool\u2019s Day prank on their dad, Kanye West, 41. \u201cI do worry about them getting along, because for my sisters and I, we were just so close growing up and obviously still are,\u201d Kim started off by saying. But \u2013 she went on to explain that North, 5, and Saint, 3, are more of a team than she initially thought. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to get closer now that she can include him in her jokes. She roped him into an April Fool\u2019s prank yesterday that was ridiculous. She took ketchup into my bathroom, and she begged me to let her spread it on me, and on the bathroom, as if it was like a bad scary movie,\u201d Kim explained. \u201cThen she asked me to lie down. I thought she was just playing, maybe that she was going to say I was hurt. No. She taught Saint how to fake-cry\u2014she showed him how to do it!\u2014and then she told him to scream \u2018Mommy\u2019s dead!'\u201d Ok, it looks like 3-year-old Saint is already following in North\u2019s fun-loving footsteps.\nNeedless to say, Kanye wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of the wild prank. \u201cKanye ran upstairs and he was like, \u2018Kids, this is not funny. This is not a good prank,'\u201d Kim said in the chat. The famous mom was on the same page as her hubby, but she wasn\u2019t entirely upset about the prank. \u201cI completely understand and I agree. But it did make me a little impressed that they planned something together, and they were getting along and having fun as a team,\u201d she told the mag.\nWhile Kim is an all-star mom herself, she took the interview as an opportunity to gush about her own mother, Kris Jenner. Kim explained that she attributes a lot of her success to the \u2018momager.\u2019 \u201cI am very fortunate that my mom and I have worked together from the very beginning of my career. She is the best negotiator, and that\u2019s always been her role. I didn\u2019t have that loud personality in the beginning that allowed me to negotiate for myself. I was really insecure about how to negotiate for myself, and so I would always look to her to show me how to do that for myself,\u201d Kim sweetly said. One thing\u2019s for sure: Kim also inherited some excellent parenting skills from her momma, and her own kid\u2019s are not lacking in creativity!\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Letters will be delivered to agencies en masse \u201clater this week\u201d\n\u201cThousands\u201d of members of the Writers Guild of America have signed the form letters informing their agencies that they could no longer represent them, WGA West president David A. Goodman said in a letter to members Monday night.\nThe total number of signatories was not stated, but the letter comes just three days after the 43-year-old agreement between WGA and the Association of Talent Agents expired without a new deal in place, putting a tough new code of conduct for talent agents, intended to end the practice of packaging, into effect.\nThe form letters are still being collected, and will be delivered en masse to the agencies \u201clater this week,\u201d Goodman said. The ATA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheWrap.\nAlso Read: Can Writers Still Get Work After Firing Their Agents and Other Burning Questions About WGA Dispute\nPackaging was the main point of contention preventing WGA and ATA from hammering out a new agreement. WGA says packaging is a conflict of interest for agents and that it has caused a decline in writer earnings. The guild is demanding agencies end packaging outright, and on March 31, WGA members overwhelmingly voted to approve the new code of conduct.\nATA has steadfastly defended packaging, contending that writers earn more money because of it; WGA disputes that assertion.\nIn his statement to members Monday, Goodman addressed member criticism of the form letters, which the guild has made mandatory for members.\nAlso Read: Talent Agents Plan Fight Against WGA, Lay Out Standard of Representation for Agents\n\u201cSome members have reached out to me and other members of the negotiating committee asking why these letters are necessary at all,\u201d Goodman wrote. \u201cOther members feel that the letters are inconsistent with what we first mentioned in our outreach meetings about the agency campaign \u2013 that no writer would have to individually fire their agent.\u201d\nGoodman said that the guild has determined that having each member individually fire their agents by signing the letter, rather than having WGA fire agents on their behalf, best protected members from any \u201cfuture potential commission dispute.\u201d Goodman also described this as \u201can overt statement of strength\u201d against agencies. Goodman also said that having each member sign the letters, followed by WGA delivering them all at once, was a more effective form of collective action.\nRead the whole letter below:\nDear Members,\nOver the weekend, it\u2019s been remarkable to see members taking to social media to share their support for the WGA as we rolled out the Agency Code of Conduct. The hashtag #IStandWithTheWGA started trending nationwide. Many members shared screenshots of their signed letters to their agencies, along with their eagerness to resume working with their agents once a deal could be reached that puts clients over conflicts.\nThousands of members signed their letters in the first hours after the code was put in place, and the number keeps growing. As we said in the initial email, we\u2019re gathering all the letters and will deliver them to each agency later this week. Some members have reached out to me and other members of the negotiating committee asking why these letters are necessary at all. Since the Guild has implemented the Code of Conduct, isn\u2019t that enough? Other members feel that the letters are inconsistent with what we first mentioned in our outreach meetings about the agency campaign \u2013 that no writer would have to individually fire their agent. So I want to talk for a moment about why we ultimately decided the letters were necessary.\nMany things about this negotiation have required us to keep updating our strategy and tactics. We have never had to take an action like this with our agencies, and the last time this agreement was negotiated was 43 years ago. We determined that the best legal protection for writers against a future potential commission dispute was to have each individual terminate their agreement. Then your elected board and negotiation committee came to the conclusion a few weeks ago that it made the most sense in this situation, as a matter of political solidarity, for us to find a way to collectively state our position to the agencies. In a strike, our position is clear when we respect the picket line; in this situation we need an overt statement of strength, given agency efforts to question our 95.3% vote, and this is what we decided.\nHad we instructed members to individually email their agents, that felt like it violated the spirit of what we\u2019d promised. It put members in the awkward spot of firing their agents one by one. That was the motivation behind doing the form letter. By delivering all the signed letters together, it allows us to do what unions are designed to do: take a collective action on behalf of all members.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it this way. We did not communicate this clearly, and for that I apologize. I want every member to feel that they understand why the Guild does what it does, that we listen when they have concerns, and that we correct our mistakes. I\u2019m constantly impressed by the members of this Guild.\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about why the e-signed letter is mandatory rather than optional.\nWhen the Guild takes action, we do so as a group. While we encourage members to communicate directly with their agents, we don\u2019t ask an individual member to take a stand. We do it together. In addition to protecting you as an individual, the e-signed letters protect us all from any agency claim that our 95.3% vote wasn\u2019t real \u2013 that people voted one way and acted another. They are already suggesting that. What this action does is show each individual writer that they are not doing this alone. The instructions for filling out the letter can be found here.\nThis is our power, and it is at this moment that we need to show it.\nIn Solidarity,\nDavid A. Goodman\n", "label": "human"}

Opponents are calling it a \"gag rule.\"\nThe rule is set to take effect next week, unless the courts intervene. Attorneys general in 20 mostly Democrat-controlled states, including Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are leading a lawsuit challenging the rule.\nDr. Leana Wen reflects on her four years as Baltimore health commissioner as she prepares to take the helm of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

(Kenneth K. Lam / Baltimore Sun video) SEE MORE VIDEOS\n\"With all our champions and supporters, this is the time to be going on the offensive where we can,\" said Wen, a physician who is Baltimore's former health commissioner.\nWen cited Maryland as a leader among states opposing the rule. Earlier this month, Maryland became the first state to pass a measure that would end participation in the program if the rule takes effect. Maryland's legislature is controlled by Democrats, and the bill now goes to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. A Hogan spokesman says the governor will review the bill when it officially reaches his desk. A Maryland law from 2017 would provide state funds for family planning.\nThe Democrat-controlled Massachusetts House and Senate this month also approved state money to offset the potential loss of federal funding due to the rule change, a measure signed by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker.\nOther blue states also are considering whether to opt out.\nMeanwhile, Republican-leaning states have been working to start new legal battles that could prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit its 1973 decision that legalized abortion.\nAlabama has introduced legislation that would make performing an abortion at any state of pregnancy a felony unless the mother's health is in jeopardy. Kentucky and Mississippi have approved bans on abortion once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which happens as soon as the sixth week of pregnancy.\nOn Monday, the Tennessee General Assembly approved a proposal that would effectively outlaw most abortions in that state, if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\nReligious conservatives and abortion opponents argue that Title X funding has been used to indirectly subsidize Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider in the nation. They have welcomed the president's rule change.\nTitle X family planning clinics get federal funds to provide people with comprehensive family planning and preventative health services, according to a Health Resources & Services Administration website.\nSee also: Leana Wen reflects on four years as Baltimore health commissioner before becoming Planned Parenthood president \u00bb\nWen said Title X funding is not used for abortions. The funding is used to provide low-income people with affordable birth control, as well as primary and preventive care, including cancer screenings and HIV tests. She said it would not be acceptable in any other medical field for doctors not to provide patients with full medical information.\n\"This is about restricting the practice of medicine,\" Wen said. \"It's about politicians making decisions for doctors and for patients. It's about politicians restricting the ability of doctors to give our patients full and accurate medical information.\"\nPlanned Parenthood, which serves 1.6 million of the 4 million women who get care through Title X, has said it will leave the program if the rule is implemented.\n", "label": "human"}

Right now, our kids or grandkids are likely in the other room playing Fortnite with 99 of their \u201cfriends.\u201d What different about this? Those friends are not the kids next door or the kids at school, but cyber-friends scattered across the globe. For the first time in human history our sense of community is not limited by geography.\nThis is frightening for some, thrilling for others.\nThe obvious upside is the cultural understanding and comity one-on-one interaction fosters. When we play together, share our music, our interests, our hopes and dreams, we not only learn and grow but acquire an appreciation for not how different we are from each other rather how similar. Travel has been democratized. Even the agoraphobic can interact with the world.\nThe downside is equally profound, the loss of connection to our physical community, a weakening of the ties that bind us to our country, our state, our city, our neighborhood. Abraham Lincoln famously called these intangibles the \u201cmystic chords of memory,\u201d the shared experiences that link the generations.\nAsk your teenager or 20-something how they feel about their country.

New ideas are seeds planted for a better future. Today, they spread instantly and globally, right into the phones in our hands. The old systems are fighting for relevance. Maybe a losing battle.\nThe sultan of Brunei \u2014 already an anachronism \u2014 imposed draconian sharia law penalties after activists inspired by liberties enjoyed in other countries began fighting for their basic human rights. Now, gays, lesbians and adulterers face death by stoning. Thieves face dismemberment and other equally medieval measures that have no place in the 21st century. The world is rallying to the sultan\u2019s oppressed subjects, pressuring him to reverse course. Change is rarely easy but it is inevitable.\nMillions of young people are growing up in a world connected in ways unthinkable just a few years ago.

(Ryan Michalesko/The Dallas Morning News)\nThe Cowboys have put themselves in position to basically draft the best player available when they go on the clock later this month. That doesn't mean there aren't some positions with bigger needs than others.\nTo get you ready for this year's NFL draft, we're counting down the positions that have the biggest need on Dallas' roster.\nQuarterback, offensive line and linebacker are not part of this series. The Cowboys are unlikely to draft another quarterback. Dak Prescott, Cooper Rush and Mike White are expected to be the top three on the depth chart entering training camp. There could be some interest in finding another offensive tackle, but it's not considered a significant need at this point. Leighton Vander Esch and Jaylon Smith have quickly made linebacker one of the team's greatest strengths. Dallas could draft a linebacker late for depth and special teams purposes.\nWe begin with No. 7, cornerback.\nON THE ROSTER\nByron Jones recently had hip surgery and is expected to be ready for the start of the season. However, he's entering the final year of his rookie contract. Coming off his first Pro Bowl appearance, Jones is the Cowboys' top corner and a player they'd like to extend long term. But they need to have a backup plan just in case the two sides are unable to come to an agreement.\nChidobe Awuzie, Anthony Brown and Jourdan Lewis provide the Cowboys with quality depth for the upcoming season, but things start getting thin a year from now. Brown is entering the final year of his contract. Awuzie and Lewis each have one more year remaining.\nWho are some possibilities for the Cowboys in this year's draft?\nIN THE DRAFT\nCowboys defensive backs coach Kris Richard prefers tall corners with long arms. If the position was of bigger immediate need, Houston's Isaiah Johnson would make a lot of sense at pick No. 58, Dallas' first selection in this year's draft. Johnson is 6-2 with 33-inch arms. Richard comes from a Seattle organization that has openly admitted to seeking corners with at least 32-inch arms.\nThe Cowboys are more likely to target some depth at the position in the final two rounds. Two players that could be available in the later rounds include Baylor's Derrek Thomas and Kentucky's Chris Westry. Thomas is 6-3 with 33 and \u00be arms. Westry is 6-4. He was not invited to the combine and his arm length has not been made available.\nBoth players have had official pre-draft visits with the Cowboys.\nNeither put up outstanding statistics in college, but both are viewed as low-risk, potential high-reward type prospects that could flourish under Richard's coaching.\nSeries schedule\nCounting down the Cowboys' draft needs by position, from least in need of reinforcements in the NFL draft to the unit that needs the most help:\nSunday, April 14: Cornerback\nMonday, April 15: Running back\nTuesday, April 16: Tight end\nWednesday, April 17: Wide receiver\nThursday, April 18: Defensive end\nFriday, April 19: Defensive tackle\nSaturday, April 20: Safety\nTwitter: @jonmachota\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Golden State Warriors have been a fixture in the NBA Finals for four years straight and if the various oddsmakers and prognosticators around the globe are to be believed a fifth appearance is on the horizon. FiveThirtyEight, Caesars Palace, the Westgate SuperBook, 5Dimes and many others all see Golden State as the prohibitive favorite to represent the Western conference in the NBA Finals with little stopping them from a third straight title, their fourth in five years.\nYet this time, coach Steve Kerr and his squad are coming to the playoffs in less intimidating fashion than in years past. For example, they suffered eight 20-point losses in 2018-19, almost as many as the last four seasons combined (11). They had no such losses during the 2017-18 season. Plus, according to Nick Friedell of ESPN, no NBA champion has suffered more than six during a title run.\nTo be fair, the Warriors have made no secret they value long-term health more than regular-season success, but while a 57-25 record gets them home-court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs it does not ensure them four home games at Oracle Arena if they were to face either the Milwaukee Bucks (60-22) or Toronto Raptors (58-24) in the 2019 NBA Finals. And that is pretty much the only factor that should keep the Warriors from another trophy.\nSince Kerr took over in 2014-15 the Warriors are 173-32 at home during the regular season (.844 win rate) and 39-6 during the playoffs (.867). The rest of the NBA has win rates of .576 and .601, respectively. As you can see, home-court advantage has been very good to Golden State and the lack thereof would reduce their chances of winning a seven-game series against either the Bucks or Raptors.\nAccording to the website WhoWins, when the team with home-court advantage loses the first game of the series they still have close to a 50/50 chance at winning the title. After taking into account a team\u2019s actual win-loss record; its expected win-loss record based on points scored and allowed, also known as its Pythagorean winning percentage; and their regressed win-loss record to account for a small sample size of only 82 games played, the Bucks are also better than the Warriors \u2013 at least on paper. We would expect this iteration of the Bucks to win a seven-game series against the 2018-19 Warriors 63 percent of the time.

It shouldn\u2019t. Research from Fivethirtyeight\u2019s Neil Paine found home-court boosted an NBA team\u2019s chances of winning by 10 percentage points during the regular season and as high as 14 percentage points during the playoffs. Plus, the Bucks finished the season outscoring opponents by a league-high 8.6 net points per 100 possessions behind the third-best offense and second-best defense. They have the MVP front-runner in Giannis Antetokounmpo, a Coach of the Year candidate in Mike Budenholzer and are capable of keeping up with the Warriors 3-point barrage.\nToronto would be a 51 percent favorite over Golden State in a seven-game series. In other words, the ability to play four games at Scotiabank Arena helps makes up for a perceived lack of talent on Toronto\u2019s roster in comparison to Golden State\u2019s super team. And remember, those numbers are perhaps low after the Raptors played 22 games without their best player, Kawhi Leonard, this season. When he was in the lineup Toronto outscored opponents by 7.8 net points per 100 possessions. That dropped to a net rating of 3.2 points when he was on the bench or in street clothes, roughly the difference between how the Bucks (plus-8.6 net rating, 60 wins) and Oklahoma City Thunder (plus-3.4 net rating, 49 wins) fared this season.\nThe Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are having fine seasons, but without home-court advantage to tilt the odds in their favor, neither would have a significant chance to defeat the Warriors in a potential NBA Finals matchup. The Celtics would be estimated to win that series just 29 percent of the time with the 76ers just a tick worse at 28 percent.\nAnd if you are looking for the Denver Nuggets or Houston Rockets to knock off the Warriors before then, don\u2019t. They would each have a 36 percent chance to defeat Golden State in a seven-game series.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Mocks are starting to expand as the 2019 NFL draft is now just two weeks away. The Dallas Cowboys are without a first-round pick, so it\u2019s been a strange feeling seeing mock after mock come and go and not have them included, but now things are starting to shift. ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper has checked in with another installment of his world-renown (and often debated) mocks, this time going three rounds deep.\nThe Cowboys were given help to both their offense and their defense in this iteration, as Kiper tended to both the defensive line and the skill positions.\nRound 2 (58): Gerald Willis III, DT, Miami (FL)\nRound 3 (90): Jalen Hurd, WR, Baylor\nLike the Browns, the Cowboys got a star receiver for their first-round pick, and they\u2019re thrilled. Amari Cooper instantly made them a playoff contender last season. But their roster does have a couple of holes, particularly at safety and defensive tackle. Dallas\u2019 problem is that there could be a run on safeties at the top of Round 2, which means it could miss out on guys like Juan Thornhill, Chauncey Gardner-Johnson and Deionte Thompson. Jerry Jones & Co. can then move on to address the other need, taking Willis, a powerful tackle who had 18 tackles for loss last season.\nHurd is a 6-foot-5 wide receiver who played running back at Tennessee before playing a season at Baylor. He has an intriguing size/speed skill set, though he\u2019s still learning the position.\nFans may be groaning that Dallas didn\u2019t grab a safety, but like Cowboys\u2019 Wire\u2019s concern from our Monday mock draft, there was a huge run on safeties earlier in the second round.\nNow, there were two safeties who were part of Dallas\u2019 30-visit class remaining, Taylor Rapp and Will Harris, but Kiper didn\u2019t ship those players until the third round.\nWillis III, another of the 30 visitors, is an interesting prospect. From our scouting report:\nWillis reminds me of current Cowboys defensive tackle Maliek Collins coming out of Nebraska, as he is a nimble athlete for his size, who uses his agility and aggressively active hands to get past blockers and play in the opposing backfield.\nHis technique prevents him from playing with a great deal of power against the run or as a pass rusher, but he spends enough time in the opposing backfield and makes enough splash plays that he\u2019s someone who should be considered valuable at a certain point in the draft. He will make a few plays as a rookie but also has the potential to give up a few big plays in the run game until he is able to play with a more consistent pad level and keep himself from getting washed out of the play on a regular basis.\nHe has the potential to be a starting level under tackle in the Cowboys defense by year 2 or year 3 if he is able to be a more consistent player against the run.\nGrade \u2013 Late 3rd/Early 4th round\nHurd was not one of Dallas\u2019 30 visits, but as a Baylor product they should be relatively familiar with him. He transferred from Tennessee where he was a running back, and is very raw but athletic.\nGallery Cowboys 7-round Mock Draft: April 8, 2019\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Right now, global oil markets seem ecstatic. A big source for this enthusiasm is courtesy of OPEC, the massive oil cartel that has been working diligently to establish balance in the markets and prop up prices in the process. The end result, so far, is turning out well for oil bulls, as plummeting output from the group points to, at worst, an almost balanced market for crude this year and, at best, a scenario where inventories are far too low for a glut to arise come the start of 2020. Either way, investors in this space should be happy with current conditions and any company that benefits from higher oil prices should be considered a viable prospect.\nOPEC production plummeted\nAccording to OPEC\u2019s monthly report, the amount of oil produced by the group in the month of March plummeted compared to where it was in prior months. In the image below, for instance, you can see that crude production from the group came in last month at 30.022 million barrels per day. This represents a decline of 0.534 million barrels per day from the 30.557 million barrels per day seen a month earlier and it helped bring the first-quarter average from the group down to 30.45 million barrels per day.\n*Taken from OPEC\nLeading the path in declines, unsurprisingly, was Saudi Arabia. According to the data provided, the nation\u2019s output fell 0.324 million barrels per day in March, falling from 10.118 million barrels per day to 9.794 million barrels per day. Other nations posting big declines included Iraq, which reported a drop of 0.126 million barrels per day, and Iran, which reported a drop of 0.028 million barrels per day. The decrease from Iran should not be surprising given sanctions and the fact that some nations that had received waivers from the US regarding output have been scaling back their purchases. The only country to post a sizable increase in production during the month was Libya, with output rising 0.196 million barrels per day from 0.902 million barrels per day to 1.098 million barrels per day. This could, however, be temporary (as could the drop in Iraq) because of militant activities within the country.\nAside from Saudi Arabia, the country that posted the largest decline in production was undoubtedly Venezuela. During the month, Venezuela\u2019s production came in at 0.732 million barrels per day, down 0.289 million barrels per day from the 1.021 million barrels per day seen a month earlier. This is the largest one-month drop I have ever seen from Venezuela, and while some of the decline may be temporary thanks to blackouts that have negatively-affected the South American nation, most of the drop will probably remain in place for the long haul due to a collapsing economy and heightened international sanctions against its government by the Trump Administration. In all likelihood, output will continue declining there for the rest of this year. It\u2019s worth noting that Venezuela even acknowledged the drop, with its publicly-announced estimates showing output falling 0.472 million barrels per day from 1.432 million barrels per day to 0.96 million barrels per day (their numbers have always been more attractive than the OPEC-estimated ones).\nThis year is looking great for the bulls\nLooking solely at the first quarter of this year, it\u2019s clear that there was a build-up of oil. According to OPEC\u2019s own estimates, total commercial oil inventories among OECD nations last year ended at 2.873 billion barrels. The amount of excess production in the first quarter of this year came out to 0.43 million barrels per day. If all of this went to OECD nations, then it would imply inventories today of around 2.912 billion barrels. As you can see in the table below, this would translate to about 60.74 days worth of supplies among OECD nations. Generally speaking, a glut is signified at any measure north of 60 days worth of supply. This, then, would imply a glut today of about 35.48 million barrels.\n*Created by Author\nWhile this looks bad in and of itself, if OPEC continues to produce at the level seen in March and that lasts for the remainder of this year (I suspect production will continue declining, so this is a conservative assumption), and if all excesses or deficits are reflected in OECD inventories, then by the end of 2019, we should see stocks of around 2.809 billion barrels, about 64 million barrels lower than last year\u2019s end. Given growing OECD demand, this should result in output that is about 91 million barrels shy of hitting glut territory, with the trough hitting 146.10 million barrels shy of it at the end of the third quarter this year. This does not necessarily mean that we will be in a state opposite a glut, but it will mean we have some nice wiggle room should estimates prove to be wrong and we should see oil price at rather attractive levels ($65 to $75 per barrel for WTI, I believe).\nIn the same table, you can see the same analysis repeated, but this time in a world where any excesses or deficits are reflected only in half in OECD nations. After all, the oil market is a global one, and just less than half of all of it consumed this year will be among OECD nations. In this scenario, the picture does look less attractive on the whole, but we would still be around 59 million barrels shy of being in a state of glut. I would still consider this to be a very attractive outcome for bulls.\nOne interesting tidbit to be aware of is that all of OPEC's estimates assume that Russia\u2019s oil production this year will average 11.54 million barrels per day, up from last year\u2019s 11.35 million barrels per day and just shy of the 11.61 million barrels per day they estimated for the nation\u2019s fourth quarter last year. If Russia were to abide by its OPEC+ agreement entirely, and if those cuts extended through 2019, actual output would be around 11.2 million barrels per day, but due to the slow progress they made toward achieving them in the first quarter, a more realistic number might be 11.3 million barrels per day. It\u2019s possible Russia could forsake OPEC this year and that scenario seems to be priced in, but if the nation does produce, instead, around 11.3 million barrels per day, that would remove a further 87.6 million barrels from the global market.\nTakeaway\nAt this moment, oil investors should be bullish\u2026 very bullish. So long as OPEC continues to stick with its production agreement, and so long as there are issues involving Venezuela, Iran, and Libya, there is a very high probability that the market will be, at worst, balanced this year, but a more likely scenario is that we\u2019ll see inventories fall year over year. A major economic downturn could change this picture, but absent that happening, I don\u2019t see any likely scenarios where oil bulls end up ending this year in a bad position.\nCrude Value Insights offers you an investing service and community focused on oil and natural gas.

{"text": "By AP\nFirefighters by Friday morning had extinguished large parts of a forest fire burning in the mountainous South Korean region that hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. It has destroyed 120 homes, forced thousands to flee, and killed one person, with another dying because of a falling object in the high winds fanning the flames.\nThe fire likely started Thursday night from a transformer spark near a resort in the town of Goseong and then spread to the nearby mountains, according to Choi Jin-ho, a fire captain at Gangwon Fire Headquarters. Gangwon province governs the Olympic host city of Pyeongchang and is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) northeast of Seoul.\nVideos posted to social media in South Korea showed tall flames rising from large areas of forest, the air filled with embers and debris as cars drove by the raging fire. News photos showed a burnt-out bus, fire engulfing a hill, and residents evacuating apartment complexes and filing into gyms.\nChoi said nearly 2,400 people in Goseong and almost 1,250 in the city of Sokcho were evacuated.\nAuthorities said a 60-year-old man died because of the fire, and a woman in her 70s died after being hit by wide-angle mirror on a road that fell because of strong winds.\nThe region is close to the border with North Korea. South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said Friday it plans to inform North Korea of details about the forest fires.\nThe Ministry of the Interior and Safety said about 120 homes were burned. The Korea Forestry Service said about 250 hectares (1 square mile) of forest was estimated to have burned in Goseong alone.\nAbout 20 firefighting helicopters and 5,600 firefighting personnel were expected to be deployed Friday, the ministry said. The fire also spread toward Ganeung and Donghae, causing the temporary shutdown of a highway and delays in train services from Ganeung to Seoul.\nAnother Gangwon fire official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of office rules, said at least 11 people were being treated for injuries. The official wouldn\u2019t comment on the nature of the injuries or how many were serious.\nThe office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he held an emergency meeting early Friday and called for all available resources to be deployed.\nChoi said nearly 800 firefighters fought the fire overnight but had trouble because of the wind and darkness, which prevented the use of helicopters.\nPhotos: AFP\nFire brigades from all major surrounding regions, including Seoul, were reportedly ordered to send trucks to help fight the blaze.\nThe fire hasn\u2019t threatened any venues where Olympic athletes competed last year, including the main venues in Pyeongchang, the alpine center in Jeongseon, and the skating centers in seaside Gangneung.\n", "label": "human"}

Miguel Rojas started the rally with a one-out double and moved over to third on an Isaac Galloway single. Rosell Herrera loaded the bases for the Marlins (5-15) after dropping down a bunt, which Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki picked up just in front of home plate but didn't make a throw. Martin Prado, in as a pinch-hitter for Smith, walked on five pitches.\nIt was enough run support to give Smith his second consecutive victory and backed up another quality performance by the 27-year-old. Smith scattered five hits and gave up just one run off a Juan Soto RBI single in the first that scored Adam Eaton, who led off the game with a bunt single.\nSmith threw 87 pitches, including 61 for strikes with 15 swings and misses.

It\u2019s not the snow, but the combination of precipitation and freezing temperatures that starts the pothole process, municipal officials across the county say.\nThe temperatures plummeted to single-digits in January, and the rest of the winter was marked by a mix of minor snowstorms, rains and consistently cold temps.\nEnter the potholes \u2014 wide, deep and unforgiving on tires and wheel alignments.\n\u201cThe freezing weather wreaks havoc on our streets,\u201d said John Shaw, North Bergen\u2019s superintendent of public works department. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working pretty hard since January 1 on potholes.\"\nPotholes are formed when precipitation seeps through the pavement, freezes and then expands when the temperatures rise, cracking the road.\n\"The freezing after the snow was the problem.\u201d\nAccording to Shaw, the township has filled over 1,500 potholes this year, averaging between 100 and 150 potholes per week.

But the problems aren\u2019t as serious because we\u2019re hitting them every year.\"\nJersey City spends nearly $500,000 annually on fixing potholes, according to Stamato.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nMike Trout homered in his fourth consecutive game, and the Los Angeles Angels scored seven unanswered runs in a 7-2 victory over the Texas Rangers on Sunday afternoon in Anaheim, Calif.\nIt was the Angels\u2019 third win in a row after dropping the first game of the four-game series to the Rangers.\nThe Rangers certainly will be happy to avoid facing Trout for a while, after the Angels center fielder destroyed Texas pitching throughout the series.

Jonathan Lucroy drove in one run with an infield single, Zack Cozart drove in one when he was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded, David Fletcher had an RBI single and Tommy La Stella had an RBI groundout.\nStratton was unable to get an out in the fifth inning, as the Rangers loaded the bases with nobody out before Angels manager Brad Ausmus gave him the hook.\nBut Justin Anderson, the first of five Angels relievers, escaped the jam by retiring the next three batters and stranding all three baserunners. Anderson (2-0) struck out Shin-Soo Choo and Rougned Odor before getting the final out when Elvis Andrus lined to third.\nTrout hit a two-run home run off Texas reliever Kyle Bird in the sixth inning, and Brian Goodwin hit his first homer of the season in the seventh, also his first as an Angel.\nThe game was stopped for five minutes in the fifth inning when a swarm of bees invaded the bullpens in left center field.\n\u2014Field Level Media\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "According to statistics reported by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, over half of all Americans have drunk alcohol in the last month. Over 75 percent have drunk alcohol in the last year, and over 80 percent of all adults over the age of 18 have tried alcohol at least once in their life.\nThis makes alcohol one of the nation\u2019s most popular social beverages. Nearly everyone has tried it\u2014and with the ability to soothe nerves and spark lively conversation, it\u2019s an easy drink option for just about anyone looking to have a good time.\nAccording to a study conducted by the Washington Post in 2014, though, a significant chunk of Americans don\u2019t just drink a glass of champagne at the annual family holiday party. Thirty percent of Americans have at least a glass of wine or some other form of alcoholic beverage every day, pouring a cold brew with dinner or sipping a glass of red while catching up on their favorite TV shows.\nThe dangers of binge drinking are well known, and the good news is that very few American adults are truly heavy drinkers; only the top tenth percentile reported in the Washington Post survey drink around 10 alcoholic beverages, on average, per day of the week.\nEven that daily dose of alcohol, though, can start to have some adverse effects on your health. Want proof? Here\u2019s what happens when you cut alcohol out of your diet for just thirty days:\n1. Your Appetite Will Go Down (Eventually)\nWhen you first quit drinking alcohol, you may find yourself absolutely starving\u2014and craving some seriously sugary sweets.\nThat\u2019s actually your body suffering from the sugar imbalance that you\u2019ve been putting it through while regularly drinking. When the liver has to work to eliminate the alcohol from your body, it can\u2019t work as effectively to help manage your blood sugar levels\u2014which can wreak havoc on your body whether you\u2019re drinking a dry beer or a syrupy-sweet cocktail.\nThe blood sugar imbalance can result in massive cravings for a while, but the good news is that it\u2019s not always a permanent issue. For most routine but casual drinkers, a period of cravings to replace the alcohol will eventually give way to a much more manageable appetite\u2014and between that and the calories you stop consuming from the drinks, it can result in some pretty significant weight loss.\nEven if you don\u2019t lose weight, though, your body will thank you in the long run. There\u2019s a link between alcohol consumption and exacerbating type 1 diabetes concerns, and the excess carbs in drinks like beer and wine can be a contributor in getting type 2 diabetes later in life. Cutting out alcohol can keep you healthier longer, even if you don\u2019t have any health concerns right now\u2014and if you do have health concerns, cutting out alcohol can help you regulate them better.\n2. Your Heart Health Will Benefit\nScientists have suggested, per studies, that a glass of red wine can decrease your risk of cardiovascular disease. There are certain antioxidants in that particular drink that can prevent coronary artery disease, a leading cause of heart attacks.\nIn the grand scheme of things, though, alcohol actually likely hurts your heart more than it helps. Studies have shown that regular alcohol consumption can lead to heart disease, putting strain on your body\u2019s most important muscle.\nThe reason? Alcohol raises your blood pressure, which damages your heart muscle over time. It\u2019s a slow build, but cutting out alcohol entirely can lower your blood pressure within weeks and put you on a path to a longer, healthier life.\nThis doesn\u2019t just help you out from a generic standpoint, either. Regular drinkers can have trouble with cardio exercises, such as running, swimming, or biking. Cutting out alcohol can help you get in better shape, so you can beat those records you want to set on your 5k or spend more time in the pool with your kids.\n3. Your Sleep Quality Will Improve\nEveryone has heard the advice; a glass of wine helps you get to sleep. It\u2019s a common refrain among alcoholics, too, who often use alcohol to calm themselves after stressful days and rely on it to help them sleep.\nIt may seem counterintuitive, then, to suggest that cutting out alcohol will help you sleep better. But chemically, your brain is able to get a better, more complete rest when you\u2019re sober\u2014and in the long run, that can actually help with the insomnia that some alcoholics try to defeat when they start drinking in the first place.\nStudies have shown that indeed alcohol does help you fall asleep faster\u2014and it can help you fall into a deeper sleep, making it tougher for external stimuli to wake you up. The problem, though, is that it also reduces the amount of REM sleep you get, which is crucial for a truly good night\u2019s rest.\nThis disruption of a proper REM sleep cycle can leave you feeling drowsy and unfocused in the morning, which can lead to a vicious cycle and push you to drink more. It can also cause sleep apnea and breathing problems, which can even further disrupt a proper night\u2019s sleep.\nIf you find that cutting out a drink before bed leaves you counting sheep for hours, there are healthier alternatives to jump-starting those snoozes. Doing a light workout in the early evening \u2014 but not right before you fall asleep\u2014can help you fall asleep a little bit easier. Cutting out midday naps, changing your evening screen time habits, and switching up your diet will all have much healthier effects on your sleep habits than drinking to doze off.\n4. Your Skin Will Look Brighter\nIf you\u2019ve ever woken up to a gnarly-looking zit the day after you went out for drinks with your friends, you aren\u2019t alone\u2014and it\u2019s not just the leftover makeup on your face causing the breakout.\nAlcohol alone doesn\u2019t directly cause your skin to become clogged; only dirt and oils can do that. It also doesn\u2019t directly inflame your skin like smoking does.\nIt does affect your hormone levels, though, which are a leading cause of acne (which is why teenagers going through puberty tend to be the population most heavily affected by breakouts). Alcohol can impact your hormone levels and your body\u2019s nutrition levels at the same time, which can lead to breakouts. The longer you spend avoiding alcohol, the brighter\u2014and clearer\u2014your skin will be.\n5. Your Mental State Will Improve\nThere\u2019s a reason that you aren\u2019t allowed to drink alcohol and drive; alcohol quite literally impairs your brain function, which can make it impossible to react properly when you\u2019re behind the wheel.\nOver time, alcohol has proven in both men and women to result in significant brain shrinkage, and the long-term risk of developing conditions that affect memory and thought process becomes higher and higher.\nIt\u2019s not just the long-term effects on your brain that can be stopped when you quit drinking, though. The American Addiction Center explains that alcohol can be a key factor in exacerbating depression, both due to the outside effects\u2014missed work and physical fatigue from hangovers\u2014and chemical changes in the brain. The metabolic changes caused by alcohol can slow the body down, which puts people at risk of being triggered depressively.\nFor those who try to use alcohol to treat depression, cutting out alcohol won\u2019t necessarily cure them\u2014although it can make it easier to isolate symptoms and seek treatment from a licensed doctor. Those who trigger depression with alcohol use, though, will find themselves happier and better able to focus on their days when they cut out alcohol; not only will your brain thank you for it, but your emotions will, too. Motivation increases the longer you spend away from alcohol, and it can be easier to manage your life cognitively when you\u2019re sober.\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Clement Cao\nWith the world\u2019s online mobile population growing day by day, and a home market dominated by giants such as Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba, Chinese app developers are increasingly looking to market their apps abroad.\nI have seen first-hand this shift from a focus on the domestic market to a much more global viewpoint. And I believe that the increasing influence of a wave of successful domestic startups will create a shift at the intersection of the mobile app industry and the global advertising ecosystem.\nWe know that the number of mobile internet users around the world is increasing rapidly. Nearly four billion people access the internet via their phones, and this is projected to increase to six billion by 2022. And with this rise in the online mobile population comes an increase in digital ad spending.\nIn China, these costs are growing fast, particularly on user acquisition outside of the People\u2019s Republic. In 2018, more than 80 per cent of spending on digital advertising was dedicated to mobile.\nAds have become the most profitable \u2013 and sometimes only \u2013 method for most developers to make money from their apps. Fewer than 10 per cent of mobile app users make in-app purchases. As a result, mobile advertising has grown from an $8.6bn industry in 2013 to $88.6bn in 2017, and it is estimated that it will reach an incredible $219.3bn in 2022.\nInside the People\u2019s Republic, mobile traffic is controlled by a small number of digital media giants \u2013 think of them as equivalent to Google and Facebook \u2013 which make up 90 per cent of the total addressable market of mobile advertising. So in order to succeed, small and medium-sized mobile companies are instead looking towards the global market.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s government is applying more and more scrutiny to online content, and has issued bans on platforms featuring user-generated videos. Chinese companies are therefore looking beyond the boundaries of their home market and searching for opportunities globally.\nThe evidence of this outward growth is compelling. Overseas ad spend by Chinese app developers hit more than $1bn in 2017.\nChinese app developers are spending a large amount of their ad budgets in mature markets such as North America and East Asia, and beginning to invest in Southeast Asia\u2019s emerging markets such as Indonesia and India. As a result, the popularity of Chinese apps is growing. For example, 25 per centof the top 20 free apps in India last year were Chinese.\nOverall, the next 12 months will be interesting for the global advertising industry. Already, the shift from print to online, and now from desktop to mobile continues to disrupt established business models.\nMore importantly, the increasing influence of Chinese consumers, as well as Chinese apps and brands, is certain to create new opportunities for incumbents and challengers alike.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - APRIL 10: Jason Dickinson #16 of the Dallas Stars is attended to by medical staff after receiving a check by a member of the Nashville Predators in Game One of the Western Conference First Round during the 2019 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs at Bridgestone Arena on April 10, 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Frederick Breedon/Getty Images)\nNASHVILLE -- Stars winger Jason Dickinson could laugh about it on Thursday afternoon, one day after Brian Boyle temporarily knocked him out of the Stars' 3-2 win over Nashville in Game 1 with a massive hit in the first period.\nBoyle flattened Dickinson during a Predators power play, running him over with a check through Dickinson's chest as he tried to exit the Stars zone. Dickinson immediately dropped his stick and lay on his back on the ice before skating to the dressing room on his own.\n\"Don't come around the boards with your head down, first of all,\" Dickinson said. \"I thought because I was on the PK, they were on the power play, I thought I could make a play on the puck. I didn't think he'd finish his check there. I might have put myself in a little bit more vulnerable position there than I normally would. He's 6-6, so any hit he throws is going to look dirty. I don't think he was trying to make anything dirty out of the play. I feel fine.\"\nDickinson underwent concussion testing and missed more than 20 minutes of game time. He said he failed one test, which led to more testing and delayed his return to the game. Dickinson finished the game by playing 9:18, including 2:30 on the penalty kill.\nDickinson is a decent-sized player, checking in at 6-2 and 200 pounds (five pounds shy of Jamie Benn). But Boyle is listed at 6-6 and 245 pounds, making any collision a mismatch.\n\"He kept his shoulder tucked, I watched the video after,\" Dickinson said. \"There's nothing in it that looked malicious to me. It was just the size advantage, my position on the ice, it set up for a scary hit. I'm lucky that I feel fine today. There's no repercussions.\"\nHours before he made his NHL postseason debut Wednesday night, Dickinson reflected on from where he'd come.\nA year ago, he was preparing for an AHL playoff push. In training camp, he was fighting for a roster spot. This season, he had to prove himself an everyday player. And during Game 1, he began on the Stars' top line with Tyler Seguin and Alexander Radulov.\n\"Just everything, mentality, confidence, just everything coming into every game is completely different,\" Dickinson said. \"A complete 180, where I'm going into games thinking I'm going to make a difference whereas last year, I was going into games just to play is how I see it now. I thought I was going in to make a difference, but it's so different this year.\"\nDickinson is a potential difference maker for the Stars in the playoffs. He's versatile in that he can move up and down the lineup, smart enough to play with Seguin and Radulov but sound enough to play in the bottom-six in a defensive role (like he did for most of Game 1 once he returned).\nIt's his defense that gives him confidence on the offensive end.\n\"That's my goal is to limit chances against,\" Dickinson said. \"It's hard to put a number on it, one to two per game is really good. So if I can keep it under five, under four even, that's a good game. That includes PK and everything. I think that's where my game started to find itself and then from there, I grew into more confidence with the puck, more confidence making plays.\"\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Open this photo in gallery The Canada Revenue Agency website is shown in this April 17, 2019, image. Doug Ives/The Canadian Press\nThis is the time of year when procrastinators begin to fret about filing their income tax forms with Canada Revenue Agency by April 30.\nOf course, there are many reasons to file on time \u2013 such as avoiding expensive late fees and receiving tax refunds promptly.\nFor retired people, the CRA has an extra reason to finish their taxes on time \u2013 the potential to boost their monthly income or, on the flip side, to avoid a reduction in government payments.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThat\u2019s because the federal tax collector checks seniors\u2019 returns to see if they\u2019re receiving old age security (OAS) and eligible for a guaranteed income supplement (GIS).\nEmployment and Social Development Canada estimates 10 per cent of eligible seniors didn\u2019t receive their GIS payments in 2016-17, the most recent information available.\nSince then, the government has attempted to increase public awareness and reduce missed opportunities.\nElizabeth Mulholland, chief executive of Prosper Canada \u2013 a national charity dedicated to helping Canadians living in poverty \u2013 says GIS payments may be small but they can make a big difference.\n\u201cFor seniors who are quite low-income, it\u2019s an important additional source of income,\u201d Mulholland says.\nFor the poorest seniors with virtually no income besides the OAS, the guaranteed income supplement could be worth up to a maximum of $898 a month for single people and up to $540 per person for couples.\nThat would be in addition to old age security (OAS), which is available to seniors aged 65 and older. OAS is currently worth about $600 a month per person for most people who meet Canadian residency requirements.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe GIS payments are reduced bit-by-bit for seniors who have other income and they\u2019re eliminated for single people who have annual income of about $18,240 or more and couples with annual income of about $24,550 or more.\nMulholland says the CRA\u2019s automatic applications ensure more people receive all the benefits they are owed.\n\u201cWe know that the more steps that you put in a process, the more likely it is that people are going to encounter obstacles \u2026 and not succeed in completing the process.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an important catch, however. Just because a senior receives GIS in a taxation year \u2013 shortly after they begin receiving OAS for the first time, for example \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have to file annually with the CRA.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t file your taxes, the government doesn\u2019t know what your income is that year, Mulholland says.\n\u201cIn the absence of you filing, their assumption is you don\u2019t need this benefit any more. So they\u2019ll cut it off.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nEmployment and Social Development Canada, which oversees the GIS, OAS and other benefits, says clients should contact Service Canada by phone or in-person as soon as possible if the tax return can\u2019t be filed by April 30.\n\u201cThis will allow the department to be in a position by June 2019 to reassess a client\u2019s GIS entitlement for July 2019 to June 2020,\u201d ESDC said in an e-mailed statement.\nMulholland adds there are many reasons people could need assistance with filing their taxes and suggests they or their family or friends check for local organizations that operate volunteer-staffed tax clinics.\n\u201cIf you need help, reach out,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of these pots of money add up, when you put them together. So it\u2019s important to make sure people are getting all of them.\u201d\nKelley Keehn, author of several financial advice books and an advocate for FP Canada (formerly the Financial Planning Standards Council), says it\u2019s also important to start planning years before retirement to avoid unnecessary benefit clawbacks.\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t pre-planning \u2026 you\u2019re probably going to pay more tax than you need to and you may lose out on government benefits,\u201d Keehn says.\nStory continues below advertisement\nYour postretirement income might include not only OAS and GIS but also Canada Pension Plan payments, a company pension plan, a locked-in retirement account or a spouse\u2019s benefits.\n\u201cYou take all of those elements together and you can see how it gets to be a little bit complex,\u201d Keehn says.\nTo avoid unnecessary clawbacks of income-linked benefits, Keehn says it\u2019s often better to use a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) to spread out withdrawals and create a predictable flow of income at an appropriate level.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency, FP Canada and many chartered banks provide various online tools and video tutorials that can assist with the process.\nBut Keehn says many Canadians probably need to get professional advice about whether to begin RRIF withdrawals earlier than age 71 (the latest allowed) and how to factor in widowed spouses and other estate beneficiaries.\nMulholland notes there are times when a senior\u2019s income does rise above poverty levels \u2013 through an inheritance or marriage, or other source of income \u2013 and that may also disqualify them for some retirement benefits such as the GIS.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cLife happens to all of us in good ways and bad,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s job is to make sure you get all the money you\u2019re entitled to \u2013 but not get money you\u2019re not entitled to.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jake Odorizzi was in complete control. He really was.\nAnd then \u2026\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often you see something like that happen,\u201d he said, much later.\nOdorizzi and the Minnesota bullpen suddenly went wild, allowing seven straight batters to reach base despite not hitting a single fair ball and letting Noah Syndergaard and the New York Mets stroll past the Twins 9-6 Wednesday night.\nOne day after the teams set a Citi Field record by totaling 10 home runs in Minnesota\u2019s 14-8 romp, the Mets barely had to swing to build a big lead.\n\u201cIt just came down to strike throwing,\u201d Twins manager Rocco Baldelli.\nOr lack thereof.\nThe last time a team had seven batters in a row reach without a hit or error? It was 25 years ago, in fact, when the New York Yankees did it in 1994, the Elias Sports Bureau said.\nA startling stretch that kept snowballing saw Odorizzi, newly promoted reliever Andrew Vasquez and Trevor Hildenberger combine to walk six and hit a batter with a pitch without getting a batter out.\nAt one point, the Twins threw 21 pitches \u2014 19 missed the strike zone, many of them bouncing or sailing all over.\nMets manager Mickey Callaway had a simple message for his team as the inning unfolded.\n\u201cKeep on taking,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t swing.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t even think we put one take sign on. I think we just did a great job of being patient and doing what it took to score some runs there,\u201d he said.\nWilson Ramos grounded a two-run single that capped the crazy six-run rally in the fifth inning. The Mets could\u2019ve scored more, but Jeff McNeil was picked off third after hesitating on a bases-loaded pitch that skittered to the backstop.\nSyndergaard (1-1) had permitted just two hits in taking a 9-1 lead into the eighth, and was pulled after giving up a single, double and triple to begin the inning.\nIt had already been a strange season for Odorizzi (0-2) \u2014 he struck out 11 against Cleveland, yet got only two outs while being tagged by Philadelphia \u2014 before this bizarre start.\nOdorizzi had retired 13 of 14 batters in quick order before McNeil singled with one out in the fifth for the Mets\u2019 first hit.\nOut of nowhere, Odorizzi lost it. He walked Amed Rosario, J.D. Davis and Syndergaard in a row, all on full counts. At one point, Odorizzi threw his hands over his head, in disbelief after another free pass.\nOdorizzi couldn\u2019t really explain what caused the control problem, simply offering: \u201cIt was an unfortunate time for that to happen.\u201d\nVasquez took over, and it got worse. He hit Brandon Nimmo in the back on a 2-0 pitch to force home a run, walked rookie Pete Alonso on a full count and walked Robinson Cano on four pitches.\n\u201cJust didn\u2019t have my stuff,\u201d Vasquez said.\nHildenberger was next, with similar results. He walked Michael Conforto on four pitches and gave up Ramos\u2019 single that made it 6-1.\nConforto added a two-run single in the seventh.\nThe Twins scored three times in the eighth to make it 9-4 and loaded the bases with no outs. Jeurys Familia got Willians Astudillo to ground into a double play, limiting the damage.\nMAKING A CONNECTION\nMitch Garver homered in the ninth off Edwin Diaz, who led the majors in saves last year. On Tuesday night, Garver hit two home runs off NL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom.\nROSTER MOVES\nTwins: The 25-year-old Vasquez was called up from Triple-A Rochester, but didn\u2019t fare any better than the player he replaced on the roster. RHP Chase De Jong was optioned to the minors, a day after he gave up four runs on three hits and three walks in the ninth inning.\nMets: RHP Corey Oswalt was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse. He\u2019s expected to be used in long relief. RHP Tim Peterson (0-0, 4.50 ERA in four games) was sent down.\nUP NEXT\nTwins: Snowballs or baseball? Snow fell Wednesday in the Twin Cities and the forecast calls for more into the weekend, putting Friday night\u2019s series opener at Target Field vs. Detroit in jeopardy. As it stands, Minnesota RHP Michael Pineda (1-0, 2.00 ERA) is scheduled to start against LHP Daniel Norris (0-0, 5.06).\nMets: LHP Steven Matz (0-0, 0.87 ERA) makes his third start of the season, facing Braves RHP Kevin Gausman (1-0, 0.00) in Atlanta.

They're normally not there at night so you kind of worry that someone's down there.\n\"The police came and reprimanded them, but when they left they had a trailer with them and it was filled with our signs - we've got photographic evidence of that - and they put a swastika up on one of the neighbour's sheds.\"\nMr Raffaelli said the terrorist attack in Christchurch had amplified the concerns of the small community.\n\"Directly after the day of that shooting they were up there first thing in the morning with high-powered rifles, shooting.\n\"They shoot on Christmas Day and I'm anticipating they'll be shooting up there all over Easter.

{"text": "NEW YORK, April 15 (LPC) - Fitch Ratings in an industry update for Business Development Companies (BDCs) said it is focused on leverage differentiation among funds looking to employ greater leverage following the passage the Small Business Credit Availability Act in 2018, amid continued competitive challenges.\nThe Small Business Credit Availability Act, signed in to law by Congress in 2018, allows BDCs to access additional capital to make more loans to middle market companies, but Fitch believes the change poses elevated execution risk for those BDCs opting to pursue lower asset coverage requirements.\n\u201cNot surprisingly, over the last year we have been focused on increasing leverage as a result of legislative changes in 2018,\u201d said Chelsea Richardson, associate director at Fitch. \u201cLeverage increases overall have been offset by shifting portfolio composition to favor first-lien investments.\u201d\nAt year-end 2018, 65.3% of BDC portfolios, on average, consisted of first-lien investments, up from 58.6% at the end of 2017, reflecting a rotation of portfolios up the capital structure into lower yielding, but less risky investments, a move afforded by the use of increased leverage, the report said.\nBDCs with greater exposure to first-lien investments generally have less portfolio risk because those assets have higher recovery prospects in default scenarios.\nBBDC, TSLX and GBDC had the greatest exposure to first-lien investments in 2018, while AINV and NMFC each showed large increases in that direction as both firms focused new originations on senior positions following the approval to use higher leverage, according to the report.\nFitch follows a group of 18 BDCs, nine of which are rated by the agency. Six of those are pursuing higher leverage, the report said.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any negative rating actions yet, aside from two outlook revisions,\u201d said Chelsea Richardson, associate director at Fitch. \u201cMost have strong track records, solid investment strategies and affiliations with larger platforms, which has helped us get comfortable.\u201d\nFitch views higher leverage as credit negative, generally, and said in the report that rating movement will depend on how BDCs utilize higher debt capacity relative to portfolio risk and how funding profiles evolve.\nFitch is also evaluating the funding profiles for BDCs and views increases in secured debt as a percentage of funding unfavorably. Last year, total unsecured debt issuance for the group was lower than the year before, and some of the offerings completed after the legislative change had higher pricing and/or additional covenants.\nUnsercured debt issuance for the group declined to US$1.7bn in 2018 from US$2.8bn in 2017.\n\u201cWe believe that an unsecured funding component enhances funding diversity and allows for greater flexibility during times of stress since a lower portion of assets would be pledged as collateral,\u201d Richardson said.\nOverall, Fitch Ratings for the fourth consecutive year maintains a negative sector outlook for Business Development Companies (BDCs) in 2019, citing continued competitive underwriting conditions, unsustainable asset quality metrics and limited access to growth capital.\nAn unfavorable supply/demand dynamic in middle market lending has resulted in aggressive deal structures and pricing, which together have led to earnings pressure and in the future could lead to asset quality deterioration.\n\u201cDespite the competitive underwriting environment, we have seen relatively robust origination volumes. However, portfolio growth has been more modest due to elevated repayment volumes,\u201d Richardson said.\nFor the BDCs covered in the report, total originations were up 18% in 2018.\n\u201cWe believe portfolio growth will pick up in 2019 as additional BDCs are able to take advantage of the higher leverage capacity, and higher rates have made refinancing less attractive for borrowers more recently,\u201d said Richardson.

After skipping the 2016 Olympics, Goodwin tweeted on Monday that he\u2019s ready to try again.\nI\u2019m going to win the 2020 Olympics in Long jump! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfff idk how, but I am. \u2014 MG (@marquisegoodwin) April 8, 2019\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how Goodwin would be able to train for his event at a high enough level to win while still playing football. He told NBC Sports Bay Area in 2017 that he\u2019s committed to football but still thinks he has the ability to compete at the Olympics.\nThe 2020 Games in Tokyo are slated to run from July 24 through Aug. 9. Those dates alone would mean Goodwin misses the end of training camp and at least one preseason contest. That doesn\u2019t include all the additional time he would need to train in order to compete as an elite long jumper.\nGoodwin broke out a celebration following a touchdown in Green Bay last season in which he mimicked doing a long jump. It was extremely impressive considering he was in full pads in the midst of a physically demanding NFL game.\nThe 28-year-old has three years left on his deal with the 49ers, although the team can get out of that contract for relatively cheap in each of the next two years.\nPerhaps Goodwin was joking on the internet, but he\u2019s certainly capable of competing in the Olympics, and it wouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise to see him chase the goal he put out Monday.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\u201cI\u2019m Cameron. I play cricket. Yeah, I made a really poor mistake. I\u2019m really sorry for that. I will come and say G\u2019day, say hello, shaking your hands, signing your stuff. I will go out there and have fun for Durham Cricket.\u2019\u2019\nCAMERON BANCROFT has sinned. Through the media at a press conference at Emirates Riverside yesterday he addressed the Durham Cricket fans.\nIt reads more of an introduction at a meeting of gamblers, alcoholics or addicts than words from a world-class batsman.\nThe Australian spoke with a freshness, an honesty after training with his new team-mates, who he will lead this summer as the new captain of the county.\nBancroft has served his suspension, a nine-month ban imposed for ball tampering while playing Test cricket for Australia in South Africa. There was no mention of sandpaper yesterday.\nHe returned to the sport he loves by rattling out some big scores for Perth Scorchers and Western Australia.\nNow he aims to transfer that form to the County Championship. And from there? There\u2019s an Ashes series in England coming up in August\u2026.\n\u201cIt's exciting,\u2019\u2019 he reflected. \u201cIt's an opportunity here to play, the aspirations to play Test cricket are certainly in my mind and where I would love to be one day. But I'm here right now and I'll walk out on the field a Durham player. I just look forward to playing cricket, having fun, enjoying it, because that's why I'm here.\n\u201cAn international recall would mean a lot to me, definitely. I also know that I've got a lot of great things in my life, even just playing club cricket back at home in Perth, it's a game that you can get really single-minded and absorbed in your pursuits, at the forefront of it all is just the enjoyment.\n\u201cIf I do that I know the results will hopefully take care of themselves.\u2019\u2019\nBancroft will lead Durham out this morning in Chester-le-Street. He missed last week\u2019s opener at the behest of Western Australia as he had to attend an end of season awards dinner.\nDurham took first punt on Bancroft, announcing his signing during his ban before anyone in his homeland took a punt.\nSince he was appointed skipper there\u2019s been some backlash from members. Bancroft was in the media eye on a more magnified scale when the ball tampering scandal unfolded.\nHe took a low profile, while the other two miscreants, Steve Smith and David Warner, were more high profile.\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s about making runs out in the middle,\u2019\u2019 he admitted. \u201cNo doubt, all the Durham fans, if I am scoring bucket loads of runs for the club, I\u2019m sure they will definitely be happy, whether it\u2019s me or another player.\n\u201cI am ready for the reaction that may come; it is what it is. I can\u2019t change how people are going to feel and react. That\u2019s completely up to them and I respect that. As long as I am really enjoying and focused on what I can control, that\u2019s all that matters.\u2019\u2019\nBancroft is new to captaincy. He\u2019s never led a team before this morning when Durham take on Sussex: \u201cI haven't had a lot of experience of being a captain at first class level, all great captains at some point started captaining zero games of cricket. That's where I'm at now, and I'm just looking forward to learning about my team-mates, being part of this cricket club. I look forward to being part of the future of the club.\u2019\u2019\nHe hopes his charges will listen to him and take on board the experiences he has harshly learned over recent times. Bancroft breached the subject of his ban and fall out when he met his team-mates in preparation for today\u2019s game.\nHe said: \u201cI will be really positive around the place, giving my time, listening to my team-mates and being adaptable and willing to change, learning and the most important thing is what you do with your own performance \u2013 hopefully they gel together to allow me to be the best leader I can be.\u2019\u2019\nAnd as for taking on board a lesson or two?\n\u201cJeez, (I\u2019ve learned) thousands of lessons. I think it\u2019s too hard to really put my finger on one specific point but it\u2019s a journey filled with ups and downs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like climbing a mountain and you get to a point and stop and look down and realise how far up you are. I think life is a mountain that never ends and throughout that journey you reflect and the chance to do that has been a very rewarding part of the journey.\u2019\u2019\nBancroft admitted he did ponder whether cricket was for him during his ban. He turned to yoga and was heading home from a teaching exam when he doubted he had a future in the sport he loves. Those thoughts didn\u2019t last long.\nThe journey he\u2019s been on since that day comes to the Riverside today for Captain Bancroft.\nHe admitted of the captaincy role: \u201cI'm, thrilled, absolutely pumped about it. I know that it's going to be complex, I'm going to have to be really adaptable and open to learning. Certainly in Western Australian cricket back home we've got really strong values and it's really hard cricket over there. I've played under some great leaders in the past. I look forward to seeing how those things you learn come out of yourself as leader.\u2019\u2019\nHe added: \u201cMarcus North (Durham\u2019s director of cricket) captained Western Australia for a number of years and my first couple of one-day games he was captain and a very good leader.\n\u201cAdam Vogues was the captain for most of my first-class career, he was an excellent captain, a great tactician and an absolute gun.\n\u201cDuring my time in the Australian cricket team Steve Smith was an awesome leader as well. All those people had great qualities but I think ultimately they led by example really well with their skills. If I can do that I feel I'll be giving to me team really well.\u2019\u2019\nThere is a new look at Durham Cricket, with North taking control, and James Franklin coaching the team.\nBancroft reserved thanks for North and his role in enticing him to the North-East: \u201cHe was really important. He was a team-mate when he was back at Western Australia. He was a guy I looked up to as a player.\n\u201cIn Northy\u2019s last season, we opened the batting together which was absolutely awesome. He has had a great career, he is a good mate and I am looking forward to sharing this time and journey with him here at Durham. The opportunity he and the club have given me, I am very grateful for.\u2019\u2019\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "news, local-news,\nA Whitebridge community group has expressed relief at a court's decision to reject a fourth storey on a long-time contentious development in the suburb. \"There's relief that the right decision was made,\" Whitebridge Community Alliance spokesperson Michelle Burdekin said. \"There's some frustration that it took a legal decision to say quite clearly that the developer's reasons for breaching controls were not justified.\" Lake Macquarie City Council staff had supported the fourth storey [which included two apartments] at the Fettlers Whitebridge development, but councillors voted it down last year. Read more: Carrington cottage expanded to fit growing family Developer SNL Building Construction appealed against the decision. In dismissing the appeal, Land and Environment Court Commissioner Michael Chilcott said it had not demonstrated sufficient planning grounds to \"justify contravening the standard\". \"I have concluded that the applicant's written request to vary the height of [the] building's development standard ... is not well founded,\" commissioner Chilcott concluded. Read more: Eucharista at 59 Queens Road, New Lambton listed with $1.6 million guide Commissioner Chilcott added that he was not satisfied that the extra storey would be in the public interest. SNL Building Constructions approvals director Wade Morris said the decision was \"obviously disappointing in light of the technical and professional support it had throughout the assessment process\". \"Having delivered the first stage of homes, we'll focus now on construction and delivery of the remaining stages of this quality housing project,\" Mr Morris said. The Whitebridge development has been a simmering source of tension in the community for six years. Hundreds of people opposed the plan when it first emerged as part of a planning philosophy to encourage more medium density housing closer to town centres. Many felt the plans were simply too big and did not suit the area's character. The Joint Regional Planning Panel approved 89 apartments on the site in late 2015, but removed the fourth storey with the two top-floor apartments.

This led to accusations last year that a planning \"loophole\" was being used to get around the panel's decision. The developer said it had used a \"legitimate process\" available under the state's planning laws. Ms Burdekin expects community feelings about the project to ease over time. \"We did what we could. Along the way there were improvements [to the plans]. There are still some things that niggle and will continue to do so,\" she said.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/3AijacentBN9GedHCvcASxG/30b5394d-6166-4ab1-a5ff-03fd553705b8.JPG/r0_294_4855_3037_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Much of the story of the unusual watch and clock repair business known as Perfect Time is obvious.\nIt is a standalone former bank drive-through in the Transitown Plaza at Main Street and Transit Road in Clarence, in a parking lot near a pizza parlor, shoe repair shop and nail salon. Not much bigger than a full bathroom, the store boasts cuckoo clocks, desk clocks, wristwatches, pocket watches, broken watches harvested for parts and work benches that hold their tools. Customers who need help with their timepieces can walk in or use a drive-through window.\nBut the drive-through isn't the only thing that makes the business stand out like a vintage Patek Philippe timepiece. So does the story behind that plaza kiosk and Brooke and Rosa Stanley, the couple who run it.\nThey own a horse farm in Lockport. Brooke Stanley used to offer carriage rides at Canalside. They ran a pawn shop for years in downtown Buffalo.\nOh, and this: Brooke Stanley was a paid FBI informant in a murder-for-hire case. And both Stanleys were accused of receiving stolen property at their pawn shop.\nBoth acknowledge past mistakes, but say they want to leave the past behind them. But they're happy to talk about their lives together.\n\"I could tell you stories all day,\" Brooke said.\n\"About watches.\"\nLearning the trade\nBrooke Stanley, 58, said he doesn't wear a watch, but he had on two \u2013 one on either wrist \u2013 on a rainy recent weekday to check that they kept accurate time.\n\u201cI just always know what time it is. I have thousands of watches. They're everywhere,\u201d Brooke said. \u201cI have clocks \u2013 you can't imagine the clocks we have.\"\nThe Stanleys opened the shop about 16 years ago and work side-by-side, literally and figuratively. They have been married for 29 years and engage in the kind of playful banter common among people who have seen each other at their best and their worst.\n\"That's my first wife, Rosa,\" Brooke quips.\n\"I never know how to respond to that,\u201d Rosa, 55, replied, \u201cso I just kind of let it go over my head.\"\nBrooke, with Rosa joining him in 1992, started out in retail jewelry sales before shifting into repairs. Brooke bought the Perfect Time watch repair business from its previous owner.\nIt takes years of schooling and on-the-job practice to repair intricate watch mechanisms and delicate pieces of jewelry.\n\"A lot of hours,\" Rosa said.\n\"It's impossible,\" Brooke added.\nAn FBI informant\nAs if repairing watches and thinking up wife jokes don\u2019t occupy enough of Brooke Stanley\u2019s time, he keeps busy in other ways.\nBrooke offered horse-drawn carriage rides at Canalside for several years before stopping last year.\n\"I had no life anymore,\" Brooke said.\nThe Stanleys own a 150-acre horse farm, in Lockport near the Transit Drive-In, though they have just four horses there.\nHe also creates belt buckles and other items out of metal in a shop at home, including a knife forged from an old railroad spike.\nBut the Stanleys' story was not always about horses and watches and metal work.\nIn 1995, he testified as an informant, after a friend asked him to help find people who would kill his ex-wife\u2019s current husband. Brooke went to the FBI instead and the woman who attempted to hire him was arrested, tried and convicted.\nTwo years later, a civil rights activist led protests outside the Stanleys\u2019 Empire II Pawnbrokers shop in Buffalo, saying the couple discriminated against black customers. Community activist Charley H. Fisher III, who led the protests, at the time called Brooke Stanley a \"career criminal.\"\nThe Stanleys denied any racism and Rosa Stanley was quoted as calling Fisher \"garbage.\"\nAlso in the late 1990s, Brooke was arrested for accepting stolen property at the pawn shop, he pleaded guilty to charges related to a stolen rifle and Rosa was indicted in a computer theft. Both were placed on probation after convictions and State Supreme Court Justice Ronald H. Tills ordered them to liquidate or sell the business.\nThe Buffalo News discovered the criminal cases after interviewing the Stanleys. The Stanleys did not discuss any of the cases in detail.\nBut during the visit to the shop, Rosa found as good a way as any to describe Brooke: \"He's definitely a character.\u201d\nDrive-through watch repair\nBrooke said about 50 or 60 people come to the shop each day, either through the front door or to the drive-through window. He said people like the convenience and, especially, it works for busy parents who can keep their children in the car while they wait.\n\"It's like McDonald's. They like that,\" Brooke said.\nCustomers can drop off a watch for a more complicated repair, but wait in their car for a battery replacement. The Stanleys charge about $10 for a Swiss watch battery.\nKim Durak of Snyder takes watches and jewelry, such as a silver charm bracelet, to the Stanleys. Durak said Rosa has replaced her watch battery in as little as two minutes as she waited in the drive-through lane.\n\"Where does that happen anywhere else in the world? Only in Buffalo,\" Durak said, noting the couple's historical knowledge and their repartee.\nBrooke said they must read technical manuals to keep up to date on the thousands of watch movements. When repair shop owners retire, or die, the Stanleys often buy their specialized tools.\nA widow who lived in the neighborhood once came into the Stanleys\u2019 shop to offer them her late husband\u2019s work bench, with tools inside, untouched since 1969.\nWhile more people today don\u2019t wear watches, keeping track of time with their smartphones, Brooke Stanley said many customers are collectors who own five, six or more watches.\nBrooke and Rosa have worked on pocket and wristwatches that are more than 150 years old and that are worth thousands of dollars. They also repair grandfather clocks, which require home visits.\n\"This is a dying art. Not too many people do what they do,\" Durak said. \"My husband said, 'They're a hoot.' \"\nThe Stanleys planned to add cellphone repairs to their repertoire.\nAsked if he could repair an Apple Watch, Brooke said, \"I can fix anything except your marriage.\"\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Elon Musk, already in hot water over his Twitter use, posted another Tesla Inc. production forecast reminiscent of the one that landed him before a federal judge earlier this month.\nMusk wrote Sunday that Tesla will make more than 500,000 cars in the next 12 months. A similar tweet sent almost two months ago in which Musk said the company would build half a million vehicles in 2019 led the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to argue he was in contempt of a settlement reached with the regulator last year.\nThe latest forecast, given as a seemingly innocuous aside in a discussion about the future value of Tesla vehicles, nonetheless came as Musk\u2019s lawyers are negotiating with the SEC over an agreement that put controls on the billionaire\u2019s tweeting. A U.S. judge gave the two sides until April 18 to meet for at least an hour and resolve their differences. If they can\u2019t, she\u2019ll rule whether Musk is in contempt.\nThe legal tussle for Musk, 47, served as a distraction amid a record decline in deliveries for Tesla during the first quarter. Concerns about demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles escalated last week after the Nikkei reported the company and its partner Panasonic Corp. were freezing plans to expand capacity at the battery factory they share in Nevada.\nMusk on Saturday disputed reports that Panasonic had boosted annualized battery cell production capacity at the plant to 35 gigawatt hours, saying the company\u2019s lines were only at 24 gigawatt hours and have been constraining output of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan.\nBoth the Panasonic and the next-12-months production tweets are noteworthy in light of the settlement that sprang from Musk tweeting in August of last year about trying to take Tesla private. The SEC accused the chief executive officer of securities fraud, and Musk settled. He agreed to pay US$20 million, step down as chairman and seek pre-approval from an in-house securities lawyer before tweeting information material to the electric-car maker.\nMusk\u2019s legal team has argued that he retained discretion to determine whether he was sending out material information or not, and that his Feb. 19 post about Tesla\u2019s 2019 production was consistent with comments he made weeks earlier on an earnings call.\nIn an April 4 hearing where Musk appeared, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan questioned the specifics of the CEO\u2019s settlement with the SEC and told the two sides to rework the language of their agreement.\n\u201cTake a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on and work this out,\u201d Nathan said. She wrote in an order the next day that if Musk is held in contempt, the court will allow further briefings on sanctions. The SEC said at the hearing that the remedies it was seeking included a series of escalating fines for future violations, and monthly reporting on Musk\u2019s communications.\n\u2013With assistance from Kevin Miller.\nBloomberg.com\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Alabama football coach Nick Saban still remembers one of the reasons why former colleague Bill Belichick would reprimand him during their coaching tenure with the Cleveland Browns.\n\u201cBelichick would chew my butt out, man, and say, \u2018Let the players play,'\u201d Saban said Wednesday after practice ahead of the team\u2019s first spring scrimmage. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never had my butt chewed out before for coaching [and] teaching.\u201d\nSaban, who spent four seasons as Cleveland\u2019s defensive coordinator, said he now has the same message for members of his coaching staff. In his 13th year at Alabama, Saban said he sees value in time that\u2019s dedicated to \u201c[letting] the players play\u201d \u2014 just as Belichick told him over 20 years ago.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think good coaches are trying to reinforce players in practice after every play,\u201d Saban said. \u201cSo they\u2019re telling them, \u2018You did this well,\u2019 or \u2018You need to do it this way,\u2019 or \u2018You made a mental error,\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re getting corrected,\u2019 or \u2018You did a good job,\u2019 or whatever. You\u2019re trying to reinforce guys on every play. Sometimes players are depending on that reinforcement all the time in practice.\u201d\nBecause that approach was effective in a practice setting, Saban said he would act similarly during scrimmages and games. But Belichick helped him realize that it\u2019s not necessarily beneficial.\n\u201cIn a game, they got to know what to do, they got to know how to do it, they can\u2019t depend on somebody else to make a call for them, [and] they can\u2019t depend on somebody else to recognize things for them,\u201d Saban said.\nSaban said he makes a point to have moments even in practice where coaches will be asked to leave the field to simulate the scrimmage and game environment.\nIn addition to their scrimmage on Saturday, the Crimson Tide will host their annual Clinic of Champions this weekend. Among those expected to speak are former Patriots defensive coordinator, and current Detroit Lions coach, Matt Patricia as well as Patriots special teams coordinator Joe Judge.\n", "label": "human"}

However, the tragedy did not hit home until the bodies of 29-year-old father Derek Marshall and his 1-year-old baby Maddox were pulled from the Susquehanna River. Although not everyone knew the father and son, the loss of the young family took an emotional toll on the entire Pennsylvania township because they were so young and full of life.\nLocals were quick to describe how much of a tragedy this loss was for their community.\n\u201cI was very devastated,\u201d Athens resident Gloria Lincoln said. \u201cVery devastated. It brings tears to my eyes because it\u2019s so sad.\u201d\nThe incident happened around 10 pm on Friday according to the Athens Township police department. The police watched as a speeding vehicle came blasting along Sheshequin Road. However, the car then went off the road and crashed into the river. While Maddox and Derek drowned in the river, the girlfriend and mother Emily Hoey fled the car and escaped before the vehicle sank to the bottom of the river.\nPolice found Hoey clinging to life on the bank of the river. However, Derek and Maddox were nowhere to be found.

Why did only Hoey survive the crash? What happened?\nPeople are always fearful of Sheshequin Road. It is a very dangerous place in Bradford County.

Those votes cast outside a voter\u2019s electoral division have to be distributed to Elections Alberta where they will be tallied in a centralized location. Elections Alberta hopes to be done counting before Saturday.\nBut that likely won\u2019t prevent Albertans from finding out who will lead their next government on Tuesday night, unless enough ridings are too close to call.\nUniversity of Lethbridge political scientist Geoffrey Hale said the next premier will probably be known once initial results are available on election night, however the number of seats in their government could vary depending on those extra ballots that will have yet to be counted.\nHe said any race with a margin of 500 votes or fewer separating the riding\u2019s top two candidates (according to the initial count on Tuesday) will likely depend on those additional advance votes in order to declare a winner.\n\u201cFor political junkies, that\u2019s a matter of deferred gratification,\u201d Hale said. \u201cFor the cell phone generation, it might be a little irritating, if they care enough to pay attention.\u201d\nRelated\nHale predicted a high voter turnout, much like in 2015 which saw 57 per cent of eligible voters cast their vote.\n\u201cThat was relatively high because it was a more contested election than usual,\u201d he said, adding anger seemed to be at an all-time high among the electorate this time, too.\n\u201cLooking at very closely contested elections, that tends to be a signal of higher turnout because people feel their vote will have a greater impact. Looking at it from the perspective of an Albertan, I have noticed over the years that an angry electorate turns out in greater numbers.\u201d\nIn Calgary, ridings which saw the most \u201cvote anywhere\u201d ballots cast elsewhere last week include Calgary-Foothills (7,397), Calgary-Bow (6,363) and Calgary-Buffalo (6,298).\nshudes@postmedia.com\nTwitter.com/SammyHudes\n", "label": "human"}

(\u00a9 Keystone / Christian Beutler)\nIn Switzerland, big cities are governed by left-wing administrations, but they are islands in a more centre-right sea. Newly-released statistics confirm the picture.\nIn the six Swiss cities with over 100,000 inhabitants (Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Lausanne, Bern, Winterthur) left-wing groups held over 70% of local government positions in 2018, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) reported on Tuesday.\n+ Why do Swiss cities lean to the left?\nAs the towns become smaller, the profile changes: in urban areas of under 20,000, just 23% of seats are held by the left; the most represented group in these towns is the centre-right Liberal Radicals.\nIndeed the Liberal Radicals are the most successful party overall in the 172 towns and cities examined by the FSO, holding 30% of the seats. Along with the People\u2019s Party and Christian Democrats, the centre-right and right account for over half of all seats.\nRegionally, the picture also conforms to received wisdom: French-speaking towns and cities are more left than the national average, while in Ticino things lean towards the right.\nAs for the right-wing People\u2019s Party, their urban base is almost exclusively confined to towns and cities in German-speaking Switzerland.\nGreens have continued to progress and stood at 7% of seats nationally in 2018.\nThe FSO also reported on the level of female representation in town administrations: at around 30%, the proportion of women has remained stable for the past two decades, it says.\nKeystone-SDA/dos\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "New Delhi: Bollywood\u2019s new releases aren\u2019t doing much to dent the collections of its older offerings whose collections continue to boom. Akshay Kumar\u2019s period saga Kesari netted \u20b92.5 crore on its third Saturday taking its 17-day total to \u20b9139 crore. The film is currently the actor\u2019s second biggest hit of all time, after the Hindi version of science fiction flick 2.0 co-starring Rajinikanth that had made \u20b9185.89 crore.\n\u201cKesari picks up speed on third Saturday. The journey thereafter - towards \u20b9150 crore is dependent on how it trends on weekdays and the fourth weekend,\" tweeted trade analyst Taran Adarsh.\nTrade website Box Office India said Kesari will be the highest grossing film of 2019 in east Punjab beating Uri - The Surgical Strike, thanks to its narrative that is centered on a Sikh army officer. It could also be the top ranker in Rajasthan beating ensemble comedy Total Dhamaal. The Anurag Singh directed film has about a week-and-a-half before another big release, Dharma Productions\u2019 Kalank takes over, leaving little screen space.\nThe other film that has surprised trade experts and is only now nearing the end of an impressive box office run is mystery thriller Badla featuring Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee Pannu. The film has crossed the \u20b985 crore mark in the domestic market alone, with appeal particularly for metro audiences. Adarsh said the film was also nearing the $5 million mark in international territories, with its current total standing at $ 4.95 million ( \u20b934.25 crore), including $ 1.86 million in the US and Canada, $ 1.89 million in the UAE and Gulf, $ 289,000 in Australia, $ 284,000 in the UK and $ 619,000 from the rest of the world.\nTo be sure, older hits like Kesari and Badla continue to sustain as there is little that theatres have to offer in terms of new releases. John Abraham\u2019s spy thriller Romeo Akbar Walter (RAW) and Hollywood superhero flick Shazaam! only managed \u20b912.25 crore and \u20b97.25 crore over their opening weekends at last count. The collections of RAW are a huge drop for Abraham whose last release Satyameva Jayate had made \u20b920 crore on its first day alone, albeit with the Independence Day holiday. The film is trending similar to the actor\u2019s other recent release, Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran that had picked up later, making close to \u20b965 crore but Box Office India said the older film was an action drama that had appeal even beyond the youth, which doesn\u2019t seem like the case with RAW.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Cryptocurrency mining has become the latest target for the Chinese government seeking to phase out industries considered a drag on the country\u2019s economy.\nThe National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the top economic planning agency in the world\u2019s largest market for bitcoin mining, released on Monday a list of sectors it plans to promote, restrict or eliminate. Crypto mining, the process of creating Bitcoin and other digital currencies through the use of computing power, was namechecked alongside a swarm of other sectors the agency wanted to \u201celiminate\u201d because they \u201clacked safe production conditions, seriously wasted resources, polluted the environment,\u201d among other issues.\nBitcoin\u2019s valuation famously slumped in 2018, falling from a record $20,000 in December 2017 to below $4,000, but this piece of news from China comes amid a period of renewed optimism. Last week, Bitcoin\u2019s value rocketed above $5,000 for the first time since November 2018.\nThe official announcement, which comes in the form of a revised list awaiting public comment, does not exert regulatory power. The agency did not put a proposed deadline for when crypto mining should be banned. While such guidelines normally hint at Beijing\u2019s attitude towards an industrial activity, some points out that the NDRC\u2019s guiding list, which renews every few years, has had limited impact on industries it has wanted to cut.\n\u201cItems that should be eliminated by end of 2006 are still in the 2011 and 2019 versions,\u201d noted Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, in a tweet.\nfor more context (\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3regulatory landscape is fuzzy so hard to explain everything in tweet's length) \u2013 NDRC updates a new version of such proposal every other 3-5 years since early 2000.

In particular, Bitmain \u2014 which recently lets its application for a proposed Hong Kong IPO lapse \u2014 would be significantly impacted by a ban. Bitmain\u2019s mining-optimized hardware is widely acknowledged as the top provider of mining hardware, and as much as 94 percent of the company\u2019s revenues in the first half of 2018 came from \u201cAntminers\u201d, its crypto mining hardware.\nA spokesperson for Bitmain declined to comment on the news when contacted by TechCrunch.\nThe crypto sector has drawn close scrutiny from Beijing amid concerns over frauds and speculation, which led to a ban on initial coin offerings in 2017. Meanwhile, environmentalists have protested wasteful energy consumption that bitcoin mining incurs. China was reportedly planning to restrict power supply for some bitcoin miners early last year, according to sources cited by Bloomberg.\nThis is not the first time China has mulled a clampdown on crypto mining. In January 2018, Beijing was said to ask local governments to discourage bitcoin mining enterprises, according to documents obtained by Chinese financial news publication Yicai. But local officials may be reluctant to embrace such guidance. Much of China\u2019s crypto mining activities happen in its sparse, underdeveloped hinterlands where energy is in the surplus and the governments are eager to boost production. Whether the new order coming from the powerful NDRC will put further deterrent on the industry is up in the air.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The demographic and age range of unemployed Calgary-area workers has shifted from \u201cyouth\u201d to \u201cprime-aged\u201d employees over the last year, according to city economists.\nThe city\u2019s latest Labour Market Review shows some 894,000 people are gainfully employed in the Calgary Economic Region, which includes nearby municipalities like Airdrie, Chestermere, High River and Olds.\nAnd while the total number of unemployed Albertans in the region is mostly unchanged from a year ago, the city says there has been a spike in \u201cprime-aged workers\u201d on the unemployment line when looking at year-over-year statistics for the month of March.\nIn March 2018, the city said approximately 46,700 workers between the ages of 25 to 54 were unemployed, making up 50 per cent of out-of-work Albertans in the region.\nThat number jumped to 61 per cent by last month to around 60,000 unemployed prime-aged workers.\nIn contrast, the number of unemployed youth workers in the region has dropped significantly from 42 per cent in 2008 to just 18 per cent last month.\nTrevor Tombe, economist with the University of Calgary\u2019s School of Public Policy, said looking at month-over-month or even year-over-year labour market reviews only provide a snapshot of unemployment in the Calgary region, not the entire picture.\nWhile he said the numbers in the review aren\u2019t a reason to panic, they do give reason \u201cto be disappointed\u201d when looking at the Calgary area\u2019s economic recovery compared to Edmonton.\n\u201cThose prime-aged individuals, the fraction of them that are employed (in Edmonton) is higher than before the recession. So they have, for that age group, fully recovered already. Whereas Calgary has still a little over a percentage point to go,\u201d Tombe said.\nThe city said the older demographics are more likely to feel the economic \u201cimpact of unemployment,\u201d adding prime-aged workers find it \u201cmore difficult\u201d to re-enter the workforce in a new industry.\nFrank Atkins, a former University of Calgary economist, said \u201cthere\u2019s a huge reluctance on the part of middle-aged people to retrain\u201d to find work in other industries after losing a job.\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t want to do it and you see it all the time,\u201d Atkins said.\nRelated\nJeanette Sutherland, manager of workforce and productivity for Calgary Economic Development (CED), said the key for older workers re-entering the workforce is to find the best \u201cshort-term re-skilling opportunities.\u201d\nCED launched an online tool last month to give job-seekers the ability to compare their own skills to those required for some of the tech sector\u2019s most in-demand jobs, such as software developers and data analysts.\nThe increase in unemployed prime-age workers could also be attributed to the layoffs of \u201chigh-priced\u201d employees in senior positions, as well elements of ageism, Atkins said.\n\u201cNobody likes to admit this but there is a huge amount of age discrimination when you have human capital invested in one industry,\u201d Atkins said.\nThe review also shows the number of Employment Insurance beneficiaries in Alberta increased sharply by five per cent at the start of the year, jumping from 14,900 in December 2018 to 15,700 this past January.\nEven though the number of unemployed young workers has dropped over the last 10 years, Tombe said workers in that demographic with less education are still struggling to adjust to a post-recession job market.\n\u201cHigh-paying labour jobs just aren\u2019t available to the extent that they were,\u201d Tombe said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very clear and very large group of Albertans who have been hit hard, and it\u2019s worse in Calgary for those 15 to 24-year-olds than it is in Edmonton.\u201d\nRRumbolt@postmedia.com\nOn Twitter: @RCRumbolt\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "One of the government\u2019s top investigative agencies has looked at allegations of potential wrongdoing by individuals in the Trump administration about their planning of a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, according to two individuals with knowledge of the probe.\nThe line of inquiry is part of a broader investigation in the Office of the Special Counsel\u2014an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency\u2014into alleged politically motivated personnel decisions at government offices.\nThe OSC, which can seek corrective and disciplinary action, is looking at whether officials were retaliated against for raising concerns about the administration\u2019s work related to a Saudi nuclear deal. As part of that investigation, OSC has also reviewed allegations about potentially improper dealings by senior members of the Trump administration in their attempt to map out a nuclear deal with Riyadh, according to two sources with knowledge of OSC\u2019s work.\nThe details of the OSC probe, previously unreported, are the first indication that a government body other than Congress is investigating matters related to a potential nuclear deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. OSC declined to comment on the record for this story.\nMeanwhile, there is a growing concern among lawmakers on Capitol Hill about U.S.-Saudi relations, especially following the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Those concerns were heightened by a report issued by Rep. Elijah Cummings in February that outlined allegations about efforts inside the White House to rush the transfer of highly sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia\u2014a potential violation of the Atomic Energy Act and without review by Congress.\nThe Cummings report said IP3\u2014a firm that includes former top military officers, diplomats, and energy experts\u2014had developed a proposal for Saudi Arabia that was simply \u201ca scheme for these generals to make some money.\u201d That report said former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had ties to the firm during his time working in the Trump administration.\nSources with direct knowledge of the IP3 plans today say the firm is focused on providing security for nuclear-related projects and in finding ways to compete with Russia and China to secure those projects throughout the Middle East.\nIn the wake of the Cummings announcement, The Daily Beast reported that U.S. companies and officials in the administration were moving forward in their conversations with Riyadh about a nuclear deal and the transfer of nuclear technology.\nThe Department of Energy then approved seven U.S. companies to conduct nuclear-related work in Saudi Arabia. (Federal law stipulates that companies obtain clearance from the U.S. government for exporting nuclear technology to or engaging in the production or development of special nuclear material in the kingdom.)\nThat news has prompted intense questioning by lawmakers in hearings with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.\n\u201cOne thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon,\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen in this administration recently... is an effort to evade Congress and to some extent evade your department and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while [the country] refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment.\u201d\nA cohort of lawmakers is ready to reveal next week a new piece of legislation that would stop the Trump administration from bypassing Congress on the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.\nCongress is also increasingly concerned about Jared Kushner\u2019s relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and his recent trip to Riyadh, especially because of the news that his security clearance was denied last year in part because of concerns about foreign influence. Engel is demanding a briefing from Pompeo on Kushner\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia last month that included a senior State Department official but otherwise left American diplomats in the dark.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio \u2013 Never before has this city\u2019s name been so descriptive, or so literally accurate.\nYes, Shaker Heights was settled by Shakers, and sits above Cleveland. Now that Shaker Rocks is open, however, it\u2019s also fair to say that people here will be reaching new heights, and probably trembling a little along the way.\n\u201cPeople are excited that it\u2019s so close,\u201d said Shaker Rocks co-owner Annie Richman. \u201cThe community already has taken ownership of it.\u201d\nNo doubt about it: Climbing in Cleveland just got a whole lot more interesting. Northeast Ohio has long been home to several indoor rock gyms, and others are still in the works, but Shaker Rocks is the first that will put this generally flat, mountain-less region on the national climbing map.\nWith its 17,000 square feet, 40-foot ceiling, and nearly 400-person capacity under one roof with a shop, caf\u00e9, climbing fitness area, and multi-purpose exercise room, Shaker Rocks (shakerrocksclimbing.com) is already being eyed as a likely host for regional competitions and an attractive destination for area high school and college climbing teams.\nNow, it hardly matters that there\u2019s only one legal outdoor climbing route in Northeast Ohio. The routes at Shaker Rocks are taller than that by far, and simulate climbing on natural walls and boulders more realistically than any other facility within 100 miles.\nShaker Rocks not only has more routes than most. It also has more advanced options and is equipped for lead-style climbing. New climbers can take classes to improve their skills and all will have access to group exercise classes and fitness equipment.\n\u201cWe would travel and see gyms in other cities and be frustrated that there wasn\u2019t a gym like that here,\u201d Richman said. \u201cThere really has been a lack of indoor climbing in Cleveland. There was a real opportunity.\u201d\nWHAT NEXT? Have a suggestion for an activity you think I should try? Send me an e-mail.\nPreviously: Miracle Performance strikes effective blow with \u2018HIIT & Run\u2019\nShaker Rocks is also notable for its location. Where many serious rock gyms are in remote warehouses, this one is in a busy commercial area abutting both the Shaker Heights city pool and the new Van Aken District. Climbers now can make a full day of their hobby, taking breaks for meals, shopping, or swimming.\nIt almost never came to be. Although the Richmans encountered little resistance in their quest to build a rock gym in Shaker Heights, the actual work of garnering support for the project and bringing it to fruition was fraught with challenges.\nObtaining the land was the easy part, Richman said. Shaker Heights was only too happy to repurpose a lot that had been home to an empty medical office building. It also didn\u2019t quibble over the new building\u2019s modern design, green-lighting a structure unlike any other in the city.\nConvincing investors was another matter, Richman said, especially in the project\u2019s early days, and the processes of demolition and construction generated a host of their own unique headaches.\n\u201cIt was chicken-and-the-egg the whole time,\u201d Richman recalled. \u201cWe were 24 hours from going out of business so many times before we even got started.\u201d\nLittle could they have known what awaited them at the project\u2019s end, how worthwhile their efforts would prove. Long before Shaker Rocks opened its doors, or indeed even had a door, the Richmans began receiving queries from all over the region. When the gym began accepting advance memberships and birthday party bookings, the response exceeded even optimistic projections, Richman said.\nNow, the project is clearly on solid ground, thanks in equal parts to an ongoing fitness boom and a surge of interest in what will soon be an Olympic sport. Where, at times, the Richman family\u2019s dream of a climbing gym in Shaker Heights may have appeared uncertain, the future of Shaker Rocks today is all but carved in stone.\n\u201cAll the Midwest climbing parents, they\u2019re talking,\u201d Richman said. \u201cHow soccer was 15 years ago, that\u2019s how rock climbing is now.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d the mother\u2019s lawyer, Nicholas Boca, told ABC 15. \u201cThat type of kicking your door in, with guns drawn\u2026 it should be reserved for violent criminals.\u201d\nState Representative Kelly Townsend has a history of encouraging parents to skip vaccinations for their children. She once called vaccination a form of communism, because it forces people to do something.\nTownsend wrote on Facebook: \u201cThe idea that we force someone to give up their liberty (with a vaccine) for the sake of the collective is not based on American values but rather, Communist.\u201d\nHowever, when the police busted through this family apartment in the name of vaccinations, the Republican quickly stepped up to criticize the police and their response to the doctor\u2019s \u201cmisdiagnosis.\u201d\n\u201cThis mother is nearly 9 months pregnant, and her baby will be born soon,\u201d Townsend said in a Facebook post. \u201cI have great concern that DCS will also take this infant over a misdiagnosis by the Dr., who thought the child might have meningitis when actually he had (a respiratory virus). This would have led to an unnecessary and potentially dangerous spinal tap of a two-year-old child. The parents were correct, the doctor was wrong.\u201d\nBecause the Chandler police used excessive force when dealing with this case, people in Arizona are questioning whether the law even protects children. Townsend has written new legislation that would require police to have a warrant before they can remove children from their families at gunpoint and threat of death.\nThe DCS has not commented on the story.\nDo you think the Chandler police overreacted? Or should police department take the threat of unvaccinated children as seriously as they would armed criminals?\nSources: NY Daily News / Photo Credit: Post Image\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The continued use and production of thin plastics is said to cause more harm than good that if the country is not careful it will have no fish stocks in Lake Malawi by 2050, according to findings from an independent assessment.\nThis was revealed by the spokesperson of Malawi Parliamentary Conservation Caucus (MPPC) Commodius Nyirenda and MPCC Co-Chair Alex Meja during a news conference that took place in Lilongwe.\nFindings from an independent assessment commissioned by the Malawi government with support from UNDP and Lilongwe Wildlife Trust also unearthed negative social, environmental and economic impacts of plastics pollution.\nAccording to Meja and Nyirenda, an estimated 75 000 tons of plastic is currently produced in Malawi each year, of which 80 per cent is single useplastic that cannot be recycled.\nIt was also revealed during the meeting that plastic production has roughly doubled globally in the past 30 years with 3000 million tons of plastic waste being produced every year, almost equivalent to the weight of the entire human population.\nSaid Nyirenda: \"The evidence is crystal clear. If thin plastics use continues unabated we can expect degraded soils, reduced fish stocks, worsening crop yields, increased floods, declining human health and losses in tourism revenue.\"\nNyirenda then called on Malawians to desist using thin plastics because they are not easily degradable and end up in our rivers and eventually lakes.\n\"There is evidence that fish is failing to multiply because of the presence of plastics in Lake Malawi which is sometimes ingested unknowingly and affects spawning. If we are not pro-active even the tourism sector will be negatively affected since tourists come to see rare species of fish that cannot be found anywhere else in the world,' said Nyirenda.\nNyirenda added that if the fish in Lake Malawi dwindles then millions if not thousands of fishers along the lake will have their livelihood completely compromised as they will have nothing to do.\nMeja concurred with Nyirenda that by 2050 negative effects of plastics will reverberate across the country as many people especially fishers in Lake Malawi will be toiling in vain.\nProfessor Sosten Chiotha, who is the Regional Director for Leadership for Environmental Development, explained in an interview with Nyasa Times that the presence of thin plastic bags is of huge concern to everybody because they affect nature.\nChiotha disclosed that recently his organization engaged Malawi army divers to collect trash in Lake Malawi and the soldiers ended up collecting moreplastics.\n\"We have evidence that some fish if you dissect them they have plastics in their gut. This is dangerous and affects reproduction systems of the fish. Even then quality of water if we persist using thin plastics will be compromised and eventually we lose revenue from tourism as the Lake will no longer be attractive,\" he added.\nSpokesperson for Lilongwe Wildlife Trust Elaine Hake whose organization works to protect Malawi's biodiversity for the benefit of the nation and wildlife also called for drastic action on those still producing thin plastics.\n\"Thin plastics are a danger that we need to do away with, the sooner the better. As LWT we have been appointed by government to administer a number of national wildlife trade, deforestation, justice and advocacy initiatives. In collaboration with local and international partners, LWT responds to urgent conservation challenges as well as drive long term social and institutional change across a number of areas including illegal wildlife trade, deforestation and plastic solution,\" explained Hake.\nPortfolio Manager for Resilience and Sustainable Growth at UNDP Andrew Spezowka said tackling plastic pollution is crucial to achieveing sustainable development and that is the reason why this issue is woven into the UN's sustainable development goals.\n\"The government of Malawi has demonstrated its progressive approach to environmental protection by banning thin plastics in 2014 and we welcome Malawi joining the growing number of countries across Africa that are tackling plastic pollution and upholding a common vision for a cleaner, safer and more prosperous future,\" he said.\nThe international community have recognized the urgency and gravity of the matter and as of March 2019, lightweight plastics have been introduced in 62 countries.\nLast month the European Union voted to ban single-use plastics across Europe by 2021.\n", "label": "human"}

The board, additionally, endorsed 11 project concepts and pre-concepts, and approved US$170,000 in project formulation grants to help further develop them.\nWhile it technically cleared three full additional regional projects, since it reached the US$60 million cap for regional project funding for the current fiscal year, the Board deferred formal approvals of those projects until the start of the next fiscal year on July 1, when another US$60-million in new funding for regional projects becomes available. It established a waitlist in the meantime for regional projects recommended for approval.\nThe other three regional projects that were recommended for approval by the board will be considered for funding in July by remote intersessional decision. They total about US$39.5 million across projects in Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger; another in Comoros, Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique; and one in Argentina and Uruguay.\nFULL AGENDA\nThe start of the board meeting featured its annual change in leadership as Sylviane Bilgischer of Belgium became the new chair and Ibila Djibril of Benin the vice-chair. Bilgischer congratulated outgoing chair Victor Vi\u00f1as of the Dominican Republic for the leadership he showed over the past year. She praised the fund\u2019s excellent results at COP 24 in December, which included decisions where the fund is now formally serving the Paris Agreement and a record amount of new pledges raised. Several new board members and alternates joined the meeting as well from the Bahamas, Fiji, Germany, Italy, Malawi, Spain and Sweden.\n\u201cThis was a very full agenda and the board accomplished a lot as a new group,\u201d said Bilgischer.\n\u201cThe Adaptation Fund now has tangible projects for the first time in climate-vulnerable countries of the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh, and its first regional project in Eastern Europe. We also enhanced climate access in Uganda by accrediting a new Direct Access entity there. Importantly, we made progress with the transition process from Kyoto to Paris, and made steps forward so that the fund will continue to serve, both in the meantime and eventually, just the Paris Agreement in a smooth and seamless manner,\u201d she added.\nAmong other key decisions by the board, it decided to explore in consultation with civil society and draw on lessons from other climate funds, various options to further enhance civil society participation and engagement in the work of the board and prepare an analysis for the next board meeting. It also decided to consider extending the reaccreditation process for national implementation entities that are actively engaged in concrete projects, to allow more time to comply with the process while those projects are being completed.\nThe key decisions by the board related to the Paris Agreement followed the recent landmark decisions at the COP 24 climate change conference in Poland in December, where the 197-member Conference of the Parties, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, decided the Fund \u201cshall serve\u201d the agreement in a formal manner, starting on January 1, this year.\nThe decision recognised the fund\u2019s concrete adaptation work to the most vulnerable and its effectiveness in building national capacities to adapt to climate change through Direct Access.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Driving the news: In Bezos' annual letter to stockholders Thursday, the Amazon CEO countered two lines of criticism: that his company is strong-arming third-party sellers on its platform, and that it has monopolistic power over the market.\n\u201cThird-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly,\u201d Bezos' letter said. It pointed to Amazon's investment in Fulfillment by Amazon and the Prime program as \"the very best selling tools we could imagine and build\" for its third-party merchants.\n\u201cAmazon today remains a small player in global retail,\" the letter said in another section. \"We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that\u2019s largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline.\"\n\u201cIt certainly looks like they\u2019re concerned about the growing scrutiny on their market power,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a longtime critic of the company, who also argued Bezos was downplaying Amazon's power over its marketplace.\nBackground: Amazon\u2019s critics have ramped up their pressure in recent years, saying the company uses its scale to muscle out competitors in a growing array of businesses.\nIn a 2017 law review article, a then-law student named Lina Khan traced how the company had become a dominant player without running afoul of current antitrust legal standards in the United States.\nLast year, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced she was probing the company's dual role running a marketplace for third-party sellers and competing against them with its own private label products. (Amazon maintains its private labels constitute a tiny percentage of sales.)\nNow, Amazon is a regular target for progressives. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) told Axios in January, around the time she launched her presidential campaign, that \"Amazon should be subject to oversight that protects the dignity of workers and ensures fair competition.\"\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released a plan in March to break up Amazon and other tech giants and ban marketplace platforms from selling products on their own service.\nAmazon has also pulled back on some practices that have put the firm in the crosshairs of regulators.\nIn March, Amazon stopped banning third-party merchants in the United States from offering lower prices on other sales platforms, after Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) raised concerns about this practice, which was discontinued in Europe under regulatory scrutiny in 2013.\nIt has also stopped a series of special promotions for the private-label products business Warren has criticized on the campaign trail, according to CNBC, although it told the outlet they had been experimental.\n\"I'm glad Amazon pulled back on some anti-competitive behaviors after I raised concerns about their business model, but I'm still deeply concerned that their own private-label sales on their platform are projected to hit $25 billion by 2022,\" said Warren in a statement.\n", "label": "human"}

Combined with fears of slowing global growth and a reduction in corporate earnings, an ongoing trade war would certainly add to the growing wall of worry for investors.\n\u201cIf it began to look like a semipermanent trade war, the market would definitely sell off,\u201d said Cashin.\nFurthermore, the severity of a sell-off would depend on how long the trade war continues\u2013to Cashin, the longer, the deeper the sell-off.\n\u201cIf it looks like we are looking at two years or something like that, with us going nose to nose with some major trading partners, then I think the sell-off could be more severe,\u201d Cashin added.\nWall Street analysts are expecting a less-than-stellar earnings season for the first quarter as big banks like J.P. Morgan and Bank of America are scheduled to kick off reporting on Friday. Investors are looking at a 4.3 percent year-over-year reduction in earnings growth, according to FactSet estimates.\nShould those estimates hold up, it would represent the first profit reduction for the S&P 500 since the second quarter of 2016. With analysts expecting a decline in earnings, focus falls on corporate guidance for the rest of the year, which could help temper any investor fears.\nAdding to the market fretting is the IMF cutting its global growth forecast to the lowest level since the financial crisis, citing the impact of tariffs and a weak outlook for most developed markets. According to the IMF, the world economy will grow at a 3.3 percent pace, which is 0.2 percent lower versus the initial forecast in January.\nIn addition, the global volume of trade in goods and services will increase 3.4 percent in 2019, which represents a drop from the 3.8 percent gain last year.

{"text": "After dangling little more than a title before us for months, EA and Respawn Entertainment finally revealed more about their new Star Wars game, Jedi: Fallen Order over the weekend. What they revealed almost says more about the publishers than it does about the game \u2014 namely, that the lack of typical \u201cEA-ish\u201d elements means Electronic Arts may have finally let years of fan complaints sink into its skin.\nEA revealed the game\u2018s trailer during Star Wars Celebration in Chicago, alongside a panel with Respawn founder Vince Zampella. Zampella told a cheering crowd, \u201cNo multiplayer. No microtransactions. It\u2019s a story game.\u201d This was later confirmed by tweets from the official EA Star Wars Twitter, which also specified the company would resist the temptation to add them after the fact:\nNo microtransactions. No loot boxes. And no, we won't be adding them. A single-player Star Wars story for those of you who are ready to become a Jedi. https://t.co/kTheWVBjJc \u2014 EA Star Wars (@EAStarWars) April 13, 2019\nRemember a few weeks ago, when Gearbox revealed Borderlands 3 and sent its audience into paroxysms of joy when it mentioned the game wouldn\u2019t have a battle royale mode? This is that, amplified by the fact that, while no one really thought Borderlands 3 would be battle royale, we had every reason to believe EA would pull its usual tricks with this game.\nRemember, Star Wars: Battlefront II was the game that started the whole loot box controversy, which is still going several years later. The company has also gone a long time without releasing a single-player game, having cancelled a few promising projects. Most, if not all EA games released in the last five or so years have had multiplayer. So even hoping for a game with a story campaign seemed like a big ask. The fact the company is upfront about what the game isn\u2019t suggests its actually sensitive to the criticism its received.\nAs for the game itself, it looks mildly interesting. From what we\u2019ve seen of the story so far, a former Jedi Padawan named Cal Kestis manages to survive the Order 66 purge and must keep his head down, not using the Force lest he attract the attention of the Empire.

{"text": "\u2018Modernize\u2019 these sports by making them safer\nRe: Most Ottawa officials breathe sigh of relief at provincial budget, April 11.\nOne of the less-mentioned aspects of the 2019 Ontario budget is \u201cModernizing rules for professional and amateur combative sports.\u201d The three combative sports mentioned in the budget \u2013 mixed martial arts, boxing and kickboxing \u2013 all allow deliberate blows to the head. Of the Olympic combative sports \u2013 such as boxing, freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, and Judo \u2013 the majority do not allow direct blows to the head.\nThe budget proposes to \u201cmake it safer for professional and amateur athletes to participate in combative sports.\u201d There is no such thing as a completely safe blow to the head, especially if it is delivered by a trained athlete. Any sport in which an athlete can win a match by rendering their opponent unconscious can never be made completely safe.\nThe three head-striking sports mentioned in the budget are distinctive in that opponents can be killed or paralyzed even if there is no negligence and all the rules are observed. One of the ways in which such sports could be made safer would be to make promoters and sponsors liable to civil damages for serious injury or death, even if there was no negligence or violation of the rules. However, that solution might be unacceptable to the government because it would reduce the number of fights and tourism and media dollars.\nA compromise would be to require promoters and sponsors to carry a significant amount of disability and survivors\u2019 insurance payable if there is serious injury or death, regardless of negligence or other fault. If the sport were quite safe, premiums would be very low. It would also create a financial incentive for sponsors and promoters to develop safety protocols in addition to those required by the government.\nBruce Couchman, Ottawa\nCurtailing disaster preparedness is short-sighted\nResidents of Northern Ontario will recall the harrowing 2018 fire season, in which 275,000 hectares of land were scorched by 1,325 individual fires. Firefighters were battling 550 blazes during July alone, a toll so high that Ontario had to temporarily import nearly 1,000 out-of-province firefighters and support staff to augment provincial capacity.\nSo it is surprising to see that the 2019 budget cuts the Emergency Forest Firefighting budget from $212 million to a $69.8 million, a drop of 67 per cent.\nIn the face of an emergency, additional money can be allocated if needed. This is not the case for forecasting and monitoring activities or floodplain restoration, and makes the 50 per cent cuts to Conservation Authorities\u2019 flood management activities all the more problematic.\nEmergency managers rely on forecasts and prevention projects to protect against property damage and loss of life. With the federal government retreating from disaster assistance and climate change intensifying severe events, these cuts have the potential to cause much greater damage down the line.\nDustin Carey, Ottawa\nQuebecers, like the rest of us, came from somewhere else\nRe: A growing sense of sadness about Quebec, April 15.\nI appreciated this article by Fariha Naqvi-Mohamed.

{"text": "A 24-year-old man arrested Friday morning and accused of randomly throwing or pushing a 5-year-old boy from a third-floor balcony at the Mall of America has had other violent incidents at the Bloomington shopping center, court records show.\nThe man, identified by police as Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, was accused in July 2015 of throwing things off the upper level of the mall to the lower level. He also refused to give his name to police and resisted arrest.\nAranda was given a trespass notice then to stay away from the mall.

{"text": "Perhaps the best part about Sunday\u2019s 84-74 victory for the Celtics?\nPretty much no one but the 18-something thousand in the Garden saw them shoot 32.5 percent in the first half. No one but those in attendance saw them turn the ball over a hideous 10 times in the opening 24 minutes while falling behind Indiana by as many as 11 points on the way to a 45-38 deficit at the break.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Brad Stevens with a smile as he walked away from the postgame interview room. \u201cTiger.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until Eldrick Woods had taken down the Masters and secured his 15th major that full attention could be turned to Causeway Street. The Tiger effect stretched all the way from Augusta to the North End, drowning out every other sporting exercise in its wake.\nBy then, the Celtics had decided to truly play some basketball. They should thank Tiger for sparing them the national embarrassment of their shooting.\nAnd while Woods was hitting a fairway metal off the 18th tee, the C\u2019s started gripping it and ripping it. They scored the first 11 points of the third quarter and grew that into a 22-3 run to take command.\nAnd not only were the Bostonians firing at pins, it helped their cause, too, that Indiana kept rinsing its shots in the Charles. The Pacers were rather Molinari-like, missing their first 10 shots from the floor.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 3:28 remained in the third period that they were credited with their first field goal of the session \u2014 and that came with Al Horford was called for goaltending a Cory Joseph drive. In other words, Indiana\u2019s first bucket of the half didn\u2019t even make it through the strings.\nThe Celtics cooled off, scoring just 24 points over the last 16 minutes after posting those 22 in the first eight of the second half. But they avoided becoming the third straight higher-seeded team in the East to fall into an 0-1 hole on its home floor by playing with the kind of physical intensity that would have earned them several more wins that they performed that way on anything resembling a regular basis in the regular season season.\nBut these are the playoffs, and like the Bruins\u2019 metamorphosis from Game 1 spectators to Game 2 aggressors against the Maple Leafs, the Celtics took a page from their mates down the hall and took the body in the second half. It wasn\u2019t that they were weenies or anything in the first two periods, but they raised their checking game in the third, and the Pacers seemed unprepared for this kind of hockey on hardwood. Their most frequent response was to complain to the officials as the Celts ran in the opposite direction with the ball.\n\u201cThe biggest point we made at the break was protecting the paint,\u201d said Stevens.\nThe coach noted that it was more of a positioning thing, but added, \u201cYou can\u2019t give teams layups, and you\u2019ve got to challenge shots as well as you can. And then rebounding and owning your space on offense had been our No. 1 and 2 emphases over the last four days. (It was) disappointing the way they got under us a little. We knew that they would come at us.\u201d\nBut, warming to one of Red Auerbach\u2019s most important tenets, the Celtics were instigators rather than retaliators in the second half \u2014 with the notable exception of Jaylen Brown\u2019s two-hand shove of Bojan Bogdanovic that earned a technical after the two had been trading words and elbows a while.\n\u201cThis is not a series for the timid,\u201d said Stevens.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a team that just plays hard,\u201d said Horford, who hauled in a game-high 11 rebounds and facilitated the offense with five assists to go with his 10 points on 10 shots from the floor. \u201cThey play the right way. They\u2019re tough. You have to match that in order to have any chance. And I feel like that third quarter was huge for us tonight.\u201d\nEven larger for their image, because those who tuned in from that point on will come away believing these are the Celtics they expected from the season tip-off.\nThe first half had been a very nice old-school rock fight of sorts, but Tiger lowered the ratings before the C\u2019s could master the afternoon.\nAnd that was fine with all local concerns. Celts\u2019 co-owner Steve Pagliuca was in his Garden seat and focused on the game in front of him, but, golf enthusiast that he is, he admitted getting regular updates on his phone from his son-in-law and caught the final holes in a Garden private club before his team made him very happy after halftime. He\u2019d also hit the links in the morning to get ready for, uh, this playoff opener.\nDanny Ainge generally tries to stay away from active participation in his job on this holy day of the week, but one has to wonder where his attention lay.\n\u201cOh, he wasn\u2019t watching us,\u201d cracked Stevens. \u201cAnd if he was, I\u2019m sure he had one eye on Tiger, too.\u201d\nBy the time the Celtics got all the attention of their president of basketball operations \u2014 and the rest of the viewing public \u2014 they were more than ready for their close-up.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Sam Bennett provides the sort of spark, the sort of sandpaper, that is such an important asset during the NHL\u2019s spring dance.\nAnd despite an early exit in Monday\u2019s 7-2 drubbing of the Los Angeles Kings, the Calgary Flames expect to have the hard-nosed, hard-hitting forward in the lineup when they open their Stanley Cup playoff quest next week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation in this game but he\u2019s fine, that\u2019s the good thing,\u201d said Flames head coach Bill Peters of Bennett\u2019s injury scare in a meaningless meeting at Staples Center. \u201cSo he\u2019ll play again here in the regular season and be ready for the playoffs. Dodged a bullet on that one.\u201c\nWith top spot in the Western Conference already clinched, the Flames \u2014 minus six of their resting regulars \u2014 continued to roll against the cellar-dwelling Kings.\nFor a big chunk of the night, Bennett was among the bright spots.\nMarking his return to the Flames\u2019 lineup after missing five straight \u2014 and seven of eight \u2014 due to an upper-body ailment, No. 93 cranked an opponent on his first shift of the evening and scored a greasy goal later in the opening frame.\nHowever, with just a minute remaining in the middle stanza, the 22-year-old released a wrist shot from the right circle and was walloped by Kings defenceman Kurtis MacDermid, all 6-foot-5 and 233 lbs. of him.\nBennett struggled back to his feet and headed straight to the visiting locker-room. He did not return for the third, but the post-game report from his boss was all positive.\n\u201cWhen you see him down on the ice, you\u2019re just hoping for the best,\u201d said Flames centre Mark Jankowski after a three-point performance. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be alright. He\u2019s a tough guy obviously, so we\u2019re just hoping he\u2019s going to be OK for playoffs.\u201c\nApparently, he is.\nPhew.\nSam Bennett\u2019s numbers:\nEven with four of their big-minute blue-liners and two-thirds of the 3M Line watching from the press box after they\u2019d secured the top seed in the Western Conference the previous night, the Flames managed to hit the 50-win plateau for just the second time in franchise history with a one-sided result against the Kings.\nRookie defenceman Oliver Kylington, after sitting 13 straight as healthy scratch, collected an assist on his first shift in nearly a month.\nFellow freshman Juuso Valimaki, a rising-star rearguard recalled earlier in the day from the minors, didn\u2019t look out of place in his first NHL appearance since late November. He, too, notched an assist in nearly 22 minutes of ice time.\nBest of all, forward James Neal scored for his second in a three-game span, added an assist and finished plus-4, another sign that the big-bucks free-agent addition is trending upwards since returning from a five-week layoff due to injury.\n\u201cThe rest, like I\u2019ve said, I took it as a blessing and just tried to stay positive and just did everything I could to get my body back to where I wanted it to be,\u201d said Neal, shooting to advance to the Stanley Cup final for the third consecutive campaign. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of playing tired. You don\u2019t want to use it as an excuse, but you\u2019ve played a lot of hockey and played a lot of meaningful hockey and meaningful games and sometimes you get so amped up and then you come down a little bit.\n\u201cSo for me, I want to get back to where I know I can be, the player I can be, and I think it was a little bit of a reset for me. The body has felt great coming back. I\u2019m skating a lot better and I feel good around the net, feel good on pucks, more patience and hanging onto more pucks and getting more shots \u2026\n\u201cSo I feel a lot better.\u201d\nThere is plenty of meaningful hockey coming up.\nThe Flames\u2019 depth dudes seem to be ready.\nJankowski, Neal and Bennett showed flashes of chemistry in Los Angeles as a line before losing a man late in the second.\nFourth-line pivot Derek Ryan potted a pair, cashing Kylington\u2019s rebound just two minutes after the anthems and burying another as the out-of-town team turned it into a rout in the third.\nSuperstar Johnny Gaudreau sniped a top-shelf special, while Andrew Mangiapane also tickled twine.\nKyle Clifford and Dustin Brown replied for the Kings.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just turn it up at playoff time,\u201d Jankowski reminded. \u201cThis is the time of the year where you really ramp it up \u2026 For us, we want to be playing our best hockey.\u201d\nNow boasting a 50-23-7 record, the Flames will conclude this three-game road-trip with Wednesday\u2019s date against the Anaheim Ducks at Honda Center (8:30 p.m. MT, Sportsnet West/Sportsnet 960 The Fan).\nWELCOME BACK, VALIMAKI\nAuditions, in this case, remain open.\nThis is not a top-of-the-credits starring role, but the sixth defenceman is still a significant piece of the supporting cast. This is not one of the extras.\nOn Monday, fittingly not far from Hollywood and having already clinched the first seed in the Western Conference playoff bracket, the Calgary Flames were able to get a glimpse of every one of the candidates for that third-pairing position in Monday\u2019s 7-2 shellacking of the Kings at Staples Center.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there and I\u2019m playing tonight \u2026 So that\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d smiled rookie Juuso Valimaki, freshly recalled from the American Hockey League\u2019s Stockton Heat.\n\u201cEvery time I step on the ice now, it\u2019s another chance to show that I want to play and I want to be in the lineup every night.\u201d\nValimaki had, of late, been out of sight but certainly not out of mind.\nThe 20-year-old started the season at the Saddledome before missing two months due to a high-ankle sprain. He\u2019s been workhorsing for the farm club since being green-lighted in late January.\nMonday\u2019s call-up didn\u2019t come as any sort of surprise.\n\u201cIt means everything,\u201d said Valimaki, who collected four goals and 10 assists and posted a plus-9 rating in 20 appearances with the Heat. \u201cThat\u2019s why I play \u2014 I want to play here, and especially this time of the year. The best time in hockey is just around the corner.\u201d\nIndeed, the NHL\u2019s annual playoff bash starts next week, with the Flames entering as top dog in the Western Conference for the first time since way back in 1989-90.\nThey clinched that perch with Sunday\u2019s victory over the Sharks in San Jose, turning a hat-trick of remaining regular-season outings into valuable opportunities to rest some of their go-to guys.\nThat allowed coach Bill Peters to scratch captain Mark Giordano and fellow back-enders TJ Brodie, Travis Hamonic and Noah Hanifin in Los Angeles. Those four just happen to lead the Flames in average ice time, all working upwards of 20 minutes per night.\nOf the guys who did suit up at Staples Center, Rasmus Andersson is the other sure thing to be patrolling the blue line in Calgary\u2019s optimal playoff lineup.\nOscar Fantenberg seems like the frontrunner for that final slot. He has been a steady-eddie since being acquired from the Kings on trade-deadline day.\nSunday\u2019s surprise sniper, Dalton Prout, is the toughest customer of the bunch.\nMichael Stone has more NHL experience than any of the others but has barely added to his resume this season after missing nearly three months because of a blood clot, while rookie Oliver Kylington\u2019s greatest asset is that he skates like a deer.\nOf all those options, Valimaki is perhaps the most complete package. He is also oh-so-green.\n\u201cI know what (Valimaki) is all about. He\u2019s a hell of player,\u201d Peters praised prior to Monday\u2019s matchup. \u201cHe scored the game-winner in his last game (in Stockton). They won 2-1 and he snuck in back-door and beat his winger to a rebound with 15 seconds back. Great instincts. He looks good, looks bigger, looks stronger \u2026\n\u201cAnd I love the fact we handled him correctly \u2014 he started in the National Hockey League, went down and got a taste of the American League and played all those valuable minutes.

{"text": "By Gary Stringer, Kim Escue and Chad Keller, Stringer Asset Management\nCoaching is one of the greatest values that Financial Advisors bring to their relationships with clients. We live in an emotional world, especially when it comes to the financial markets. At Stringer Asset Management, we believe that errors resulting from emotional decision making when investing is the primary reason that many investors do not capture the potential rewards that financial markets can provide. Coaching based on precepts of behavioral economics can benefit investors and strengthen their relationships with their Financial Advisors.\nRichard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics for his contributions to the field of behavioral economics. Despite the historical economic assumption that people make rational decisions, behavioral economics shows that people often make decisions that may not be rational. The work of Thaler and many others in behavioral finance may be boiled down to practical techniques that we think can help investors achieve better results.\nPRACTICAL STEPS TO IMPROVE RESULTS\nSTEP 1: BE HUMBLE, WE ARE ONLY HUMAN\nInvestors cannot fight human nature, but steps can be taken to keep detrimental behavior in check. The first step is for investors to admit they are fallible. Once investors acknowledge that they do not know what is going to happen for certain, processes can be put in place to help control the behavioral pitfalls of investing.\nSTEP 2: HAVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT & DOCUMENTED PLAN\nTo avoid distractions investors should focus on the big picture, which starts with a fundamentally sound investment strategy. Without a definable and repeatable process, a positive outcome is just dumb luck. In his 1999 commencement address to the University of Pennsylvania, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined his four principles to decision making: \u201cFirst, the only certainty is that there is no certainty. Second, every decision, as a consequence, is a matter of weighing probabilities. Third, despite uncertainty we must decide and we must act. And lastly, we need to judge decisions not only on the results, but on how they were made.1\u201d\nSTEP 3: INCLUDE RELIEF VALVES\nEvery investment strategy needs relief valves to help keep the negative impact from human behavior from causing harm. We see an analogy in engineering. For example, a mid-mission oxygen tank rupture caused the Apollo 13 space craft to abort its mission before landing on the moon. Helping avert disaster was a relief valve built into the tank which mitigated the damage and allowed the crew to make it safely back.\nInvestors can also build relief valves into their portfolios to avert disaster and help them sleep at night. For example, investors should keep savings and emergency funds separate from investment funds. Savings and emergency funds are safe funds (i.e., cash). Investment funds are where risk should be taken, and the amount of risk depends on the investor\u2019s goals, objectives and constraints.\nConsider the investor lifecycle chart below as an example of a sound investment plan. The investor starts off just out of school and their immediate goal is to build a cash reserve to cover emergencies. Once this reserve is built, the investor can begin the accumulation phase by allocating to both strategic portfolios (relatively static portfolios based on long-term expected return characteristics) and tactical portfolios (more active portfolios that attempt to take advantage of perceived market imbalances that create attractive short-term investment opportunities).\nThroughout the life cycle, the cash reserve and tactical allocation can be considered the relief valves. We consider cash a relief valve in a mental accounting sense because it is always available to pay essential expenses, such as the mortgage and tuition. The tactical allocation is a relief valve because it can satiate an investor\u2019s cravings for action.\nInvestors should allocate more aggressively in the early stages of their lifecycle and gradually move to more conservative portfolios as they age. Throughout the chart, more color reflects less aggressive investments and less color reflects more aggressive. Once the investor is approximately five to ten years from retirement, they should begin the distribution phase and invest accordingly. This phase should include less aggressive strategic and tactical allocations as well as more cash.\nSTEP 4: ALLOCATE WITH A RISK FIRST APPROACH\nUnderstand that risk matters, and the importance of risk management is twofold. First, the arithmetic of loss makes it clear that positive compounded returns come more easily if downside deviations are limited. For example, a loss of 10% requires a return of 11% to get back to even, which is not an unreasonable expectation. Meanwhile, a loss of 30% requires a gain of 43% to get to even and a loss of 50% requires a doubling to get back to where the investor started.\nMore importantly, losses have a larger impact on investor sentiment than gains. The behavioral economics concept of loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to be more sensitive to a loss than they are to a gain. More specifically, the pain of a loss is in some cases more than two times greater than the good feeling associated with a gain. When combining the pain of a loss with a bias towards action, investors can make emotional decisions in a down market, which is rarely a good choice.\nWhile the probabilities of a loss small for fixed income investors, equity-oriented investors should understand how time and probabilities relate. For instance, the S&P 500 Index is just as likely to return a positive number as it is a negative on a daily basis.\nHowever, if investors extend their timeframe, the probabilities of a positive return are greatly increased. Furthermore, we can illustrate the loss aversion problem by combining those probabilities with investors\u2019 sensitivity to a loss. The discontent and impact felt by investors with a negative return on a daily basis is almost twice the satisfaction of a gain in their investment portfolio. The probabilities and resulting utility for equity investors does not turn to their favor until the timeframe is extended to about one year.\nSTEP 5: SATIATE CRAVINGS FOR ACTION\nMany investors have a craving for action and we believe that there are opportunities for new investment or to play defense in every market. It makes sense that Financial Advisors should include a tactical allocation in their clients\u2019 portfolios in order to attempt to take advantage of new opportunities or to quickly pare back risk, depending on the environment. These changes can help satiate their clients\u2019 craving for action.\nFor example, within our strategic (longer-term) and tactical (shorter-term) allocations, we maintain specific biases that should benefit our clients over time. Our strategic allocations use market factors that we think perform best over the long-term. Conversely, our tactical allocations allow us to take advantage of short-term opportunities and manage risks in real-time. Furthermore, there are certain asset types that we favor for the strategic portion of a portfolio and others that we think are more appropriate for the tactical side.\nSTEP 6: HAVE A PLAN IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY\nToday\u2019s 24-hour news cycle, where if it bleeds it leads, can drive investor emotions to extremes. Having a plan in case of emergency can help clients sleep at night. By this, we mean having a plan to reduce equity market exposure and increase defensive cash positions in anticipation of outsized market selloffs.\nImportantly, this should be a stubborn plan. Attempting to time the market is not a fundamentally sound investment strategy. Nobel laureate William Sharpe found that market timers have to be correct over 70% of the time just to keep pace with buy-and-hold investors2. Since uncertainty is inevitable, a fundamentally sound investment strategy should alleviate the necessity to clear such a high hurdle.\nThe team at Stringer Asset Management has worked together for nearly 15 years on developing an investment management process with individual investors and their families in mind.

{"text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Lawrence prosecutor has dismissed the DUI charge against Kansas City mayoral candidate Quinton Lucas.\n\"We always thought that there wasn't evidence to support a charge. There was never a crime committed,\" Quinton Lucas said. \"That's why I elected to fight the charge the moment it happened.\"\nThe Kansas City Council member was cited for DUI back in October.\nA Lawrence police officer got a call about an unconscious man near 8th and Massachusetts. That's when officers said they found Lucas asleep in his car. They arrested him for driving under the influence.\n\"I'm glad we have a positive resolution now,\" Lucas said.\nWhen that happened, Lucas took to Facebook. He openly said yes, he drank that night -- but he said he didn't drive. He planned to wait in his car until he was safe to drive and never attempted to move his car.\nWhen FOX4 asked Lucas if the car was running, he said:\n\"I think those are all things that ended up being debated. I think it's our view that most of those claims couldn't have been proven. I think you're seeing with the dismissal decision today that they agreed with the defense side that frankly, this was not the sort of thing that would sustain a DUI charge, and that's why the charges were dropped today by the prosecutors.\"\nA few months ago, Lucas said the Lawrence city prosecutor offered him a plea. He refused it.\nIn February, Lucas's attorney submitted a motion to dismiss evidence, saying he never should have been arrested in the first place.\nElizabeth, Hafoka, the supervising city prosecutor for Lawrence, sent FOX4 the following statement:\n\"After a review of the facts and relevant case law, the city does not have evidence to present that Mr. Lucas moved or attempted to move the vehicle, which is required for conviction of DUI based on the holding in State v. Darrow, 304 Kan. 710 (2016). The Kansas Supreme Court in Darrow held that 'taking actual physical control of the vehicle is insufficient to attempt to operate that vehicle without an attempt to make it move within meaning of driving under the influence (DUI) statute prohibiting a person from operating or attempting to operate a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.' In Mr. Lucas\u2019s case, there is no evidence that he moved or attempted to move the car. Therefore, the city will not proceed with prosecution at this time.\"\n\"I wasn\u2019t guilty of an offense,\" Lucas said. \"We were ready to take it to trial if we needed to, and I think that\u2019s why we saw prosecutors review it and dismiss the case today.\"\nLucas said when it comes to the Kansas City mayoral race, he isn't concerned about the dropped charge.\n\"I think the voters already spoke in connection with this issue in the primary,\" Lucas said. \"They had these facts and this information out for the last six months.\"\nMatt Harris, a political science professor at Park University, agrees.\n\"I think the public are willing to forgive, and a lot of times they just don\u2019t care or there can be other factors in races. Whether it\u2019s party ID, overall support for a candidate, for their ideas, there\u2019s a lot of other factors at play,\" Harris said. \"Something like this, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a major factor for the campaign.\"\nFOX4 asked Lucas' opponent, Jolie Justus, who is also on the Kansas City Council, for her thoughts on the matter.\nHer campaign manager said they don't have any comment right now.\n\"I think that just plays into the idea that this is not going to be a big factor in the race,\" Harris said. \"Sometimes scandals, charges, things like that can be a bigger factor when an opponent makes it a factor. And so Jolie Justus choosing not to address it, this is probably going to be put to bed, and then they\u2019ll move forward with the campaign.\"\nThe vote for Kansas City mayor is on June 18.\nLucas said his key platform issues are economic development with a focus on women, minorities and racial justice. Jolie Justus said her biggest priorities include reducing crime and increasing educational opportunities.\nLucas said he was fortunate enough to afford a strong attorney. He said he knows not everyone can do that and donated a thousand dollars to Legal Aid of Missouri. That's a group that helps free legal assistance for civil cases.\n39.099727 -94.578567\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It\u2019s getting bare-knuckled out there again in the ride-hailing wars.\nAccording to a report earlier today from The Information, newly public Lyft threatened Morgan Stanley with legal action earlier this week, demanding in a letter that the powerful investment bank stop marketing a short-selling product that it believed was disrupting trading in its stock.\nThe outlet says Lyft learned about the product through the New York Post, which reported in its own, separate story early this week that Morgan Stanley \u2014 the lead underwriter for Uber\u2019s IPO \u2014 had been calling pre-IPO investors in Lyft\u2019s offering and pitching them on a way to lock in gains, regardless of Lyft\u2019s lockup agreements with those investors.\nAt first glance, it seems like the kind of dirty pool we\u2019ve grown accustomed to seeing between the rival companies and their associates. But Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake tells TechCrunch that the New York Post report was flat-out wrong, providing us with the following statement: \u201cMorgan Stanley did not market or execute, directly or indirectly, a sale, short sale, hedge, swap, or transfer of risk or value associated with Lyft\u2019s stock for any Lyft shareholder identified by the company or otherwise known to us to be the subject of a Lyft lock-up agreement.\n\u201cOur firm\u2019s activities have been in the normal course of market making, and any suggestion that Morgan Stanley engaged in an effort to apply short pressure to Lyft is false.\u201d\nWhat went wrong is hard to know, given that the Post shielded its sources. But it was descriptive in how it characterized the purported short-selling scheme. From its story:\nDriving the unusual bets is language in Lyft\u2019s lock-up agreements that has hedge funds and other early Lyft investors giving themselves a green light to make limited \u201cshort\u201d bets, which make money on a stock\u2019s decline. The goal is to position the bets in such a way that investors don\u2019t benefit from a decline or a rise in the stock, but simply to lock in their IPO gains, which were significant. \u201cIf I can lock in $70 now, I\u2019m going to do that,\u201d said an investor. \u201cLyft made a mistake,\u201d one investor who bought into Lyft shares prior to the IPO told The Post. \u201cPeople who own the stock are allowed to hedge their positions. You are not allowed to reduce your economic interest.\u201d The investor was referring to a recent e-mail Lyft sent to investors reminding them that they are not allowed to engage in any transactions that might affect a holder\u2019s \u201ceconomic interest \u201d in the stock. This \u2014 and other \u201clock-up\u201d language around the IPO \u2014 has Lyft investors protecting against a decline in an amount identical to their stock holdings, rather than betting on the stock\u2019s decline.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Lyft for comment, which has yet to respond.\nA source familiar with the situation confirms that Lyft\u2019s ire with Morgan Stanley rests entirely on that Post piece, as noted in The Information. We\u2019re told that no further action has been taken, beyond the letter sent to the bank by Lyft\u2019s attorneys.\nWhether the story ends here remains to be seen. The Information has updated its original post to include part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s statement of denial, but it continues to report that, according to one of its sources, Morgan Stanley had been calling early Lyft investors for weeks during its roadshow and pitching them on a short-selling transaction that would enable them to lock in gains, regardless of the lockup.\nAssuming Morgan Stanley is telling the truth \u2014 and we can\u2019t imagine the bank would go on the record otherwise \u2014 there\u2019s still the question of who floated misinformation about a short-selling product in the first place. It may be one that regulators want to dig into. Stay tuned.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In series of Instagram posts, Cannon writes of 'unfinished business' and shares video of Honduran herbalist who claimed all diseases had only one cause.\nAfter the shooting death of rapper and community activist Nipsey Hussle (b.

Stark headed the New York AG\u2019s Consumer Fraud Division at that time.\nNow, however, rapper and music producer Nick Cannon may be preparing to back completion of Hussle\u2019s reported documentary on Dr. Sebi\u2019s trial, as he hinted in an Instagram post, according to the music site Vibe.\nIn other Instagram posts made around the same time, Cannon wrote that \u201cwe have to take \u2018responsibility\u201d for each other, and that he had \u201c\u2018unfinished King business\u2019 to tend to,\u201d Vibe reported.\nLoading...\nCannon also posted videos of Bowman discussing his theories. In one video posted by Cannon on Instagram, Bowman says, \u201cthere is only one disease\u2026 the compromising of the mucous membrane. And the mucous membrane of the Africans have been compromised 400 years now.\u201d\nWhile the extent of Hussle\u2019s \u2014 and Cannon\u2019s \u2014 involvement with the reported documentary on Bowman\u2019s trial is not clear, Hussle\u2019s commitment to investing in and improving conditions in the South Los Angeles community where he grew up is well-established. He owned several businesses and provided employment for local residents who could not find jobs elsewhere. He also invested in numerous neighborhood improvement projects, as LAist reported.\nBut Hussle was also open about his involvement earlier in his life with the notorious Los Angeles street gang, the Rollin\u2019 60s, a clique affiliated with the Crips gang. Police in Los Angeles now believe that Hussle\u2019s murder was an incident of gang-related violence, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n", "label": "human"}

Puskar/The Associated Press\nFord Motor Co on Thursday posted a better-than-expected first-quarter largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market and said it was more confident in its forecast 2019 would bring better results than last year.\nThe first-quarter results sent Ford\u2019s shares up as much as 8 per cent in aftermarket trading.\nFord is restructuring its business, which will include cutting costs by $11 billion by 2021 and overhauling its product lineup.\nStory continues below advertisement\nChief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters at company headquarters in suburban Detroit that Ford has more confidence its 2019 results will be better than last year\u2019s, but said it is in a \u201cvolatile environment with very strong competition.\u201d\nShanks added the first quarter was likely Ford\u2019s best for the year.\nVirtually all of the No. 2 U.S. automaker\u2019s profit was generated in the U.S. market, thanks to a strong performance by its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks and its new Ranger mid-size pickup. The company lost money in most other markets, but less than it had expected.\nThe company\u2019s decision to kill off most of its unprofitable passenger cars in the U.S. market meant that its revenue rose 2 per cent despite a 14 per cent drop in wholesale unit sales.\nFord also made a small profit in Europe and the profit at its financing arm also grew. But the automaker\u2019s global market share fell to 5.9 per cent from 6.5 per cent as it lost ground in every major market except North America.\n\u201cWe still have lots and lots of work to do,\u201d Shanks said. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the game, it\u2019s not game over.\u201d\nFord\u2019s biggest challenges lie outside the United States. The automaker is struggling in China. Earlier this month, Ford said it plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years, as it seeks to reverse a two-year sales slump in the world\u2019s top auto market.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe automaker saw its sales fall 48 per cent in the quarter, but said higher-priced products helped deliver a smaller loss than in the same quarter in 2018.\nIn March, Volkswagen AG and Ford signed a deal to develop mid-size pickup trucks and are continuing discussions about extending the alliance to include electric and autonomous vehicles and mobility services.\nThe two automakers have yet to reach agreement on a potential VW investment in Ford\u2019s Argo AI self-driving unit.\nCFO Shanks said those talks were \u201cgoing very well.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Ford said it will invest $500 million in U.S. electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC, joining e-commerce giant Amazon Inc in backing the potential rival to Silicon Valley\u2019s Tesla Inc.\nFord posted a quarterly net profit of $1.15 billion or 29 cents per share, down 34 per cent from $1.74 billion or 43 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 44 cents per share, above analyst estimates of 27 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\nStory continues below advertisement\nFord reported revenue of $40.3 billion for the quarter, down 4 per cent from $42 billion a year earlier.\n", "label": "human"}

I don't think it is impossible to win every game, (looking) game by game, but if you see the fixtures coming up - I think every game we play now we are going to be at a disadvantage physically and mentally,\" he said.\n\"We will have a game before the other teams, the other teams will have a rest. The Champions League is the same. So, it is difficult.\"\nCity are now staying in London ahead of their next testing task at Tottenham.\nTo underline his point, De Bruyne noted that Tottenham, who City also face in the Premier League this month, have had a free weekend ahead of the clash.\n\"Every game is difficult. We just now have to prepare for Tuesday,\" De Bruyne said.\n\"We know Tottenham played their last game on Wednesday so they will be more fresh than us. We have to prepare ourselves mentally and physically to be ready.\"\nThe game will be Tottenham's second at their new stadium, but De Bruyne insists City won't be troubled by the passionate atmosphere.\n\"The stadium doesn't matter. They are going to be excited because it is a Champions League quarter-final,\" he said.\n\"Spurs are a very good team. Everybody knows how they play. They will not change.\n\"It is going to be exciting, it is going to be tough because we play them three times in 10 days.\"\nWhile City were involved in FA Cup action over the weekend, title rivals Liverpool returned to the top of the table with a win at Southampton.\nCity are still favourites because of their game in hand, but De Bruyne does not think the Reds will allow any margin for error.\n\"Probably they will (win their games). We just have to look at ourselves and try to win game by game. We will see in the end what happens,\" he said.\n\"No matter who is champion or second, we've had a great season. What can you say if you get 92 or 95 points and in the end you are second?\n\"Normally that's historic in the Premier League, to get these points.

{"text": "Auburn held its annual A-Day spring game on Saturday in front of 41,489 fans at Jordan-Hare Stadium, all of whom got an early glimpse at the 2019 iteration of Gus Malzahn\u2019s team.\nThe Orange (first-team) won, 28-10, over the Blue (second-team) during the glorified scrimmage.\nHere are a few of AL.com\u2019s key takeaways from the Tigers\u2019 A-Day game:\n1. The passing game appears to be in good hands, regardless of who wins the starting job\nWhile it\u2019s still technically a four-man competition for the starting quarterback job, each of Auburn\u2019s candidates for the starting job looked sharp during their opportunities on A-Day -- particularly the trio of Joey Gatewood, Bo Nix and Malik Willis.\nGatewood and Nix, who worked with the first-team offense, each had strong first-half performances. Gatewood was 1-of-2 for 28 yards on his opening drive and finished the half 7-of-10 passing for 123 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Nix, who went 4-of-6 for 63 yards and a touchdown on his first drive, went 11-of-14 for 155 yards and two scores in the first half.\nWillis, who worked with the second-team offense in the first half, was a perfect 5-for-5 for 64 yards and a touchdown on his first possession and finished the half 7-of-8 for 63 yards. His one first-half touchdown went for 41 yards to Matthew Hill, who made a nice over-the-shoulder grab.\nIn the second half, the quarterbacks switched sides while there was a running clock. Willis went 2-of-2 for 22 yards in the second half. Nix threw an interception midway through the third quarter and finished 11-of-16 for 155 yards and two scores for the game.\n2. Seth Williams is putting his money where his mouth is\nEarlier this spring, Seth Williams said he wanted to help turn Auburn into \u201cWide Receiver U.\u201d A tall order, to be sure, but Williams backed up his talk on A-Day -- as did two of his other fellow wideouts. Williams caught four passes on four targets for 103 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the first half, with each of his grabs impressive athletic receptions. The most eye-opening of the bunch was a 38-yard touchdown pass from Nix in which Williams snatched the ball out of double coverage -- Roger McCreary was in coverage and Jamien Sherwood was closing in over the top, with a chance at the interception -- for a 38-yard touchdown.\nWilliams wasn\u2019t the only receiver to impress on A-Day. Matthew Hill, a redshirt freshman, had four receptions for 93 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the first half while splitting time between the Orange and Blue teams. He added a 35-yard reception in the fourth quarter. Eli Stove, fully recovered from the ACL injury he sustained last spring, had four first-half receptions for 63 yards and a touchdown.\n3. Harold Joiner\u2019s versatility was on display\nHarold Joiner\u2019s role on offense is still fluid and undefined -- he\u2019s part running back, part slot receiver -- but the redshirt freshman athlete was all over the field Saturday during A-Day. He finished with six carries for 21 yards as well three receptions for 28 yards -- and he added a fumble recovery to help the offense get the ball back following Nix\u2019s third-quarter interception.\nWhen Joiner signed with Auburn, Gus Malzahn spoke of using him like former Tulsa star Charles Clay. This spring, Malzahn evoked the name of another former player, running back Kerryon Johnson. After A-Day, it\u2019s easy to see why Auburn\u2019s staff likes Joiner\u2019s versatility and ability to fill some different roles within the offense.\n4. D.J. Williams should find a role in the backfield as a freshman\nAuburn returns each of its top-four running backs from last season in Boobee Whitlow, Kam Martin, Shaun Shivers and Malik Miller, but it was the newest running back of the group -- freshman early enrollee D.J. Williams -- who looked most impressive on A-Day. The 5-foot-10, 216-pounder had nine first-half carries for 56 yards while going up against Auburn\u2019s first-team offense. He finished with 11 total carries for 55 yards.\n5. Auburn\u2019s offensive line is miles ahead of where it was a year ago\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s practice, Gus Malzahn gave his shortest answer of the spring. He was asked which position group was the most improved this spring, and he bluntly said \u201coffensive line.\u201d\nThat was evident during A-Day, and it should be no surprise. Auburn\u2019s offensive line returns all five starters, with all five of them seniors. The group looked cohesive against the second-team defense and did not allow a sack in the first half. The only negative play by the first-team offense in the first half came on a 2-yard loss by Nix on a keeper.\n6. Chandler Wooten injured\nAuburn made it out of A-Day relatively healthy, with only one player injured during the spring game. Junior linebacker Chandler Wooten was injured in the first half and remained down on the field for several moments with an apparent right knee injury. He was tended to by trainers, who helped him off the field and took him back to the locker room.\nTom Green is an Auburn beat reporter for Alabama Media Group.

At the 2019 Virtual Summit on Wednesday, a trio of fixed income investors shared their thoughts.\nOn the Fixed Income Strategies for a Changing Debt World panel:\nJordan Farris, Managing Director, Head of ETF Product Development, Nuveen\nJohn Ecklund, Managing Director, Global Fixed Income, Currency & Commodities Group, J.P. Morgan Asset Management\nTim Urbanowicz, Senior Fixed Income ETF Strategist, Invesco\nThe default bond play to get broad-based exposure might be the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSEArca: AGG), which tracks the investment results of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. The AGG gives bond investors general exposure to the fixed income markets, but there are times when current market conditions warrant a deconstruction of the AGG to extract maximum investor benefit.\nHowever, given the latest challenges in the market, more diversification across the spectrum of the yield curve should be considered\u2013a mix of short-term and longer durations.\n\u201cYour first objective should be diversification,\u201d said Ecklund.\nAnother challenge lurking is the BBB bond rating risk. At the height of the extended bull market, risky less-than-investment-grade bonds were in vogue with their attractive yields, particularly in a rising rate environment, but BBB bonds that are on the cusp of high yield status could be facing a liquidity crisis, according to a recent CNBC report.\nAs the volatility seen has been racking the stock markets as of late, it has also affected the bond markets, particularly liquidity\u2013the ability purchase and sell an asset within a reasonable amount of time. BBB bond markets are especially susceptible because institutional investors, who carry war chests full of capital that aid in liquidity, aren\u2019t able to invest in these bonds if they become high yield or \u201cjunk\u201d issues.\n\u201cThis has been by far the biggest that we\u2019ve seen is in BBB issuers,\u201d said Urbanowicz.\nNonetheless, the quest for income in the bond markets still persists, which means that high yield is still in vogue despite the challenging fourth quarter in 2018.\n\u201cAt JP Morgan, we still like high yield,\u201d said Ecklund.\nA polling question was thrown out to advisors as to how their fixed income allocation is currently shaping up given the latest challenges\u2013a number were tilted towards short duration and investment-grade debt. However, an area that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten is overseas debt, such as emerging markets.\nSome ETFs mentioned during the presentation:\nMissed the Virtual Summit?

He's the man to do it.\"\nWidely tipped to challenge for the premiership this season, Penrith have disappointed with just two unconvincing wins from five games.\nThey gave Gold Coast their maiden win of the year last week, however, Ivan denied their poor form prompted him into finding a solitary voice.\n\"That wasn't the plan. Effectively, it was a group of leaders and it was an evolution thing, really. It got to a point where James has come through that,\" he said.\n\"I think right now, it's good for the team and he's the man to now lead us with the support of that group.\n\"When you put these sorts of groups together, the ideal thing would be to have someone actually rise in that group and that's what happened.\"\nThe 30-year-old Tamou takes the reins in the third season of a four-year deal with the Panthers, after he joined them from North Queensland at the end of 2016.\nHe has represented NSW in State of Origin on 14 occasions and played in 12 Test matches for the Kangaroos.\n\"He was pretty humbled and that's the sort of guy he is.

{"text": "Background:\nA major focus of research is on possible drug treatments targeting the clumps of protein (amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (tau proteins) in the brain, but with recent trial failures, debate has sharpened over whether treatment research needs to look elsewhere.\nEven if some researchers believe plaques and tau proteins may not play a causative role, they are considered hallmarks of the disease that diagnostics work is built around.\nWhat's new: Howard Fillit, founding executive director and chief science officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation, tells Axios:\n\"There's a lot of excitement in the field right now ... despite the [recent failure in some] clinical trials. There's over 100 studies being conducted now, with roughly half in amyloid and tau research.\"\nA large study of 11,049 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia published in JAMA Tuesday shows PET scans identifying amyloid plaques changed clinical care, such as drugs and counseling, by roughly two-thirds.\nFillit says that if Medicare would allow the tool, he believes people would not only get the proper diagnosis and symptom alleviation they need, but clinical trials would improve by having a larger and definite pool of Alzheimer's patients to study.\nOther exciting developments in the works, Fillit says, are tests of early diagnostics in the eyes, blood and spinal fluid that look for amyloids and tau, plus inflammatory and neurodegeneration markers. He expects a blood test in a couple years and says \"this is a really exciting time for biomarkers in this space.\"\nBiomarkers are something \u2014 such as amyloids \u2014 that can be measured and indicate the possible presence of a disease. Fillit points to...\nTwo new tests that the FDA granted breakthrough device designations to, including Roche's Elecsys that checks cerebrospinal fluid for biomarkers from amyloid and tau in assays.\nQuanterix uses a microscopic fluid-analysis device to detect a different protein that is released when neurons deteriorate.\nMeanwhile, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos joined the Diagnostics Accelerator formed over the summer to develop novel biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer's, bringing the total funding for new grants over the next 3 years to $50 million, ADDF announced Tuesday.\nThe bottom line: Billions are being spent by the U.S. government and biotech companies to understand the cause and to pin down better diagnostics and treatments. \"Alzheimer's will look like cancer [research] soon,\" Fillit says. \"We will have precision medicine.\"\nGo deeper:\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "\u00d7 Lori Lightfoot Becomes First Black Female Mayor of Chicago and First Openly Gay Leader of the City\nFormer federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot defeated a longtime political insider Tuesday to become Chicago\u2019s next mayor, the first black woman and openly gay person to lead the nation\u2019s third-largest city.\nLightfoot, who had never been elected to public office, easily defeated Toni Preckwinkle, who served in the City Council for 19 years before becoming Cook County Board president. Preckwinkle also is chairwoman of the county Democratic Party.\nLightfoot promised to rid City Hall of corruption and help low-income and working-class people she said had been \u201cleft behind and ignored\u201d by Chicago\u2019s political ruling class. It was a message that resonated with voters weary of political scandal and insider deals, and who said the city\u2019s leaders for too long have invested in downtown at the expense of neighborhoods.\nChicago will become the largest U.S. city to have a black woman serve as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20. She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U.S. cities, including Atlanta and New Orleans and will be the second woman to lead Chicago.\nLightfoot, 56, and her wife have one daughter.\nBrian Johnson, CEO of Equality Illinois, said the civil rights organization for lesbian and gay people was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the outcome.\n\u201cThis victory is historic, and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community,\u201d Johnson said.\nLightfoot emerged as the surprising leader in the first round of voting in February when 14 candidates were on the ballot to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who decided against running for a third term.\nLightfoot seized on outrage over a white police officer\u2019s fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her reformer campaign. That was even before Emanuel announced he wouldn\u2019t seek re-election amid criticism for initially resisting calls to release video of the shooting.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a person who decided I would climb the ladder of a corrupt political party,\u201d Lightfoot said during a debate last month. \u201cI don\u2019t hold the title of committeeman, central committeeman, boss of the party.\u201d\nPreckwinkle countered that her opponent lacks the necessary experience for the job.\n\u201cThis is not an entry-level job,\u201d Preckwinkle has said repeatedly during the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk about change. It\u2019s hard to actually do it. And that\u2019s been my experience \u2014 being a change maker, a change agent, transforming institutions and communities.\u201d\nJoyce Ross, 64, a resident of the city\u2019s predominantly black West Side who is a certified nursing assistant, cast her ballot Tuesday for Lightfoot. Ross said she believes Lightfoot will be better able to clean up the police department and curb city\u2019s violence.\nShe was also bothered by Preckwinkle\u2019s association with longtime Alderman Ed Burke, who was indicted earlier this year on charges he tried to shake down a restaurant owner who wanted to build in his ward.\n\u201cMy momma always said birds of a feather flock together,\u201d Ross said.\nTruly Gannon, a 39-year old mother of four who works as a dietitian, said she wasn\u2019t bothered by stories that portrayed Preckwinkle as an insider aligned with questionable politicians like Burke. She supported Preckwinkle, based on her experience.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure Lightfoot would be able to handle the job like Preckwinkle,\u201d she said.\nThe campaign between the two women got off to a contentious start, with Preckwinkle\u2019s advertising focusing on Lightfoot\u2019s work as a partner at Mayer Brown, one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms, and tagging her as a \u201cwealthy corporate lawyer.\u201d\nPreckwinkle also tried to cast Lightfoot as an insider for working in police oversight posts under Emanuel and police oversight, procurement and emergency communications posts under Mayor Richard M. Daley.\nIn one ad, Preckwinkle criticizes Lightfoot\u2019s oversight of the emergency communications in 2004 when a fire killed four children. A judge ordered Lightfoot to preserve 911 tapes after questions were raised about how the emergency call was handled. The ad notes some of the tapes were destroyed, prompting the judge to rebuke Lightfoot. The ad sparked a backlash from the family of three of the children killed, with their sister accusing Preckwinkle of trying to take advantage of her family\u2019s tragedy.\nLightfoot also responded by scolding her opponent for being negative while also airing ads pointing out Preckwinkle\u2019s connection to powerful local Democrats, including one under federal indictment.\nPreckwinkle spent much of her time during the campaign answering for her ties to Chicago\u2019s political establishment. She and her supporters asserted her rise to Democratic Party leadership did not hinder her ability to oppose policies promoted by the city\u2019s ever-powerful mayors.\n\u201cMy whole career has been about change, and change is action and results, not simply words,\u201d said Preckwinkle, who asserts her experience makes her better positioned to lead a city with financial problems and poorer neighborhoods that are racked by gun violence.\nDespite the barbs on the campaign trail, the two advanced similar ideas to boost the city\u2019s deeply troubled finances, which include an estimated $250 million budget deficit next year and billions in unfunded pension liabilities.\nBoth candidates expressed support for a casino in Chicago and changing the state\u2019s income tax system to a graduated tax, in which higher earners are taxed at a higher rate \u2014 two measures lawmakers have tried for unsuccessfully for years to pass.\nLightfoot said that as mayor, she would focus on investing in neighborhoods on the West and South Sides and bring transparency and accountability to City Hall.

{"text": "TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS (45-26-7) at NEW YORK ISLANDERS (46-26-7)\n7 p.m., Monday\nNassau Coliseum, Sportsnet, TSN Radio 1050\nBIG MATCHUP\nNazem Kadri vs. Leo Komarov\nPals when they were teammates with the Maple Leafs, Nazem Kadri and Leo Komarov likely will see plenty of each other on Monday night. Because of injuries to Valtteri Filppula and Tanner Fritz, Komarov has been playing in the middle of the Islanders\u2019 third line. At the least, we would expect Kadri and Komarov to spend much of the evening chirping at each other. Each has the ability to get under the opponents\u2019 skin. Whether they will have that impact on each other could make for a fun subplot.\nFIVE KEYS TO THE GAME\n1. End to Fred\u2019s funk\nNo April fooling \u2014 Frederik Andersen can\u2019t pay mediocre hockey forever, right? The Maple Leafs\u2019 No. 1 goalie will have a few chances this week to get his game in proper order for the playoffs and it has to start on Long Island. Andersen had an .890 save percentage in 11 games in March and allowed 33 even-strength goals; by comparison, in 11 games in November he had a .942 save percentage and allowed 16 even-strength goals. Not having played since Wednesday, there is no reason for Andersen to be anything but sharp.\n2. Rosen\u2019s return\nCalle Rosen has been recalled from the Toronto Marlies and is expected to play in his first NHL game since Oct. 17, 2017, when his initial four-game look with the Leafs ended. Rosen has developed into a fine two-way defenceman in the minors and it\u2019s imperative he performs that way for the Leafs, considering the changes that are coming in the off-season to the Toronto blue line. Rosen\u2019s participation this week likely depends on the health of Jake Gardiner, but a carryover of what Rosen has been doing in the minors would be a needed shot in the arm for the Leafs.\n3. Tavares\u2019 return, Part 2\nJohn Tavares\u2019 first game against the Islanders on Feb. 28 went terribly, as the Leafs couldn\u2019t get past a nasty crowd for No. 91\u2019s return and were clobbered 6-1. While it\u2019s hard to see how the reception can be that vitriolic again, there is bound to be more bitterness flung at Tavares. The Leafs have not been great since that game, going 6-5-3, and they know they\u2019re probably going to get another relentless effort from an Isles club that has clinched a playoff spot. The Leafs need a point to clinch, and you think that would be enough inspiration, but apparently it wasn\u2019t in Ottawa on Saturday.\n4. Matthews\u2019 consistency\nThe Leafs have won just three of their past 10 games but Auston Matthews has been doing his part on offence, scoring seven goals and assisting on five others in that span. It\u2019s without the puck that Matthews, like the majority of his teammates, has to get to a higher level before the playoffs start. A hostile environment in New York will be similar to what the Leafs will experience next week in Boston; Matthews needs to continue to rise to be better than than he was in the playoffs last spring, when he had two points in seven games.\n5. Missing in action\nA couple of Leafs forwards who will be expected to supply some goals in the post-season \u2014 Kasperi Kapanen and Andreas Johnsson \u2014 are backing their way into the Stanley Cup tournament. Kapanen has one goal in his past 18 games, Johnsson one in his past 15. Each brings levels of speed and tenacity, and one would presume that a game against a hard-working group such as the Islanders would help make them playoff-ready.\nMAPLE LEAFS LINES\nLW-C-RW\nZach Hyman-John Tavares-Mitch Marner\nAndreas Johnsson-Auston Matthews-William Nylander\nPatrick Marleau-Nazem Kadri-Kasperi Kapanen\nTyler Ennis-Frederik Gauthier-Connor Brown\nDefence pairs\nMorgan Rielly-Ron Hainsey\nJake Muzzin-Nikita Zaitsev\nCalle Rosen-Travis Dermott\nGoaltenders\nFrederik Andersen\nGarret Sparks\nISLANDERS LINES\nLW-C-RW\nAnders Lee-Mathew Barzel-Jordan Eberle\nJosh Bailey-Brock Nelson-Michael Dal Colle\nAnthony Beauvillier-Leo Komarov-Tom Kuhnhackl\nMatt Martin-Casey Cizikas-Cal Clutterbuck\nDefence pairs\nNick Leddy-Johnny Boychuk\nAdam Pelech-Ryan Pulock\nDevon Toews-Scott Mayfield\nGoaltenders\nRobin Lehner\nThomas Greiss\nINJURIES\nIslanders \u2014 C Valtteri Filppula (upper body), LW Andrew Ladd (knee), C Tanner Fritz (hand).\nMaple Leafs \u2014 D Jake Gardiner (back).\nSPECIAL TEAMS\nPower play\nIslanders: 14.6% (29th)\nMaple Leafs: 22.2% (8th)\nPenalty kill\nIslanders: 79.8% (18th)\nMaple Leafs: 80.7% (15th)\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Democratic Party\u2019s field of presidential contenders might be the largest and most diverse in history, but that new phenomenon hasn\u2019t foreclosed a much older one: white men asking, why shouldn\u2019t I be president, too?\nThe result has been a heavily white, decidedly XY chromosomal surge among those entering or thinking of entering the 2020 primary. After a series of high-profile women and people of color jumped into the contest, almost half a dozen Democrats, all of them white men, have either announced bids of their own or begun inching toward making a run.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) have all visited key early states and are probably on the brink of kicking off their campaigns. The two newest candidates in the race, meanwhile, are white men with modest records in Congress: Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH).\nThese bids have renewed sensitive questions from both observers and rival campaigns about pre-existing power structures and how voters, the media and even Democrats themselves judge issues of electability in the age of the self-identified \u00fcber white male: Donald Trump. Mostly, however, it has left people wondering what it will possibly take to break up the patriarchy that is presidential politics.\n\u201cWe have 250 plus years of history in this country of white guys looking in their mirrors and seeing a future president,\u201d Stephanie Cutter, former deputy campaign manager for President Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe are starting to see a generational shift with more diverse people building the right experience and national support to be president. But, as you can see by the recent coverage of this race, we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\nWith roughly 300 days to go before the primary voting begins, no one is quite certain how Democratic voters will value ideological purity or experience when making their decisions. Less clear is the degree to which diversity itself will come to define the party. In addition to the wave of new entrants into the primary, public opinion polls currently place two septuagenarian white former presidential candidates\u2014former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\u2014in the lead.\nEven the news coverage of the race has drawn criticism for the way it has prioritized and described the men in the race (as this piece may well too, being written, as it is, by two white male journalists). A recent analysis by Northeastern University\u2019s School of Journalism found that the percentage of positive words being used to describe female candidates was lower than for male candidates. Others have also found that a number of male candidates have completely dominated recent news cycles.\nIt is, at times, a more complicated image than critics suggest, since a large share of recent coverage of Biden was centered around testimonials of women feeling uncomfortable in his presence. But it\u2019s been enough to lead some Democrats to wonder whether the lessons of 2018\u2014in which a historic number of women candidates won federal office\u2014have been forgotten in a matter of months.\n\u201cWith the record wins for women and minority candidates, Democrats in 2018 showed they were pretty sick of having white guys in Congress, so I\u2019m not sure what makes these dudes think the White House will be different,\u201d an aide working for a current Democratic campaign told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey\u2019re much more the Rick Santorum model than Barack Obama: run for president to get famous, become known, and stop getting buried in obscurity as a House backbencher. They understand our media environment won\u2019t really punish them for giving it a go, but they will not be the Democratic nominee, and if they were being honest they\u2019d tell you they know that, too.\u201d\nFor those white men actually running, questions of race and gender have proven tricky. Swalwell, a fourth-term congressman from the Bay Area and a familiar presence on cable news, defended his right to jump into the race as he hopped in a car to address a union event on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s identity should keep them from running,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think you better see all the other identities out there.\"\nO\u2019Rourke, meanwhile, has spoken candidly about the privilege afforded to him because of his race and gender. But the fact that he was immediately heralded as a potential 2020 contender even while former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams were left out of the 2020 conversation, has stirred immense frustration among others in the party.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s frankly a travesty that folks have rushed to elevate Beto O\u2019Rourke,\u201d Symone Sanders, who served as national press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) campaign in 2016, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI wanted Beto to beat Ted Cruz just like every other good Democrat, but I don\u2019t think that there was anything inherently special about him that made him better or different than Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum.\u201d\nSanders, who is not working for any campaign currently, was not dismissive of any candidates jumping into the race who believed that they had something to offer voters. She just stressed that they needed to be aware of the challenges for minorities in the field.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the highest level of politics, whether we want to believe it or not, there\u2019s still an asterisk by people of color,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s still an asterisk by women. There\u2019s still an asterisk by people in the LGBTQ community.\u201d\nIn an attempt to thwart criticism that they\u2019re not bringing anything new to the field beyond the stature of the office they hold, some white male hopefuls have already begun to outline specific themes for their candidacies.\nBennet, who recently received a prostate cancer diagnosis, has signalled a run based on bipartisan efforts to fix the health care system. Swalwell is planning to put gun control at the center of his bid and hopes to leverage his age\u2014he\u2019s 38\u2014to brand himself, in his words, as a \u201cgenerational\u201d candidate.\nMoulton, a three-term congressman best known in Washington for his failed attempts to oust Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader, wants to be the national security candidate. \u201cI\u2019m the only person running or considering running who\u2019s even talking about national security,\u201d said Moulton, who is a decorated Iraq War veteran. And Ryan, who represents a blue-collar district in northeast Ohio and is also best known for trying to unseat Pelosi, is explicitly casting himself as the Democrats\u2019 best candidate to win back working-class white voters who fled to Trump.\nThese Democratic longshots don\u2019t believe their identities pose a serious obstacle to getting traction in this historically diverse field. \u201cI don\u2019t think that identity politics should keep anybody in or out of the race,\u201d said Moulton. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how you can best serve the country.\u201d\nAnd, for the most part, their Democratic colleagues believe they\u2019re right to be imbued with a sense of confidence in their mission. After all, the American presidency is fundamentally a story of white men realizing their dreams of grandeur. As one Democratic lawmaker of color put it: \u201cI mean, look at Trump.\u201d\n\u2014 Sam Stein contributed reporting\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Environment Minister Catherine McKenna ordered officials to include marine shipping activity in their review of Roberts Bank Terminal 2\nOTTAWA \u2014 In an echo of the criticisms that stalled the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, opponents of a $2-billion container terminal near Vancouver are calling on the federal government to delay hearings on the project, arguing regulators have failed to account for the environmental effects of increased marine traffic that would result from the development.\nSeveral First Nation communities and one private-sector firm are calling on regulators to delay hearings scheduled to begin May 14 after Environment Minister Catherine McKenna issued a directive last month that ordered officials to include marine shipping activity in their review of Roberts Bank Terminal 2, a roughly $2-billion project planned for construction on a sprawling man-made island off the coast of Vancouver. The proposal is led by the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, and is currently under environmental review by a federal panel.\nThe directive by McKenna could raise concerns that the broader environmental considerations applied to Trans Mountain may also be extended to projects such as sea ports and rail lines, in turn diminishing Canada\u2019s ability to build major infrastructure projects.\nLast August, a Federal Court of Appeal judge halted construction on the Trans Mountain expansion, partly due to a failure by the national energy regulator to include the environmental impacts of marine vessels in its study of the project. The court also ruled that Ottawa had failed in its duty to consult with local Aboriginal communities.\nThe ruling marked a setback for the oil and gas sector, which has failed for many years to build the major pipelines needed to get its product to market. The delays have generated fierce criticism of Ottawa in some Western provinces. Last year, regulatory and legal delays on the Trans Mountain pipeline ultimately compelled Ottawa to purchase the existing assets for around $4.4 billion, effectively nationalizing the project as a way to ensure its completion.\nMeanwhile, the court ruling on Trans Mountain could set a precedent for future projects that involve ocean vessels of any kind. In her March 8 letter, McKenna directed the chair of the panel reviewing Roberts Bank to update the terms of reference around the project to include marine shipping, a decision that came \u201cas a consequence\u201d of the federal court ruling on Trans Mountain, she said.\nBut her directive came just over two months before hearings are scheduled to begin on May 14, leaving some local communities to claim that they were not sufficiently consulted on the updated terms.\nGlobal Container Terminals (GCT), a major terminal operator on the B.C. coast, is also calling on Ottawa to push back the start date for public hearings after the terms of reference were changed.\n\u201cWe think that the process is a little bit flawed,\u201d Doron Grosman, President and CEO of GCT, said in an interview.\nThe company is locked in its own battle with the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, after the regulator struck down GCT\u2019s competing container terminal project, called Deltaport, which is planned to come online around 2028. The port authority acts as both regulator and landlord to GCT on its existing Deltaport terminal, but is also putting forward its own competing terminal project in Roberts Bank \u2014 a position that Grosman calls an \u201cinextricable conflict of interest.\u201d The port authority rejected the GCT bid on Feb. 28.\nGCT then launched a judicial review of the decision on March 28 in federal court, saying regulators should be compelled to consider both proposed projects. Grosman also warns the move could stifle investment from private sector players like GCT, which is backed by three institutional investors, in favour of taxpayer-funded projects.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very surprising, I think it\u2019s unusual,\u201d Grosman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s not in line with the current Canadian administration\u2019s policy in desiring private capital to be invested, and to not be crowded out by the public sector.\u201d\nOfficials with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency did not directly respond to questions about whether Ottawa would delay hearings on Roberts Bank.\nDuncan Wilson, a vice-president at the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, does not expect the directive from McKenna to hurt their chances of building the project. He said the panel has been studying the environmental impacts of marine activity since 2015, and the port authority has consulted with over 40 First Nations communities.\nI think it\u2019s not in line with the current Canadian administration\u2019s policy in desiring private capital to be invested, and to not be crowded out by the public sector\n\u201cFrankly we think [the directive] is a sensible thing to do given the growing interest in the impacts of activities in the Salish Sea,\u201d he said.\nThe port authority also says the Roberts Bank expansion would allow larger vessels to enter the Vancouver port, which would increase capacity without using a greater number of ships.\nWilson said that the Roberts Bank project, which could come online in the late 2020s, is the only project of the two that could be built in time to meet growing demand \u2014 a claim GCT disputes.\nMeanwhile, several Aboriginal communities oppose Roberts Bank.\nIn a letter to the panel on March 28, lawyers representing the T\u2019Sou-ke Nation said the review body lacks sufficient evidence to properly study the project. The lawyers wrote that the \u201cproposed inclusion of Project-related marine shipping is more than a mere formality,\u201d and said that it reinforced calls the community had made for years: \u201cthat the Panel has no information before it on T\u2019Sou-ke\u2019s marine traditional uses that may be impacted by the Project.\u201d\nIn its own submission to the panel, the Tsawwassen First Nation, who claimed to be the community most directly impacted by the Robert Banks project, said the proponent \u201chas not provided sufficient information for the purposes of proceeding to a public hearing.\u201d\nThe Musqueam Indian Band, for its part, criticized the panel in a February submission for not properly accounting for the cumulative effects the project could have on juvenile salmon habitats.\nThe Roberts Bank Terminal 2 project is expected to cost \u201cmore than\u201d $2 billion according to estimates by the port authority, but the group did not provide a more detailed cost range. However, a 2016 briefing note from Transport Canada suggests the authority has asked for a $2.8-billion borrowing limit to cover the costs of the project, which includes $700 million in the event that the scope of the terminal is broadened.\nEither Roberts Bank Terminal 2 or the Deltaport project would go a long way in meeting demand to move cargo from the B.C. coast in coming years. The port currently accepts around five million shipping containers of cargo every year, which could almost double by the year 2035, according to estimates by the port authority.\nIn February, the National Energy Board submitted its report to Ottawa on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and how it would effect local marine life. Environmentalists have for years warned that increased marine traffic in the region, whether carrying oil or household goods, could further diminish local killer whale populations.\n\u2022 Email: jsnyder@postmedia.com | Twitter: jesse_snyder\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "newsletters, editors-pick-list,\nWomen are being forced to make up to 150 applications to get an apprenticeship despite a skills shortage in the automotive trades industry. Research from the University of Sydney business school has found that it is common for women to submit 80 to 150 applications over a six-to-eight-month period. Many of the women interviewed said they believed this was because of their gender. Louise Azzopardi, who trains apprentices in heavy vehicle and plant mechanics in Newcastle, said she knows women who have put in more than 60 applications to get an apprenticeship. After getting an apprenticeship in 2012, she was \"on the tools\" repairing truck engines and farm equipment for more than six years. She then started mentoring other apprentices before taking on a full-time teaching role. The federal government last year reported labour shortages in the automotive trades for the fourth consecutive year. Dr Sarah Oxenbridge, lead author for the University of Sydney research,'One of the boys?' The work and career experiences of Australian women working in the automotive trades occupations', said women who are making more than 100 applications are determined to get into the industry. Many had topped their TAFE classes and had won skills competitions including 'apprentice of the year'. \"They just had to work doubly hard to be seen to be deserving of their role,\" she said. Study co-author Professor Rae Cooper said a rejection of women in automotive trades was a symptom of a \"hypermasculine culture\" which was alienating some men as well as women. She said the skills shortage meant highly skilled women should not be having difficulty getting a job. \"There is something going wrong,\" she said. \"It is a pointy issue for women, but it is affecting the whole industry. Employers are crying out for skilled labour, women are really interested in interesting careers in the sector, so this mismatch is a problem for productivity in the sector and needs some keen attention.\" The study included an online survey of 119 female employees, 12 face-to-face interviews and 20 telephone interviews. The survey found only half of all respondents described their workplaces as environments where \"men and women were treated equally\". Almost one in four women in automotive occupations (24 per cent) said they had directly experienced sexual harassment, and 43 per cent stated they had been subjected to some form of offensive language or offensive behaviour in their job because of their gender. Ms Azzopardi said she has experienced only one or two male co-workers among many who have treated her like she did not belong. \"One guy at a workshop came up to me and looked me dead in the eye and said I shouldn't be there - that he wouldn't let his wife do it or his daughter do it,\" she said. \"Some people are still old-fashioned and think that way.\" Many customers have also been surprised to find her emerge from underneath a heavy vehicle she has been repairing. \"They would see my feet hanging out from under truck and start talking to me and reply. And they'd be like, 'oh, you're a girl',\" she said. Sharon Pask, the chief financial officer at Frankston Toyota in Melbourne said it has set a goal to become \"gender neutral\" by 2020. This will mean 40 per cent of the workforce will comprise either gender. She said 36 per cent of its workforce was made up of women and this had been achieved through blind recruitment, a computer-generated process which filters prospective resumes based on their skill-set. \"I want the automotive industry to come into the 21st century,\" she said \"We have actively gone out and sought women for roles by making sure that our language and advertisements are gender neutral. It has been a game-changer for us.\" Ms Pask said that while 10 per cent of all sales staff in Toyota dealerships across Victoria were females, women now outnumbered male sales staff at her dealership in response to 47 per cent of new car buyers being women. \"We have seen a growth in our bottom line,\" she said.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/HLS8hELXYzzpgPAWF8Wni5/ef76b44d-d68e-43e8-9d2e-c16e2637411b.jpg/r111_296_4483_2766_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "human"}

At Edmonton\u2019s Polish Hall on Sunday afternoon, Notley gave one of the final speeches of her campaign to a crowd of about 1,000 people.\nNotley waited outside the doors, her security standing by, while the crowd was warmed up \u2014 literally, given the sweaty hall \u2014 taking a selfie, waving at children and chatting with staff.\nAfter wading through a crowd of supporters toting orange New Democrat signs, to the sounds of Serena Ryder\u2019s Circle of the Sun, Notley gave a rousing speech \u2014 her voice sounding slightly hoarse, preaching to the converted and imploring conservative apostates to join her party.\nThen, it was off to Calgary for a Monday morning event and back again to Edmonton for an afternoon appearance.\nWhile polls have suggested, for a long time, that Notley\u2019s New Democrats will be in trouble Tuesday, the campaign has remained thoroughly upbeat.\nNo doubt, some of it\u2019s putting on a brave face \u2014 nobody\u2019s going to vote for a party that morosely admits it\u2019s going to lose \u2014 but Notley has insisted there\u2019s a path to majority for the NDP.\n\u201cWe have a path to victory, we know the areas that we can win and we know that there are enough of them that we could still win a majority government,\u201d she said in a Friday interview in Canmore.\nAnd, if they don\u2019t win, the feeling is that they will be on track for a strong opposition. These are the low moments \u2014 when staff wonder which side of the aisle they\u2019re going to be on after Tuesday.\nThe question, then, is whether or not Notley remains at the helm of the party. \u201cThat\u2019s too far, hypothetically, down the road,\u201d Notley said Friday. She swears, though, that she\u2019ll be in the legislature, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s as premier.\nThe Kenney campaign kicked off Monday morning in Sherwood Park, a suburb east of Edmonton, then headed to the city\u2019s south end for a pizza lunch with campaign volunteers. Kenney stuck around in the south end for some door-knocking after lunch, all in ridings that the campaign sees as winnable despite the iron grip Notley\u2019s NDP asserted on the city in the 2015 election.\nWith the NDP pulling support from the province\u2019s public service unions, the capital city has been one of the few strongholds left for the NDP, as its support erodes amid a sputtering economy.\nAlthough Kenney says his party is \u201cvery much focused on the private sector,\u201d if the UCP forms government he hopes to empower Edmonton\u2019s healthy contingent of public servants \u201cand listen to them about how to better provide services.\u201d\n\u201cAt the same time, the majority of people who live in Edmonton are tied to the private sector economy,\u201d said Kenney, in an interview with the Post. \u201cSo my pitch to the city is it\u2019s a great, industrious city deeply connected to our resource industries. And we\u2019ve got some great Edmonton candidates. Let\u2019s ensure that Edmonton is a strong voice in a future government.\u201d\nHow much all the door-knocking and beating the bushes for votes will matter is also hard to predict, with nearly 700,000 advance ballots already cast. That means about 25 per cent of the province\u2019s electorate has already visited a polling station before election day.\nFor the first time Albertans were allowed to vote from outside their electoral district in advance voting, with more than 200,000 voters taking advantage of that. Those ballots may not be fully counted until the weekend.\nBoth major parties have claimed the high turnout is a positive sign for their campaigns, with Kenney telling the media in Sherwood Park on Monday that pockets of high turnout match-up with areas of conservative enthusiasm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense that when there\u2019s high turnout, that is a vote for change,\u201d said Kenney.\n\u2022 Email: sxthomson@postmedia.com | Twitter: stuartxthomson\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The men\u2019s Final Four is set, with No. 5 seed Auburn and No. 2 seed Michigan State winning Sunday to join No. 3 seed Texas Tech and No. 1 seed Virginia next weekend in Minneapolis. Here are six takeaways to get you ready for the final three games of the season.\n\u2014 There will be vastly different levels of Final Four pedigree in Minneapolis. Virginia has played in the Final Four twice, in 1981 and 1984. Texas Tech and Auburn haven\u2019t been there before, and none of the coaches from those three schools has been to the national semifinal round before. Meanwhile, Michigan State will be playing in its 10th Final Four in school history.\n\u2014 The lack of upsets in the early rounds of this year\u2019s tournament might have made for a sleepy first weekend, but that was long forgotten after a fabulous, heart-stopping Elite Eight. There were 12 lead changes in Texas Tech\u2019s win over Gonzaga, in which neither team led by more than six until the final minute. Virginia was on the ropes in the final seconds against Purdue, until a missed free throw led to a game-tying Mamadi Diakite jumper and overtime. Auburn trailed by double digits in the first half against Kentucky on Sunday, but it was able to force overtime before getting a win.\n\u2013 Does defense win championships? This weekend will provide the latest referendum. Through March 24, Virginia and Texas Tech ranked first and third in the country in scoring defense, respectively. Texas Tech, Michigan State and Virginia are all in the top five nationally in field-goal-percentage defense.

From ESPN\u2019s latest list of the top 20 NBA draft prospects, two will participate in the Final Four: Virginia\u2019s DeAndre Hunter (5) and Texas Tech\u2019s Jarrett Culver (6).\n\u2014 Auburn\u2019s free-wheeling style stood out all season, and it should again this week. The high- in the country in 3-pointers per game and have already made 49 in their first four NCAA Tournament games. None of the other Final Four teams rank in the top 100 in that category; Texas Tech is 232nd.\n\u2013 Missing the Madness? It shouldn\u2019t be all that unexpected that the final four teams standing are top-ranking seeds. Since 1985, a No. 1 seed has reached the national championship game 32 times. In that span, only U-Conn. as a No. 7 seed has won a national title as lower than a four-seed, while top seeds have won 21 times, two-seeds five times and three-seeds four times.\nSchedule and TV information\nAll times are in Mountain Daylight Time.

Sure he has weird bird powers that allow him to know everyone's secrets, but you know what else that makes him? An absolute creep.\nIn the pilot of the series, way back in 2011, you may remember Jaime Lannister pushing Bran out of a tower window and causing him to be in the wheelchair he is today. Well, Sunday's episode brought the reunion of Bran and Jaime which created the most interesting plot point in Bran's story line in several years.\nTwitter was sure to point out this is the only interesting moment Bran has had in 8 seasons.

He has never had time for you. He will never have it either. Stop FAKE NEWS Sir,\" Philip Etale, ODM director of communications, tweeted during the interview.\n\"The truth of the matter is; it is the president who looked for @RailaOdinga for a meeting that culminated into the handshake. Raila never ever sought to meet Ruto. He has never planned to do that and he will never do.\"\nThe DP revealed that his scepticism in engaging the former premier stemmed from the fact that he did not believe Mr Odinga\u2019s advances were in \u201cgood faith\u201d.\nHe pointed out the aftermath of a merger between Kanu and Mr Odinga\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and the quick fallout between President Mwai Kibaki and the ODM leader in Narc government as some of the lessons that fuelled his scepticism.\n\u201cWe spoke on phone and it was after the president had appointed the first six Cabinet secretaries. He (Mr Odinga) made suggestions of me being short-changed and so I did not engage him further,\" he said.\n\"I told him the president is the head of the party and we were not running a coalition.\"\nMr Ruto said his reservations have been vindicated, pointing out an instance where ODM deputy party leader Ali Hassan Joho, in a rally in Busia, said that they must fight the deputy president.\nHe also cited Siaya Senator James Orengo\u2019s talk of a 2022 deal between Mr Odinga and Mr Kenyatta.\nDr Ruto added that Mr Orengo was being used by former Jubilee Party vice chairman David Murathe to sponsor a censure motion against him.\nCONSULTATIONS\nThe former Eldoret North MP laughed off claims that he was kept in the dark about the \u2018handshake\u2019, saying it was not necessary for President Kenyatta to inform him about the discussion as he already knew of Mr Odinga\u2019s plans.\n\u201cThat is the reality of what happened. So when I see people standing on podiums saying things then I do not know how dishonest people can be,\u201d he said.\nAsked on why Mr Kenyatta went ahead to broker the deal with Mr Odinga despite his misgivings, Mr Ruto said he believes the president consulted widely before making the decision to work with his arch-rival in the 2013 and 2017 elections.\n\u201cWe consult on a daily basis with the president but you we are all different and the president has more latitude, powers and I believe he consulted beyond me before the handshake,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement\nThe DP observed that he is in support of the handshake despite what is being peddled around that he is against it.\nThe handshake, he said, was meant to foster unity across the country and he believes has been achieved so far.\n\u201cYes I can say that it is working to an extent. There are currently no demonstrations, no people quarrelling in the streets and businesses are running without problems,\u201d he said.\nOn his differences with Mr Odinga, the former ODM Pentagon member said there are no irreconcilable differences and that they can work together.\n2022 TICKET\nHowever, he warned the ODM party leader that he will not hesitate to stop him \u201cwhen he comes to a party which I am the deputy party leader\u201d.\nOn chances of being declared \u2018Ruto Tosha\u2019 by Mr Kenyatta, the Jubilee Party presidential hopeful said the president will make his choice when the time comes.\nThe Jubilee Party constitution, he added, clearly states how a presidential candidate is chosen and there is nowhere they agreed with Mr Kenyatta that he will be the flagbearer.\nHe said President Kenyatta will not impose him on Jubilee members and will have to work hard to convince others to support his candidature.\n\u201cI will not in public want to tell my boss what to do. What I know is that the party headed by Kenyatta will have a presidential candidate in 2022 and that person is not necessarily me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI will present my papers same as others and will support whoever the party will have chosen.\u201d\nThe DP stated that Jubilee is intact and scoffed at those behind the \u2018Stop Ruto movement\u2019, calling them former ODM original members, sympathisers and Jubilee party rejects.\nODM LOSSES\n\u201cODM has managed to persuade sympathisers but 95 percent of Jubilee is intact,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese were people who wanted to rig elections but we believe in fairness and every member will be treated so.\"\nHe said Mr Murathe was nowhere during the formation of Jubilee Party and his departure was as a result of not being able to stomach what the DP said.\nThe former vice chairman \u201cbit more than he could chew\u201d, Dr Ruto said.\nConcerning the recent humbling of ODM in both Embakasi South and Ugenya Constituency by-elections, the DP said he did not support any candidate but his tweet was a tribute to the winners.\n", "label": "human"}

(Photo: File)\nBengaluru: Relying on his astrological calculations, Karnataka minister and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda's son H D Revanna Thursday said he would quit politics if Prime Minister Narendra Modi comes to power again.\nThe PWD minister said UPA would come to power because elections in Karnataka were taking place on April 18, which, he claimed, numerologically suits the UPA.\n\"Modi has cheated the state and the nation. What is Modi's contribution to the nation,\" he asked\n\"Note it down in the diary what I say today because I will come back to you again - If Modi comes back in the country I will quit politics,\" Revanna told reporters in Mysuru.\nThe minister, who often makes news for his superstitious beliefs and has a strong belief in astrology, gave out some figures.\nWhen journalists sought to know the implications of elections in Karnataka on April 18, Revanna said, \"You don't know about 18\".\nLast time the elections (in Karnataka) took place in 2018 - 18 means one plus eight, which is nine. Because of this combination Kumaraswamy (his younger brother) became chief minister.\nAgain this time there is a combination of 18, whose sum is nine. The UPA will come to power once again in the country.\"\nAsked what was in the store with regard to another election date of April 23 for Karnataka, Revanna said that is a separate issue.\nThe minister was in the news recently for holding at least seven to eight lemons in the hand at Hassan at a public function to address Congress workers.\nHis son Prajwal Revanna is contesting from Hassan on JD(S) ticket, a seat vacated by the JD(S) supremo Deve Gowda for the entry of his grandson into politics. Gowda himself opted to contest election from Tumakuru at the ripe age of 87.\nDeve Gowda's second grandson and chief minister Kumaraswamy's son Nikhil Kumaraswamy is also contesting the Lok Sabha election from Mandya. The Hassan event saw rebellion by Congress workers who said they will not support or work in favour of Prajwal.\nAsked why he carried so many lemons in Hassan, Revanna jokingly said, \"They are all thieves. They need to be terrorised. It is necessary to keep a few lemons.\" To the question whether lemons are so effective, Revanna said, \"If it wasn't effective, why one would keep it?\"\nHe even suggested that the BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa and former deputy chief minister in the BJP government in Karnataka R Ashok should also carry lemons to withstand any black magic.\n", "label": "human"}

I am very frightened for the safety of, not only my child, but the entire school.\u201d\nOne of the students who threatened posted a message on Snapchat that reads, in part: \u201c(The student who made the list) threatened to kill me and everyone at KMS. He told me that he wanted to be a serial killer and kill me first. He always told me that he didn\u2019t like me and that he was going to kill me one day.\u201d\nParents were equally upset by he lack of communication from the Kearney School District regarding the threat. Most parents only found out after the police announced the investigation on social media.\n\u201cFinding out on social media \u2014 on Friday on social media \u2014 was just shocking,\u201d said Rhonda Holland, who has a seventh-grader at KMS. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t there a statement by the Kearney School District saying that they had the matter brought to their attention and they were investigating it?\u201d\nThe district finally sent out a statement to parents Saturday, acknowledging the threat and explaining the timeline.\nAccording to the letter from Kearney Middle School Principal Bart Woods, a student notified the school counselor about another student\u2019s \u201chit list/kill list\u201d and additional prior threatening statements, which had gone unreported.\nWoods said the school launched an immediate investigation, reported the threats to local police, and required the student who made the threat to complete a mental health assessment.\nThe district also tweaked its policy and put \u201ca safety plan has been put in place to monitor the initial threats as we move forward from this incident,\u201d Wood said,\nAccording to the letter, the KMS administration was in contact with the parents of all the students involved throughout the process.\n\u201cWe have also made contact with all others who expressed concerns to us,\u201d Woods said in the letter.\nHe indicated that it hasn\u2019t been school policy to send information regarding verbal threats to all parents, but it was making an exception \u201cdue to concerns being expressed on social media\u201d and in an effort to \u201celiminate any confusion and misinformation.\u201d\nWoods said he believes Kearney Middle School is a safe environment, expressed appreciation for the students who came forward about the threats and encouraged parents to reach out with any concerns.\n\u201cStudent/school safety is extremely important to us and is something we talk about with our students,\u201d Woods said.\nGiven the number of high-profile incidents nationwide involving violence in schools, it\u2019s little wonder some parents are on edge when such threats impact their communities.\n\u201cWe send these kids to school, and we believe it\u2019s a safe place,\u201d Holland said. \u201cYou have something like this happen, and it\u2019s just hard.\u201d\nKearney police provided an update of the investigation Saturday afternoon.\n\u201cToday we have conducted investigations and interviews,\u201d a post on the department\u2019s Facebook page said. \u201cWe believe that we have a much better understanding of this alleged incident.

Will Britain, France and other NATO countries join a US \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to rape and destroy Venezuela?\nIt\u2019s the strategy used in the 1990s rape of Yugoslavia and in all post-9/11 wars of aggression against nations threatening no one.\nIn my view, it\u2019s highly unlikely. The world community opposes it, notably EU, Latin, and Central American nations.\nThat said, the Trump regime pulled all its staff from Venezuela. A State Department alert advised US citizens in the country to leave.\nOn Friday, an unnamed Trump administration official said military intervention \u201cis seriously (being) considered as events unfold\u201d \u2013 because everything else tried so far failed, adding:\nUS tactics \u201ccontinue to diminish due to Maduro\u2019s recent actions.

What hasn\u2019t worked so far won\u2019t likely ahead.\nConvicted felon Elliott Abrams was appointed point man for regime change in Venezuela.\nDirty Central American wars he orchestrated in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala were responsible for over 300,000 deaths, countless thousands more brutally tortured, and forced into exile.\nIn June 1986, an International Tribunal on Genocide in Central America called the period a time of intense violence \u2013 made in the USA by Abrams and his co-conspirators, saying:\nThings \u201cverg(ed) on a near total break-down of the state institutions and open warfare between state governments, competing rebel forces challenging state authorities and indigenous\u201d peoples. \u201cIn the course of resurgent violence, acts of genocide and ethnocide (were) committed against indigenous groups.\u201d\nAccusations \u201cof state sponsored and rebel force sponsored genocide against indigenous peoples (were) repeatedly made throughout the course of\u201d the decade, including massacres, torture, forced military service, land seizures, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, population relocations, and attacks amounting to genocide under the UN Convention.\n\u201cThat there is sufficient evidence to warrant the convening of a (genocide) tribunal goes without question.\u201d Perhaps Abrams intends an encore of the above atrocities in Venezuela.\nIs he plotting something similar in Venezuela, together with other Trump regime co-conspirators?\nAlong with more illegal sanctions, proxy and cyberwar war are most likely, the former with armed paramilitary thugs for involvement in violence creating chaos, the latter by attacks on Venezuelan infrastructure.\nDirect military intervention would be high-risk, neighboring countries Colombia and Brazil especially hostile to the idea, concerned about possible millions of Venezuelans fleeing cross-border for safety.\nRussia appears committed to help preserve and protect Venezuelan sovereignty. If US forces attack the Bolivarian Republic, will Putin intervene against Trump regime aggression similar to how he acted in Syria?\nWill the US risk possible East/West confrontation over Venezuela?\nIn a same day article, I suggested Guaido\u2019s arrest, detention, and prosecution for high crimes against the state is likely coming, adding:\nMost likely what will follow is escalated US sanctions war, along with more Trump regime threats and establishment media rage. All of the above are coming anyway whether Guaido remains free or detained, awaiting trial \u2013 direct US military intervention highly unlikely despite regime threats otherwise.\nVenezuela has a choice \u2013 going all out to preserve and protect its hemisphere\u2019s best social democracy and sovereign independence or become a US vassal state, the country transformed into a fascist police state, its people terrorized into submission.\nThe choice is simple. Fundamental freedoms are too important to lose. They\u2019re worth fighting for, no matter the risks.\nLosing them to an imperial power means all hope is lost \u2013 which is no choice at all.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

It cut its final dividend to only 1 pence per share from 6 pence last year.\nTo help revive its insurance business, Saga plans to offer home and motor policies with three-year fixed pricing and also cut prices for renewals.\nBookings at the company\u2019s tour operations for the coming year were 3.4 percent lower than a year ago, Saga said, blaming uncertainty around Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nThis is a change of tone for Saga, whose travel business has been propped up by spending by affluent pensioners, protecting it from a hit to consumer spending power since Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016.\nCustomers had begun to get nervous about booking European holidays by the end of last year, with the trend becoming severe this year, Chief Executive Officer Lance Batchelor told Reuters. Bookings for European holidays were about 8 percent lower.\n\u201cBrexit is a factor and its dragging our holidays business down,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf a solution is reached in the next few weeks then we would hope to see some uplift, although the peak holiday booking season is the spring, and the spring is rapidly passing.\u201d\nWhile customers were still booking holidays to other destinations, Europe accounts for more than half of Saga\u2019s tour operations.\nPROFIT WARNING\nSaga\u2019s shares were 30 percent lower at 74.6 pence, taking them to the bottom of London\u2019s FTSE midcap index, dragging down rival\u2019s shares.\nBudget airline EasyJet also warned this week that European travellers were holding off booking their summer holidays as they wait to see how Brexit will play out.\nInsurance prices have also been pressured by competition in the sector where companies such as Admiral, RSA Insurance, Direct Line and Hastings operate, forcing insurers to sacrifice gains on margins.\nThe company warned that it expected underlying profit before tax for the 2019-20 year to be between 105 million pounds to 120 million pounds, down from 180 million pounds for the previous year ended in January.\nSaga reported a goodwill impairment of 310 million pounds related to its insurance business, meaning a loss before tax of 134.6 million pounds for 2018.\nThe restructuring \u201cmight all be too little too late\u201d, according to Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett, who said Saga will need to work hard to win over older drivers.\n($1 = 0.7605 pounds)\n", "label": "human"}

And Georgia-Pacific said the prolonged closure of Coos Bay\u2019s swing span railroad bridge made it more difficult to ship products from the site.\nThe 100-year-old bridge has been closed for more than a year and plans to reopen the structure have been repeatedly delayed. Kimble said 70 percent of mill\u2019s products went by rail and the bridge closure was adding significantly to operating costs.\n\u201cThat makes a big difference when you have to truck it over to an offload facility and then put it back on rail,\u201d he said.\nWhile there are other railways serving the community, economic development officials said the bridge\u2019s closure was affecting shippers throughout the community and neighboring counties.\nJohn Burns is chief executive of the Port of Coos Bay, which owns the bridge and has overseen the repairs. He said the port has spent $3.5 million so far to get the bridge back in operation and expects to have it back open within the next two weeks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unfortunate that they couldn\u2019t wait for that,\u201d Burns said. He said the port expects to spend another $9 million over the next year on upgrades to ensure the bridge remains operational.\nGeorgia-Pacific\u2019s Coos Bay facility opened in 1994. It produces dimensional lumber -- 2x4s, 2x6s and similar products.\nGeorgia-Pacific\u2019s western lumber general manager, Bill Goodman, wrote to state officials Thursday to notify them of the pending layoffs. He said the job cuts will begin June 10 and continue in phases until the Coos Bay facility is completely closed. He said employees, most of whom are union members, \u201cwill be paid all earned wages and agreed upon benefits.\u201d\nWhile Oregon is enjoying historically low unemployment of 4.4%, some industries and regions are still working to recover from the Great Recession.\nFor example, Coos County\u2019s nonfarm employment remains 4% below levels before the start of the recession, and manufacturing is 110 jobs below its peak, according to a recent analysis from the Oregon Employment Department.\nWood products manufacturing in Coos Bay is 100 jobs above its pre-recession levels. The pending Georgia-Pacific layoffs could reverse that, but Burns said he\u2019s optimistic another employer will move onto the mill site \u2013 though he said he doesn\u2019t know who.\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019m hearing,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are other suitors that are interested in taking over that facility.\n-- Mike Rogoway | twitter: @rogoway | 503-294-7699\n", "label": "human"}

He said he regrets how he framed his remarks.\n\u201cOf course I do not believe that homosexuality is akin to pedophilia. I unequivocally apologize if anyone was offended or hurt,\u201d he said.\nAlso in a Tuesday statement, Kenney said Smith made the comments before he was an MLA, and he has not, to Kenney\u2019s knowledge, made similarly offensive comments.\n\u201cI personally find his comments from 2013 offensive, and Mr. Smith has rightly apologized,\u201d Kenney said.\nSarah Hoffman, NDP candidate for Edmonton Glenora, called on Kenney to fire Smith as a candidate, saying his comments were \u201coffensive, homophobic and completely neglect women\u2019s rights.\u201d\nFiring LGBTQ teachers\nPostmedia also obtained a document, dated Sept. 30, 2015, authored by Smith, entitled, \u201cShould Christian public schools be able to fire a homosexual teacher that claims to be homosexual?\u201d\nA source said Smith wrote it and distributed it to Wildrose caucus and staff.\nIn the document, Smith, who is not a lawyer, argued the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives independent and Catholic schools the right to dismiss employees on religious and moral grounds.\n\u201cDoes the right to equality before the law have limits? Yes, it would appear that at least one reasonable limit upheld by the Constitution is the right to hire and fire for denominational cause,\u201d Smith wrote.\nIn late 2018, several Catholic teachers came forward saying they had been fired, or lived in fear of being fired, for having same-sex relationships or living with a partner out of wedlock, which potentially violated religious agreements they signed when they took their school district jobs.\nUCP spokesman Harrison Fleming said it appears Smith wrote the document before he was elected, because he refers to himself as a \u201cWildrose candidate.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s views do not reflect the party\u2019s position, he said.\n\u201cWe believe that when issues of competing constitutional rights arise, they are better resolved by the judiciary than by politicians,\u201d Fleming said.\nUCP candidate promoted anti-Muslim book\nAnother UCP MLA hopeful is under fire after the NDP accused him of promoting \u201cextreme materials\u201d in a sermon and publishing anti-gay content in a church newsletter.\nIn a 2012 sermon posted online, UCP Livingstone-Macleod candidate Roger Reid calls a book by evangelical Christian Charles Colson \u201cone of his favourite books.\u201d\nHe said the book \u2014 released first in 1994 under the title The Body and again in 2003 under the title Being the Body \u2014 tells the story of the \u201cpersecuted Church.\u201d\nIn a news release Tuesday, the NDP called the book anti-Muslim. The 2003 version, which has a preview available online, called Islam \u201cintrinsically a militant religion, which, if true to its own doctrine, expands by force.\u201d\nReid said he was referencing the original version in his sermon.\nThe NDP also took issue with a 2003 First Alliance Church newsletter published when Reid was director of communications. It contained a book review of The Homosexual Agenda, which argues LGBTQ activists are trying to trump the rights of others, especially religious people.\n\u201cThe authors provide well-documented proof that America is not only becoming more tolerant of homosexual behaviour, it is becoming less tolerant of those who disagree with the lifestyle,\u201d said the review.\nReid said his views have since evolved.\n\u201cAlbertans are tired of revisiting old, divisive debates from many years prior,\u201d Reid said in a Tuesday statement.\nYellow vest fan\nKenney also said Tuesday a candidate who shared an anti-United Nations meme on Facebook holds a legitimate perspective.\nAnti-conservative website PressProgress posted an article Sunday about a \u201cYellow Vest Canada\u201d Facebook post shared by UCP Lac Ste. Anne-Parkland candidate Shane Getson in December.\nThe meme shows an image of the UN flag with the message, \u201cI do not recognize this flag as my country\u2019s flag and I do not support the United Nations Compact Agreement. Sharing this FB post shows my \u2018social media\u2019 vote against Canada supporting the UN and their dangerous agendas (sic).\u201d\nGetson shared the meme, titled \u201cmessage to Trudeau,\u201d saying that he and his wife read the compact and it scared him.\nYellow vesters have held protests in Edmonton, demonstrating against the UN\u2019s Global Compact for Migration. The deal aims to improve cooperation on international migration. It\u2019s not legally binding, allowing its 193 signatory countries, including Canada, to control their own immigration rules.\nThe agreement is an effort to prevent suffering and chaos, said the UN.\nKenney said the UN pact is a federal issue, so it\u2019s not on the radar of the UCP.\n\u201cA third of the member states of the European Union, Australia, the U.S. are opposed to the UN migration pact, so I think that\u2019s a legitimate perspective to hold,\u201d he said of Getson\u2019s decision to share the meme.\nRecently, two UCP candidates quit the race after past comments were dredged up.

{"text": "Officials from South Texas, including the Rio Grande Valley, recently met with their counterparts from northern Mexico to pledge mutual cooperation in improving the economy on both sides of the border.\nThis agreement and the cooperation it represents are the perfect response to current talk about building border walls and closing down ports of entry.\nEconomic development representatives from Brownsville to Laredo on the north side of the border \u2014 and from Matamoros to Nuevo Laredo, as well as Tamaulipas\u2019 capital of Ciudad Victoria on the south \u2014 met in Weslaco last month to sign the binational collaboration agreement. In the deal, officials agree to join forces to recruit business investment in the various cities along the Rio Grande.\nThe move is partly a response to recent actions by the U.S. and Mexican presidents that have affected the maquiladora industry that has benefited the border region for decades. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed high tariffs and threatened border closures, while Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador imposed wage changes that have led to labor unrest and walkouts at the cross-border industrial plants. In reaction to the changes, several maquilas are looking to abandon the cross-border structure and set up shop exclusively in one country. Through the agreement, local officials will work to keep those businesses on the border rather than see them move to the interior of either country and take hundreds of jobs with them.\n\u201cMatamoros is saying, \u2018Man, I\u2019m going to lose five maquilas. It\u2019s better to lose them to Brownsville than see them go back to Ohio\u2019,\u201d Mario Lozoya, executive director of the Greater Brownsville Incentives Corp., explained to Brownsville Herald reporter Steve Clark. \u201cThere are lots of employees who live here and drive daily to Matamoros; it\u2019s the same with McAllen and Reynosa and the whole border.\u201d\nLozoya and other officials believe the new regional approach, and the combined resources of all the border interests, add new strength to border economic development strategies.\nIt\u2019s a modern approach for our modern economic times.\nAt the national level, today\u2019s global economy relies more on cooperation than on competition. Tariffs and other artificial efforts to handicap other countries are outdated in a world that generally understands that working together benefits both sides much more than working against each other.\nThat is the rationale behind the maquila system that has strengthened our border economy for more than a half century. Manufacturing and assembly plants on either side of the border work together, utilizing the resources and talents found on both sides, to produce products better and more efficiently.\nNo country can stand alone in today\u2019s economy, in which parts and products must move freely across borders for any company, and any country, to succeed. This border agreement recognizes that reality; we can only hope that our policy makers will recognize it as well.\n", "label": "human"}

The review is useful for what it is worth but I feel compelled to question why ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru had to set up the team in the first instance.\nThe reason is self-evident: whatever is referred to as government communication is a web of confusion, contradictions and often, misinformation. The government communication network is a dysfunctional multi-layered bureaucracy in part hobbled by under-resourcing, but repeatedly caught in twists of embarrassing mischief; the result of an administrative system too inter-woven with politics.\nLEGACY ITEMS\nAfter defining a four-point agenda on which he is staking his legacy as Kenya\u2019s fourth President, Mr Kenyatta hardly has time nowadays to articulate progress in this humongous ambition. The Presidency's attention is split right down the middle with Mr Kenyatta ostensibly focusing on fighting corruption while his Deputy William Ruto is laser-focused on being the fifth president.\nThe state of play has compelled the President to create another structure led by his most effective Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang\u2019i to supervise the implementation of government projects generally, and specifically the four agenda legacy items. But even as Dr Matiang\u2019i rolls up his sleeves, education is in a mess, health is ailing, hunger is killing Kenyans, the environment is on its knees, the national debt threatens to balloon out of control, unemployment continues to drive youth crazy. Betting and graft have taken over as the opt-in favourites to success!\nThis is the mess being communicated mainly by mainstream media because it is generally what is reflected in the mirror of government performance.\nDEBT BURDEN\nBut the government has its own machinery: Presidency Spokesperson, the Directorate of Strategic Communications, the Deputy President\u2019s communications unit, the Official Government Spokesperson. There may be a communication adviser to the President. In the ministry is the moribund Kenya News Agency with information officers in each county, the anaemic Kenya Broadcasting Corporation and the Kenya Yearbook. Each ministry has information officers.\nWhich story are all these megaphones, platforms and experts trying to tell? That the President did not refer to a \u201cclosest political aide\u201d as he fulminated against corruption while touring Namibia last month? Or that no Kenyan has died of hunger while graves are fresh in Turkana and Baringo? Or that Sh7bn and not Sh21bn may have been lost in some dams we can\u2019t find in Kerio Valley?\nOr that the last mile electricity project was a great success despite most homes now being unable to pay to enjoy light and Kenya Power tottering on the brink of collapse because of the debt burden? Or that promised stadiums are here and that Chinese debt is wholesome?\nMALFEASANCE\nThese fibs can be verbalised but will not be believed because of the basic fact that however sophisticated the machinery set up to articulate a lie, it will remain a lie. Believability is in the execution, the doing, and the results.\nThe government must stop trying to sugar-coat a narrative riddled with oodles of incompetence and malfeasance and just deliver on its numerous promises to wananchi. Out of this will flow the positive narrative about a people busy creating wealth, a country exporting food, an education system thriving on research and registration of patents, a policing system that is a service rather than a force, etc. This narrative is not contrived by press statements and layers of busy-body bureaucrats.

On April 4th, the British designer won an appeal to trademark the term \u201cFur-Free Fur,\u201d a phrase used on the tags of her imitation styles, which are made from acrylic, polyester, wool, or mohair.\nPETA\u2019s senior vice president Dan Mathews, who met with Speaker Johnson to discuss the fur ban, told The Daily Beast that the animal rights organization will hold training in New York later this month to teach members how to lobby their council members.\nPETA representatives will also take leghold traps to City Hall to show council members \u201cthe real violence that animals endure in the fur industry.\u201d\n\u201c This is New York, one of the cradles of civilization, and there is nothing civilized about electrocuting and skinning animals just for a frivolous fashion item that has already fallen from favor. \u201d\nThough New York has long been known for its mink-clad socialites (many of whom still proudly parade their Dennis Basso coats around the Upper East Side), Mathews believes it is time the East Coast follows California\u2019s lead.\n\u201cThis is New York, one of the cradles of civilization, and there is nothing civilized about electrocuting and skinning animals just for a frivolous fashion item that has already fallen from favor,\u201d he said.\nFallen from favor for PETA\u2019s target demographic, maybe, but definitely not for all buyers. Industry studies suggest that demand is rising in recent years.\nWhile millennials may not be running to cop a full-length rabbit coat, there is no denying the popularity of fur trim. Google Trends reports that searches for \u201cCanada Goose jacket\u201d and \u201cWomen\u2019s coat with fur hood\u201d are up more than 80 percent. New York, Washington, DC, and New Jersey lead the states that search such terms the most.\nIn the New York neighborhood of Chelsea, where the fur industry is based, an average one bedroom rents for $3,700 and a cup of pour over coffee costs $4 with tax. The always-rising cost of living has displaced family-run fur shops, some of which have existed for four or five generations.\nFurriers see the proposed ban as yet another attack on their livelihoods. \u201cHow do you take a business that has been around for hundreds of years and decide you want to end it?\u201d said Marc Kaufman, a fifth-generation shop owner. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond the fur business. Next is cashmere, goose down, suede shoes, leather shoes. Once they\u2019re done with us, they\u2019re going to go to the next prize.\u201d\nLarry Cowit, vice president of Madison Avenue Furs, also asked \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cDo we close Peter Luger\u2019s [Steakhouse]? It\u2019s been there 100 years. Do we close every Canada Goose store in the city? There has to be a line, or we\u2019re all going to eat tofu and walk around in plastic sandals. Where does it end?\u201d\n\u201c Fur is just a luxury adornment of a bygone era\u2014it\u2019s not something people need to keep warm. \u201d\nWhen asked why ban fur as opposed to leather or suede, Mathews said, \u201cYou have got to start somewhere. Fur is just a luxury adornment of a bygone era\u2014it\u2019s not something people need to keep warm.\u201d\nMiguel Inclan runs Dimitrios Furs, which was founded by Greek immigrants in 1937. Like many of the stores on 30th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenue, multiple posters that read \u201cSave NY Jobs!\u201d line the front window.\n\u201cA fur ban would kill us,\u201d Inclan said. \u201cWe make our living through this, put our kids through college. This is the only thing we have been doing forever.\u201d\nAll of the furriers who spoke with The Daily Beast believe that the ban is rooted in more than just ethics. \u201cEverything is political,\u201d Inclan said. \u201cThis could be about real estate. The rent in the area is so high, you have no idea.\u201d\n\u201c We went through this in the \u201980s and late \u201990s, and now we\u2019re going through it again. The public has to realize that you\u2019re talking about taking away people\u2019s rights. \u201d\nDuring a furrier protest on City Hall last month, WLNY reported that more than 1,100 people work in the industry, so a ban would cost New York $3.3 billion in revenue over the next decade.\n\u201cWe are fighting tooth and nail,\u201d Cowit said. \u201cWe went through this in the \u201980s and late \u201990s, and now we\u2019re going through it again. The public has to realize that you\u2019re talking about taking away people\u2019s rights.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Speaker Johnson, whose constituency includes the fur district, declined The Daily Beast\u2019s request for an interview. The Speaker told WLNY, \u201cI never want to see jobs lost or businesses close, but this is the right thing to do.\u201d\nMathews, the PETA vice president, put it more bluntly: \u201cSmart furriers have diversified,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go into a lot of shops that sell furs, they sell other things, too.\u201d He also noted that, \u201cPeople who made cigarettes said the same thing [about losing jobs], despite the fact that smoking is such a leading cause of death in this country.\u201d\nThough Mathews claimed that PETA reps have met with \u201cloads of furriers over the years,\u201d the organization has no plans to speak to those impacted by the ban. As he put it, \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of PETA having those conversations.\u201d\nOf course, a ban on the sale of fur in just one city will not crush the entire international industry. In fact, during a recent afternoon at Madison Avenue Furs, one shopper was a woman who lives in L.A.\nSince the sale of mink is prohibited in her hometown, she made a point of stopping by New York's fur district to pick something up where it's legal\u2014for now.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Share:\nWASHINGTON - Tensions are rising, fingers are pointing and the search for solutions is becoming increasingly fraught. Overwhelmed by an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border that is taxing the immigration system, President Donald Trump is grasping for something \u2014 anything \u2014 to stem the tide.\nTrump, who campaigned on a promise to secure the border, has thrown virtually every option his aides have been able to think of at the problem, to little avail. He has sent out the military, signed an emergency declaration to fund a border wall and threatened to completely seal the southern border. On Thursday he added a new threat, warning of hefty tariffs on cars made in Mexico if the country doesn\u2019t abide by his demands.\nNow, with the encouragement of an influential aide and with his re-election campaign on the horizon, Trump is looking at personnel changes as he tries to shift blame elsewhere.\nThe first move was made Thursday, when the White House unexpectedly pulled back the nomination of Ron Vitiello to permanently lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where he had been acting director. The abrupt reversal was encouraged by top Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller and seen by some as part of a larger effort to bring on aides who share Miller\u2019s hard-line immigration views.\nPresident Donald Trump says his administration is ensuring the country knows \u201cthis is an actual emergency\u201d at the U.S.-Mexico border. (April 5)\n\u201cWe may go a different way. We may have to go a very tough way,\u201d Trump said in an interview with \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d that aired Saturday.\nAn empowered Miller is also eyeing the removal of Lee Francis Cissna, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which runs the legal immigration system, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal staffing matters. The White House did not respond to questions Friday about whether Trump was on board with that plan.\nTrump has become increasingly exasperated at his inability to do more to halt the swelling numbers of migrants entering the country. Aides, too, have complained they are stymied by regulatory guardrails, legal limitations and a Congress that has scoffed at the president\u2019s requests for legislative changes.\n\u201cThere is indeed an emergency on our southern border,\u201d Trump said Friday during a visit to the southern border in Calexico, California, where his frustration was evident. \u201cIt\u2019s a colossal surge and it\u2019s overwhelming our immigration system, and we can\u2019t let that happen. So, as I say, and this is our new statement: The system is full. Can\u2019t take you anymore.\u201d\nImmigration experts say Trump\u2019s own immigration policies have caused so much chaos along the border that they may be encouraging illegal crossings. The furor over family separations last summer helped to highlight the fact that families won\u2019t be detained for long in the U.S. if they\u2019re detained at all. And metering, in which people are asked to return to a busy port of entry on another day to seek asylum, may have encouraged asylum-seekers to cross illegally, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\u201cThis policy chaos, coupled with a sense that the U.S. government may at some point really shut down the border, has generated an urgency to migrate now while it is still possible,\u201d he said.\nWhatever the reasons for the migrant surge, there is a growing consensus that federal border resources are overwhelmed. While illegal border crossings are still down sharply from their peak in 2000, they have nonetheless reached a 12-year high. While most illegal border-crossers used to be single Mexican nationals coming to the U.S. in search of work, more than half are now parents and children who have traveled from Central America to seek refuge in the U.S.\nThose families, along with unaccompanied children, are subject to specific laws and court settlements that prevent them from being immediately sent back to their home countries. Immigrant processing and holding centers have been overwhelmed, forcing officials to dramatically expand a practice Trump has long mocked as \u201ccatch and release.\u201d\nIndeed, ICE has set free more than 125,000 people who came into the U.S. as families since late last year and is now busing people hundreds of miles inland, releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities like Albuquerque, San Antonio and Phoenix because towns close to the border already have more than they can handle.\n", "label": "human"}

These tragedies continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and minds, and we extend our sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. All of us feel the immense gravity of these events across our company and recognize the devastation of the families and friends of the loved ones who perished.\nThe full details of what happened in the two accidents will be issued by the government authorities in the final reports, but, with the release of the preliminary report of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accident investigation, it's apparent that in both flights the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS, activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information.\nThe history of our industry shows most accidents are caused by a chain of events. This again is the case here, and we know we can break one of those chain links in these two accidents. As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it.\nFrom the days immediately following the Lion Air accident, we've had teams of our top engineers and technical experts working tirelessly in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration and our customers to finalize and implement a software update that will ensure accidents like that of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 never happen again.\nWe're taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach, and taking the time, to get the software update right. We're nearing completion and anticipate its certification and implementation on the 737 MAX fleet worldwide in the weeks ahead. We regret the impact the grounding has had on our airline customers and their passengers.\nThis update, along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents, will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS-related accident from ever happening again.\nWe at Boeing take the responsibility to build and deliver airplanes to our airline customers and to the flying public that are safe to fly, and can be safely flown by every single one of the professional and dedicated pilots all around the world. This is what we do at Boeing.\nWe remain confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 MAX. All who fly on it\u2014the passengers, flight attendants and pilots, including our own families and friends\u2014deserve our best. When the MAX returns to the skies with the software changes to the MCAS function, it will be among the safest airplanes ever to fly.\nWe've always been relentlessly focused on safety and always will be. It's at the very core of who we are at Boeing. And we know we can always be better. Our team is determined to keep improving on safety in partnership with the global aerospace industry and broader community. It's this shared sense of responsibility for the safety of flight that spans and binds us all together.\nI cannot remember a more heart-wrenching time in my career with this great company. When I started at Boeing more than three decades ago, our amazing people inspired me. I see how they dedicate their lives and extraordinary talents to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world \u2014 safely. And that purpose and mission has only grown stronger over the years.\nWe know lives depend on the work we do and that demands the utmost integrity and excellence in how we do it. With a deep sense of duty, we embrace the responsibility of designing, building and supporting the safest airplanes in the skies. We know every person who steps aboard one of our airplanes places their trust in us.\nTogether, we'll do everything possible to earn and re-earn that trust and confidence from our customers and the flying public in the weeks and months ahead.\nAgain, we're deeply saddened by and are sorry for the pain these accidents have caused worldwide.

{"text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 More than 60 stakeholders from across the women\u2019s basketball landscape got together Wednesday hours before the WNBA draft to discuss a variety of topics critical to the sport.\nViewership, attendance, the role of coaches, international trends, and player perspective were discussed during the three-hour meeting that included representatives from the WNBA, NCAA, USA Basketball, FIBA, coaches, the players\u2019 association, officials, apparel companies and journalists.\n\u201cMany people in the room have logged years supporting and promoting women\u2019s basketball and want to see it remain respected, relevant and in growth mode,\u201d Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman said.\n\u201cThe meeting was a unique opportunity for key stakeholders to exchange thoughts and consider the questions we should be asking as we look to keep the women\u2019s game at a high level in the years to come. Hopefully we can keep the momentum going and come up with collaborative strategies that help attract more fans and keep us in step with the times.\u201d\nWhile there are many positives around the sport right now with the attendance at the NCAA Tournament at its highest level in 15 years and play in the WNBA at a high level, there are concerns. The number of girls playing basketball across the nation has dropped nearly 10 percent since 2000-01. In 2015, the number of girls playing volleyball for the first time surpassed basketball and it\u2019s steadily increased since.\nNew York Liberty coach Katie Smith was one of the attendees Wednesday, speaking about life as a former college and WNBA player and a coach. Even though she had the draft to focus on a few hours later, Smith wanted to be at the summit.\n\u201cI felt that it was important for me to join even with the draft that night,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTo be in that room with all those contributors to our game and for us to have discussions how and what we need to do to grow our game in all areas is something I value and wanted to be a part of. The game has given me so much and I want to make sure I do my part in pushing it forward for all involved.\u201d\nThe event was organized by Carol Stiff, ESPN\u2019s vice president, programming and acquisitions. Ackerman said that Stiff have been trying to put together the summit for a few years and that the timing worked for most people with many of the attendees in New York for the draft. Ackerman also ran a summit at the FIBA World Championship in 2010 in the Czech Republic.\n\u201cThe 60 representatives from all levels have a unique perspective on the history, successes and continued opportunities surrounding the sport,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe discussions were educational, candid and spirted, focusing on strategies and enhancements for the future of the game. This type of dialogue is critically important as ESPN continues to expand our women\u2019s sports portfolio \u2014 specifically our women\u2019s basketball commitment at the professional, NCAA and high school levels.\u201d\nThe group hopes to have another discussion down the road at potentially the WNBA All-Star Game in July or at some point later on.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "If you\u2019re a professional basketball player and have been smugly snickering at all those articles about robots and AI taking over jobs, annoyingly confident that your gig is, and always will be, safe, then I have some bad news for you. Toyota, maker of your friend\u2019s grey-market Sera and your enemy\u2019s Prius, has developed a robot that can sink three-pointers with ease. Plus, it has skin that looks like an obsidian pineapple.\nThis video was shot on April 1 at a basketball court in Tokyo. While the actual shooting of the basket is unquestionably impressive, there\u2019s a lot of other strange robotic stuff going on here. Watch:\nSee what I mean? The ball was first handed to a robot controlled by a man in a VR headset and gear that appears to replicate his actions to that black-and-white humanoid robot:\nNext, that VR-wearing-human-controlled robot passes the ball off to this very slow, careful non-humanoid basketball-transporting robot that appears to navigate its own way to the tall basketball-throwing robot, who\u2019s dressed in black-and-red basketball shorts that prevent us from knowing if Toyota designed any robotic genitals for it.\nThe process is slow and peculiar, giving the entire event a strangely stately and almost religiously ritualistic feel.\nThe basketball-shooting robot is named Cue 3, and while it\u2019s being developed mostly for promotional, fun, and morale reasons, that doesn\u2019t make what it\u2019s doing any less impressive.\nThere\u2019s a hell of a lot of computation that has to happen to sink a long basket like that. Cue 3 uses sensors in its torso to generate a three-dimensional image of the basket\u2019s location, and there\u2019s motors inside the arms and knees to adjust the power and trajectory of the shot. There also appears to be some sort of cyclopean camera on the head, too.\nNone of this is easy, but Toyota says it hardly ever misses, though in the April 1st demonstration it only sunk five out of eight shots, worse than normal but still pretty damn good.\nEven so, it looks like it would be pretty easy to defend against the robot and steal the ball.\nToyota\u2019s also made a more-produced video of the basketbot in action, this time competing against some human basketball players:\nThe robot won.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Traditional building materials are quickly being replaced by innovative products that have all the strengths of their predecessors while offering new and amazing advantages, as demonstrated by Prairie Rubber Paving. Through its synthetic rubber surfaces, Prairie Rubber Paving proves that you can have a surface that is beautiful yet durable, sturdy but flexible, and, above all, safe.\nThe overlay is composed of synthetic rubber that is specially formulated and manufactured for the purpose. \u201cWe use the highest quality synthetic rubber on the market,\u201d said Corey Redstone, the co-founder and President of Prairie Rubber Paving. \u201cIt\u2019s authentic EPDM rubber, and it\u2019s been produced and used in Europe since the 1970s.\u201d\nProviding maximum traction and minimum impact, the rubber serves as a reliable and attractive surface. It\u2019s an anti-slip product,\u201d Redstone said. \u201cIt\u2019s the safest product on the market as far as something that you can walk on.\u201d\nOnce cured, it does not emit gasses or other substances, and, because the pigment is distributed throughout the rubber, it will not discolour or wear off. In brand new walkways and playgrounds, an under-layer of rubber recycled from tires can provide additional bounce. For greater resilience and longevity, Prairie Rubber Paving mixes polyurethane binders into its rubber. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely flexible, and, every colour you use, any project that we do, is made to be UV-resistant,\u201d said Redstone.\nThat flexibility also allows rubber paving to function on cracked or even slightly shifting foundations. Many conventional materials succumb to the prairie climate\u2019s cycles of freezing and thawing, but those surfaces can be revitalized by an overlay of rubber paving, which will completely cover the damage and fill in cracks and crevices.\nConsequently, a rubber overlay can be applied to decks, steps and driveways as readily as it can to gym floors, pools, splash pads and playgrounds. Those surfaces can be shovelled, washed or vacuumed normally. The porous structure allows water to drain away, but in indoor applications, the surface can be sealed into a non-porous state for easier cleaning.\nRedstone himself has been working with rubber for ten years, training and acquiring on-site experience with another company. \u201cAs that company grew a lot and I moved to Winnipeg, I decided that I wanted to change a few things to improve the product,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPrairie Rubber Paving has been in existence for six years.

For example, Andrew Renner of Alaska received jail time after he led his teenage son into a hibernating mother bear\u2019s den and shot her and her two infant cubs.

Now another clip of a bear in India is making the rounds online \u2013 and this one is a bit different because the bear is not the victim.\nIn the footage, you\u2019ll watch forest worker Kumar trying to move a bear to a safer location in the forest. Because the bear was spotted walking around the Velugodu Reservoir, which is located in Andhra India, Kumar was sent to get the bear out of the area and take it back to its natural habitat.\nTo do that, Kumar used ropes and ties. He decided it would be easier to restrain the predator as he tried to carry it away from the open water back to where the bear belonged in the forest.\nIn the footage, you\u2019ll see that Kumar has the bear right where he wants it. But suddenly the bear breaks free from the ropes that tied it in place, and it rushed straight toward Kumar with murderous intentions.\nAlthough the mission was to rescue the bear, things took a turn for the worst when the bear started mauling Kumar. The forest worker dashed into the reservoir hoping to escape the claws of the bear.\nBecause the other forest workers were ill-prepared for the incident, they started hurling rocks at the creature, trying to stop it from attacking their co-worker. Eventually, it worked.\nKumar survived and was later rushed to the Kurnool General hospital, where he was treated for bear attack wounds. He is reported to be in stable condition but is still recovering from the mauling.\nThe footage is alarming and has been spreading across various platforms online.

{"text": "A drama imagines a fictional Hillary Clinton, post-college, soul-searching and sliming fish in Alaska.\nA relatively little-known fact: After college, Hillary Rodham went to Alaska and worked for a short time in a cannery scraping guts out of salmon. Decades later, Hillary Clinton wrote in her autobiography, \u201csliming fish was pretty good preparation for life in Washington.\u201d What she didn\u2019t do in Alaska, as far as we know, was have a brief fling with an unemployed Japanese fisherman and use him as a sounding board for some heavy-duty existential soul-searching. But that is the admittedly fabricated premise of When I\u2019m a Moth, an earnest, pretentious attempt to find political relevance in an imaginary, pre-Clinton Hillary.\nThe film was written and directed by Zachary Cotler and Magdalena Zyzak, whose previous efforts were also calculated to hit sociological or political nerves. They co-helmed The Wall of Mexico, a feature that played at this year\u2019s SXSW about rich Mexican-Americans who build a wall to keep out poor white thieves, as well as Maya Dardel (2017), starring Lena Olin as a dying poet who announces in a radio interview that she will kill herself.\nThe Hillary film sends a political signal at the very start, with a variation on the usual biopic disclaimer. This one says: \"What follows is a work of fiction. So is the United States political situation.\" But any attempt to invoke the superficiality and fakery of our current moment in history fails to register.\nTheir heroine certainly plays off our knowledge of the real Clinton, or at least her public persona, as ambitious, endlessly disciplined and emotionally chilly. Although she is never given a last name, the character is called Hillary, she has long blonde hair and is a recent graduate of an all-women\u2019s college, liked the real-life person. Addison Timlin plays her with a tone of rote determination, in a performance at odds with the way this Hillary writes to her parents that she wants to \"say yes to everything\" during this summer.\nShe is already headed for a political career. How do we know this? \"I\u2019m going to be a politician,\" she says. \"I\u2019m on a predetermined path.\" She announces this to two Japanese men who aimlessly sit by the water as she walks by on her way home from work each day. She asks them to have a drink with her and discovers that the slightly older man is a drunken oaf, but the younger, Ryohei, is a sympathetic listener.\nOver the next days, as Hillary and Ryohei get to know each other, she says things like, \"I need to work on softening my personality, I think,\" for her political future. Already acutely aware of politics as image-making, she guesses that softening her persona will include pretending not to be ambitious \"for decades, if necessary.\"\nTheir conversations make it clear that she is genuinely idealistic, but also willing to take tough action. Ryohei tells her that his parents died as a result of the U.S. bombing of Nagasaki and she replies, \"I guess I\u2019ll have to be involved in something like that,\" one day. But except for calling Henry Kissinger a war criminal, none of her dialogue is more than generic, from the political babble to the sophomoric navel-gazing.\nThe pic is shot as if it were a nature documentary, full of slow panning shots of snow-capped mountains by a lake, or a prism of color across the screen, to no purpose except lengthy, cliched scene-setting. Lyn Moncrief\u2019s cinematography is technically fine but unexceptional. The mournful soundtrack music is so distracting that it enhances the film\u2019s self-conscious artiness instead of effectively setting a tone. Despite the many attention-getting stylistic choices, from extreme backlighting to shooting Hillary behind a railing so she looks as if she\u2019s in prison, the movie remains flat, even and especially in the discreet sex scene.\nThe title comes from a conversation in which Hillary describes herself as \"a moth that has to be in a cocoon first\" before becoming her future self. But the pic doesn\u2019t add to our knowledge about the woman who won the popular vote for president in 2016, and it doesn\u2019t raise interesting new questions about someone who has already been analyzed for decades. That would have been fine if instead it had created a fictional character or avatar who intrigues us on her own, but it doesn\u2019t. This woman\u2019s most un-Hillary-like trait is that she sits on her porch reading Proust, eating a bunless hot dog and dripping mustard on the book\u2019s pages. Was the real Hillary ever so careless? Are we meant to think she has been hiding that part of herself? This meandering film makes it impossible to guess. The best that can be said about When I\u2019m a Moth is that it is not lurid, although it does seem pointless.\nProduction company: The Winter Film Company\nCast: Addison Timlin, T.J.

{"text": "James Skeer says it's an \"exceptional time\" to be selling crossbred wool.\nLamb producers in Australia are seeing record prices for crossbred wool, partly driven by a trend for fake fur coats made in China.\nkey points fake fur Key points: Twenty-five year highs in crossbred wool prices are being driven by a surge in demand in China for fake fur coats\nCrossbred wool is obtained from sheep farmed for both meat and wool, with the latter the \"poor cousin\" of merino wool\nLarge orders from China ripple very quickly through the Australian market\nCrossbred sheep are used to produce both meat and wool, and their wool is not as premium as that of merino wool.\nBut over the past few months at wool auctions around Australia, crossbred wool prices have surged \u2014 even in weeks when most merino micron categories fell.\nJosh Lamb from Endeavour Wool Exports said it had been a huge season for crossbred wool.\n\"We've seen record levels, or levels that are certainly at record highs over the last 25 years,\" he said.\n\"That continued last week, with 28 to 30-micron crossbreds increasing again [in the week ending March 29], which was the only part of the market that improved across the board.\"\nMr Lamb said a huge factor behind the price rise was a spike in demand in China for a fake fur fabric made out of the wool.\n\"It's a heavy winter coat imitating a fur material and that [trend] seems to have continued through the northern hemisphere winter,\" he said.\n\"We're still seeing the back-end of that now.\"\nBoost to meat business\nWool consultant Andrew Dennis said crossbred wool had been considered the \"poor cousin\" to the more expensive merino fibre, but demand for it was increasing.\n\"The first reason for that is a product called 'fake faux fur', which has been around for couple of years,\" he said.\n\"Orders have hit the market, so people are scrambling to buy crossbred wool to satisfy that particular fashion demand.\nShare There is demand for fake fur coats, similar to this one, made out of wool.\n\"People are using crossbred wool in place of merino wool to keep mills busy because it costs half the amount, and it's seen as the lower-risk way to fill machinery if the future is uncertain.\"\nAfter watching the market for months, lamb and beef producer James Skeer, who farms near Penola in South Australia, sold crossbred wool at auction about two weeks ago and fetched the highest price he has seen in his time on the farm.\nShare A flock of first-cross ewes is just one part of the Skeer farm.\n\"We focus on prime lamb production and wool is a bit of a side, but there's more focus on it as the prices have gone up,\" he said.\n\"For our 28-micron wool, it's at record highs \u2014 or close to record highs \u2014 at the moment.\n\"It's a pretty exceptional time to be selling crossbred wool.\"\nMr Skeer said because \"markets come and go\" the farm would not be changing strategy.\nBut the record prices were a nice boost in income from his flock of first-cross ewes.\n\"For us, wool production is only a small proportion of what we do. But every market that comes up I guess counts as one that goes down because we're operating in a few different markets at once,\" he said.\n\"They never all seem to go up at once, though.\"\nLarge orders drive market\nMr Dennis, who is based in Adelaide but travels around the world selling Australian wool, said it was increasingly common to see this kind of trend having a ripple effect on prices.\nShare Wool market movements are difficult to predict, but some agents expect the high prices to stick around a few more months.\nBecause the market providing wool was smaller due to drought, he said movements in the fashion and garment manufacturing industry had provided a useful diversifying earner for struggling sheep meat farmers.\n\"Before you would have a pool of products \u2014 wool top, yarn, etcetera \u2014 now those pools are very very limited,\" he said.\n\"So a big order placed in the market \u2014 whether it's fake fur, whether it's Chinese uniform, whether it's double fabrics, a serious order placed in China \u2014 suddenly that ripple effect will spread very quickly back to the Australian market.\"\nLike most global markets, wool prices can be volatile and hard to predict.\nBut agents expect crossbred prices to remain high for a few more months.\n\"It makes the whole lamb enterprise a very viable one going forward,\" Mr Dennis said.\n\"It's taken a long time to get there, but the wool industry in general is going exceptionally well.\n\"If we can get a bit more rain it will be even better. But the outlook for the wool industry is as favourable as it's ever been.\"\n", "label": "human"}

It aims to dispel harmful and pervasive stereotypes while \u201cshifting the lens from pathologizing poverty toward amplifying resistance to, and healing from, all forms of gendered colonial violence.\u201d\nThe women\u2019s centre\u2019s project co-ordinator, activist Harsha Walia, co-authored the report with the centre\u2019s victim services worker and long-time community leader Carol Martin in partnership with the 128 women who shared their personal experiences. Ms. Walia said the document provides an unfiltered look at a range of issues affecting these women, such as violence, the legacy of residential schools, colonization, policing and the overdose crisis.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cThese are stories that, separate from government, the public needs to know about,\u201d Ms. Walia said on Wednesday at a news conference for the report\u2019s release.\nAmong the stories is that of Sophie Merasty, a Denesuline and Woodlands Cree woman originally from Manitoba. She spoke of her sister\u2019s murder \u2013 falling out of a window to her death attempting to escape from a sexual assault in 1981 \u2013 called the police response callous, and said the man convicted in the case spent only 30 days in pretrial custody due to requirements that judges take Indigenous background into consideration in sentencing.\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s life was not valued in life or in death,\u201d reads Ms. Merasty\u2019s account. \u201cShe was seen as a drunk, addict, and all these other victim-blaming stereotypes.\u201d\nDebra Leo wrote that she and her sister ran away from home in their teens to escape abuse at the hands of their father, whom Ms. Leo believed learned his habits from abuse he suffered in residential school. The girls stayed with older men in the Downtown Eastside and were introduced to drugs, alcohol and sex. When police would find them, they would bring them home \u2013 to the father, and the abuse, they had fled.\nSuzanne Kilroy of the Okanagan First Nation spoke of her sister\u2019s murder, of her struggles with substance use, and of police inaction when she reported being raped. No one cared much about any of that, she said, because she was a drug user, a sex worker, Indigenous and transgender.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised I am still alive,\u201d reads one part of her account. \u201cOut of 17 of my friends who came from the Okanagan, I am the only one who is still alive.

After the near-crash, tempers flared and fists flew.\nWith a black eye and a cast around his wrist, Fink on Monday, April 15 recounted the moment he feared for his life.\n\"I've got three or four broken ribs over there,\" said Fink.\nFink said around 2 p.m. Saturday, a driver in a red vehicle slammed on his brakes to avoid hitting Fink in the bike lane.\n\"That upset me, so I did use my middle finger,\" said Fink.\nThen, Fink said the driver made a U-turn and began yelling at him to come towards him.\n\"He said, 'Take one more step.

{"text": "The Portland Timbers have spent the past two years working with neighborhood representatives and the city to ensure that traffic congestion and parking demands around Providence Park won\u2019t be amplified on game days following the completion of their $85 million expansion project this summer.\nBut some neighbors around the stadium remain concerned that the 4,000 additional seats, which will bring capacity up to 25,000, will lead to increased traffic and a lack of parking after the stadium reopens in June.\nAhead of the reopening, a city oversight committee was tasked with making updates to the Good Neighbor Agreement and Comprehensive Transportation Management Plan, which lay out measures to ensure that game days aren\u2019t causing undue strain on the surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe oversight committee, which includes representatives from the Timbers, the City of Portland, the Goose Hollow Foothills League and the Northwest District Association, recently voted to send its updated transportation plan and neighbor agreement to the Portland City Council for review. The council will decide whether to approve the updated plans on April 17.\n\u201cWe all want the experience of coming and going from the stadium to be smooth for us, for our fans, for the neighbors,\u201d Timbers President of Business Mike Golub said. \u201cOur interests are aligned with the interests of the neighborhoods. We think the plan that we\u2019re ready to enact really does an excellent job at improving on what was already a really good situation here.\u201d\nThe updated transportation plan estimates that 55 percent of fans will take cars to the stadium this year to look for either off-street or on-street parking. Based on that assumption, the plan estimates that there will be an additional 1,120 cars heading to Providence Park on game days, as compared to previous years. In addition, it estimates that fans will utilize an additional 110 ride-hailing vehicles to attend games, which could affect traffic congestion.\nWhereas the previous transportation plan included 12 measures to help alleviate congestion and parking demands on game days, the new plan has 21 measures. Among the key measures are: providing a third additional MAX train in each direction after games, promoting the use of and providing discounts to underutilized SmartPark garages downtown, enhancing game-day enforcement of on-street parking, designating new ride-hailing zones and creating a one-stop shop of travel information on the Timbers website.\nBut the Northwest District Association, which covers the neighborhood north of Providence Park, continues to have significant concerns about the updated transportation plan.\nRon Walters, the association\u2019s representative on the committee, did not vote to send the plans through to the city. He said that the current plan lacks sufficient implementation details, clearly defined metrics and accountability measures. A committee of stakeholders appointed by Portland\u2019s transportation commissioner voiced similar complaints in a letter to the oversight committee.\n\u201cParking in the neighborhood is tough on non-game days,\u201d Walters said. \u201cGame days, it\u2019s much, much worse, to the point where neighbors have to completely modify their behavior. They have to go get parking four hours before the match. This notion that there\u2019s now going to be 1,200 additional cars is really problematic. They don\u2019t have any strong argument for where those people are going to park.\u201d\nUnlike other downtown stadiums, Providence Park doesn\u2019t have its own dedicated parking lot, meaning that fans must park elsewhere. The stated goal of the transportation plan is to \u201caccommodate the transportation needs of additional fans without increasing demand for on-street parking or increasing traffic congestion in neighborhoods near the stadium.\u201d\nWhile the Timbers can be fined for violating specific agreements in the transportation plan or neighbor agreement, Walters said the transportation plan is lacking clear metrics to evaluate the proposed measures and doesn\u2019t have enough built-in accountability to ensure that the proposals will be implemented in a timely fashion and re-evaluated if they are unsuccessful.\nFor example, the success of the ride-hailing portion of the plan will be measured by looking at the percentage of fans who use ride-hailing. Instead, Walters said that the metric should be looking at how ride-hailing is affecting traffic congestion and that there should be a clear process in place if specific goals aren\u2019t met. The oversight committee is required to meet just once a year following the reopening of the stadium, but Walters would like to see those meetings occur more frequently as well.\nJerry Powell, the oversight committee representative from Goose Hollow, agreed that more accountability could be built into the transportation plan, but still voted to send the agreement on for city approval.\n\u201cI certainly appreciate the concerns that NWDA has,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI disagree in terms of pushing it forward, simply because my neighborhood doesn\u2019t want to see the work that\u2019s gone into this go to waste. I think we got as much as we\u2019re going to get, and I don\u2019t want to see the season start without these plans in place. It goes back to accountability. We lose the ability to demand accountability if there\u2019s nothing to be accountable to.\u201d\nKen Puckett, Timbers senior vice president of operations, said fans have consistently pointed to the ease of going to and from games in surveys and that the club hasn\u2019t received much blowback from the neighborhoods in the past.\nPuckett also said that the current transportation plan, like the previous one, will be a living document that can be updated as needed in the coming years.\n\u201cWe want our fans to have a good experience coming to our games and leaving our games, so we\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make that happen,\u201d Puckett said. \u201cSome of these 21 measures that are in this new plan might not work and they might need to be tweaked and they might need to be changed, and we\u2019re open to doing that.\u201d\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @jamiebgoldberg\nVisit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.\n", "label": "human"}

The weird part about this pick is that a year ago, the Giants took the best rookie in the class\u2014a pick that makes sense if you believe that your quarterback has as much left in his career as, say, Philip Rivers or Ben Roethlisberger. Maybe Eli Manning had some historically bad offensive lines last season, and maybe we\u2019ll all look foolish this year. But I\u2019m curious if, knowing how the last season worked out, and how the Odell Beckham Jr. relationship would bottom out, and the scramble it took to patch up the roster in free agency for one last push, it wouldn\u2019t have been easier to have Darnold a year ago and find a running back in 2019. Again, that\u2019s if you were given this insane power to redo this draft knowing everything that would happen.\nIf the Giants were given the power to re-do the 2018 NFL Draft, they\u2019d approach it the same exact way. Barkley is a guaranteed Hall of Famer if he can stay healthy, while the future for Darnold is completely uncertain. He flashed at times in 2018, but more often than not, he could barely keep his head above water.\nMeanwhile, the Giants did not have the type of offensive line that would breed a rookie\u2019s success under center. They had one of the lowest pass-blocking efficiency ratings in the league a season ago, but in the face of all that, Eli Manning still put up some of his best career numbers.\nAnyone watching the tape with an open mind can see Manning can still play at a high level and win, but the narrative has been repeated so many times at this point people assume that it must be true.\nIt\u2019s not and we may finally see that in 2019.\nRelated Giants keeping a close eye on Penn State WR DeAndre Thompkins\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A total of 387 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 15 states from January 1 to March 28, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the United States since measles was declared eliminated in 2000. The highest number of reported cases since elimination was 667 in 2014.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person comes into direct contact with or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces.\nThe states reporting cases are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.\nThe CDC said six outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more cases \u2014 are ongoing in California (Santa Cruz and Butte County), New Jersey, New York (Rockland County and New York City) and Washington.\nThese outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.\nTypical measles symptoms, including high fever, rash all over the body, stuffy nose and reddened eyes, usually disappear without treatment within two or three weeks, though a severe case of the measles can lead to death.\nLast week, in an effort to contain an outbreak of measles that began in October, Rockland County, New York, banned unvaccinated people under age 18 from public places. As of Friday, the county reported 153 confirmed cases, though state health officials noted additional cases have not been reported.\nLast year, the CDC reported 372 total cases and 17 outbreaks, with three areas \u2014 New York, New York City, and New Jersey \u2014 contributing most of the cases. All three area outbreaks were linked to travelers bringing measles back from Israel and then spreading the virus among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities.\nA total of 82 people brought measles into the nation from other countries in 2018. This is the greatest number of imported cases since measles was declared eliminated in the United States.\nSince 1963, when the vaccine was introduced, cases and deaths from measles in the United States and other developed countries have plummeted. Prior to the vaccine, measles caused approximately 450 to 500 deaths each year in the United States.\nThe measles vaccine \u2014 known as the MMR vaccine \u2014 is very effective. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come in contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective. Experts recommend that children receive the vaccine in two doses: first, between ages 12 months and 15 months and a second between 4 and 6 years old.\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions, according to the CDC. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but there is a \u201cremote chance\u201d of the vaccine causing side effects and even serious injuries.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Thanks to the popularity of livestreaming and YouTube content, peripheral makers have discovered a market for high-quality audio-video equipment. Now, gaming-first companies like Razer and HyperX are rushing into that space.\nHyperX is launching the QuadCast USB microphone. It\u2019s available now for $140, and it\u2019s compatible with PC, Mac, and PlayStation 4.\nOne of the good things about HyperX entering this space is that it knows gamers are demanding. And it built a smart microphone that is better because of all of its clever extras.\nWhat you\u2019ll like\nGreat sound\nIt all starts with high-quality audio. You will always get better audio from plugging an XLR mic into a mixer, but USB mics are going to work just fine for the vast majority of people. And if you\u2019re in this \u201cprosumer\u201d segment, the HyperX QuadCast sounds as good or better than nearly any competing device.\nIt has four microphone patterns: stereo, omnidirectional, cardioid, and bidirectional. For streaming a game by yourself, you\u2019ll always want cardioid. And in this mode, your voice will come through full and clean. It even does a fine job of isolating room noise if your PC fan is loud or you want to keep a window open.\nBut even in the other modes, you should get audio that will sound great in a YouTube video or on Twitch. If you want to record a bunch of people for a podcast or for a multiplayer stream, you\u2019d do better with an array of shotgun mics, of course. But the QuadCast is still better than good enough.\nYou can hear it compared to other microphones in the playlist below:\nSmart features\nBut it\u2019s all of the extras that set the QuadCast apart. You can get similar audio from the Blue Yeti Nano, the Razer Seiren X, or the Samson G-Track Pro. The reason I prefer the QuadCast is because it was obviously built with gaming in mind.\nThe QuadCast lights up from the inside with red LEDs when the microphone is active. This makes it easy for people to tell when you have a hot mic on your desk.\nAnd if you want to mute the mic, all you have to do is tap the top. The QuadCast has a touch-sensitive button to mute and unmute. This is such a great idea. It eliminates switches and physical buttons that can create loud clicks on your recording track. Instead, all you have to do is gently press your finger to the top of the microphone, and the light turns off and the microphone goes silent. And since the touch button is on the top, you won\u2019t accidentally activate it.\nIncluded shock mount\nBut perhaps the best feature is that the QuadCast comes with a shock mount. This is what pushes it over the top for gaming-related video content.\nA lot of USB microphones sound great, but they also pick up the bumping and thudding of a mouse moving on a nearby surface. You can almost always buy a third-party shock mount to fix that. But with the QuadCast, that\u2019s not a concern. It eliminates those vibrations without the need for anything extra.\nWhat you won\u2019t like\nYou may need to tinker to get the best results\nThe QuadCast sounds great out of the box, but you may have to fiddle with everything to get the best quality. The problem is that you can adjust the mic in Windows or on the hardware itself.\nYou can use the gain control on the bottom of the mic, but that could affect the clarity of your recording. It is also separate from any software gain control that you might end up using.\nSo you should take some time to get everything dialed in how you like it.\nConclusion\nWith the QuadCast, HyperX has continued to show that it understands how to appeal to gaming fans. While it knows that great sound is crucial, it added multiple features that it knows will keep people happy long after they spend their money. On top of that, the QuadCast is really hitting the right price. At $140, it is right in the range of a Blue Yeti, but it\u2019s actually a better deal since it comes with a shock mount.\nIf you are looking for a USB mic to livestream, podcast, or create YouTube content with, this is my recommendation.\nThe HyperX QuadCast is available now for $140. HyperX sent GamesBeat a sample unit for the purpose of this review.\n", "label": "human"}

A number of them may be long-term and some injuries were to key recruits.\nAs with recent tradition the junior football topped and tailed the usual three games of footy with the U14s starting before the Thirds and the U16s playing a twilight game after the seniors.\nIt was a very long, but entertaining, day for footy tragics. Congratulations to the U12s playing at Ball Park and the U16s who were both victorious.\nSeniors\nCorowa Rutherglen 3.11.29 defeated by Yarrawonga 10.20.80\nNot only were injuries of a major concern to the Roos, but a score line of 0.11 from sixteen shots at three quarter time soured the day even further.\nBut at least they didn\u2019t surrender, outscoring the Pigeons by three goals to one in the last term, only to go down by 51 points at the final siren.\nAgain the backline stood strong restricting the perennial finals\u2019 contender to just ten goals in perfect conditions.\nTim Brook, playing his first game for the club was in great form in the first half before being struck down with a leg injury.\nJarred Lane again reinforced what an important pickup he has been for the Roos ruck department while Andrew Pretto put in a four-quarter display of class and composure.\nThere were moments during the game when the Roos look dangerous in attack especially when Joe Hansen and Tyler Spencer took on the opposition with dashes through the centre and driving the ball deep into attack.\nThe Roos were finally rewarded when Leigh Schulz goaled from a set shot early in the last.\nThat goal seems to put some spark in the Roos who went on to play their best quarter of the game.\nThe late withdrawal of Cody Parker and a nasty leg injury to assistant coach Rohan Davies at training last Thursday further depleted the Roos, but it did provide an opportunity for Billy Raggett to make his debut.\nThe Roos take on Wang Rovers away next week and if they can find a way to lock the ball in their forward line and move it out of defence, we can look forward to pushing them all the way.\nGoals: A.

{"text": "A new tax on large industrial emitters, killing the climate leadership plan and an Open for Business Act all form part of the UCP\u2019s 117-page campaign platform released Saturday afternoon.\nThe platform fleshed out commitments UCP Leader Jason Kenney has already made on the campaign trail around health care, farm safety, education, post-secondary and red tape reduction, and outlined the party\u2019s environmental plan.\nIt also included a costed budget which includes $700 million in new spending over four years and with provincial debt projected to hit $86.1 billion by 2022-23 (compared with what the UCP calculates would be a projected $101 billion under the NDP, though the NDP put that figure at $94.8 billion in its most recent quarterly fiscal update). It also aims to move Alberta closer to the provincial average in program spending through a \u201crigorous evaluation of all programs and services.\u201d\nStokes Economics assessed the platform and concluded it would lead to a balanced budget by 2022-23, but \u2014 like the last NDP budget \u2014 relies on two out of three pipelines being built to do so. It also banks on 2.2-per-cent economic growth and employment growth of 1.4 per cent.\nEnvironment\nThe UCP has made no secret it will scrap the carbon tax, but it would also kill (and spend taxpayer dollars to review) the NDP government\u2019s entire Climate Leadership Plan. Among other things, that plan put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, pledged to end coal-generated electricity by 2030 and outlined a 100-megatonne oilsands emissions cap (which would be nixed by the UCP).\nThe current large emitter tax would be replaced with a new Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program. The first $100 million of TIER would fund new technologies to reduce carbon emissions (the party cited improved oilsands extraction technology and carbon capture as examples) and $20 million would go to the energy \u201cwar room.\u201d The rest will fall into general revenue. That change would likely sound a death knell for both Energy Efficiency Alberta, which oversees projects solely funded by the carbon tax, and Emissions Reduction Alberta, an arms-length agency established in 2007 and a recognized world-leader funding research technology with carbon tax dollars.\nJobs\nUnder an Open For Business Act, the UCP would introduce a $13/hour youth minimum wage, publish economic data on the NDP\u2019s minimum wage increase, allow banked hours to be paid at regular instead of time-and-a-half pay, and restore mandatory secret ballots for union certification.\nIt would reduce the business general income tax rate from 12 to 8 per cent over four years in the hopes of creating jobs, cut red tape by one-third and replace farm safety Bill 6 with a Farm Freedom and Safety Act. However, the party would maintain some employment law changes made under the NDP, including provisions around long-term, bereavement, domestic violence and child illness leave.\nThe party pledged to develop a 10-year tourism strategy focusing on jobs, \u201creorient\u201d the mandate of Travel Alberta towards public-private partnerships, and make the department the responsibility of the Economic Development Minister.\nThe UCP would also create Fairness for Newcomers Office with a $2.5-million budget, and international student entrepreneur and foreign graduate startup visa programs.\nInfrastructure\nThe UCP would retain the NDP government\u2019s capital plan from 2019-20 to 2022-23, and bring back public-private partnerships (like the P3 school-build scheme slammed in a Deloitte review under the former Progressive Conservative government). The UCP would also create a 20-year strategic capital plan for the province and pass an Alberta Infrastructure Act to provide transparency around capital project funding.\nEnergy and electricity\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator\u2019s board of directors would be fired by a UCP government.

Should I move my investment from Tata Digital to L&T Mid Cap fund? Please let me know if I should change my allocation in any of the schemes?\n\u2014Mayank Gupta\nThe portfolio that you hold is an aggressive one and consists very good funds.\nIt\u2019s good that you recognize the importance of debt investing in the overall scheme of things and identify that your PF contributions make up for the same.\nRegarding your question about choosing between a sector fund and a mid-cap fund, we need to first look at the nature of sector funds. But before that, I am going to assume that this is a long-term portfolio with at least a 10-year time horizon. If that is the case, you need to evaluate whether or not a sector fund should find a place in such a portfolio. Funds like these that invest in particular themes or market sectors are good for investments meant for the medium term where you can time your entry and exit.\nAs far as investing in information technology funds are concerned, they\u2019ve had a very good run in recent years despite the sluggishness in the overall market and, hence, this is as good a time as any to tune your portfolio to reflect its long-term diversified nature. So, my advice to you would be to move out of this sector fund and buy a more diversified fund.\nThe L&T fund that you have chosen in this regard is a good mid-cap fund to move to.\nSrikanth Meenakshi is co-founder and COO, FundsIndia.com.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Have a seat. Put on your reading glasses. Pour yourself a celebratory beverage.\nThe Seattle Mariners have the best record in baseball, in 2019, and this is not fake news.\nHow do we go from expecting next to nothing from a ballclub to witnessing such success, albeit at a young phase of the 162-game, almost seven-month-long baseball season? Are they outperforming everyone\u2019s low expectations just to prove them wrong, or is this just an early-season blip? These are the kind of big questions that are not entirely answerable. For now, let\u2019s just enjoy what\u2019s happening.\nAt the time of this writing, the Mariners lead the American League in these statistical categories: batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, home runs, runs, walks and stolen bases.\nThey\u2019ve already broken club and MLB records for the most home runs hit in the fewest number of games. They are proud owners of the best run differential in baseball, thank you very much. The only other team that comes close is the Dodgers. Sounds like good company to keep, as the Dodgers are considered one of the better teams in the sport. The Mariners currently have 110 runs, about eight a game. When you put up those kinds of numbers, you\u2019re going to win an awful lot of games.\nThe regular season began with the Mariners traveling overseas for only the second time in club history. They played a two-game series in Tokyo against Oakland. Not only did they win both games, which no one expected, but they had a stirring retirement tribute to Ichiro, who was able to end his illustrious career on native soil. From there, Seattle returned Stateside and slipped back into the preseason. They stashed a couple of non-consequential losses where no one would find them. For the first regular-season home series, the Mariners hosted the Boston Red Sox, the defending World Series champions. Not only did Seattle not get clobbered, but the Mariners won three out of four, proving that Tokyo was no fluke. They followed this with a couple of wins over Mike Trout\u2019s Angels, a team that many expect to compete for all the marbles at season\u2019s end.\nIn terms of individual contributions, there are numerous notable successes on both sides of the ball. On offense, some standouts are shortstop Tim Beckham, who currently leads the team with a batting average of .400, which puts him right near the top of the American League. He also, not surprisingly, leads the team with an on-base percentage of .489. Right fielder Domingo Santana is leading the team with 19 each RBIs and hits. Pitcher Marco Gonzales already has four wins and an ERA of 3.16.\nThis week the Mariners have been beating up on the cellar-dweller Royals, which is what you expect good teams to do \u2014 beat bad teams. This weekend the Mariners have a good team on their schedule, the division-rival Houston Astros. Houston will be out for blood, trailing the Mariners in first place by 3.5 games. Beat up on Seattle all weekend and they could flip that script. But I\u2019m sure few expect that to happen the way the Mariners are playing.\nIf you\u2019re not ready for a cold shower, you might want to stop reading now.\nThe reality is that the weather hasn\u2019t even warmed up yet. Casual fans may not even realize that the season is underway. The Mariners have the best record and many of the best stats in baseball, but they haven\u2019t even played 10 percent of their games. When you recall that the Mariners have the longest playoff drought in major professional sports, some 18 years, you realize that it is a little premature to anoint this team as champions.\nOK, a lot premature. As with weather in the Northwest, just because you get a week of sunshine doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not going to revert back to rain.\nSo where does that leave us fans? How exactly should we feel? As with many things in life, we have choices about how we choose to react to various events that come before us.\nOne option is to build a steel fortress around your heart. Whenever you hear about the Mariners continuing to win, tell yourself that it\u2019s only a matter of time before things start to deteriorate. Wait till the end of the season and then see where things sit. If and when things do go downhill, tell yourself that you were right not to get too excited, too early.\nAnother option, the one I propose, is of the life is short variety. Imagine what a great summer 2019 might be if the Mariners are in the hunt for meaningful, postseason things. Picture yourself sitting on a stoop with a transistor radio nearby. Or maybe a hammock is more your thing. Better yet, envision a trip or three to the ballpark. Have you ever played hooky from school or work? It\u2019s really fun, but don\u2019t tell your boss or teacher I said that.\n-- Paul Redman is a freelance writer.

Smollett, 36, was indicted on 16 felony counts in early March for allegedly lying to police about the altercation - one count per alleged lie - but Cook County prosecutors dropped all criminal charges on March 26, citing his two days of community service and agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond to the city.\nMayor Rahm Emmanuel, a Democrat, joined other city officials in criticizing the prosecutors's decision, calling it \"a whitewash of justice.\" Two days later, the Department of Law sent Smollett a letter that threatened legal action if he didn't pay for the overtime costs within a week. It also noted that, if he were prosecuted, he could be fined up to three times the amount. Smollett refused to pay. He maintains his innocence and, as he said after his charges were dropped, holds that he \"would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I was accused of.\"\nThe city filed the lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court, stating that the Chicago Police Department \"expended significant resources\" looking into Smollett's claims. Police say more than 24 officers and detectives took part in the weekslong investigation, ultimately incurring 1,836 hours of overtime pay, costing $130,106. The city will also seek attorney fees and litigation costs, as well as a civil penalty of $1,000 for each of Smollett's alleged lies.\nRepresentatives for Smollett, who has been written out of the last two episodes of \u201cEmpire\u2019s\u201d current season, declined to comment on the city\u2019s lawsuit.\n", "label": "human"}

Using a process known as two-photon calcium imaging, scientists see bright spikes and flashes of light in the brain \u2013 nerve impulses firing off in response to stimulus. The process is incredibly slow, arduous and requires scientists to circle every single neuron, which lights up like a lightbulb. However, an incredible artificial intelligence algorithm tested by Duke University in North Carolina, US, has proven to be much more effective at the job.\nA Duke study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found the AI automated process is as accurate but considerably faster.

It needs to change.\u201d\nWhile the AKP claimed victory at a national level, analysts said the election results were an indication the party\u2019s veneer of invincibility is giving way. But for Mr. Erdo\u011fan, they said, who employed divisive and incendiary rhetoric at more than 100 rallies, the result represented a personal failure. Mr. Erdo\u011fan \u201cturned it into a referendum, he made a strategic error by marrying these elections to himself,\u201d says Henri Barkey, a Turkey expert at Lehigh University. \u201cHad he stayed on the sidelines the results might have been different.\u201d\nMunicipal elections on Sunday proved a watershed moment in Turkish politics, a major setback for President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). For the first time in a quarter century, the opposition seized control of both Turkey\u2019s political capital, Ankara, and \u2013 in a result now being challenged \u2013 its commercial center, Istanbul.\nWhen the Turkish electrician, a longtime supporter of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party, backed the opposition Sunday in Istanbul, his vote was cast without joy, and with little expectation of change.\nInstead, it contributed to a watershed moment in Turkish politics, a major setback for Mr. Erdo\u011fan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in municipal elections nationwide that the president had declared critical to Turkey\u2019s survival.\nFor the first time in a quarter century, the opposition seized control of both Turkey\u2019s political capital, Ankara, and \u2013 by the slimmest of margins, in a result now being challenged by the AKP \u2013 its commercial center, Istanbul, where Mr. Erdo\u011fan once was mayor.\nWhile the AKP claimed victory at a national level, analysts said the election results were the first indication the ruling party\u2019s veneer of invincibility is giving way, and that its days in power may be numbered. But for Mr. Erdo\u011fan, they said, who campaigned relentlessly with a schedule of more than 100 rallies, the result represented a personal failure.\nThe rallies were marked by divisive and incendiary rhetoric in which Mr. Erdo\u011fan labeled opponents as \u201cterrorists,\u201d threatened them with prosecution, and blamed \u201cenemies\u201d in the West for Turkey\u2019s economic malaise, giving the Istanbuli electrician every reason to vote against him.\nThe turn away from the AKP by this small shop owner, Yilmaz \u2013 who once actively campaigned for the Islamist-leaning party, but today refuses even to give his full name for fear of retribution \u2013 is emblematic of the broader disillusion with Mr. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s combative and authoritarian style as well as the tanking economy, as shown in the election results.\n\u201cOnce you call people traitors, people \u2013 even AK Party folks \u2013 get alienated,\u201d Yilmaz says on the day after the vote, as a toaster is brought in for repair.\n\u201cNow there\u2019s competition [that\u2019s] going to be good for everyone,\u201d says the electrician, who during the campaign told the Monitor he did not see enough prospects for his own future to get married and have children.\n\u201cThey antagonized everybody,\u201d adds Yilmaz, whose father and grandfather supported the AKP and its Islamist antecedent, Welfare. \u201cNow the AK Party is going to have to step back and regain its footing.

The opposition dealt Erdo\u011fan a symbolic blow by gaining ground in key cities, including the capital, Ankara, and Istanbul.\nDespite the headline-grabbing losses, the AKP remains the most popular political party in Turkey, winning, with its nationalist coalition ally, 51.6 percent of the vote overall. On top of that, Mr. Erdo\u011fan rules until 2023 with expanded executive powers that came into effect with a presidential vote last year.\nBut the Turkish economy entered recession in March, after years of exceptional growth since the AKP came to power in 2002. Among a host of economic concerns, the currency has lost one-third of its value in the past year, unemployment is high, and inflation hovers around 20 percent.\nMr. Erdo\u011fan \u201cturned it into a referendum, he made a strategic error by marrying these elections to himself,\u201d says Henri Barkey, a Turkey expert at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, adding that Turkish voters aren\u2019t buying the president\u2019s rhetoric anymore.\n\u201cHad he stayed on the sidelines the results might have been different. He wouldn\u2019t have galvanized the opposition so much,\u201d says Mr. Barkey. \u201cSo this is a slap at Erdo\u011fan. Erdo\u011fan is the big loser here.... People voted against him.\n\u201cAt this stage, his big worry is that people will see him as a diminished figure,\u201d says Mr. Barkey. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t expect him to mellow.\u201d The president and his party, he adds, have \u201cgone too far down this road of traitors and evil-doers and all this, to suddenly say, \u2018We are going to cooperate with them, we are going to accept this.\u2019 \u201d\nErdo\u011fan sees fault, not defeat\nIndeed, in a midnight speech addressing supporters on election night, Mr. Erdo\u011fan didn\u2019t accept defeat. He said instead that \u201cour nation\u201d had given the AKP the highest number of votes in the 15th election in a row, and that it would control 56 percent of Turkey\u2019s municipalities.\nBut Mr. Erdo\u011fan also struck a more humble tone when he admitted, without mentioning Istanbul or Ankara, that the \u201csole reason\u201d for any poor results was \u201cour having been unable to explain ourselves sufficiently to our people [and] having been unable to enter their hearts sufficiently.\u201d\nThat was despite addressing rallies in 59 provinces and 43 districts and on nine television programs, he noted, all of them promoted ubiquitously by pro-AKP media.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t seek out [fault] in our nation, we must seek it out in ourselves,\u201d said Mr. Erdo\u011fan. Starting the next morning, he vowed, \u201cwe will set to work identifying and addressing our shortcomings.\u201d\nAn adviser to the president, Saadet Oru\u00e7, was less sanguine. \u201cSometimes storms are a good thing,\u201d she was quoted as saying in the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper. \u201cYour boat is a bit worn out, rocking from side to side, but afterwards there is no scum on deck.\u201d\nBut that may not change the eventual historical verdict, that this election result marks the beginning of a transition away from Erdo\u011fan-AKP dominance, says Sinan \u00dclgen, a Turkey expert and former Turkish diplomat with Carnegie Europe.\n\u201cWith hindsight, we will read it as the first real sign of that decline, because fundamentally what needs to happen to stop this decline is for Turkey to generate a new positive narrative about itself, which would need to be led by an economic upturn,\u201d says Mr. \u00dclgen.\nThe current political context \u201cdoes not really give much optimism\u201d for such a turnaround, says Mr. \u00dclgen, and without regeneration \u201cit\u2019s going to be a downward trend for the ruling party.\u201d\nIstanbul\u2019s symbolism\nThe loss of Istanbul is especially symbolic for the AKP, since it was the place that Erdo\u011fan cut his political teeth, starting in 1994 as mayor, and where the AKP devised its program.\n\u201cThis will certainly appear as a weakening of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule, both internally and externally,\u201d adds Mr. \u00dclgen. That\u2019s because the opposition now control cities that generate some 70 percent of Turkey\u2019s GDP, and \u201cthat\u2019s where political and economic influence stems from.\u201d\nTurkey\u2019s pro-AKP media put a brave spin on the results, suggesting that winning 778 municipalities is a \u201crecord that will be hard to beat.\u201d\nOn the streets, there was still surprise \u2013 even from longtime supporters of the opposition.\n\u201cI thought the AKP was going to win again, clear and certain,\u201d says a tea shop owner named Fatih. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to win it back in the next election. Nothing\u2019s going to change; the vote was just a reaction.\u201d\nA customer arrives, orders a sandwich, and complains about the price. Fatih dismisses the complaint by listing the rising price of tomatoes and cheese.\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s all for the best for the country and the people; AKP will [be forced] to put itself in order,\u201d says Fatih.\nThe opposition are a minority, he says, but there are signs that this time the AKP knew it had been beaten.\n\u201cAfter every election, they [AKP supporters] come by and make fun of us\u201d for losing, says Fatih. \u201cToday there was none of that.

{"text": "Round two gets underway Tuesday in California's fight over how best to limit fatal shootings by police through nation-leading reforms.\nState legislators are debating a measure that proponents said would set a national precedent by creating statewide guidelines on when officers can use lethal force and requiring that every officer be trained in ways to avoid opening fire.\nBut opponents said the law-enforcement-backed bill doesn't go far enough because it would enshrine current rules that allow police to kill if they reasonably believe that they or others are in imminent danger. They are backing competing legislation sparked by last year's shooting of unarmed vandalism suspect Stephon Clark that would set the first statewide policy allowing police to kill only if they have exhausted non-lethal methods of resolution or de-escalation.\n\"As law enforcement officers, we know we can improve \u2013 we need to do everything in our power to minimize the use of force,\" Peace Officers Research Association of California President Brian Marvel said in a statement before his scheduled testimony at the Senate hearing. \"The country is watching. They are counting on California to lead.\"\nCalifornia Police Chiefs Association president Ron Lawrence said the bill incorporates best practices from around the country. Aside from the use-of-force policies and training, it would require that the policies be public and set standards for reporting uses of force. It requires officers to provide medical aid to injured suspects and to report and stop any excessive force they see used by other officers.\nThe training includes how to better respond to mental health crisis situations that Protect California President Robert Harris said account for nearly 25% of all fatal officer-involved shootings. Law enforcement groups formed the nonprofit to promote their alternative to changing the legal standard on using force.\nIllustrating the contentiousness of the debate, Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Marvel and California Association of Highway Patrolmen President Rick Labeske released a joint public letter Monday backing what they said is a \"sweeping reform to California's use of force policies.\"\nOpponents countered with two Capitol rallies backing the competing bill by Democratic Assemblywoman Shirley Weber of San Diego that would toughen the legal standard for using lethal force.\n\"It changes the status quo and that is always a hard thing to do against an institution like the police force,\" Ms. Weber said at one rally organized by the California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nThe bill carried by Democratic Sen.

{"text": "US President Donald Trump has warned the International Criminal Court (ICC) of \u201cswift and vigorous response\u201d if the Hague-based tribunal investigates Americans and Israelis for war crimes.\nTrump issued the warning on Friday, after ICC judges rejected a request by the court\u2019s prosecutor to probe atrocities committed by US forces in Afghanistan.\nTrump hailed the unusual ruling as a \u201cmajor international victory,\u201d claiming that the Americans and Israelis should be immune from ICC prosecution.\n\u201cSince the creation of the ICC, the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American national sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attempt to target American, Israeli, or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response,\u201d he added.\nAmnesty International denounced the ICC\u2019s decision as a \u201cshocking abandonment of victims\u201d that would \u201cweaken the court\u2019s already questionable credibility.\u201d\nBiraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International, stressed that the ruling would be seen as a \u201ccraven capitulation to Washington\u2019s bullying.\u201d\nLast month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the US would withdraw or revoke visas for ICC staff who prosecute American troops in Afghanistan, as well as their allied personnel, including Israelis.\nHe also warned about potential economic sanctions \u201cif the ICC does not change its course.\u201d\nUS National Security Adviser John Bolton had also threatened to revoke the visas of ICC personnel if the court pursued charges against members of the US military over crimes in Afghanistan.\nEarlier this month, the US revoked ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u2019s visa as part of a crackdown on the ICC.\nThe ICC has been examining abuses committed by all parties in the Afghan war for more than a decade.\nIn November 2017, Bensouda sought authorization to open an inquiry into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, including in states where the CIA held prisoners.\nThe ICC is also investigating Israeli atrocities in the West Bank and Gaza, including the demolition of Palestinian property and eviction of the Palestinians from the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds.\nNeither the US nor Israel are ICC members.\nThe United States has revoked the entry visa of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda, who is looking into the US military\u2019s possible war crimes in Afghanistan.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced, last month, that the United States would withdraw or deny visas for the ICC personnel probing the war crimes allegations against American forces.\nUnited Nations human rights experts denounced Washington\u2019s \u201cimproper interference\u201d in the work of the court, which has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression.\nThe US denial of visa to the ICC prosecutor also drew criticism from within the European Union.\n\u201cWe can confirm that the U.S. authorities have revoked the prosecutor\u2019s visa for entry into the US,\u201d Bensouda\u2019s office told the Reuters news agency in an e-mail, on Thursday.\nLast month, the US secretary of state also declared that Washington was ready to take additional steps, including economic sanctions, if the world body failed to change its course.\nThe United States has refused to cooperate with international investigators over their probe into possible war crimes of US military personnel in Afghanistan, claiming they violate US sovereignty.\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has previously rebuked and questioned the International Criminal Court. One of National Security Adviser John Bolton\u2019s first speeches was about the ICC, condemning its investigation into US personnel.\nThe US invaded Afghanistan, in October of 2001, and overthrew a Taliban regime in power at the time. But, US forces have remained bogged down, there, through the presidencies of George W. Bush, Barack Obama and, now, Donald Trump.\nObama announced, in 2013, that he was pulling out all US troops from the Arab country. However, the US troops returned to Iraq a year later, under the pretext of fighting the Daesh (ISIS) terrorist group.\nTrump had also pledged, during his election campaign, to end the US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, he has changed his mind, since entering office, and prolonged the US military presence in both countries.\nThe ICC has repeatedly highlighted alleged abuses of detainees, by American troops between 2003 and 2005, that it believes have not been adequately addressed by the US government.\nWashington insists that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over American citizens because the US never ratified the Rome Statute that established the court in the first place, PNN reports.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

{"text": "Accelerator chips that use light rather than electrons to carry out computations promise to supercharge AI model training and inference. In theory, they could process algorithms at the speed of light \u2014 dramatically faster than today\u2019s speediest logic-gate circuits \u2014 but so far, light\u2019s unpredictability has foiled most attempts to emulate transistors optically.\nBoston-based Lightelligence, though, claims it\u2019s achieved a measure of success with its optical AI chip, which today debuts in prototype form. It says that latency is improved up to 10,000 times compared with traditional hardware, and it estimates power consumption at \u201corders of magnitude\u201d lower.\nThe technology underpinning it has its origins in a 2017 paper coauthored by CEO Yichen Shen. Shen \u2014 then a Ph.D. student studying photonic materials at MIT under Marin Soljacic, a professor at MIT\u2019s Department of Physics who runs the school\u2019s photonics and modern electro-magnetics group \u2014 published research in the journal Nature Photonics describing a novel way to perform neural-network workloads using optical interference.\nLightelligence was founded months later, and Soljacic was one of the first to join its board of directors.\n\u201cA student like Yichen only comes through rarely in a Professor\u2019s career, even at MIT. Yichen is a real visionary and a pioneer in this field of using integrated optics for AI,\u201d said Soljacic.\nThe chip in question \u2014 which is about the size of a printed circuit board \u2014 packs photonic circuits similar to optical fibers that transmit signals. It requires only limited energy, because light produces less heat than the electricity, and is less susceptible to changes in ambient temperature, electromagnetic fields, and other noise. It\u2019s designed to slot into existing machines at the network edge, like on-premises servers, and will eventually ship with a software stack compatible with algorithms in commonly used frameworks like Google\u2019s Tensorflow, Facebook\u2019s Caffe2 and Pytorch, and others.\nLightelligence has so far demonstrated MNIST, a benchmark machine learning model that uses computer vision to recognize handwritten digits, on its accelerator. And it\u2019s recorded matrix-vector multiplications and other linear operations \u2014 key components of AI models \u2014 running roughly 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art electronic chips.\n\u201cWe are very pleased to reveal our working optical chip AI computing system,\u201d Shen said. \u201cOur prototype \u2026 is 100,000 times faster than the system demonstrated in our Nature Photonics paper and a fraction of the size. The system is a true testament to our team.\u201d\nTo date, Lightelligence has raised $10.7 million in venture financing and has over 20 employees, including a number of industry veterans hailing from Columbia, Georgia Tech, Peking University, and UC Berkeley. Headlining the roster is Dr. Gilbert Hendry, who\u2019s held various roles at Google and Microsoft, and Maurice Steinman, a former AMD senior fellow.\nLightelligence stands largely alone in the optical AI accelerator space, but it competes with Lightmatter, which has raised triple the amount of funding ($33 million) for its own chip. (Lightmatter\u2019s CEO Nicholas Harris, interestingly, was a coauthor on that Nature Photonics paper.)\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "sport, australian-rules-football, lucas mellier, thurgoona, knee injury\nLucas Mellier was resigned to the fact he had probably played his last match. The classy midfielder's career was at the crossroads after he copped a heavy bump against Mitta United almost a fortnight ago. Mellier hyper-extended his knee in the incident and initially thought he may have torn his ACL. Scans revealed he had fractured his shin just below the knee and torn his meniscus. \"I went to the doctor and he said he was going to pin the knee where the fracture was,\" Mellier said. \"I also required surgery on my meniscus. \"The doctor told me before the surgery that the best outcome would be to get me to a point where I could walk without any discomfort. \"But you probably won't be able to run or play sport. \"That shattered me when I heard that.\" MORE SPORTS NEWS Mellier arrived for surgery, hoping for the best and expecting the worst. \"I went in for the surgery and then when I was in recovery I realised I had only been in surgery for an hour and I I thought to myself 'geez I've been in surgery for an hour, what did they do?,' he said. \"When they went to operate, it wasn't as bad as they thought and I didn't require surgery to repair my meniscus. \"The ligaments on either side of my knee were buggered but there was still enough to hold my knee together. \"The ACL was a bit damaged but nothing that required surgery. \"They didn't even up pinning the fracture and decided to let it heal naturally. \"So I basically just had a clean out in the end.\" The diagnosis has given Mellier hope he can be back playing in late July and be fit enough for a finals campaign. \"I just have to stay off it for six weeks and be on crutches and once the fracture heals have physio to repair all the ligaments after that,\" he said. \"I still can't believe it. \"Hopefully I can get back about a month before finals, that would be ideal. \"That's the carrot for me but there is a fair bit to do before I can do that but that's my aim.\" The 35-year-old said he was keen to stay involved at Thurgoona as much as possible while he recovers. \"I want to be in the coaches box on match-days and be helping out where I can,\" he said. Teammate Luke Gerecke also injured his knee on the same day as Mellier and is still waiting on the results of scans to determine the extent of the damage.

Their current series, \u201cThe Silence of Spaces\u201d at ClampArt, was made at an unoccupied religious complex upstate. BJ, who is nonbinary, wears dresses in many of the photos; in others, nothing at all. Even though BJ does not identify as a man, Rivera said she has never had a problem displaying photos of BJ topless, whereas her own topless photos would get her kicked off Instagram.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of exploring the inherent shame related to women\u2019s bodies,\u201d Rivera says.\nAnother timely work is Rania Matar\u2019s \"A Girl and Her Room \u2014 50 photos\" from the Boston-based Robert Klein Gallery. The Lebanese-American photographer captured 50 different girls, including her teenage daughters and their friends, in both the U.S. and the Middle East, from 2009 to 2011, resulting in a mosaic of young women by turns posed or casual, bareheaded or wearing a hijab, embracing childhood or attempting maturity.\nDespite the rising profile of climate change, there are relatively few photos cataloging its effects, although it would be hard to top Stephen Wilkes\u2019 \u201cHurricane Sandy, Seaside Heights, New Jersey\u201d at the Monroe Gallery, which shows the Jet Star roller coaster in the ocean after the 2012 superstorm.\nOther notable large-scale works include those by German photographer Christian Voigt, who shoots with handmade Rodenstock lenses that allow a uniformity of focus across astoundingly large spaces. Two of his four photos here show dinosaur skeletons from European museums; and Alex Cesaria, co-founder of Unix Gallery, says that Voigt has been asked to shoot the local dinos at the American Museum of Natural History.\nNancy Richardson, at the Voltz Clarke Gallery, achieves her oversized art by overlaying scores of photos.

He said they had first looked at the traffic aspect and how could the zone be pedestrianised for the gardens. There will be adequate parking and with time there will even be underground parking. There will be four clearly designated entryway gates to the facility.\nMr Jilani said the Frere Hall library will be moved to the left side, to a much bigger space which will be a conditioned space. Its size will be doubled. Then there will be an amphitheatre, a souvenir shop and a cafe.\nA visitors\u2019 centre on the ground floor is also planned, which will serve as the first interface for the tourists to the city. The bandstand, along with the fountains, will be restored. There will be several features to the gardens at the centre of which will be Jinnah Square. Cars will not be allowed to enter the central space.\nAcknowledging a member of the board Ghazi Salahuddin\u2019s thoughts that the hall was once associated with the city\u2019s intelligentsia and public where book fairs happened, where people got together for exchange of ideas, Mr Jilani said stalls will be put together keeping all those things in mind.\nTalking about the efforts related to the restoration of the building, the architect said his team was working alongside NED University\u2019s Dr Noman Ahmed and Anila Naeem. The cleaning of the stones, the restoration of the roof drainage system and replacement of missing elements are some of the key aspects of the restoration process. All of that may require two years to complete.\nEarlier chairman of the board Shahid Firoz spoke about members of his team and underlined the historic significance of Frere Hall. He said it was built in 1863 and inaugurated two years later as the city\u2019s first town hall. He pointed out that this enclave has survived the apathy and helplessness of successive administrations. He thanked the Mayor of Karachi Wasim Akhtar for his role in the whole project. He added when they first took the idea to the mayor he was a bit reticent about it thinking it was too bold but then they were able to convince him and an agreement was signed between the KMC and the board.\nArchitect Shahid Abdulla, who stood alongside Mr Jilani when he was giving the presentation, informed the audience on how they could help raise funds for the project.\nJameel Yusuf delivered the vote of thanks in an impassioned manner. He floated the suggestion to Commissioner of Karachi Iftikhar Shallwani that instead of calling Karachi the city of lights let\u2019s call it the city of love and care.\nAyesha Tammy Haq conducted the event.

{"text": "Federal prosecutors on Thursday asked for another extension to return an indictment against Ald. Edward Burke in the bombshell corruption case alleging the powerful Chicago alderman used his City Hall clout to steer business to his private law firm.\nThe request was the second delay sought by prosecutors since Burke was charged in a criminal complaint Jan. 2 with attempting to shake down two businessmen seeking to renovate a Burger King restaurant in his ward.\n\"The government is conducting a diligent and thorough investigation into this case, but certain factors have led to this request for an extension,\" Assistant U.S. Attorneys Amarjeet Bhachu and Sarah Streicker wrote in the four-page motion. \"These factors include the complex nature of this public corruption case, and the fact that the investigation is ongoing.\"\nIf the motion is granted by U.S. District Chief Judge Ruben Castillo as expected, the new deadline for prosecutors to seek an indictment from a grand jury would be June 7.\nIt\u2019s typical for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office to seek delays in bringing an indictment, particularly in political corruption cases. An indictment essentially starts the legal clock ticking toward a potential trial. In the meantime, court proceedings in Burke\u2019s criminal case are essentially on hold.\nThe request for an extension comes two weeks after prosecutors brought a separate indictment against real estate developer Charles Cui on charges he hired Burke\u2019s law firm in exchange for the alderman\u2019s help with a sign permit and financing deal for a Portage Park project.\nBurke, 75, who for decades has had his hands on many of the city's levers of power, was charged with one count of attempted extortion stemming from the alleged shakedown of the Burger King businessmen.\nA wiretap on Burke's cellphone allegedly captured Burke leaning on the Texas-based executives to hire his private law firm in exchange for help with permits needed to renovate the restaurant, according to the 37-page complaint.\nWhen the businessmen didn't seem to be cooperating, Burke plotted with a ward staffer on how to play \"hardball,\" holding up permits and sending a city worker to the site to harass them with unwarranted citations, according to the charges.\nAt least 9,475 wiretapped calls were made or received on Burke's phone over at least an eight-month period, according to the charges.\nThe complaint also alleges that Burke pressured one of the company's executives in December 2017 to contribute to the campaign of an unnamed local politician.

{"text": "Jamaicans would have their electricity bills slashed by as much as 18 per cent if the company were to eliminate power theft, president and chief executive officer of the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS), Emanuel DaRosa, has revealed.\nThe light and power company suffers about J$9 billion in losses to electricity thieves annually and spent US$27 million, or J$3.5 billion, last year in fighting abstraction, including the rollout of 100,000 smart meters.\nDaRosa has listed this as one of the priorities under its capital projects for this year.\n\u201cIn terms of electricity theft, just the cost alone to fuel electricity that is stolen from our system is US$70 million, and if all customers were to pay for electricity consumed it would be about US$120 million incremental revenue, which would decrease the cost of electricity to everyone in the system by somewhere between 15 to 18 per cent, so it is substantial,\u201d he revealed during a Gleaner Editors\u2019 Forum on Thursday at the newspaper\u2019s North Street head office.\nDaRosa, who joined the JPS team 18 months ago, said that he was taken aback by the heights of electricity theft in Jamaica when he relocated to the island from Canada.\n\u201cIt was a little bit shocking because it is much higher levels than it is in Canada. We estimate that electricity theft represents about two to three per cent of energy in total, and here we are seeing it at 18 per cent,\u201d he said.\nDaRosa said he does not expect to eradicate electricity theft in Jamaica but acknowledged that the incidence of two to three per cent, common in First-World nations, would be tolerable.\n\u201cIt is a different country, it is a different place, and so there are different challenges, and this is just a challenge that exists here that we are going to work towards correcting and addressing as best as we can,\u201d he said.\nAccording to data provided by JPS, five parishes \u2013 Kingston and St Andrew, St Catherine, Clarendon and St James \u2013 contribute to 72 per cent electricity theft.\n\u201cJPS does not have the capacity to address this issue.

{"text": "LONDON (CN) \u2013 The United Kingdom Supreme Court heard arguments this past week in a marine insurance case which could significantly affect insurers and ship owners.\nThe issues in the case began when a ship suffered an engine room fire during a voyage, after which money was spent on salvage operations. In the months that followed, quotes for the cost of full repair were obtained, ranging from around $3 million to $9 million.\nEventually, the ship owners decided inform the insurers they were abandoning the ship, believing the cost of repair would exceed the value of the ship and was therefore a constructive total loss.\nClaiming a constructive total loss meant the ship owners could receive a payout for the full insured value of the ship, in this case $12 million. But the insurers claim the ship owners are only entitled to just over $1.4 million, which was the reduction in the vessel\u2019s value as a result of the fire.\nBoth a trial court and an appellate court found in favor of the ship owners, prompting an appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court. One key issue for the court to consider is whether the costs incurred in salvaging and repairing the ship before the notice of abandonment was given should be included in the calculation of a constructive total loss.\nThe basic criterion for a constructive total loss is if the cost of repairing the ship exceeds the value of the ship. If costs incurred before the notice was given are included in this criterion, then the ship is a constructive total loss as the ship owners claim. If not, the ship is only a partial loss as the insurers say.\nAttorney Michael Ashcroft, representing the insurers, argued the question is \u201cwhether the hypothetical prudent owner would, if uninsured, have gone to the future expense of repairing the vessel.\u201d He emphasized only future expenses are considered in this question and therefore expenses which were incurred before the notice of abandonment was given are irrelevant.\nSenior Judge Lord Sumption challenged Ashcroft\u2019s argument, saying \u201cthe prudent uninsured owner test is concerned with the reasonableness of incurring expenditure. Therefore, although you ask the question at the time of the notice of abandonment, the question that you ask is whether it was reasonable to incur the expenditure at the time it was incurred.\u201d\nLord Sumption suggested that although the question of costs arises when notice is given, this does not necessarily preclude the consideration of costs incurred before that point.\nAshcroft, with the firm Thomas Cooper LLP, further argued that since the wording of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 mentions that account should be taken of future expense when considering a constructive total loss, this supports his contention that only future expenses should be taken into account. He described the test for constructive total loss as \u201cforward looking\u201d only.\nAshcroft also suggested that if ship owners want to include all costs in the calculation of a constructive total loss, they should give a notice of abandonment immediately after a ship is damaged so that any costs incurred in salvaging and repairing the ship will be in the future and thereby included in the calculation of constructive total loss.\nThe ship owner\u2019s attorney Steven Berry called the \u2018forward looking\u2019 argument fallacious. He stated there should be no limitation put on the cost of recovery and repair which is considered in the calculation of constructive total loss.\nHe cited the Marine Insurance Act and stated \u201cthe question is whether she is so damaged that the cost of repairing would exceed the value of the ship when repaired. It is as simple as that.\u201d\nIn his view it was clear from the act that all costs of repair should be taken into account, regardless of when they are incurred.\n\u201cA brave counsel would now sit down,\u201d Berry joked before continuing.\nIn response to Ashcroft\u2019s suggestion that ship owners should give notice of abandonment as soon as a casualty occurs, Berry pointed out the Marine Insurance Act requires a valid notice of abandonment to be given only after reliable information of the loss has been obtained.\nHe added it would be unreasonable to force a ship owner to spend money to obtain reliable information so that a valid notice can be given and then not allow the money spent be counted toward the calculation of a constructive total loss.\nSumption and Lord Reed probed Berry with questions throughout as the justices considered the arguments.\nChristian Gaddes reports for Courthouse News Service from London.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Tampa Bay Lightning entered the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs as the heavy favorite to win it all.\nNow the NHL\u2019s best team from the 2018-19 regular season is one loss away from exiting the postseason without a single win.\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets\u2019 3-1 victory in Game 3 of the teams\u2019 first-round series on Sunday at Nationwide Arena in Columbus put the Lightning in an unthinkable 3-0 hole, and the team that finished with 128 points in the regular season is on the verge of disaster.\nIf the Lightning did get knocked out in the first round, albeit against a Blue Jackets team far better than a typical eighth seed, where would it rank against some of the biggest postseason collapses and disappointments of the salary cap era that started in 2005-06? Here\u2019s a look at the other biggest collapses.\n5. Chicago Blackhawks (2017)\nGiven the Blackhawks\u2019 decline in the two years following the 2017 first-round defeat to the Nashville Predators, the result doesn\u2019t look as shocking. But at the time, it was. The eighth-seeded Predators swept the Western Conference\u2019s top regular-season team and one the decade\u2019s top NHL powers, giving up just three goals in the process.\n4. Red Wings (2006)\nIn the salary cap era, the Red Wings had one of the best regular-season teams prior to the Lightning, posting 124 points in 2005-06, the first season following the lockout. Still in the Western Conference at the time, the Red Wings ended up losing their first-round playoff series to the Edmonton Oilers in six games.\n3. Boston Bruins (2010), San Jose Sharks (2014)\nThese two teams weren\u2019t historically great or heavy favorites, but they both collapsed within a series after taking a 3-0 lead. The Bruins let the Flyers win the final four games of their 2010 Eastern Conference semifinal series, and to add insult to injury, they blew a 3-0 lead in Game 7, losing 4-3 at home.\nThe Sharks, after rolling past the Los Angeles Kings in two home games and one OT road win to open their 2014 first-round series, dropped the final four, including Game 7 at home. The Flyers lost in the Stanley Cup Final to the Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, while the Kings went on to win the Cup in 2014.\nIf the Lightning do rally from their hole, the Blue Jackets would have the misfortune of joining this group.\nProjecting Devils\u2019 2019-20 opening-night roster: Can Ty Smith, Jesper Boqvist and 2019 No. 1 pick make team? Projecting the New Jersey Devils' 2019-20 opening-night roster, which could include Jack Hughes or Kaapo Kakko.\n2. Washington Capitals (2010)\nBefore the Capitals finally claimed the Cup in 2018, they experienced their share of playoff disappointments and shortcomings. There are a few that could qualify for this list, but 2010 takes the cake. They won the Presidents\u2019 Trophy with 121 points, but bowed out in the first round of the postseason, losing in seven games to the Montreal Canadiens. That disappointing ending also featured an in-series collapse, with the Capitals losing the final three games after going up 3-1.\n1. Tampa Bay Lightning (2019)\nNo Presidents\u2019 Trophy winner has ever been swept in the first round of the playoffs. And this isn\u2019t a typical Presidents\u2019 Trophy winning-team, if there is such a thing. When the Lightning clinched the league\u2019s best record, just two other teams had even clinched playoff spots. They tied the all-time record with 62 wins and flirted with the all-time record for most points by a team in the regular season, falling four points short of the 132 set by the Canadiens in 1976-77.\nThe series isn\u2019t over yet, and if any team is capable of stringing together four straight wins, it\u2019s this Tampa Bay squad. But the Blue Jackets have been the dominant team for all three games, outside the opening 20 minutes of Game 1. In order to avoid being historically remembered for all the wrong reasons, the Lightning need to add another historic achievement to their resume: climbing out of a 3-0 series hole.\nChris Ryan may be reached at cryan@njadvancemedia.com.

{"text": "HOUSTON -- Astronaut Jeanette Epps, a Syracuse native, was guiding two astronauts at the International Space Station through a spacewalk from NASA\u2019s mission control in Houston when there was a problem, according to a report.\nA panel on the space station would not open, so Epps suggested using a pry bar, Space.com reported. Her suggestion worked, and despite the stubborn panel the spacewalking mission was successfully completed.\nEpps, a Corcoran High School and Le Moyne College graduate, was supposed to go to the International Space Station as part of the Expedition 56/57 crew. She would have been the first African-American to live at the station. Fourteen African-Americans have gone to space and several have visited the station without staying. Epps was supposed to live there for about six months in 2018.\nEpps, an aerospace engineer and former CIA analyst, joined the astronaut corps in 2009. NASA announced in January 2018 that Epps was removed from the crew, sparking speculation about why. NASA did not give a reason for her removal.\nWhen she was pulled from the mission, Epps said everyone thought it was for health reasons, but that wasn\u2019t the case, she said in October 2018. Regardless of why, Epps said \u201cit was really a bad thing that happened.\u201d\nOn Monday, Epps was in Houston guiding two spacewalking astronauts step-by-step through a mission to complete several repairs and upgrade tasks on the space station when Internet cable work caused some problems, Space.com reported.\nNASA astronaut Anne McClain and Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques had to remove a micrometeroid orbital debris shield to access some cabling to upgrade connectivity for experiments on the space station, the website reported. One of the fasteners on the shield refused to loosen and eventually Epps suggested that Saint-Jacques grab a pry bar. He carefully inserted it under the panel, verifying first that he was in the right position before pushing.\n\u201cI feel some movement,\u201d Saint-Jacques told Space.com. The two astronauts carefully jimmied the pry bar back and forth underneath the shield, eventually pulling the panel loose. \u201cGot it\u201d Saint-Jacques said. He and McClain exchanged a quick high-five before finishing the installation.\nThe panel, unfortunately, then refused to go back in, forcing the astronauts to remove and reinstall a nearby handlebar to squeeze the panel into position.

Lately, their ranks have been growing by the week.\nDavid Hawkins, executive director for educational content and policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said he expects more colleges will explore going test-optional.\nTrump Celebrates Mueller Report as Democrats Plan Next Step\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russia collusion today, but Democrats say this story isn't over and are already talking about their next step. The report, which totals over 400 pages, neither condemns nor exonerates the president. (Published 2 hours ago)\n\"In the long term, the conversation \u2014 even without the bribery scandal of a couple of weeks ago \u2014 the conversation about access to higher education has been simmering for a long time, and is starting to take shape in a way that we really are examining every aspect of the admission process to understand fully how it either promotes or inhibits access,\" Hawkins said.\nThe ringleader, admissions consultant Rick Singer, was among 50 people charged in the scheme that involved bribes paid to test administrators and college coaches. Perfectly legal, however, are $1,000-an-hour tutors and coaches hired to guide affluent students through the admissions maze, including rigorous test preparation.\nIn California, lawmakers disgusted with the fraud have proposed a series of reforms to prevent a repeat, including a discussion of whether it's time to phase out the tests at public colleges statewide.\nDavid Coleman, the chief executive of the College Board, which administers the SAT, said he agrees that commercial prep classes have corrupted the test. But he said the solution is not to do away with the tests, which he sees as complementing a student's high school grades and as a check on grade inflation, which also tends to benefit wealthy students.\n\"We've got to admit the truth, that wealth inequality has progressed to such a degree that it isn't fair to look at test scores alone,\" Coleman said, \"That you must look at them in context of the adversity students face.\"\nTo that end, College Board has begun piloting an \"Environmental Context Dashboard\" to measure SAT scores in relation to the student's neighborhood and school. In its pilot phase, the dashboard helped Florida State University admit about 400 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2014 which are more likely to be students of color \u2014 in 2018, said John Barnhill, the university's associate vice president for enrollment management.\n\"It takes the emphasis away from getting the highest score you can get to,\" Barnhill said. He added it's more about, \"How did you do where you are?\"\nBut despite a growing number of schools moving away from standardized tests, most U.S. colleges still require them just as much as a high school transcript and application fee. Last year, about 2.1 million students took the SAT, and about 1.9 million took the ACT.\nAt the University of San Francisco, which announced a shift in its standardized test policy last week, administrators said SAT and ACT scores are more reflective of a student's economic background than their academic abilities.\nDePauw University, the University of Minnesota Crookston, University of Denver and Bucknell University are among others to say recently they won't ask for the results, joining roughly 1,000 other schools, according to the nonprofit group FairTest, which argues standardized tests are biased against minority groups. The list includes elite liberal arts colleges as well as research universities and for-profit schools. Those caught up in the scheme require scores.\nTechnology is letting institutions that may have once relied heavily on them to consider other measures, said Dan King, president of the American Association of University Administrators.\n\"Now a college can look very quickly at the high school. What do we know about this high school, about students who come from here? What do we know about students who come with four units of English and three units of science and students who took chemistry? We can plug all of those into formuli, which give us a lot of information that we just didn't have before,\" he said.\nDoctors Discover 'Bubble Boy' Breakthrough\nA gene therapy developed at St. Jude's Children's Hospital has cured 10 infants born with a rare genetic disease called SCID-X1, also known as \"Bubble Boy Disease,\" which is named for the way kids have to be protected from germs.

Female, underrepresented and low-income applicants chose not to submit scores at higher rates than male applicants. Black students were about twice as likely to exclude scores as white students.\nPhilip Sheppard, 20, from Houston, knew his SAT scores weren't great when he applied for Hilbert College just outside of Buffalo, New York.

The billboards, one at 729 Seventh Ave. and another at 3 Times Square, will run four times an hour for the next two weeks.\nMarch For Our Lives co-founder and communications strategist Brendan Duff, 21, said the organization aims to broaden its message while encouraging people to become part of the solution.\n\"The overall message, the thing you\u2019re going to see the most is \u2018Save Lives\u2019 and that is a narrative that we\u2019ve synced up with since the very beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political issue; we\u2019re not in this for any other motivation other than saving lives and doing what we can to stop what happened in our community from happening in other communities.\u201d\nThe digital billboards rotate with such messaging as \u201cI saw my brother get shot; I saw my classmate get shot; I saw my teacher get shot,\u201d along with a number that people can text to receive more information on how to get involved with March For Our Lives.\nDuff said they chose Times Square because it's a high-traffic area filled with people from all over the country and the world. The billboards are expected to reach 380,000 people a day and about 5 million people by the end of the campaign. The group hopes the billboards will remind the public that gun violence can happen to anyone.\n\u201cThere are people every single day who are at stake and the longer that we wait to address this issue, the more and more people we\u2019re going to lose,\u201d Duff added. \"We need to come together, with just the interest of saving lives.\"\nThose who text the March For Our Lives number can expect to receive information on how they can get involved in the fight against gun violence, including resources on how to start a March For Our Lives chapter or how to find an existing chapter nearby.

His younger brother, Daniel, is a survivor of the Parkland shooting that claimed the lives of 14 students and three staff members on Feb. 14, 2018. Daniel was a freshman at the time, with five out of his six classes in the building where most of the shooting took place.\n\u201cI started thinking this is really, really scary and horrifying but there\u2019s no way \u2014 that\u2019s my little brother \u2014 there\u2019s no way this is actually happening,\u201d Duff recalled of the tragic day.\nDuff was attending Elon University in North Carolina, where he is currently a junior studying strategic communications, when he heard there was a mass shooting at his alma mater. He said he texted his brother, hoping to find out he was OK.\n\u201cThere was a solid 25 to 30 minutes where I did not hear back from Daniel,\u201d he said. \u201cThat period of not knowing and that period of thinking, \u2018OK well this is a reality for so many people, it could also be my reality,\u2019 really drove me and still motivates me to do this work every single day.\u2019 \"\n", "label": "human"}

Here are some of the top takeaways that people should know about this emerging issue.\nNo Single Preferred Kind of Attack\nCyber attacks would be easy to conquer if the criminals behind them tended to engage in one particular attack most often. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case in the financial sector. A couple of things are clear, though: Financial industry attacks are going up and becoming more advanced.\nCarbon Black and Optiv teamed up to release a report that specifically looked at cyber attacks in finance. The document became available in March 2019, and 67 percent of the financial services companies surveyed for it reported an increase in those incidents over the past year. Moreover, 79 percent of the respondents said the cyber attacks have gotten more sophisticated.\nAdditionally, the findings showed a substantial variety in the kinds of attacks the criminals decided to carry out. Of the 79 percent that mentioned more sophisticated attacks, many noted that criminals showed a preference for social engineering or other kinds of attacks that exploited people or processes.\nThen, 47 showed an uptick in wire transfer fraud, while there was a 32 percent rise in \u201cisland hopping.\u201d This happens when criminals commandeer supply chains and partners to target the primary institution.\nThe researchers covered home equity loan fraud in the report, indicating it had risen by 31 percent. For those instances, cybercriminals would either target consumers with home equity loans through spear phishing attacks or set their sights on the organizational level by looking for weak points.\nDestructive Attacks Soar\nAn even more worrisome trend is that 26 percent of the financial institutions in the survey reported an increase in destructive attacks in the past year.\nIn those instances, the perpetrators usually don\u2019t want financial gain but instead seek to punish the financial institutions by destroying their data. The 26 percent statistic may seem small, but it represents a 160 percent increase compared to 2018 data.\nThe Problem Is an Ongoing and Global One\nNTT Security published a different report about worldwide cybersecurity threats in 2019, similarly concluding that cybercriminals increasingly target the finance industry. It showed that they attacked financial brands 17 percent of the time during the last year \u2014 tying with the tech sector \u2014 and noted that the financial sector had been the most frequently attacked over the last six years.\nThe research also concluded that, for all global hostile threats, 46 percent of the issues were web-based attacks and 28 percent were service-specific attacks. Although the report did not go into specifics to say where the financial-related incidents usually originated, it clarified that, across all sectors, the cyber threats most often came from the United States and China.\nWhen the report took a region-specific look at attacks in the financial sector, there were some interesting differences. Firstly, in the Americas, financial breaches accounted for 16 percent of attacks in 2018, down from 43 percent in 2017, to indicate a substantial improvement.\nOn the other hand, attacks on financial brands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) nearly doubled between 2017 and 2018, with that region seeing attacks in the financial sector 22 percent of the time in 2017 and 43 percent a year later.\nHow Can Financial Brands Get Prepared and Fight Back?\nAnalysis within the NTT Security research paper asserts that when cybercriminals attack the finance sector, they tend to move away from attacking particular applications and instead look for ways to disrupt operations in widespread ways. As such, the organization believes there could be attacks that affect critical parts of a nation\u2019s infrastructure.\nIf the electrical grid were to be compromised by hackers, banks couldn\u2019t keep operating for very long. Statistics show that the cost of downtime for financial brands with online brokerages is $6.48 million per hour. Banks can prepare for electrical outages that compromise their data center operations by securing emergency fuel supplies.\nExperts also say it\u2019s helpful for financial institutions to team up and share ideas to safeguard themselves from cyberattacks. Some of them point out that newer financial brands have the advantage of more modern systems, meaning they don\u2019t need to upgrade legacy equipment. However, those younger entities may focus on scaling up first and treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. Soliciting advice from the broader industry could aid preparations.\nFinance brands are investing more in artificial intelligence, too. Some of the solutions they choose that use the technology are customer-facing, such as those with recognition capabilities that let people show documents and set up new accounts without visiting branches. But AI can also assist with fraud prevention and stopping cybersecurity breaches.\nIn Canada, the head of the nation\u2019s cybersecurity organization specifically appealed to bankers to work with the agency as part of an aim to show hackers that Canada is not an appealing target for their orchestrated attempts. Other collaborations between financial institutions and national cybersecurity branches could stimulate more progress than banks might achieve without help.\nA Pressing Problem\nThe research shows that financial brands cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to cyber attacks.\nThey\u2019re becoming more frequent and diverse. Financial institutions need to adopt the mindset of \u201cnot if, but when\u201d as they get equipped to prevent and minimize the damage from cyber attacks.\n", "label": "human"}

Top Red Cross official Emanuele Capobianco said Friday April 12, 2019, that he's \"more concerned than I have ever been\" about the possible regional spread of the Ebola virus in Congo after a recent spike in cases. (AP Photo/Al-hadji Kudra Maliro, File)\nGENEVA -- The ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo does not yet warrant declaring a global emergency but is of \"deep concern,\" the World Health Organization said Friday.\nAfter a meeting of its expert committee, the U.N. health agency called for redoubled efforts to stop the deadly virus, noting that the recent spike in Ebola cases raises the risk of spread to other countries.\nThe outbreak announced on Aug. 1 has become the second-deadliest in history, behind the West African one from 2014-16 that killed more than 11,300 people. Congo's Health Ministry on Thursday reported 1,206 confirmed and probable cases, including 764 deaths.\nThis is the second time the expert committee has decided this outbreak is not yet a global emergency. Committee chairman Robert Steffen called Friday's decision unanimous and said the experts had feared making the declaration might even hurt response efforts. He did not give details but said experts were \"moderately optimistic\" the outbreak could be contained within a \"foreseeable time.\"\nAhead of the WHO announcement, a top Red Cross official said he was \"more concerned than I have ever been\" about Ebola's possible regional spread.\nEmanuele Capobianco, head of health and care at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, cited Congolese Health Ministry data showing 40 new cases over two days this week. He called that rate unprecedented in this outbreak.\nTo be designated a public health emergency of international concern, a situation must be \"serious, unusual or unexpected,\" threaten to infect other countries and require \"immediate international action.\"\nEmergency declarations almost always boost global attention and donor funding. WHO has noted it is woefully short of the $148 million it says is needed to fight Ebola for the next six months. To date, the agency has only received $74 million.\nThis outbreak, occurring close to the borders of Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, has been like no other. Mistrust has been high in a region that had never faced an Ebola outbreak before, and insecurity caused by rebel groups has hurt aid efforts.\nRebecca Katz, a global health security expert at Georgetown University, in a statement called WHO's decision disappointing, saying the U.N. agency and its experts were \"taking too narrow of an interpretation\" of what constitutes an international emergency. She called the difficulty of coordinating the response \"deeply concerning.\"\nA Section on 04/13/2019\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "AP-EU-France-Notre-Dame-Fire\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 A catastrophic fire engulfed the upper reaches of Paris' soaring Notre Dame Cathedral as it was undergoing renovations Monday, threatening one of the greatest architectural treasures of the Western world as tourists and Parisians looked on aghast from the streets below.\nThe blaze collapsed the cathedral's spire and spread to one of its landmark rectangular towers, but Paris fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the church's structure had been saved after firefighters managed to stop the fire spreading to the northern belfry. The 12th-century cathedral is home to incalculable works of art and is one of the world's most famous tourist attractions, immortalized by Victor Hugo's 1831 novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\"\nThe exact cause of the blaze was not known, but French media quoted the Paris fire brigade as saying the fire is \"potentially linked\" to a 6 million-euro ($6.8 million) renovation project on the church's spire and its 250 tons of lead. The Paris prosecutors' office ruled out arson and possible terror-related motives, and said it was treating it as an accident.\nFlames shot out of the roof behind the nave of the cathedral, among the most visited landmarks in the world. Hundreds of people lined up bridges around the island that houses the church, watching in shock as acrid smoke rose in plumes. Speaking alongside junior Interior minister Laurent Nunez late Monday, police chief Jean-Claude Gallet said \"two thirds of the roofing has been ravaged.\" Gallet said firefighters would keep working overnight to cool down the building.\nLate Monday, signs pointed to the fire nearing an end as lights could be seen through the windows moving around the front of the cathedral, apparently investigators inspecting the scene.\nThe fire came less than a week before Easter amid Holy Week commemorations. As the cathedral burned, Parisians gathered to pray and sing hymns outside the church of Saint Julien Les Pauvres across the river from Notre Dame while the flames lit the sky behind them.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was treating the fire as a national emergency, rushing to the scene and straight into meetings at the Paris police headquarters nearby. Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit invited priests across France to ring church bells in a call for prayers for the beloved Paris cathedral.\nDeputy mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said emergency services were trying to salvage the famed art pieces stored in the cathedral.\nBuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries, Notre Dame is the most famous of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages as well as one of the most beloved structures in the world. Situated on the Ile de la Cite, an island in the Seine river, its architecture is famous for, among other things, its many gargoyles and its iconic flying buttresses.\nAmong the most celebrated artworks inside are its three stained-glass rose windows, placed high up on the west, north and south faces of the cathedral. Its priceless treasures also include a Catholic relic, the crown of thorns, which is only occasionally displayed, including on Fridays during Lent.\nFrench historian Camille Pascal told BFM broadcast channel the blaze marked \"the destruction of invaluable heritage.\"\n\"It's been 800 years that the Cathedral watches over Paris\", Pascal said. \"Happy and unfortunate events for centuries have been marked by the bells of Notre Dame.\"\nHe added: \"We can be only horrified by what we see.\"\nAssociated Press reporters at the scene saw massive plumes of yellow brown smoke filling the air above the Cathedral and ash falling on the island that houses Notre Dame and marks the center of Paris. As the spire fell, the sky lit up orange.\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo said in a Twitter message that Paris firefighters were still trying to limit the fire and urged Paris citizens to respect the security perimeter that has been set around the cathedral.\nHidalgo said Paris authorities are in touch with the Paris diocese.\nReactions from around the world came swiftly including from the Vatican, which released a statement expressing shock and sadness for the \"terrible fire that has devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame, symbol of Christianity in France and in the world.\"\nIn Washington, Trump tweeted: \"So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris\" and suggested first responders use \"flying water tankers\" to put it out.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said he was praying \"to ask the intercession of Notre Dame, our Lady, for the Cathedral at the heart of Paris, and of civilization, now in flames!

{"text": "Pro EU protestor banners are fixed on a fence opposite the Houses of Parliament in London, Monday, April 8, 2019. Britain's government and opposition party are hoping to find a compromise Brexit deal ahead of further talks with European Union leaders.\nPrime Minister Theresa May wooed domestic political opponents and European leaders Monday as she sought to break Britain's Brexit impasse and secure a delay to the country's departure from the European Union.\nMay's Conservative government and the main opposition Labour Party were clinging to hope of finding a compromise Brexit deal, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant an extension to the U.K.'s departure from the bloc. If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the Brexit deadline previously set by the EU.\nMay has asked for a new delay until June 30, to give Britain's divided politicians time to agree, approve and implement a withdrawal agreement. The bloc's leaders are due to meet Wednesday in Brussels to consider the request.\nAn extension requires unanimous approval from all 27 EU national leaders, some of whom are fed up with Brexit uncertainty and reluctant to prolong it further. French President Emmanuel Macron has been particularly resistant to the idea of further delaying Brexit, saying the EU can't be held \"hostage\" to Britain's political crisis.\nBritish Parliament Strikes Down May's Brexit Deal\nBritish lawmakers rejected a Brexit deal put forth by British Prime Minister Theresa May by a record margin on Jan. 15, with 432 MPs voting against her deal at the House of Commons. (Published Tuesday, Jan. 15, 2019)\nMay's office said the prime minister spoke to multiple European leaders by phone Monday and will dash Tuesday to Berlin and Paris for face-to-face talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Macron.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged European leaders to be cooperative, saying May \"is totally and utterly determined to deliver Brexit.\"\n\"They want Brexit to be resolved as quickly as possible,\" Hunt said of the other 27 EU leaders. \"So do we.\"\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he was \"open to extending the deadline.\"\n\"There will be different views, but I am confident that we will reach agreement,\" he said after meeting chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Dublin.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, however, said May would have to convince EU leaders that Britain would continue \"sincere cooperation\" with the bloc if granted a delay. Some pro-Brexit British politicians have suggested the U.K. could try to disrupt EU policymaking if it remains a member much longer.\nBrexit Vote Delayed by British Prime Minister Theresa May\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May announced she has postponed a key parliamentary vote on Britain\u2019s Brexit deal with the E.U. (Published Monday, Dec. 10, 2018)\nAlmost three years after Britons voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU, the country remains divided and the political process deadlocked.\nMay and the EU agreed late last year on divorce terms, but the agreement has been rejected by Parliament three times. In desperation, May last week sought talks with the left-of-center Labour Party.\nLabour favors a softer Brexit than the government has proposed and seeks a close economic relationship with the bloc through a customs union \u2014 a trading area that sets common tariffs on imports while allowing free trade in goods moving between member states.\nSo far, the cross-party talks have failed to yield a breakthrough, but Labour politicians and government ministers were due to continue negotiations Tuesday.\n\"The government doesn't seem to be moving off its original red lines,\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. \"We are looking for movement.\"\nThe EU would welcome a move by Britain to keep close post-Brexit economic ties. Barnier said Monday that the bloc was willing to be \"much more ambitious in our future relationship\" and would agree to a customs union arrangement.\nThousands of Protestors Call for New Brexit Referendum in London\nThe U.K. is scheduled to leave the E.U. next March. (Published Saturday, Oct. 20, 2018)\nThe alternative of a no-deal Brexit threatens huge disruptions to trade and travel, with tariffs and customs checks causing gridlock at British ports and possible shortages of goods in the U.K.\nIt would also be tough for Ireland, the only EU member state to share a land border with the U.K. Any customs checks or other obstacles along the currently invisible frontier would hammer the Irish economy, and could undermine Northern Ireland's peace process.\nBarnier said the EU would remain \"fully behind Ireland.\"\n\"If the U.K. were to leave the EU without a deal, we would not discuss anything with the U.K. until there is an agreement for Ireland and Northern Ireland,\" he said.\nIt was unclear whether the cross-party talks in London would succeed. May's reach for compromise left her caught between angry Conservatives who accused her of throwing away Brexit, and Labour opponents mistrustful of her sudden change of heart.\nSuggestions she might back a customs union infuriated pro-Brexit Conservatives, who say Britain must cut ties to the EU in order to forge an independent economic policy.\nFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiteer, said a customs union would \"enslave\" the U.K. He tweeted that it \"cannot, must not and will not happen.\"\nBut others say May has little choice but to change her long-held Brexit positions, after lawmakers rejected her deal and also repeatedly ruled out leaving the bloc without an agreement.\nLate Monday, Parliament passed a fast-tracked law that compels the government to seek a delay to Brexit rather than leave without a deal. May has already committed to doing that, but many lawmakers don't trust the government and passed the bill as an insurance policy.\nWhile the government still intends for Britain to leave the EU in the next few months, it is also making plans to participate in European Parliament elections taking place across the bloc May 22-26.\nThe government announced Monday it had taken the legal step required to start preparations and set a May 23 date for the poll. It said the measure \"does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.\"\nCulture Secretary Jeremy Wright said both Conservatives and Labour should compromise to make Brexit happen.\n\"There's some urgency to it, but I do think it's important for everyone to take their responsibilities seriously, whatever party they come from, and try and get to a point where we leave the EU, as people have said they wish to do, and to do it on the best possible terms,\" he told the BBC. \"I think that's achievable.\"\nAssociated Press writer Danica Kirka contributed.\nCopyright Associated Press\n", "label": "human"}

There's even some poetry and a stunning scene at the end when Superman must choose between love and loyalty.\n9 From Hell\nThere's nothing like old fashioned horror to being a couple closer together - literally. Our first entry from a graphic novel is an old story told in a modern medium. From Hell was written and drawn by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell and appeared in serialized form in the anthology comic book, Taboo. The 1989 series was a graphic depiction of the serial killings attributed to Jack the Ripper. The title had been inspired by a letter dating from 1888 apparently from the killer himself.\nThe film, starring Johnny Depp as the brooding detective hunting for the elusive serial murderer, is just as chilling as the comics. Both film and graphic novel use authentic bits of history whenever possible. Misty, dark alleys and lofty Victorian dress and architecture make a thrilling and beautiful mix. The romance of this era is still omnipresent and the unrequited love between the main characters is profoundly tragic.\n8 Ghost World\nIf your nerd is impressed with faithful or unique comic book adaptations, they'll like Ghost World. The graphic novel, created by Daniel Clowes, first appeared in serialized form as part of his Eightball series in 1993. Commercial success and status as a cult classic made the eventual movie adaptation inevitable.\nThe story is both happy and sad, tempering the gravity of growing up with dark humor and witty musings, and it's not just for nerds. Enjoy hunting for Easter eggs and pop culture references to which everyone can relate. It's a satisfying film for both comic book nerds and movie buffs alike, as you don't have to know the classic comic to understand the movie.\n7 Spider-Man\nSpider-Man 2 is also nice for a date night, but we have to give it to the original film. This is the movie with the famous upside-down kiss that actually won Toby Maguire an award. Take a look at Maguire's brief cameo in the film Tropic Thunder to find out which one. Yes, that's a real thing.\nRELATED: RDJ Shares Alternative Tony and Peter Photo from Avengers: Endgame\nThe romance Peter Parker has with the girl next door sound formulaic but it's still compelling. The tension the audience feels for both Peter's love interest and his life as a Superhero makes for a great action film and love story. Critics and audiences attributed part of the film's success to the chemistry of the hero and the leading lady.\nWe've got a whole new selection of Spider-Man movies these days, but this is the film that revived the Spider-Man franchise. Ironically, it was also the one that almost killed it a few years later with a cringe-worthy third installment.\n6 V for Vendetta\nHow many times have you wished your partner would remember certain dates? They'll remember this one. This movie has the same ethereal beauty of From Hell, as it shares the setting. This modern London is the not-so-distant future as opposed to the Victorian Era of carriages and cobblestones. Add some modern social-political commentary along with masks, roses and capes and you have a super romantic movie that has something to say. Intelligence is hot, and that's why we love our nerds.\nRELATED: Natalie Portman Open to Returning in a V for Vendetta Sequel\nV for Vendetta was originally a black and white graphic novel between 1982 and 1985 as part of the Warrior anthology. DC Comics picked it up in the 1990s and its popularity prompted the film adaptation.\n5 The Dark Knight\nThis could be one of the best superhero films ever made period, never mind a great and tragic love story. There's a lot of romantic tension but you barely notice it flowing under the riveting storyline. There's a love triangle between Rachel the leading men and it's exciting that Harvey Dent can stand toe to toe with Bruce Wayne. Or maybe a love square including the Joker. Does Commissioner Gordon's love for Batman count?\nRELATED: The Dark Knight Was Bigger (And More Important) Than Avengers: Infinity War\nThe story does not end well for any of these characters. It's as much a Shakespearean crime thriller as a superhero movie. Your beloved nerd will be either be clinging to your hand or crying on your shoulder for most of it.\n4 Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\nVideo games, comic books, and other pop culture references make up the plot of Scott Pilgrim Versus the World. This is an ideal choice if you or your nerd is also a gamer since the plot follows the rules of a classic sidescroller or RPG video game.\nThe whole plot focuses on the love of the title character for his new girlfriend and his quest to win her over. He does this by \"defeating\" her evil exes as if they were video game bosses. The film has a lot of superhero elements, like distinctive costumes, supernatural powers, and creative weapons. It's not based on any one video game or comic book, but instead uses features from all of them to describe Scott's quest for love.\n3 Persepolis\nIf your nerd is into art, history, society or the science of animation, cuddle up on the couch with this critically-acclaimed graphic novel turned film. Persepolis uses a unique style to tell the story of a childhood spent in two vastly different realms.\nThe artwork of the animated film is based on the same style as how it was originally drawn by Marjane Satrapi, and won the jury prize at the Cannes Film festival in 2007. The story is autobiographical, with \"Marji\" telling the story of her childhood in Iran and Europe. The story is both frightening and deeply engaging, something sure to impress your nerd.\n2 The Crow\nUndead, creepy makeup, crows, perpetual rainy darkness and a horrific, over-the-top crime. For any dark and brooding folks who long for a bygone time, it doesn't get any more 1990s than this. After his wife is brutally murdered, the main character Eric Draven is brought back to life by a supernatural crow to exact revenge. The original comic book was inspired by a similar tragedy. James O'Barr drew the comic books in 1989 after his fiance was killed by a drunk driver.\nRELATED: The Crow: The True Story of Hollywood's Most Cursed Movie\nUnderlying the quest for supernatural revenge is a love story, making The Crow an ideal mix of romance, action and horror. Not all of this is fantasy. To make it even more chilling, it's whispered that bad luck haunted this set in real life. Get ready to hold on to the one you love.\n1 Deadpool\nSay what you will about Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, but his feelings for long-term girlfriend Vanessa are genuine and drive the whole plot. It was also a labor of love for star Ryan Reynolds, who not only was a hardcore Deadpool fan but also wanted to right the wrongs of Wolverine: Origins.\nRELATED: Deadpool Welcomes the Fantastc Four Back to Marvel\nAdd to the mix the fan following that hounded Fox incessantly until they gave in, and there's a lot of love out there for the Merc with a Mouth. Artist Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza created Deadpool for Marvel Comics. He first appeared in 1983, in The New Mutants #98, and got his own miniseries in 1993 with The Circle Chase.\nNEXT: The 22 Best Comic Book Movies According to Rotten Tomatoes\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The protagonist of \u201cSpecial\u201d would probably hate how people are describing the (funny! smart!) TV show about his life as being about \u201ca gay, disabled man.\u201d In fact, when Ryan (creator Ryan O\u2019Connell) gets hit by a car shortly before starting a new job in the pilot, and his new co-workers assume that the physical embodiment of his cerebral palsy is due to the accident, he\u2019s downright thrilled. To him, this misunderstanding isn\u2019t a mistake that needs a correcting so much as an incredible opportunity to start their impression of him from scratch. After a lifetime of condescension, he\u2019s suddenly not \u201cthe guy with cerebral palsy\u201d they need to pity, but just a fellow human being who got unlucky.\nOf course, this being a sitcom, maintaining this lie isn\u2019t nearly as simple as Ryan hoped. But throughout all the comic misunderstandings, \u201cSpecial\u201d keeps its feet firmly on the ground, no doubt thanks to the fact that much of it is based directly on O\u2019Connell\u2019s own life as \u2014 and here I go doing exactly what I called out a paragraph ago \u2014 a man who happens to be disabled and gay in a world that often disdains both. (O\u2019Connell really was hit by a car; his accident was even more physically devastating than the one his facsimile suffers, a fact he also leaned into when people mistook his cerebral palsy as injuries as Ryan\u2019s coworkers do on \u201cSpecial.\u201d)\n\u201cSpecial\u201d unfolds in eight abbreviated episodes running under 15 minutes each, all directed by Anna Dokoza and written by O\u2019Connell himself (whose resume also includes \u201cAwkward\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace\u201d). That truncated episode length, combined with Ryan\u2019s internship at a soulless confessional blog called \u201ceggwoke,\u201d give the show something of a throwback webseries feel that might have felt more at home in 2015 than 2019, which makes sense given its origin story. Even with Jim Parsons on board as an executive producer, \u201cSpecial\u201d was shopped around for several years before a network would fully commit to it, and \u201ceggwoke\u201d is based on O\u2019Connell\u2019s experience at Thought Catalog back when Thought Catalog was a viral force. (This latter incongruity reminds me of \u201cShrill,\u201d Hulu\u2019s comedy based on Lindy West\u2019s memoir, which also suffers from rooting its character\u2019s journey in a similarly outdated media landscape.)\nBut in the ways that truly count, \u201cSpecial\u201d tackles timeless issues with equal parts compassion and wit.\nThere\u2019s Ryan\u2019s longing for people to take him seriously, to write pieces that will connect with people, and for cute guys to find him hot when everyone else seems to have 12 more abs than he ever could (Los Angeles in this case, but the insecurity is truly a universal one). In one standout episode, Ryan decides to hire a sex worker so he can lose his virginity without fear or embarrassment \u2014 and he does, in a patient sequence that still makes room for jokes and smiles.\nIt\u2019s also impressive that \u201cSpecial\u201d makes room to flesh out a couple of the important women in his life, like his new coworker and best friend, Kim (Punam Patel), and his worried mother, Karen (the perpetually underrated Jessica Hecht). The only person onscreen who\u2019s a true stereotype is his narcissistic nightmare boss Olivia (Marla Mindelle), who clearly took all the wrong lessons from \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada.\u201d\nAs the main character of his own series, Ryan is revolutionary, yes. He\u2019s also quick and snarky, deeply insecure and sometimes more selfish than he\u2019s willing to admit. He makes mistakes and pays for them, undergoing a hell of a lot of change in the short time \u201cSpecial\u201d gets to show it. If the series were given more time to tell his story, it would be fascinating and even more satisfying to see where O\u2019Connell might take it.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "MANCHESTER UNITED have been backed to sign Declan Rice this summer ahead of Real Madrid.\nMan Utd transfer target backed to make move THIS summer: Real Madrid involved (Pic: GETTY)\nThat is the opinion of former United assistant Rene Meulensteen, who rates the West Ham ace very highly. United are expected to undergo a major squad revamp this summer after appointing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as permanent boss. The Norwegian was impressive during his interim stint and Ed Woodward wants to bankroll him to begin a new era. Part of their transfer plan is young English talent, with a number of stars on their shortlist - including Jadon Sancho, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Rice.\nThe midfielder has had an exceptional season at West Ham and is among a multitude of player in the running for the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Rice earned his first England call-up last month and made his first competitive start for the There Lions in Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro. The Hammers were beaten by United on Saturday but Rice was one of the more impressive players on the pitch.

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nThe final season of Game of Thrones is finally here, and that means one more season of the iconic opening sequence. Since the beginning, fans have joked about the length of the opening sequence, with one even working out that fans who watch the entire thing each episode have spent over an hour and a half watching that map of Westeros and listening to the theme music. The credits do more than just take up an incredible amount of time, though - they also change from episode to episode, revealing a little bit about what is going to happen in the episode.\nEach episode, the credits begin with an astrolabe decorated with the symbols of the major houses of Westeros, wrapping around the sun, before the camera pans down to a three-dimensional map of Westeros and Essos. From here, the shot zooms in, skimming over the map and stopping on labeled locations (like Winterfell or Dragonstone) that rise from the map using clockwork. As well as showing the locations that are going to be relevant in each episode, the Game of Thrones map changes depending on what has been happening in Westeros; when Winterfell burned, smoke rose from it on the map. When a castle is taken by a different house, their sigil appears on it. All these details add up, orienting the viewer at the start of the show.\nRelated: Game Of Thrones Season 8: Returning Cast & New Character Guide\nWhile the opening credits are different for each episode, there are some major differences when it comes to the opening credits for Game of Thrones season 8. Immediately, the visual effects are much more dynamic; the shot doesn't just look over the various locations from above - when the camera comes to Winterfell and King's Landing, it actually goes into the locations, exploring the Stark crypts and dragon skull basement respectively.\nA new location also appears, as the shot of the Wall shows the massive breach that was made by Ice-Viserion in the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, as well as a shot of the castle nearby, and a sheet of ice spreading outward from the wall (charting the path of the Night King's army).\nIn additon to the new design and perspective of the Westeros map Game of Thrones opening, the season 8 titles also feature different tableaux on the rings. Instead of Robert's rebellion, they now depict the War of the Five Kings, with images of the Red Wedding and the birth of Daenerys' dragons.\nIt's fantastic to see that for the final Game of Thrones season, HBO is really pushing the boat out to create something new and exciting for fans, and leaves everyone wondering what else we might see appearing in the opening credits over the next five episodes - and if another major change may happen for the series finale itself.\nNext: Every Season Of Game Of Thrones Ranked\nThor: Ragnarok Accidentally Made HULK Thousands of Years Old\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The operator of Japan's crippled Fukushima power plant yesterday began removing atomic fuel from inside a building housing one of the reactors that melted down in 2011.\nThe delicate operation represents the first time the Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) has pulled out fuel rods from inside a highly contaminated building containing the melted-down reactor, and comes four years behind schedule.\nDue to high radiation levels, technicians used remote-controlled equipment to haul fuel from a \"storage pool\" inside the building.\nOperations were briefly suspended yesterday afternoon after a problem with the equipment removing the fuel, but resumed shortly afterwards.\n\"We finally started this work. We will spend two years removing 566 units of fuel from reactor three,\" said Takahiro Kimoto, a TEPCO spokesman.\nTEPCO removed four units as planned yesterday, with workers continuing to remove debris that have fallen inside the pool and other areas, Kimoto told reporters.\n\"Factors such as removal of debris and various troubles have caused delays, which we realise have caused significant worries to people in the region and others,\" Kimoto said.\n\"Putting safety as our priority, we will carefully continue this work,\" he promised.\nEngineers have had to contend with clearing earthquake debris inside the building and an array of other technical challenges, said TEPCO spokeswoman Yuka Matsubara.\n\"We had to proceed carefully (to remove debris), and we needed to take measures as dust would waft up and increase radiation readings,\" she told AFP.\nTEPCO engineers will not yet attempt to extract molten nuclear fuel that remains deep inside the mangled reactor. This is considered the most difficult part of the massive clean-up operation and is not expected to begin until 2021.\nIn February, TEPCO sent a remote-controlled probe to pick up pebble-sized pieces of the melted fuel in a bid to find out whether the material could be moved.\nThe next step in that painstaking process will be to remove some of the fuel as a sample, which is scheduled to happen by March 2020.\nThe company also faces other difficult challenges, including working out how to dispose of large quantities of contaminated water stored in containers at the plant site.\nIn the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, reactors one, two and three at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant melted down after a deadly earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011.\n", "label": "human"}

Because they have helped people with all sorts of disabilities and birth defects and read all sorts of books about medicine, you\u2019d think that they would have seen it all. But after doctors delivered a baby in Fallujah, Iraq, who did not have a nose, they admitted they were wrong \u2013 they had not seen it all.\nThe infant, who was born only two weeks ago, has no nose. This means that the baby boy must gasp to breathe. The doctors who are helping him survive to admit that they had never seen anything like it before. They said the baby was microcephaly, which is a condition that makes the head smaller than normal. This can also affect the brain, which means it hasn\u2019t developed as it should.\nThe condition can happen because of genetics, or it could have resulted from drug or alcohol abuse by the mother. However, the condition can also come from being exposed to the Zika virus and other toxins during pregnancy.\nNewborns in Fallujah have been experiencing more problems than average, likely because of the American bombings in that part of the world. The Fallujah, Birth Defects project, has documented the man congenital malformations that have come to parents in the Middle Eastern city.\nHowever, Fallujah Birth Defects, which was established in 2004, has never witnessed any other cases of microcephaly. The child, who has not been identified as a boy or a girl to the media, lives with a family in a rural part of Iraq. He is one of four. The three other siblings are all healthy.\nBecause the rural family has \u201crefused\u2019 a tracheotomy on the newborn baby, the little guy can only breathe by gasping. If the little one had the surgery, which would insert a tube into the windpipe, it would be a lot easier for it to breathe and survive.\nThere are other cases where children were born without a nose. It happened in America not long ago. However, that baby died at the age of two in 2017. This baby was Eli Thompson. He had no nasal passages or sinus cavities. This was an extremely rare condition, even rarer than microcephaly, called congenital arrhinia. It occurs in every one in 197 million births.\nEli\u2019s parents asked the doctors to give him the tracheotomy to help him breathe. He got the surgery done when he was just five-days-old.

{"text": "Dave Bautista couldn\u2019t be happier that James Gunn is getting back behind the camera for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after Disney reversed their decision to fire the director of the cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. But before he reprises the role of Drax the Destroyer, the wrestler turned actor will be working with another superhero filmmaker.\nDave Bautsita has joined the cast of Army of the Dead, the first directing gig for Zack Snyder after departing Justice League in the middle of post-production due to a family tragedy. So if you weren\u2019t excited before, now you don\u2019t really have an excuse.\nDeadline has word of Netflix closing the deal to cast Dave Bautista in Army of the Dead. The film is said to take place in the middle of a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas where one man has chosen not to run from the swarms of undead feasting on the living. Instead, he\u2019s putting together a team of mercenaries to head straight into the quarantined zone to pull of a massive heist. That sounds like the biggest gamble anyone has taken in Las Vegas, and since people have literally thrown their lives away on the roll of a dice, that\u2019s saying something.\nAt this time, it\u2019s not clear what role Dave Bautista will be playing, but we\u2019re hoping that he\u2019s the main character who rounds up the squad to pull of this heist. But we could easily see Bautista playing one of the mercenaries, especially since he\u2019s played a wide variety of dangerous individuals in movies like Riddick, Spectre, Blade Runner 2049, and of course, the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.\nAfter being a WWE star for about 15 years (he\u2019s even returning to WrestleMania this weekend), Dave Bautista has become quite the in-demand actor. He\u2019s on the same kind of path that Dwayne Johnson took from the ring to the big screen, and he keeps landing more and more high profile gigs. It doesn\u2019t get much bigger than being part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe nowadays, but he also has a role in the upcoming adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel Dune. Bautista is also enjoying roles in action comedy with Stuber alongside Kumail Nanjiani, as well as the upcoming family friendly comedy My Spy.\nArmy of the Dead is slated to shooting later this year. And since James Gunn is also slated to shoot The Suicide Squad later this year, it sounds unlikely that Bautista will be brought into the DC Extended Universe, as many fans have hoped.

Before that, he had agreed to serve 43 years in state prison, in exchange for pleading to manslaughter and a host of other charges.\n\u201cI know the guards have a tough job here at this facility, and I\u2019ve done nothing but make it harder for them,\u201d Johnson said in his statement.\nJudge Patricia Scanlon, who oversaw the sentencing hearing, remarked that Johnson was \u201cvery polite\u201d and had a different demeanor than the \u201cangry\u201d young man she had seen in court years ago.\nJohnson has credit for the roughly six years he has spent in jail awaiting resolution in his case.\nPlair\u2019s family did not speak in court Tuesday, but prosecutor Mary Knox said they had been informed and approved of the sentence.\nAuthorities say Johnson, and his co-defendants Derrick Cooper and Jason Green, were associated with a North Richmond gang known as the Swerve Team. Plair, police said, was selected at random; the defendants are said to have driven into rival gang neighborhoods in central Richmond and gunned down the first man they saw.\nWhile awaiting trial, Cooper, Johnson and others allegedly conspired to kill a witness in the case.\nCooper took his case to trial, was convicted of murder and received a life sentence. Green and Johnson were supposed to be tried last month, but then a shocking turn of events changed that.\nIn early March, Johnson put on an improvised suit of armor, grabbed a homemade knife and stabbed Cooper in the neck at the jail, according to authorities. Cooper survived. Prosecutors and defense attorneys say the two had a conflict dating back years.\nJohnson is expected to be transferred to state prison within a week. In early May, a restitution will be held to decide whether Johnson should have to pay $5,000 to Plair\u2019s family to cover funeral and burial costs.\nShare this:\nView more on The Mercury News\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange could face a renewed investigation into an allegation of rape in Sweden.\nPhoto: Victoria Jones / PA via AP\nAssange, 47, who had been granted asylum in Ecuador's London embassy for seven years, was arrested yesterday.\nSwedish prosecutors said they were examining the case at the request of the alleged victim's lawyer.\nThe US also wants to extradite him from the UK over his alleged role in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets in 2010.\nAustralian-born Assange faces a charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the US for his alleged role in one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets in 2010, which could result in a prison term of up to five years.\nLawyer Elizabeth Massi Fritz said she would do \"everything we possibly can\" to get the investigation reopened in Sweden.\nAssange sought refuge in the Knightsbridge embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault. But Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum and invited the police to arrest him on Thursday.\nAfter his dramatic arrest, he was taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court and found guilty of a British charge of breaching bail. He spent last night in custody and is facing up to 12 months in prison for that conviction.\nThe United Nations has called for his right to a fair trial to be respected during any extradition process.\nWhat is the Swedish investigation about?\nAssange was accused of rape and other sexual offences, against two women, following a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. He has always denied the allegations, saying the sex was consensual.\nSwedish prosecutors dropped the rape investigation in 2017 because they were unable to proceed while he remained in the Ecuadorean embassy.\nAssange also faced investigation for molestation and unlawful coercion, but these cases were dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\nProsecutors will now re-examine the rape case to decide whether to resume it before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2020.\nMs Massi Fritz, lawyer for the alleged victim, said the arrest came as a shock but \"what we have been waiting and hoping for since 2012 has now finally happened\".\nShe said: \"No rape victim should have to wait nine years to see justice be served.\"\nWhat does the US want with Assange?\nAssange is due to face a hearing over his possible extradition to the US on 2 May.\nThe US Department of Justice has accused him of conspiring with former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to commit \"one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States\".\nManning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, including a video of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. She was recently jailed for a second time for refusing to testify in an investigation into Wikileaks.\nAssange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a \"dangerous precedent\" for journalists publishing information about the US.\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said the charges had been crafted to avoid free speech concerns by accusing Assange of participating in the theft of information. But he said the indictment was \"thin on evidence\".\nDuring a briefing at the White House following Assange's arrest, US President Donald Trump was asked by reporters if he stood by his election campaign remark that he loved Wikileaks, which released damaging information on his opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\"I know nothing about Wikileaks,\" said Mr Trump. \"It's not my thing.\"\nHow has the UK reacted?\nWith Assange facing extradition proceedings and up to five years in federal prison on the US computer hacking charge, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK should resist handing him over.\nShe said: \"This is all about Wikileaks and all of that embarrassing information about the activities of the American military and security services that was made public.\"\nInitially Ms Abbott dismissed the Swedish allegations, saying three times that Assange was never charged, but she later said he should face the criminal justice system if the Swedish government does charge him.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn also said the UK should oppose Assange's extradition, \"for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan\".\nThe BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said backing Assange is not without political risk and will not find universal favour among Labour MPs - but it means \"the battle over Assange's future will now be as much political as it is legal\".\nPrime Minister Theresa May welcomed the arrest, saying it showed that \"in the UK, no one is above the law\".\nHow does the extradition process work?\nLawyer Rebecca Niblock said the extradition decision lies primarily with the courts and that only a judge can decide whether an extradition breaches an individual's human rights.\nThe home secretary can consider a limited number of issues when deciding whether or not to order an extradition, including whether the person is at risk of the death penalty.\nHowever, if Sweden also made an extradition request, Ms Niblock said it would be for the home secretary to decide which request would take precedence, considering factors such as the seriousness of the offence and which request was made first.\nNick Vamos, former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the UK proceedings should not take more than 18 months.\nConsidering Assange's potential objections to extradition, Mr Vamos said that he did not think courts would accept the US case was politically motivated.\nBut he said Assange may be able to argue that his likely treatment in the US prison system would breach his human rights and that could not receive a fair trial due to his notoriety and links to political scandals.\n- BBC\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Everything Palatine Told Anakin Was a Half-Truth\nOne of the most fascinating parts about the prequel trilogy and Anakin's fall to the dark side is that, while the Jedi are supposed to be his friends, they consistently lie or conceal the truth from him. At the same time, his friend Chancellor Sheev Palpatine always tells the truth - or at least most of the truth - right up to the point where he trusts Anakin with his true identity as Darth Sidious.\nThe apparent honesty and use of half-truths is especially interesting to pick apart as we look back at Palpatine's story about Darth Plagueis the Wise. First, it's important to remember why Palpatine tells Anakin the story at all. He knows Anakin is devastated over the loss of his mother and fears the loss of Padme. The story is meant to pique Anakin's curiosity over the power of the dark side and prime him for the eventual reveal that, as a Sith Lord, Palpatine can help Anakin achieve that same power so he can save Padme.\nBut is the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise the whole truth, or one of Palpatine's half-truths? Looking at the story as, told, it doesn't all quite line-up. How could Plagueis be so powerful that he can stop people from dying, yet foolish enough to let his apprentice kill him in his sleep - especially when he knows killing your master is the path of ascension used by all Sith apprentices?\nRELATED: Palpatine Created Anakin Skywalker\nTaking a step back to look at dark side powers and how they could be used to master immortality, the most logical explanation is that it involves a form of possession or transference of consciousness into a new host body. The Sith had a similar power in the Expanded Universe known as \"essence transfer,\" and Palpatine even used it to live-on in the body of a number of clones in some post-Return of the Jedi stories.\nBecoming a Force ghost is an inherently selfless act, so it's not something the Sith can achieve, but it does seem like dominating a new host body is a way Plagueis could prevent his spirit and consciousness from dying out, living forever by hopping from body to body.\nSo, if The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise is a half-truth maybe the apprentice did kill the master, but it was Plagueis taking over the body of the apprentice to kill his own aging self, assuming the identity of Palpatine before the events of Stars Wars: The Phantom Menace. And the whole thing could be possible because of a rigid adherence to the Rule of Two.\nHow Plagueis Could Manipulate the Rule of Two To Achieve Immortality\nOne of the most fascinating aspects about Palpatine is just how complex and long-term his plan for galactic domination was. He was the ultimate chess master, but some of the essential moves to make his plan work must have been executed long before he entered the scene. Chief among these things is the decision to relocate the main Jedi Temple to Coruscant, where it was built on-top of the site of an old Sith Shrine, whose powers ultimately ended up helping Sidious cloud the minds of the Jedi so they couldn't sense his growing power on the same planet.\nThe Sith are selfish and only seek to preserve their own power, so its hard to believe the plan was established by a long-dead Sith and executed by his successors, who have no loyalty to his dreams. The only way this plan makes sense is if it was being executed by its own architect, and the Rule of Two would play a fundamental role in seeing that play out.\nRELATED: Star Wars: The Death of the Empire Explained\nAs Star Wars lore would have it, the Rule of Two was established by Darth Bane after infighting nearly decimated the Sith Order. The Rule of Two ensured that this kind of self-destruction wouldn't happen again by maintaining that there should only ever be two Sith in the galaxy - a master and an apprentice. No more, no less.\nThe Rule of Two seems like a reliable system, until you consider Plaguis's power over life-and-death could have enabled him to manipulate the Rule of Two to ensure his own survival without any real Sith competition. Instead of training an apprentice who would eventually kill him, he instead could have trained apprentices who he would eventually possess, killing his old body and continuing to live in the body and identity of his former apprentice. It's basically Christopher Nolan's The Prestige but a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\nPlagueis' Resurrection as Palpatine Explains His Obsession With The Skywalkers\nLooking at the Rule of Two and Plagueis in this new context, Palpatine's (or, Plagueis') plans in the prequels makes a lot more sense. He was constantly seeking newer and more powerful apprentices and even seeking out Force-sensitive younglings for his inquisitor program. While it would seem to make sense for him to try to wipe out all other Force users, that's not what he did. He actually continually sought out more and more powerful Force users and tried to bring them under his wing.\nHe may have finally found his next host in the body of Anakin Skywalker - the Chosen One, but thanks to Obi-Wan Kenobi and a little help from the high ground, that body was summarily ruined. Fortunately, it turned out Anakin Skywalker had a son, so it only makes sense that Palpatine would try to have Luke Skywalker replace his father at Palpatine's side, especially as the Plagueis' Palatine body seemed to be beyond aging at that point and he surely needed a new host. He may have even wanted to replace Vader with Ezra Bridger before he knew Luke existed.\nAnakin and Luke thought they defeated the Sith Lord, but as we now know from the trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine is alive and well, and with a new super powerful descendant of Anakin Skywalker set loose on the galaxy, he may have found his next host to live on and once again bring Sith Rule upon the galaxy.\nNEXT: Theory: Snoke IS Darth Plagueis (And Star Wars 9's Real Villain)\nPrev 1 2\nGame of Thrones: Who Died In The Season 8 Premiere?\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Firms given nine months to comply with law forcing them to store data on Russian servers\nRussia could block access to Facebook and Twitter if the social media companies fail to fulfil its demand to move data on Russian users to servers located within the country, officials have warned.\nAlexander Zharov, the head of Roskomnadzor, Russia\u2019s communications watchdog, said the western companies had nine months to bring their operations in line with Russian internet security laws. \u201cThey\u2019ve been given time to comply,\u201d he said.\nA law approved in 2014 by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, requires domestic and foreign companies to store the personal data of Russian citizens on servers in Russia. Those who refuse can be fined or prevented from operating in the country. In 2016, Russia blocked LinkedIn, the professional networking website.\nLast week, Moscow ordered Facebook and Twitter to pay fines of 3,000 roubles (\u00a336) over their refusal to obey the law, a move that was mocked by social media users. However, the fine was the minimum allowed under the law, and Zharov warned that the scale of punishments would steadily increase.\nRussia has threatened in the past to block the two sites for violations of the law, but this is the first time it has issued such a specific ultimatum.\nBoth Twitter and Facebook have been widely used by the anti-Putin opposition to coordinate demonstrations and publish investigations into alleged high-level corruption. Critics fear storing the personal data of users in Russia would allow the Kremlin\u2019s security services to access information on opposition activists.\nFacebook said in November that it had 6.2 million users in Russia, a number dwarfed by the 70 million Russians who use VKontakte, the country\u2019s most popular social networking website.\nVKontakte\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, was forced to give up control of the company after backing street protests against Putin in 2011-12. It is now owned by the Mail.ru group, which belongs to the Kremlin-friendly billionaire Alisher Usmanov.\nRussia has also attempted, with limited success, to block Telegram, the messaging service set up by Durov in 2013. It continues to be widely used, including by senior Russian government officials who are reported to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to get around the ban. Officials last month threatened to block popular VPNs unless they agreed to restrict access to websites banned by Russia.\nZharov\u2019s comments came shortly after Russia\u2019s parliament approved a bill that would allow Moscow to cut off the country\u2019s internet traffic from foreign servers. Critics say the move would lead to greater censorship, while the authors of the bill say it is aimed at making Russia\u2019s internet less vulnerable to cyberwarfare.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "DUBAI: For 10 years, Mashrou\u2019 Leila have been at the forefront of the underground music scene in the Arab world. Their songs \u2014 from their indie-folk roots as a seven-piece to the polished electro-pop of their current work as a quartet \u2014 have provided an alternative soundtrack to the watered-down \u2018habibi\u2019 pop that dominates the mainstream music industry in the Middle East and their socially conscious lyrics have addressed the concerns of their generation. They are, arguably, the most potent force in Arabic music, as they will prove once again in Dubai on Friday, April 5, when they play the Wasla music festival alongside several of their peers.\nLast month, they marked their anniversary with their biggest European tour to date and the release of their fifth album, \u201cThe Beirut School\u201d \u2014 a sort of \u2018Greatest Hits\u2019 compilation that includes just three new tracks.\nAs singer Hamed Sinno explains to Arab News, that was not the original intention. The record should have been an entirely new one, the first since their 2015 album \u201cIbn El Leil,\u201d which saw them grow from a regional success story into an international one, garnering widespread acclaim from European and North American media and performing a huge number of shows around the world. And they\u2019ve done all of this out of a region in which independent, alternative musicians receive little-to-no support and, indeed, are often hindered from pursuing their careers for social or political reasons.\nBut the three-plus years since the release of \u201cIbn El Leil\u201d have been, Sinno says, \u201ca constant hurricane.\u201d Despite his energetic, charismatic stage presence, Sinno \u2014 offstage \u2014 is basically an introvert. And the amped-up media attention, driven by his position as the frontman in a band that was increasingly being hailed as a driver for cultural change in the region, began to feel overwhelming for him.\n\u201cAnd regardless of that,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe pace at which things started moving over the past three years \u2014 and I mean the good and the bad \u2014 you kind of lose track of what it is that you\u2019re doing, what you want to be doing, and what you want to get out of your career. And I feel like those are things you can\u2019t forget when you\u2019re a musician. They need to factor into every damn decision. Really. Every other minute of your day has to be based on those things. And it just got really difficult to keep our eyes on the target.\u201d\nSo difficult, in fact, that six songs into what was meant to be the new album, the band effectively split up. \u201cWe\u2019d had a couple of long tours, but we\u2019d also had a lot of time off, to reflect on whether or not we even wanted to still be doing this. We hit a bit of a rough spot. We started fighting about things that weren\u2019t even our concern to start with. Honestly. It was like we brought other people\u2019s expectations, or other people\u2019s rubrics for what success is, into the studio, and it just felt really difficult to make any kind of decision, even about how to write a song. We had a big falling out and decided to stop,\u201d Sinno explains.\nFor around nine months, the band members \u2014 Sinno, multi-instrumentalist Firas Abou Fakher, violinist Haig Parpazian and drummer Carl Gerges (bassist Ibrahim Badr recently left the group) \u2014 were, Sinno says, \u201cunder the impression that the band was over and we were just going to have a few more shows and call quits.\u201d\nPartly this was down to the inevitable internal disputes that almost every group that\u2019s lasted as long as Mashrou\u2019 Leila have will eventually face (as Sinno says, \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of miraculous that we only had our first major falling out with our fifth album rather than our second\u201d). But it was also caused by factors way beyond the band\u2019s control.\nFollowing their performance at Cairo\u2019s Music Park Festival in September 2017 a number of audience members who had been waving rainbow-colored flags in recognition of the band\u2019s open support for LGBT rights were arrested. And the band were officially blackballed by the Egyptian musician\u2019s syndicate, meaning they are not allowed to perform in Egypt again.\nIt was not the first time Mashrou\u2019 Leila had been banned from performing in an Arab country, but it was the first time that authorities had targeted the band\u2019s fans. Understandably, the \u201cCairo incident,\u201d as Sinno refers to it, caused some heartache and serious soul-searching for the musicians.\n\u201cFor a while, I felt completely defeated, for all the obvious reasons. It really did feel like a political and emotional defeat,\u201d Sinno says. \u201cThe vibe in the band started to get really challenging; we started arguing with each other about stuff that we didn\u2019t need to be arguing about. And I decided that maybe this wasn\u2019t what I wanted to be doing anymore.\u201d\nSinno used one of the new tracks, \u201cCavalry,\u201d to address the frustrations that arose after the Cairo concert. \u201cIt\u2019s really a turning point for me in how I felt about the situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about embracing that defeat and just going for it anyway. It\u2019s about not expecting to win, necessarily, but to fight anyway. Out of all the tracks we had written and had on standby, it was one that felt very valuable to us on several levels; professionally and emotionally.\u201d\nThankfully, it seems that Mashrou\u2019 Leila are now past their \u201crough spot.\u201d The band even managed to write and record an \u201cuncynically happy\u201d song \u2014 \u201cRadio Romance\u201d \u2014 for \u201cThe Beirut School.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big departure for the band \u2014 it\u2019s very different from anything we\u2019ve done before. Because we sort of sat down and agreed that it wouldn\u2019t be a song that was about something horrible. It was honestly quite challenging, in the context of the last three years, to write something positive,\u201d Sinno explains.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still negotiating how to move forward, but I think everyone\u2019s on the same page, at least as far as intention goes, which is the most important thing at this point,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty intense. But I think it was a necessary period to basically remind ourselves why we\u2019re doing this and what it is that we\u2019re hoping to get out of it.\u201d\nTheir European tour last month has helped the band to refocus. \u201cIt was a really great tour to play. It was the first round of shows we\u2019d played since we decided to get back together, and the nature and caliber of the venues we were playing in was kind of its own reward,\u201d says Sinno. \u201cIt was like the cherry on top. Like, \u2018Oh, this is what we\u2019ve been given.\u2019 Places like L\u2019Olympia (Paris) and the Roundhouse (London). It was technically very difficult, and stressful, but it was cathartic.\u201d\nAnd on Friday they perform their first Middle East show since resolving to continue the Mashrou\u2019 Leila journey. Wasla \u2014 an annual festival celebrating Arabic alternative music and now in its third year \u2014 is the kind of event that the region needs more of, Sinno suggests.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about exposure as much as it is just sort of grouping some things together as these little monuments to what is going on in the region,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like the Middle East has a history of not properly archiving and not properly looking at the work that it produces and the history of that work, so it\u2019s always healthy to have things like festivals that you can look back at.\u201d\nTo conclude, I ask him if he\u2019s a fan of any of the other bands performing at Wasla.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a fan of all of the acts,\u201d he replies without hesitation. \u201cIf for nothing else then just because I completely recognize and understand how difficult it is for anyone to still be making music in the region. I know first-hand how hard it is to devote yourself to this line of work, and the amount of negativity that comes with it. So I completely respect all of these musicians and I\u2019m a huge fan of all of them.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

Following a few encounters at events over the course of the next few months, the pair made their first red carpet appearance together at the Met Gala in May 2017 \u2014 though they maintain that they were still only friends at the time of the event.\nPriyanka Chopra Says She 'Didn't Think' She Would Marry Nick Jonas: 'I Judged a Book by Its Cover' https://t.co/put5HqutJL \u2014 People (@people) April 12, 2019\nOne year later, the romance rumors were refueled after Nick and Priyanka were spotted together over Memorial Day weekend, which were all but confirmed through the flirty comments left on each other\u2019s Instagram posts throughout the summer. Finally, the romance became official at the end of June, which was quickly followed up by an engagement in June and finally their lavish wedding in December.\nIt was during their whirlwind romance that Priyanka realized that her man \u2014 whom she refers to as \u201cOld Man Jonas\u201d \u2014 wasn\u2019t quite what he seemed, but in the best way possible.\n\u201cHe\u2019s such an old soul, extremely smart, so good for me because he grounds me so much,\u201d she said during her interview on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a wild child, I do whatever I want whenever I want and he always supports me.\u201d\nThe Quantico star continued, describing one of the first things she noticed about Nick early on in their relationship.\nPriyanka detailed a night that the pair were out with friends, though she had to cut the evening short due to a work meeting. The actress began dropping hints to her beau in hopes that he would ask her to cancel her plans, but Nick wasn\u2019t having it.\nLoading...\n\u201cFinally he took me aside and he\u2019s like, \u2018Look, I\u2019m not stupid. I know what you\u2019re trying to do, but I will never be the one who will tell you to cancel work because I know how hard you\u2019ve worked to be where you are,'\u201d Chopra recalled.\nInstead, Nick offered to entertain their pals while Priyanka went to her meeting, assuring that they would wait for her to finish so they could finish their fun night.\n\u201cHe gave me credit for what I had done, it was just mind-blowing for me,\u201d she said of the memory.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Video caption Netanyahu praises Trump for recognising Israel control of Golan\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says he intends to name a new settlement in the occupied Golan Heights after US President Donald Trump.\nMr Netanyahu said the move would honour Mr Trump's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan in March.\nIsrael seized the Golan from Syria in 1967 and annexed the territory in 1981. The move has not been recognised internationally.\nSyria said Mr Trump's decision was \"a blatant attack on its sovereignty\".\nMr Netanyahu, who has secured a fifth term in office in the recent Israeli elections, has been on a trip to the region with his family for the week-long Passover holiday.\n\"All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognise Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\n\"I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J Trump\", he said in a video message .\nFor decades, Washington did not recognise Israel's sovereignty over the Golan, but Mr Trump announced his plan to overturn US policy in a tweet on 21 March .\nWhat are the Golan Heights?\nThe region is located about 60km (40 miles) south-west of the Syrian capital, Damascus, and covers about 1,200 sq km (400 sq miles).\nIsrael seized most of the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Middle East war, and thwarted a Syrian attempt to retake the region during the 1973 war.\nThe two countries agreed a disengagement plan the following year that involved the creation of a 70km-long (44-mile) demilitarised zone patrolled by a United Nations observer force. But they remained technically in a state of war.\nIn 1981, Israel's parliament passed legislation applying Israeli \"law, jurisdiction, and administration\" to the Golan, in effect annexing the territory. But the international community did not recognise the move and maintained that the Golan was occupied Syrian territory. UN Security Council Resolution 497 declared the Israeli decision \"null and void and without international legal effect\" .\nThree years ago, when former US President Barack Obama was in office, the US voted in favour of a Security Council statement expressing deep concern that Mr Netanyahu had declared Israel would never relinquish the Golan .\nSyria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. The last US-brokered direct peace talks broke down in 2000, while Turkey mediated in indirect talks in 2008.\nThere are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured.\n", "label": "human"}

Speaking to Team Mangalorean, Hebbaar said, \u201cMy leave was approved from 5 April to 12 April, but since I was not able to extend my leave days as the Sydney Airport experiences huge holiday rush due to Easter and Ramzan, and with no other option I decided to quit the job, since I wanted to vote for Modi very badly\u201d.\n\u201cMarried to a Fiji-Australian, I got the status of Permanent Resident Card Holder in Australia, and prior to my job at the Airport I had worked at Sydney Trains. I have come in contact with people from all over the world, including Europeans and Pakistanis, and I am proud to say that every time I meet these foreigners they have high praise for India, who say that India has a bright future ahead. I attribute this success and changing image of India to our beloved PM Narendra Modi. Obviously, I cannot go to the border to protect my motherland-India, but the least I can do is exercise my voting rights and caste my vote in the Lok Sabha elections\u201d added Sudhindraa.\n\u201d On April 17, 2014 I immigrated to Australia on that day when Karnataka went to the Lok Sabha polls in a single phase. But I was so determined to vote, I went to the polling booth in Hosabettu at around 7 am on that day to caste my vote, before I took the took a bus journey to Bengaluru, and from there I flew to Sydney that night. But I feel so happy that my vote counted, and Narendra Modi became the PM. So once again I was determined to come down to India and vote for Modi again, so that he will be the PM once again. Now that I have quit my job, I will be here in Surathkal till the elections results are out on 23 May 2019, and only after that I will fly back to Sydney, and look for a new job. And I am very much confident that finding another job\nshouldn\u2019t be a issue \u201d added Hebbaar.\nAnd finally, a message from this 41-year-old Modi fan to the Indian people is simple: Vote for Modi and his BJP party in 2019 to ensure India\u2019s continuing development and socio-economic betterment of India.

{"text": "A Rajshahi court yesterday sentenced three people to death for killing Rajshahi University teacher Prof AKM Shafiul Islam in 2014.\nJudge Anup Kumar of Rajshahi Speedy Trial Tribunal awarded death penalty to Abdus Samad Pintu, Ariful Islam Manik, and Mohammad Sabuj at 12:15pm, said public prosecutor Entajul Haque.\nIn addition to the capital punishment, each convict would have to pay a fine of Tk 10,000, he said.\nAmong the convicts, Pintu, a Jubo Dal activist, and Manik, former Katakhali municipal unit Jubo Dal organising secretary, were present at the court, while Sabuj was absconding.\nHaque said the murder was planned after the Prof Shafiul misbehaved with Pintu\u2019s wife Reshma Khatun, a staff of the university. Pintu threatened the teacher for this before committing the murder, he added.\nAnnouncing the brief judgement, the judge left the courtroom as the two convicts burst into tears. Pintu wailed, \u201cEveryone knows we are not the killers, yet we are punished.\u201d\nThe court also acquitted eight other accused in the case, as prosecution could not prove the allegations bought against them beyond doubt, the judge said in his verdict said.\nExpressing dissatisfaction over the verdict, defence lawyer Golam Mortuza said the convicted persons are innocent as well, as the prosecution side could not prove their involvement beyond doubt.\n\u201cThe victim was a university teacher; that is why the investigation of his murder case was politically motivated,\u201d he said, adding that none of the 34 witnesses mentioned names of the accused persons being involved in the killing.\nOn the other hand, Soumin Shahrid, son of the slain professor, said he would not comment on the verdict as it took place in accordance with the investigation. \u201cAnd the investigation could not establish the motive of the murder logically\u201d.\n\u201cThe reason for the murder of a university professor cannot be as trivial as misbehaving with a person,\u201d he said.\nSoumin said he was a second year student of Dhaka University during the investigation.

Police identified Sadhan Karmaker, a blacksmith from Bogura, who made the machete.\nSadhan told the court that he sells his weapons through Amol Kumar Mohonto, a hardware businessman of the district. Amal told police that he sold this weapon to a tall fair youth, but the police did not present the accused persons before Amal to identify the youth.\n\u201cWe think police did not do that, because Amal Kumar did not find the buyer of the machete among any of the accused persons,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the public prosecutor said the reactions of the defence lawyers and the professor\u2019s son were \u201cnot based on facts\u201d.\nCASE HISTORY\nAssailants stabbed Prof Shafiul, 48, to death on November 15, 2014 when he was returning home in Rajshahi city's Choddopai area, near the then Rajshahi Rab headquarters and the campus.\nShafiul was known as a progressive teacher and a Lalon song enthusiast.\nThe then RU registrar filed the murder case the following day, accusing unknown persons.\nHours after the killing, banned Islamist outfit Ansar Al Islam Bangladesh-2 claimed responsibility for the murder on social media, and police arrested three militants over the claim.\nSenior police officials then told media that they found militant link behind the murder, and the victim's son Soumin Shahrid suspected the same.\nOne week later, the investigation of the case took a turn when Rapid Action Battalion held six pro-BNP men and presented them before the media in Dhaka, who confessed that they are involved with the murder.\nOn November 30, 2015, Inspector Rezaus Sadik of police's Detective Branch submitted the charge sheet, and ruled out any militant outfit's involvement in the murder.\nHe accused Anwar Hossain Ujjal, a former convener of Rajshahi district unit of Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal, and ten others for the murder.\nOther accused are: Nasrin Akhter Reshma, an assistant section officer of RU; her husband Pintu, Manik, Sirajul Islam Kalu, Mohammad Sabuj, Al Mamun, Mohammad Arif, Mohammad Sagor, Zinnat Ali, and Ibrahim Khalil alias \u201cTokai Babu\u201d.\nAccording to the charge sheet, Sabuj, Sagor, Arif, Zinnat and Ibrahim hacked Prof Shafiul upon instructions from Ujjal and Manik.\nThe charges were based solely on the judicial confession of accused Nasrin Akter Reshma, who claimed Prof Shafiul was killed because \u201che misbehaved with her\u201d, said public prosecutor Entajul.\nHe said the killers were annoyed at the professor for his love for Lalon as the victim organised functions of Lalon songs at his home twice a week.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "TONY PULIS thinks Mo Besic could have a crucial role to play in the Championship run-in now that the Middlesbrough midfielder doesn\u2019t have any international football to worry about.\nThe Bosnian midfielder has struggled to maintain his decent standards of form this season when he has returned from playing with his country.\nBut when he has played well it has tended to coincide with Boro playing better and that was the case on Tuesday at Bolton when he returned to the midfield.\nThat was after Besic had been left out of the starting line-up for four games before that, all ending in defeat, having also disappointed on a personal level in losses to Brentford and Preston.\nThe on loan Everton man is even more important to the squad given Lewis Wing is sidelined through injury and requiring hernia surgery which is likely to mean he does not play again this season.\nBut Pulis feels he was left with little choice but to leave Besic out during that period because of his obvious drops in performance levels.\n\u201cMo, when he goes away with his country he tends to come back and struggle,\u201d said Pulis. \u201cWe've looked at it over a period of a year, we wanted to give him a few days\u2019 rest.\n\u201cHe was biting at the chip to play on Saturday, again (like with Ashley Fletcher) I thought these two games this week would be his games rather than Saturday.\n\u201cHe's played really well (at Bolton), but he tired. He was cramping up a bit. He still hasn't got those two games (Bosnia) out of his system.\u201d\nBesic and Fletcher were recalled at Bolton and that benefitted the team, so the hope now will be that they can deliver again this Saturday when Hull City travel to the Riverside.\nThat is the first of the five remaining matches and Middlesbrough must claw back a four point deficit to the play-off zone during that period to stand a chance of still getting promoted.\nEven though Middlesbrough did beat Bolton on Tuesday, the atmosphere around the Riverside is still likely to be fraught on Saturday if the home side don\u2019t start well.\nPulis has plenty of critics on Teesside and a positive start will be needed against the Tigers to avoid any vocal disapproval against him, like he endured in the last home defeat to Bristol City.\nThe Middlesbrough manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s another game on Saturday, that's most important now. We\u2019ve got to approach it in the right manner. We played some smashing stuff (at Bolton), but then we have in the other games.\u201d\nHull will head to Middlesbrough having clawed themselves to within a point of their opponents, so have a late play-off charge in their own minds.\nThe battle for a top six spot will also have a huge game this weekend when fifth-place Aston Villa and sixth-placed Bristol City, who sit four points above Pulis\u2019 side, meet.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Our first full look at the Joaquin Phoenix Joker movie is here. What do you think? Will this seemingly crazy idea pay off and result in a great movie, or was this a huge mistake? No matter how Joker turns out, we can say with some certainty that it\u2019s definitely not going to be your standard DC comic book movie. Completely separate from every other DC film so far, Joker is a character study about a mentally ill individual who eventually transforms into the Joker. Watch the Joker trailer below.\nJoker Trailer\nIt took a while, but I\u2019ve come around to being excited for Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker movie. While I wouldn\u2019t exactly call myself a fan of Phillips\u2019 work so far, I\u2019m very much into the cast he\u2019s put together here: Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Marc Maron, and Shea Whigham. And then, of course, there\u2019s Joaquin Phoenix in the lead. Phoenix is a phenomenal actor \u2013 maybe the best working today. He never half-asses or phones-in a performance, and I have no doubt that no matter how Joker turns out, he\u2019ll bring something new and exciting to a part that\u2019s already been portrayed several times by several great actors.\nJoker \u201ccenters around the iconic arch-nemesis and is an original, standalone story not seen before on the big screen. The exploration of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man disregarded by society, is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale.\u201d Phillips is pulling inspiration from several sources here. Sure, there\u2019s a little Killing Joke thrown in, but it also looks like the director has borrowed a thing or two from Martin Scorsese\u2019s misunderstood The King of Comedy (which also featured Joker co-star Robert De Niro).\nIf you were hoping Joker would connect to on-going DC and WB film series\u2019 like Aquaman or Wonder Woman, think again. This is a stand-alone movie, and kicks-off a new direction for Warners. This week\u2019s Shazam! is still very much in the previous cinematic universe Warners was building for their DC characters, but going forward, the studio is going to be less interested in connecting their movies, and more focused on telling good stories that can stand up on their own. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m disappointed by this decision.\nJoker opens October 4, 2019.\n", "label": "human"}

Miller will become the director of the Department of Xenophobia and with the president's consent, Miller will live out what seems to be his dream of cleansing America of immigrants.\nTony Torres, Garland\nFocus on the real issues\nIt's late but it is too important not to weigh in on SB 9. We have more important things to do than to have to deal with voter suppression and the wholesale efforts of people to keep folks from voting - this should be a given.\nThe barbaric women's issues that have been voted in our State Legislature are part of those important issues. So are gun laws, or at least monitoring the purchases of firearms in this state. Wrong people have access and are purchasing them -- people who are prone to violence and might have mental disease are purchasing these firearms. When are we going to stop some of this?\nAlso, our environment is presently challenging us beyond our capabilities. Public education is at risk.\nAnd foremost this state needs Medicare expansion. It's ridiculous for us not to have this in our state.\nI urge Gov. Greg Abbott and Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos and Sen. Nathan Johnson to focus on these important issues rather than keeping people from voting.\nElaine Hooper, Dallas/Highlands North\nSB 9 would restrict voting\nI have lived in Texas my entire life, and as an emerging adult I am excited about the prospect of being able to have a voice in my community. Many of my peers share this excitement, but many choose to abstain from voting because they don't believe their voice matters. SB 9 will only further discourage young voters and people of color, who are a vital part of our community, from taking part in this democratic right. SB 9 looks a lot like the literacy tests and poll taxes placed on the African-American community in the past. Passing this bill would put us on the wrong side of history.\nMary Silva, Dallas\nBiden's behavior no joke\nRe: \"Biden jokes about his behavior with women,\" Saturday news story.\nI like Vice President Joe Biden, but find unacceptable his making light of touching women (by saying he had \"permission\") in a speech on April 5. I am amazed that a person as politically experienced as Biden at minimum is so challenged rhetorically; you can't say you \"understand\" and will be \"mindful\" of this matter in a video one day and several days later joke about it. This shows he may not get it and has no message discipline -- a well-documented weakness of his.\nMaking a few women feel uncomfortable didn't have to be and shouldn't have been an issue for Biden, but his response may make it an issue. As a communication scholar, I believe there is a rhetorical lesson here for all politicians. When accused of something, think through the appropriate way to handle it, offering one and only one response; don't let a 24-hour story turn into one that keeps on giving.\nRichard Cherwitz, Austin\nTouchy-feely politicking\nJoe Biden's potential presidential run resembles Frank Skeffington's last campaign for mayor of an East-Coast city, presumably Boston, in the leading political novel of the 1950s, Edwin O'Connor's The Last Hurrah. Skeffington, the master of the former \"ward\" politics of rising ethnic groups, is surprisingly defeated by an unexpected competitor, the bland, handsome, inexperienced Kevin McCluskey, a younger Irish World War II veteran. Skeffington's defeat occurs within his own Irish ethnic group, not by a rising competing group such as the Italians.\nThe Last Hurrah is rich in ethnic Irish color, such as the wake with the body present in the home's parlor. Such examples are typical of Biden's past, including the \"touchy-feely\" brand of politicking. In The Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan, a speechwriter for and biographer of another Irish politician, Ronald Reagan, cautions the 74-year-old Irishman Biden not to run. She details the embarrassing downside of such a campaign at the mercy of youthful, less-charitable political operatives.\nFrederick W. Fraley, East Dallas\nTaxes, our taxes\nTexas officials like to make fun of states that offer more services at the cost of higher taxes. \"Taxachusetts\" is one put-down they use.

When it comes to property taxes, Texas should be spelled \"Taxes\".\nJoel Hale, Dallas\n", "label": "human"}

While the prices of assets were dropping during this time, the purchasing power of gold rose to prominence.\nFast forward to the financial crisis in 2008, the price of gold increased sharply while faith in U.S. equities was languishing. In essence, gold has proven to withstand times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty.\nWith the latest Fedspeak sounding more dovish as it now projects two interest rate hikes in 2019 as opposed to three or more, this could be the trigger for gold to return to come back into the forefront, particularly as a safe-haven option in the wake of more volatility. While bonds are typically the default play when U.S. equities go awry, gold is also a prime option for diversification as a safe alternative.\nRussia is also following China in terms of shoring up their gold holdings.

{"text": "Emmanuel Macron expected to demand Britain lose its seat on Brussels top table for first time since 1973\nFrance is expected to demand the removal of the post of British European commissioner as a price for a long Brexit delay, leaving Britain without a seat at the top table of Brussels decision-making for the first time since 1973.\nSenior EU sources say the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is likely to seek to entrench the UK\u2019s reduced status in the EU at the leaders\u2019 Brexit summit on Wednesday evening.\nThe British government will have to agree to losing its commissioner but it is unlikely the prime minister will put up a fight when she is presented with the terms of an extension.\n\u201cThere are different legal means not to have a [British] commissioner,\u201d said an EU diplomat, suggesting one way could be the British government declining to nominate anyone. \u201cThe question of non-participation could depend also on the British government.\u201d\nLeaders are expected to reject Theresa May\u2019s appeal for a limited extension to 30 June, but the EU27 are split between those who support a Brexit delay until 31 December year, and those who think the end of March 2020 would be safest.\nThe European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is said to favour an extension to March 2020, to allow the maximum feasible amount of time for Westminster to find a way forward and \u201ckick the can down the road\u201d, a senior diplomat said.\nFrance has been an outspoken critic of allowing the UK to extend its EU membership without a clear plan, suggesting that Britain\u2019s crisis should not be allowed to take the bloc \u201chostage\u201d.\nTimeline Brexit: what happens next? Show Hide Possible departure with May's deal? Theresa May has vowed to carry on to fight to get her withdrawal agreement over the line to avoid the need for elections to the European parliament. She said: \u201cThe choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear.\u201d European parliamentary elections The EU, including at the moment the UK, will vote for a new set of MEPs. The decision to hold European elections, which the prime minister had repeatedly said she was against, will come at some political cost for Theresa May. EU27 review The extension carries a break clause. At the end of June, the EU27 want to be satisfied that the UK is meeting its obligations, including holding those European elections properly. They have also said they will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, but can discuss changes in the political declaration. New departure date The new date that the EU27 have agreed for the UK\u2019s departure is Halloween. It is further away than May had hoped, and sooner than Donald Tusk had proposed, suggesting that Emmanuel Macron\u2019s hardline tone won the day in the European council.\nBut Paris is now expected to turn its focus on the conditions of a further Brexit delay, including the removal of Britain\u2019s seat in the European commission, currently filled by Sir Julian King, who has the security portfolio.\n\u201cThe commission will demand this; it is logical,\u201d claimed an EU diplomat, adding that a British commissioner could not take a seat \u201cif the term of the mandate is short\u201d.\nUnder a provision of the Lisbon treaty, Brussels is able to reduce the number of commissioners from its current 28, under which each member state is represented in the EU\u2019s executive branch.\nFrance\u2019s expected move will not receive the automatic support of other EU capitals who would be concerned about the loosening of the tie between the number of member states and commissioners.\nMerkel and Macron under pressure as May seeks new Brexit delay Read more\nBritain\u2019s first commissioners at the time of its accession to the then European economic community in 1973 were Christopher Soames, a son-in-law of Winston Churchill, and George Thomson, who had previously sat in Harold Wilson\u2019s cabinet as secretary of state for Commonwealth affairs.\nSenior diplomats have suggested that France would also be more comfortable with any extension being limited to the end of the year due to concerns in Paris over Britain becoming a difficult member state.\nBut under the terms of its extended membership, the UK will be asked to sign up to an \u201cenhanced duty of sincere cooperation\u201d with the EU, in reference to a responsibility to keep out of the bloc\u2019s long-term planning.\nFrance wants the summit communique to add in language stating that the \u201cUK will not obstruct decisions taken at 27\u201d.\nThe EU, on the advice of Juncker, will also follow the precedent set following the formation of the Eurozone, under which countries that have not adopted the euro are left out of meetings.\nIn this case, only the UK would be outside the room on discussions over long-term planning, such as the appointment of the new president of the European commission and the seven-year multi-annual financial framework (MFF), setting out the top lines of the budget for the next commission term.\nThe UK would be expected to refrain from using its veto on the MFF but senior diplomats said there would be a way around the problem if the British government went \u201crogue\u201d. \u201cWe can make the decisions together at 27 and formalise it once the UK has gone,\u201d said a source.\nA senior EU diplomat said the risk of Britain turning into a disruptive member state had been overblown by the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and some EU capitals for their own purposes.\nA draft summit communique, obtained by the Guardian, and to be agreed by the EU27\u2019s leaders on Wednesday, assumes in return for an extension a \u201ccommitment by the United Kingdom to act in a constructive and responsible manner throughout this unique period in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation\u201d.\nIt goes on to say the EU \u201cexpects the United Kingdom to fulfil this treaty obligation in a manner that reflects its situation as a withdrawing member state\u201d, while the length of the extension is left blank.\n\u201cTo this effect, the United Kingdom shall facilitate the achievement of the union\u2019s tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the union\u2019s objectives,\u201d it adds.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The rules governing forestry are too light and need to be reviewed, environmental groups say.\nPhoto: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King\nThe National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry came into force in May last year but are about to be reviewed by the government.\nThe Environmental Defence Society and Forest and Bird decided to conduct joint analysis because of increasing public concern about the impacts of commercial forestry in light of events like Tologa Bay last year.\nAn estimated one million tonnes of logs and debris was left strewn on properties and roads on the East Coast during two bouts of heavy rainfall in June last year.\nFarmers put the cost of the damage in the millions of dollars.\nThe two environmental groups said forestry was high risk in terms of worker safety and environmental impact, and the regulatory approach was too soft.\nEnvironmental lawyer Sally Gepp described regulation as a \"light-touch which was inappropriate for such a high-risk sector\".\nThe Environmental Defence Society and Forest and Bird want to see a regime where all environmental issues which might arise during the life of a forestry cycle are identified.\nThis would include identifying wetlands, significant areas of native bush and where there were likely to be native animals using the forest.\nMiss Gepp said there were controls on afforestation but in certain areas it was a permitted activity, despite being at high risk of erosion, which meant it did not require a resource consent.\nShe said this was too permissive and that the regulation started from the premise that the need for resource consent should be avoided where possible.\n\"Plantation forestry has too many environmental risks associated with it for that to be an appropriate starting point,\" said Miss Gepp.\nShe said the adverse environmental impact of clearfell harvesting was significant and there needed to be a transition to more sustainable methods.\nSlash and sediment needed to be better controlled, she said.\n\"There's the incidents that are really recognisable like Tologa Bay, but then there's the ongoing effect of sedimentation of coastal marine areas that's happening all the time, particularly at the time of harvest of plantation forest, and those types of impacts are still not sufficiently dealt with.\"\nShe said they needed to move on from clearfelling to looking at other methods used overseas.\nThe government said the operating context for forestry had changed in the last year with the launch of the Billion Tree Programme.\nIt said severe weather events such as the one in Tolaga Bay had raised questions about plantation forestry on erosion prone and steep land.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 In New York state government news, the Democrat-controlled Assembly has passed a package of legislation to provide services and support to crime victims, while environmentalists want to amend the state constitution to guarantee a right to clean air and water.\nHere's a look at stories making news:\nCRIME VICTIMS ASSISTANCE\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie, of the Bronx, announced earlier this week that his chamber had approved six measures, including one to ensure state compensation and counseling for families of domestic partners who are victims of homicide.\n\"This legislation allows a domestic partner to have the same rights as a spouse to seek support when their partner is a victim of homicide,\" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the Assembly legislation.\nAnother measure would direct fines imposed under certain antitrust laws to be used to help fund the state's Office of Victim Services.\nFour of the six Assembly measures have been introduced in the Senate, also controlled by Democrats.\nThe Assembly's Republican minority was upset that three of its proposals didn't make it into the package. Those measures would have created a violent felony offender registry, extended orders of protection in extreme cases and added a harsher penalty for intentionally committing an act of domestic violence in the presence of a child.\nGREEN AMENDMENT\nThe measure would make New York the 44th state to include an expression of environmental values in its constitution.\nEnvironmental Advocates of New York and dozens of other groups are calling on the Legislature to support a \"Green Amendment\" that adds the line: \"Each person shall have a right to clean air and water, and a healthful environment.\"\nThe measure has passed in the Assembly the past two years but didn't come up for a vote when Republicans controlled the Senate, something that changed when Democrats made major gains in in last November's elections.\nFor the state constitution to be amended, the proposed amendment must be passed by the full Legislature in two consecutive legislative sessions before it can be put up for a statewide voter referendum.\n\"Our state's constitution has protections to worship, assemble and even play bingo,\" said one of the sponsors, Sen. David Carlucci, D-Rockland. \"It's time environmental protections be there too.\"\nWINTER RECOVERY FUNDS\nAs public works crews start repairing roads from the winter\u2019s damage, there\u2019s $65 million less in the recently approved state budget to fund the projects.\n\"Every time you hit a pothole you can blame the Democrats who put together this budget,\" said Scott Reif, a spokesman for Senate Republicans.\nSen. Timothy Kennedy, a Buffalo Democrat who's chairman of his chamber's transportation committee, said in mid-March that the extreme winter recovery funding would be in the budget, but it didn't make it into the $175.5 billion spending plan passed by the Democrat-controlled Legislature on April 1.\nKennedy's office said the capital funding portion of the final budget was \"bare bones\" and the $65 million will be included in a supplemental capital bill to be negotiated by lawmakers. Cuomo's budget office confirmed this, while pointing out the administration announced last month that an additional $128 million was being disbursed to help local government repave roads damaged by harsh winter conditions.\nIn the meantime, repair crews have enough funding to do their jobs and more than enough busted-up roads to keep them busy this spring, one local official said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive very far to see roads that need to be repaved and upgraded,\u201d said Dennis Davis, commissioner of public works for Oneida County and president of the New York State County Highways Superintendents Association. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the Legislature\u2019s intention to revisit the capital plans and put funding back in.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

The survey found only 44% of teens believe they will begin saving for retirement by that age. Junior Achievement says the lack of confidence is concerning.\n\u201cIncredibly shocking,\u201d said Kacy Wendling, the director of development for Junior Achievement. \u201cThere\u2019s so many startling realities that we\u2019re facing specifically in Indiana in our economy and Junior Achievement, our entire mission is to empower young people to own their future success.\u201d\nThe survey also found that most teens\u2019 top financial goal for the future is getting a full-time job (62%). Other financial goals included graduating from a four-year college (59%), no longer having to rely on parents or caregivers for money (53%) and saving enough money for a big trip or vacation (41%).\nJunior Achievement created BizTown several years ago to help kids as young as elementary school prepare for their future. Students get the chance to see themselves as CEO of a bank, a mayor, a marketing specialist and more. The students play roles of successful adults while learning the steps to get there.\nWendling added that parents and teachers notice how kids catch on after being a part of the program.\n\u201cStudents or my kids are seeing what I do every day and they understand the bills I\u2019m paying, the money I\u2019m putting away for our retirement and our savings. They understand, and they get it now,\u201d said Wendling.\nEven students attending BizTown are catching on with the skills they need to succeed in their future.\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these different kinds of jobs, but since there\u2019s a few jobs missing, I\u2019d like to explore those more,\u201d said student Peyton Cook.\n\u201cYou can save up for very important stuff in the future like an apartment or something like that when you move out of the house,\" said student Luke Fisher.\nAccording to the Junior Achievement Survey:\nIn terms of teen top financial concerns for the future, those included paying for college (47%), not being able to afford to live on their own (45%), paying taxes (43%) and finding a fulfilling, well-paying job (40%). Other findings include: Most teens (64%) turn to their parents or caregivers for financial advice, followed by family members (38%), friends (30%) and online resources, such as articles and social media (27%) Most teens making money have some sort of bank account (61%), while the rest save their money unbanked, such as in a shoebox, piggybank or other method. Among those currently in school, more female respondents (40%) than males (34%) believed they would make less than $35,000 in their first full-time job after high school. More teens (22%) earned money in 2019 by working independently, compared to 2018 (16%). Most teens depend on gifts for spending money (64%), while many receive allowances for doing chores (32%).\n\u201cWe\u2019re having conversations with our fifth graders who are talking about taxes and loans, conversations you don\u2019t even have with adults,\u201d said Wendling, \u201cFor students to start thinking about wants verses needs, savings, giving back, the sooner the better to create that pathway to success.\u201d\nJunior Achievement is also hosting a walk and run called the 4.01K Race for Financial Fitness on April 28.

The IPAC spokesman said the general assembly has further directed that these cases of impersonation be referred to the police for further investigation.\u201d\nWhile acknowledging that the erring officials had attempted to cause disaffection and dissension within IPAC, Ogbonna insisted that they did not succeed in polarising the body.\n\u201cIPAC Abia State remains one strong indivisible body committed like never before to its cardinal objective of ensuring a rancour free political environment in the state and partnering with INEC and government to ensure the emergence of credible leadership and the delivery of good governance to the people of Abia State,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, the general assembly has promptly replaced the sacked executives with the following, Uzo Ogbonna, publicity secretary, Joseph Nwulu, secretary, and Chums Nwachukwu treasurer.\nAccording to the acting publicity secretary, the appointed officials would occupy their respective offices in acting capacities until fresh elections are held to substantively fill these offices.\n", "label": "human"}

I just believe we need a leader that\u2019s committed to bringing us back together, someone who recognizes we have more in common than divides us and especially someone who is going to be real leader not letting themselves be baited into these childish games we see being played out so frequently on various different platforms.\u201d\nBooker has made an early investment in New Hampshire, marked by multiple trips to stump and fundraise for local candidates \u2014 including Morgan \u2014 in the 2018 midterm elections. Booker raised more money for New Hampshire Democrats than any other national Democrat and was recognized by the party in December for doing so, leading the state party chairman Ray Buckley to call him \u201cthe best friend New Hampshire Democrats had in 2018.\u201d\nMorgan noted as much, saying while he\u2019s met many 2020 candidates since January, his relationship with Booker dates back more than a year.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Cory over an extended period of time, he\u2019s been truly committed to the Granite state in a way that others haven\u2019t been,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cHe is going to events where he has hundreds of people and staying until every last person gets their questions answered and has a selfie with them. That is something that I think New Hampshire voters value and I think that is campaigning the New Hampshire way.\u201d\nBooker has already established a New Hampshire headquarters and, since Feb. 1, has already made 27 stops or full-fledged events in the state. His campaign has tallied that Booker interacted with 3,000 New Hampshire residents since his official launch and visited seven of the state\u2019s 10 counties. The early state emphasis is part of a broader strategy by the Booker team that has focused on early state organization, including robust early staffing in Iowa and South Carolina.\nOn Sunday, Booker reported raising $5 million since launching his presidential campaign on Feb. 1, a sum outpaced by at least five of his 2020 rivals. In early national polling, Booker has struggled to break into double digits, regularly trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Kamala Harris.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Morgan was the first New Hampshire state lawmaker to endorse a 2020 candidate.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A panel discussion takes place at the 2018 I Heart Halal festival at Navy Pier. The fest returns to the Pier this weekend, with more panels, vendors and events. | Photo by True Productions\nWhen the organizers of the I Heart Halal festival planned the event\u2019s inaugural year at Navy Pier in 2018, they set a modest goal hoping for 5,000 attendees to show up for the weekend-long celebration. In fact, 17,000 people turned out for the fest.\n\u201cI think people were really hungry for this kind of event,\u201d says co-founder Asma Ahad, who previously worked as a product developer for Kraft Foods in Glenview, where she completed one of the first research studies in North America that looked at halal consumers \u2014 those who abide by food preparation set forth by Muslim law \u2014 and how everyday products resonate with them.\nI HEART HALAL\nWhen: April 12-14 (doors open at 11 am each day)\nWhere: Navy Pier, 600 E. Grand\nTickets: Starting at $10 (in advance)\nInformation: IHeartHalal.com\nAs her research grew, so did the idea for a mass consumer event. Ahad partnered with Salman Chaudry (a former event application developer for the Merchandise Mart who now has his own event firm) to design the festival. Support came from various sponsors including the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, whose goal is to promote avenues for multiculturalism with events like I Heart Halal. It is in fact the only event of its kind in the country that shines a spotlight not just on halal food, but also on halal as a lifestyle concept \u2014 with an extension of the ethically conscious and positive mindfulness ethos to fashion, entertainment, wellness and travel.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to promote halal as not only a belief of Muslim consumers, but that it does resonate with the non-Muslim population as well. Halal offerings fit into the food-conscious movement with products and packaged goods that are sustainably sourced and better for you,\u201d says Ahad, encouraging the greater Chicago community to be part of the weekend, which will take place at Navy Pier April 12-14, with expanded programming on four stages.\n\u201cThe core values of halal really are compassion and being socially conscious and ethical in lifestyle choices; those are values that are universal,\u201d Ahad says. \u201cHow we can all come together and connect on shared values \u2014 that\u2019s the conversation we wanted to have, and also to give people from outside the Muslim community a way to better understand us through our culture and break down barriers and misunderstandings that some might have.\u201d\nBooking a substantial headlining act, Lupe Fiasco, for a Friday night concert certainly helps in that mission. The Chicago-born rapper is a practicing Muslim and, as part of the conscious hip-hop movement, promotes positive messages and social issues in his lyrics. In addition to appearances from rapper Neelam Hakeem and Chicago emcee Kayem, opening Lupe\u2019s set will be Brother Ali, who also follows Islam and whose music is likewise rooted in socially conscious themes with messages of hope and acceptance.\n\u201cIt [might not be] well known to people who\u2019ve only engaged rap music and hip-hop culture through the mainstream media, but hip-hop started as a youth movement that held Islamic teachings and virtues at its core,\u201d says Brother Ali, who was drawn to I Heart Halal due to the event\u2019s work with the Inner-city Muslim Action Network (IMAN) on the South Side of Chicago. \u201cLikewise, wherever Islam has gone, it\u2019s inspired incredible creative energy in the people who embraced it. Hip-hop is the modern voice of Muslims, and Islam is the spiritual heart of hip-hop.\u201d\nAdditional main stage entertainment throughout I Heart Halal includes a Saturday night \u201cAmerica\u2019s Least Wanted\u201d stand-up comedy showcase hosted by Chicago funny man Azhar Usman, with sets from Ismael Loutfi (\u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d), Paul Elia (\u201cConan,\u201d \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d), Danish Maqbool (featured in Forbes and Wall Street Journal), Aron Kader (Axis of Evil Comedy Tour) and Zainab Johnson (\u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers,\u201d \u201cLast Comic Standing\u201d).\nOn Sunday, there will be screenings from the Canadian-based Mosquers Film Festival, which will present four award-winning short films and host a 24-hour short film competition, as well as the Breaking Barriers Pitch Competition, a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style session for up-and-coming startups to win up to $5,000 for their ideas.\nThere will also be plenty of food vendors in the Taste of Halal Food Hall as well as Lettuce Entertain You serving halal-certified food at three onsite restaurants, plus expansive culinary demos including appearances from \u201cMasterChef\u2019s\u201d Amanda Saab and \u201cTop Halal Chef\u201d host Sameer Sarmast.\nThe weekend also offers a family-friendly kids area, lifestyle panels and a comprehensive bazaar with vendors offering halal-sanctioned fashion, beauty, art and travel goods.\nHumaira Syed, the creator of Niswa Fashion, will return to I Heart Halal this year with her latest modest fashion designs showcased on the runway and for sale in the bazaar. Syed started her line in 2016, after a time studying to become an Islamic scholar.\n\u201cI wanted to do something for the community,\u201d Syed says. \u201cFor Muslim women, finding modest wear that\u2019s fully lined with long sleeves and longer lengths can be difficult \u2014 especially for fancier items, like dresses (called abayas) for our holiday Eid, which is coming up in June.\u201d Her latest designs, which will be on display this weekend and are for sale at a Hanover Park store space, incorporate traditional embroidery and sequins like fashion you\u2019d find at a major retailer.\n\u201cWe are as \u2018normal\u2019 as anyone else,\u201d says Syed, disheartened by some of the misconceptions by the media about the Muslim community. \u201cThat\u2019s why I Heart Halal is such a great initiative. It\u2019s a way for people to know more about our culture and show what we are really all about. It\u2019s great exposure for our brands, too. We don\u2019t really have a professional fashion show and this could be something that could open doors for us at events like New York Fashion Week.\u201d\nChaudry agrees. \u201cThe idea of creating community and inclusiveness is built into the fabric of our program. The values of halal are rooted in compassion, and as human beings we are inherently compassionate creatures,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis event is really about coming together in meaningful conversations and making progress as a broad community.\u201d\nSelena Fragassi is a local freelance writer.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The first trailer for A Discovery of Witches premiered all the way back in June 2018, and immediately passionate fans of the first book in Deborah Harkness's bestselling All Souls trilogy were eager to see the adaptation hit the small screen. Unfortunately, for American audiences, the wait for the series has been longer than initially expected \u2014 the first season aired in full on the UK's Sky network months ago but only just premiered on AMC and BBC America in the US on April 7.\nRegardless of whether you're in the US or the UK, you're likely wondering the same thing: will there be a second season of A Discovery of Witches? The short answer is . . . yes! In fact, the series has already been renewed for season three, as well. But details about when either of the seasons will premiere are still murky.\nFor those of you who haven't watched, the fantasy show follows heroine Diana (Hacksaw Ridge actress Teresa Palmer), a professor and reluctant witch who accidentally unlocks an important, enchanted manuscript in Oxford's famed Bodleian library that leads her to cross paths with a handsome, centuries-old vampire named Matthew (The Crown's Matthew Goode). During our recent interview with Palmer about the show, she let slip a few details about what we can expect from season two, which has yet to start shooting.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"What's funny is, I've only skimmed through the second book,\" she explained of Harkness's trilogy. \"So I know it's Elizabethan. I mean, that's what we all know, that the series is going to be set in that time period. But I've purposely made a decision that I was going to wait for the script so that I didn't have any kind of preconceived idea of where the story has to go or fall in love with one particular element that, for whatever reason, I can't end up putting in the show. But we'll definitely get to see Diana use a lot more power, which is fantastic, and an interesting dynamic shift between her and Matthew.\"\nSo, TL;DR \u2014 season two? Happening. Diana becoming even more powerful? Happening. Diana and Matthew frolicking around the Elizabethan era? Happening. And if we take into account when the first season premiered in the UK and the US \u2014 Sept. 14, 2018 and April 7, 2019, respectively \u2014 we can (hopefully) assume the second installment of the series will arrive around the same time period for each.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Beverly Cleary, pictured at the White House in 2003, turns 103 on Friday. Photo illustration by Slate. Images by Tim Sloan/AFP/Getty Images and Dell Yearling.\nBeverly Cleary\u2019s childhood memoir, A Girl From Yamhill, opens with her earliest memory: a day that her mother dragged her by the hand through the streets while church bells rang, telling then-2-year-old Beverly that she must \u201cnever, never forget this day.\u201d Vanishingly few people on earth still remember the day that World War I ended, but Cleary, who turns 103 on Friday, is one of them. She is famous for her children\u2019s books, and probably most famous for the protagonist of many of them, Ramona Quimby, an irrepressible little girl who hates arbitrary rules and condescension from grown-ups. Many have noted Cleary\u2019s ability to take episodes from her childhood and bring them to life in her fiction. But to read A Girl From Yamhill, which was published in 1988, is to see that the line between Ramona\u2019s childhood and Beverly\u2019s isn\u2019t a straight one. While many novelists reimagine their own history to heighten the emotion or exaggerate the events, the Ramona books soften the hard edges of Cleary\u2019s real childhood.\nI read A Girl From Yamhill for the first time when I was about 10, when I had already read\u2014and felt too old for\u2014all the Ramona books but hadn\u2019t yet found the Sweet Valley High series that would occupy me for the rest of middle school. I read the whole memoir in one sitting, on a rainy afternoon, and felt the electrifying feeling that I was reading something very different\u2014darker, more adult\u2014than what I had read in the Ramona books. Plenty of the similarities were obvious, and cute: Young Beverly, like young Ramona, heard the words in the Star-Spangled Banner \u201cdawnzer lee light,\u201d and both ran around the neighborhood on tin-can stilts. But the first time I caught my breath in surprise was at the memoir\u2019s description of a time that a third-grade teacher called the young Beverly a \u201cnuisance\u201d\u2014an episode that I recognized from Ramona Quimby, Age 8. In the Ramona book, though, it was all a misunderstanding, quickly fixed:\n\u201cWhy, Ramona, I can recall saying something about my little show-off, but I meant it affectionately, and I\u2019m sure I never called you a nuisance.\u201d \u201cYes, you did,\u201d insisted Ramona. \u201cYou said I was a show-off, and then you said, \u2018What a nuisance.\u2019 \u201d Ramona could never forget those exact words. Mrs. Whaley, who had looked worried, smiled in relief. \u201cOh, Ramona, you misunderstood,\u201d she said. \u201cI meant that trying to wash egg out of your hair was a nuisance for Mrs. Larson. I didn\u2019t mean that you personally were a nuisance.\u201d\nIn A Girl From Yamhill, though, there is no cheerful reconciliation and no ambiguity in the teacher\u2019s meaning. Beverly asks her teacher about getting a part in a dance that the girls are doing for the PTA (she\u2019s been excluded for being \u201ctoo short\u201d). Her teacher sets her hand on Beverly\u2019s shoulder and talks over her like she\u2019s not there: \u201cThis one,\u201d she says, \u201cis a nuisance.\u201d Cleary writes: \u201cI stared at her in pain, while she looked amused before I turned and fled. \u2026 A nuisance, a nuisance\u2014the word tormented me.\u201d\nGet Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time.\nIn Ramona the Pest, Ramona misunderstands a comment from her teacher and thinks that she \u201ccould never go back to kindergarten because Miss Binney did not love her anymore.\u201d She stays home for a few days, finds herself extremely bored by life without school, and receives a letter from her teacher asking her to come back, which she gladly does. The memoir tells the awful story of the real Beverly\u2019s first schoolteacher, a woman who clearly disliked not only Beverly but all her students and seemed only to take enjoyment from whipping children\u2019s palms with a \u201cmetal-tipped bamboo pointer.\u201d Beverly experienced every day of this school as \u201ca day of fear.\u201d Midway through the year, she comes down with smallpox. \u201cEven a fever and itching scabs,\u201d she writes, \u201cwere better than a day in Miss Falb\u2019s classroom.\u201d Both books capture a child\u2019s deep desire to be accepted by her teacher, but the particulars in the memoir are significantly more brutal\u2014and the acceptance never comes.\nMost heartbreaking of all is comparing the way Cleary writes about parents in her books. In the memoir, she is about 12 when the stock market crashes, and her real-life father loses his job. Upon getting the news:\nI sat filled with anguish, unable to read, unable to do anything. When Dad finally emerged from the bedroom, I felt so awkward I did not know what to say or even how to look at him. To pretend nothing had happened seemed wrong, but seeing him so defeated and ashamed of defeat, even though he was not to blame, was so painful that I could not speak.\nUnemployment is grinding, turning her father \u201cdepressed and irritable.\u201d He flies into a rage when his wife asks him if he wants potato soup for dinner and later slaps the teenage Beverly across her face when she back-talks her mother. Ramona\u2019s father also loses his job and, likewise, is depressed, though that word is, of course, not used\u2014in Ramona and Her Father he is \u201csitting on the couch, smoking and staring into space.\u201d Ramona, upon learning of the news, feels \u201csad and somehow lonely, as if she were left out of something important, because her family was in trouble and there was nothing she could do to help.\u201d But it would be unthinkable in those books for him to raise his voice to the mother or a hand to his children. Likewise, the memoir describes Cleary\u2019s real-life mother in a breathless, wide-ranging list: \u201csmall, pert, vivacious, talkative, fun-loving, excitable, easily fatigued, depressed, discouraged, determined.\u201d Mrs. Quimby could be described as a much shorter list: sometimes exasperated, always steady. It is impossible to imagine Mrs. Quimby saying to Ramona, \u201cYou know, you are the type that will fade quickly,\u201d as her real mother did to her teenage daughter.\nCleary has, of course, been asked if she was like Ramona as a child, and she has answered that she \u201cthought like her\u201d but was much better behaved. Her memoir bears that out. She writes about the adults unflinchingly, but with sympathy, though they are, in her telling, so broken by their circumstances and poverty that they are often petty and cruel to children. In the world of Ramona, the children can be more \u201cbadly behaved\u201d because the adults are stronger, steadier, better than their real-life counterparts; the children in Cleary\u2019s fiction do not live in fear of being called names or beaten.\nCleary has also averred that Ramona is somewhat misunderstood: \u201cIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s naughty,\u201d she has said. \u201cIt\u2019s that things just didn\u2019t work out the way she thought they should.\u201d Like Ramona, Beverly Cleary believes things should have gone differently. Her books are touching looks at the childhood she might have had, should have had, in a better, kinder world.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "State officials on Thursday advocated for a bill that would eliminate religious exemptions for vaccines for children attending any schools in the state.\nThe push for the bill, which was first introduced in 2014, comes as the Rockland County executive declared a state of emergency in the county following an outbreak of measles. There have been 161 confirmed cases of the contagious disease in the county, according to State Sen. Brad Hoylman.\nHoylman, who is sponsoring the current bill in the Senate (Assemb. Jeffrey Dinowtiz is sponsoring the bill in the Assembly), said there have been 259 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens from October 2018 through April 3. The bill would still allow for medical exemptions.\n\"If it's not measles today, it could be mumps or whooping cough at a later date,\" Hoylman said. \"This is about all vaccinations... and the need to get ahead of these outbreaks through sensible science-based vaccination policies.\"\nState Sen.

{"text": "Democratic presidential contenders will make a direct appeal to black activists at a New York City conference starting on Wednesday as they intensify their push for African-American support in the early stages of the 2020 race for the White House.\nA dozen candidates will pitch prescriptions for issues like easing the racial wealth gap, promoting criminal justice and education reform, and repairing a growing racial divide at the three-day National Action Network gathering organized by civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton.\nThe emphasis on courting black voters follows the first decline in their turnout in 20 years in the 2016 presidential election, a key contributor to Democrat Hillary Clinton's stunning loss to Republican Donald Trump.\nThe historically diverse 2020 Democratic field, including black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates as well as a record six women, is tackling an array of issues of interest in the African-American community.\nMany of the more than 15 candidates, including U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, have voiced support for some form of reparations for slavery.\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand has vowed to take on institutional racism, Julian Castro has targeted reform of the criminal justice system and Sen. Bernie Sanders has highlighted his civil rights activism as a youth.\nThe conference will give activists from around the country a chance to judge the candidates in person, Sharpton said.

Tim Burton\u2019s remake of Dumbo became Disney\u2019s fourth number one film at the UK box office this year when it was released in late March, following Mary Poppins Returns, Glass and Captain Marvel.\nThe second half of 2019 is packed with Disney films that look like box-office catnip as well. May sees the release of Aladdin, starring Will Smith, while Toy Story 4 (June) and The Lion King (July) mean that in the summer months Disney will be unavoidable.\nThe year will be capped by the launch of its Disney Plus streaming service, which is due in November and will feature a Marvel TV series starring Tom Hiddleston as Loki and two Star Wars spin-offs: The Mandalorian, and an unnamed Rogue One series starring Narcos actor Diego Luna, who will reprise his role as Cassian Andor.\nDisney Plus will be quickly followed by the sequel to Frozen before Star Wars: Episode IX hits cinemas in December.

{"text": "It seems a lifetime ago that we were issued the prime directive of Game of Thrones: You win or you die. Since then, we've watched our favorite characters (and a whole lot of expendable randos) compete valiantly or end up stabbed, shot, frozen, and burned in the ensuing unpleasantness.\nDeath is the only true god in Westeros and the show reminds us every week. What better way to prepare for Season 8 than to visit the literal ghosts of the past? Mashable combed through all seven seasons (tens of thousands of deaths) to remember the most shocking, brutal, and numerous deaths.\nEnjoy at your own peril.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nGame of Thrones Season 1's murderous ice zombies, almost equally murderous Lannisters, and the death of the show's de facto protagonist set our expectations for just how treacherous Westeros can be.\nMost unexpected: Ned Stark's was the death that shockingly illustrated how unsafe every character is in this world, and his death thrust the seven kingdoms into chaos.\nMost gruesome: Khal Drogo kills his own tribesman Mago by ripping out his tongue after a fight.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nThis season brought death upon Robert Baratheon's bastards (except Gendry) and introduced Jaqen H'ghar's preferred method of killing, a lot of which he did at Harrenhal and then later teaches to Arya. Also purged were Qarth's dramatic leaders The Thirteen, which gave Dany the assets she needed to continue her conquering of Essos slave cities.\nMost unexpected: Renly Baratheon had no real claim to the throne but you gotta admit, he was one of the nicest men on the show. No one expected him to win but he died unexpectedly early thanks to Melisandre's killer shadow baby.\nMost gruesome: No big names are involved but the most underrated grossest death on Thrones come by way of Harrenhal's torturer The Tickler: tying a bucket full of rats around a man\u2019s guts and then setting it on fire, forcing the rats to chew through his body and organs. Sheesh.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nThe Season defined by Red Wedding also included Daenerys decimating slaveowners and a lot of wildling deaths (a preview of what's to come).\nMost unexpected: No matter how early or late you started watching Thrones, you remember exactly where you were when you witnessed the bloody massacre of Catelyn, Robb, and Talisa Stark at the hands of Walder Frey and his Lannister cohorts.\nMost gruesome: Ros, who was always possessed of intellect and ambition beyond her station, was killed off-screen by Joffrey during the sickly sadism he practiced with Baelish's prostitutes. Based on her first encounter with Joffrey, it was not a swift death, and her body is riddled with arrows as she hangs from a post.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nTis' the season of the Battle of Castle Black, Joffrey's long-awaited assassination, and the start of Ramsay Bolton's fatal brutality towards those he dislikes. Lots of important Thrones events occurred here but death toll-wise, it was relatively not the worst.\nMost unexpected: Tywin's death by crossbow while on the privy (thanks, Tyrion!) marked the downfall of the Lannister clan. In the words of George R. R. Martin, \u201cLord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold.\u201d\nMost gruesome: The Mountain gouging out Oberyn's eyes and cracking his skull open like a pi\u00f1ata with his bare hands will go down in history. One of the hardest deaths to watch, tbh.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nThis season had the highest overall death toll with \"Hardhome,\" as well Meereenese fighters and Sons of the Harpy and the decimation of the Baratheon line.\nMost unexpected: You'd think we would have known better than to think anyone was safe on this show, but two years after the Red Wedding Thrones viewers had cautiously begun to trust again. This was naive as Season 5 concluded with Jon being stabbed to death by his own men of the Night's Watch.\nMost gruesome: Meryn Trant meets his comeuppance at Arya's hands in Braavos. You want to pity the gagged man howling for mercy after a teenager stabs him repeatedly in the eyes and chest, but he was also abusing little girls and has been on Arya's list for years.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nSeason 6 will go down as the deadliest in terms of major characters being popped off...at the same goddamn time. Cersei ensured all her enemies burn by wildfire. This season is home to Battle of the Bastards and the end of the Bolton rule on the North (finally!) as well as Arya's return to her motherland and killing off Walder Frey.\nMost unexpected: I'm still not over Hodor's surprising (and emotional) end. No one saw it coming but understandably, he gave up his life to save Bran and Meera from the icy undead. His death opened up even more time traveling possibilities and theories for the show.\nMost gruesome: Ramsay Bolton died a satisfactory but ghastly death. Eaten alive by his own starving dogs? Horrendous but well-deserved.\nImage: mashable/bob al-greene\nAs Thrones braced internally for the end, it felt like we lost the looming risk of earlier seasons in which a major character could drop dead at any moment. In Season 7, not a single major or main character died, more than likely because Thrones was saving them for the final showdown.\nMost unexpected: Bad guys rarely get what's coming to them in Game of Thrones, which made it immensely satisfying to watch the conniving Petyr Baelish slain before the Stark sisters he betrayed so many times over.\nMost gruesome: The death of Viserion at the hands of the Night King was also shocking, and boy, that was a lot of blood.\nGame of Thrones returns April 14.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Lydia Fenet does it all. She works full time at Christie's auction house, just wrote her first book and has three kids under the age of 6. She gracefully moves from the boardroom to the playroom, solving problems and cleaning up messes with a calm, can-do attitude.\nSo when she recently found her 2-year-old daughter Eloise pouring a bottle of green nail polish onto a cream-colored carpet, she did not yell or scream, but rather did what most people do: She frantically channeled her energy into rubbing it with stain remover. When the stain did not come out, she just flipped the carpet around, hiding the damaged portion under her daughter's bunk bed. On another occasion, her son's\ncontainer of sparkly purple slime cracked open and sat overnight, drying on her living room rug.\n\"I am terrible in these situations because even though I know what I am doing is wrong, I do it anyway,\" she said. \"In the case of purple slime, I immediately dumped a ton of water on it, which, I learned after calling a professional rug cleaner, is exactly what you don't want to do.\"\nAlthough Fenet didn't tackle the stains using the best cleaning practices, she did deal with her children using the best parenting practices: She did not lose her temper. \"I have resigned myself to the fact that with children comes a fair amount of nail polish, slime, sticky fingers and haircuts that do not come from a licensed professional.\"\nThe first thing you should do when your child makes a mess is breathe through your initial reaction, says Shelby Riley, a licensed marriage and family therapist and owner and director of Shelby Riley, LMFT and Associates in Chester Springs, Pa. \"If you can stay calm, your child will feel less defensive and they'll be more open to learning from the experience.\" Riley advises that you should narrate back to your child what you see (in your most neutral voice) -- \"I see there's purple slime on the carpet\" -- then explain that slime sticks to everything, so it should be used only in the kitchen or outside. Then involve your child in the cleanup. \"Let them experience some of the pain and hardship that comes with cleaning; it will help them remember not to do it again,\" Riley says.\nI wish I had met Fenet before the nail polish or slime incidents. As a longtime magazine editor and mother of two, I've learned a lot about cleaning over the years. Here are some of my best solutions for clothes, fabrics, walls and carpets -- the spots where kids tend to make the biggest messes.\n\u2022 Stains should be treated as soon as possible; that doesn't mean you should follow your child around with a Clorox pen, but the sooner you treat a stain with a stain remover such as Shout or OxiClean, the better chance you have of removing it.\n\u2022 Never rub a stain; blot or dab it using clean white towels or paper towels. Rubbing a stain will only work the dirt deeper into the fibers. When dabbing, rotate to a clean side of the towel as you blot so you don't spread the stain.\n\u2022 Always wash a stained item in the hottest water that the fabric will allow (with the exception of protein-based stains -- see below). Hot water will help to loosen and remove dirt.\n\u2022 Check to see whether a stain has disappeared before you put it in the dryer; dry heat will \"bake\" the stain into the fibers. If you have a stubborn stain that doesn't come out after one wash, treat it again with a stain remover and re-wash.\n\u2022 When using harsh chemicals such as nail polish remover or hair spray or to remove a stain, make sure you try it on a hidden area first; it could damage the color of the fibers.\nCommon messes:\n\u2022 Protein-based stains: Formula, milk, diaper accidents, blood -- all of these are protein-based stains, so the first thing you want to do is soak the item in cold water for about 20 minutes to loosen the stain (if you soak these stains in hot water, you risk baking in the stain). Remove the item from the water and treat the stain with a dab of an enzyme-based detergent such as Biz, Era Plus, Wisk or Axion and let it sit for 30 minutes. If the stain persists, dab it with some diluted white vinegar or diluted ammonia to lighten the stain. Machine wash.\n\u2022 Urine: For clothing, rinse the item in cold water, then wash in a normal cycle. For mattresses, first blot the area with towels. In a spray bottle, combine one part white vinegar to two parts water. Spray the mixture over the affected area, then blot with towels. Cover the area in baking soda and let it sit for eight to 10 hours. Vacuum the baking soda, then allow it to dry completely.\n\u2022 Colorful foods: Think sweet potatoes, berries, grape juice, ketchup and mustard. You can remove most of these stains by treating them with a pre-wash stain remover, then washing the item with detergent in hot water (if the item can withstand the heat). After washing, if the stain persists, dab it with some diluted white vinegar or diluted ammonia to lighten the stain. Machine wash. (This advice goes for grass stains, too.)\n\u2022 Crayon: For stains on clothing, place the item stain-side down on a clean white cloth or stack of paper towels. Spray with WD-40 or Goo Gone and let sit for several minutes. Turn the item over and apply WD-40 to the other side of the stain and let set for several more minutes. Dab the stain on both sides with some dishwashing detergent and wash in hot water. Remove crayon marks from painted or wallpapered walls with a dry cleaning sponge or a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.\n\u2022 Acrylic or water-based paint: Dab off as much as you can with a paper towel. Sponge on a solution of liquid laundry detergent and warm water to soften the paint. Scrape off as much of the paint as you can with a dull knife. Rinse and repeat. If the stain persists, apply a small amount of hair spray, rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover to the spot and allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Blot with clean dry cloths. Repeat until the stain is gone. For clothing, machine wash. For carpets, run a steam vacuum cleaner over the spot or flush the spot with cold water and blot until most of the moisture is removed.\n\u2022 Chalk: Shake the item outside to remove as much of the chalk as possible. Lay the clothing on a clean white towel and blot the spot with rubbing alcohol. Rinse thoroughly. Dab the spot with liquid laundry detergent. Machine wash.\n\u2022 Play-Doh: Do not use hot water or cleaning solutions of any kind. Allow Play-Doh to dry completely, loosen it with a stiff brush, then vacuum up the pieces. If necessary, dab the area with a gentle soap and cold water.\n\u2022 Slime: To remove slime (homemade or store-bought), first remove as much as you can with your hands. Mix two parts white vinegar with one part water in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture on the slime and allow it to soak, then blot the area with paper towels or a clean white cloth. Keep spraying and blotting until the slime is gone.\n\u2022 Nail polish: Use paper towel or a clean towel to dab up as much of the wet nail polish as possible. Once you've absorbed the excess, spray a small amount of nonacetone nail polish remover on the stain (you can use an acetone variety, but make sure you test it on a hidden area, because it can be very harsh and damage your rug). Dab the area with clean paper towels until the stain is lifted. Rinse with cold water and mild soap.\nMayhew, a Today show style expert and former magazine editor, is the author of Flip! for Decorating.\nHomeStyle on 04/13/2019\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed has said the federal government will not remove subsidy at this moment because there are no buffers to cushion the effects.\nThe minister made the commitment yesterday at the closing press briefing at the annual IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United United States of America.\nThe minister who was flanked at the briefing by the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, and the Ministry of Budget and National Planning, Sen. Udoma Udo Udoma said plausible as the argument to remove subsidy sounds, Nigeria isn't ready for it at this time.\n\"There is no eminent plan to remove fuel subsidy, \" she declared.\nShe explained further that the FG has \"no plan to remove fuel subsidy. If we have to remove subsidy, we will be working with various groups to look at the alternatives. We discuss this very frequently at the economic management team but we haven't found the viable alternatives so we are not yet at the point of removing subsidy,\" she said.\n\"We are here to discuss with the global community on various policy issues. One of the issues that always come up in the report especially, the IFM Article Four Report, is how we handle fuel subsidies. The IMF will say fuel subsidies are better removed so you could use the resources for other important sectors. In principle that is a fact to do so.\nBut in Nigeria we don't have any plans to remove fuel subsidy at this time because we have not yet designed buffers that will enable us to remove the subsidy and provide cushions for our people\" she noted.\nSpeaking on other matters, the minister said the process of issuing a second green bond N15 billion later this year to finance various sectors in agriculture, power, health and water resources.\nThe first green bond of over N10bn she said was a success. \"The projects that were scheduled to be financed by the green bonds have been so financed so it's fully drawn and performed. The projects are at various levels of completion\" she assured.\nOn a broader scale of climate finance she said 'in view of our efforts as Finance ministers who play a key role in steering the economy and managing risks, including from climate change, climate finance, we were invited to join the coalition of climate Finance Ministers a coalition of Finance Ministers with long experience with climate actions and are well aligned with the Principles of the Coalition. Nigeria endorsed the Coalition Principles as one of the founding members\" she said.\nOn Nigeria's human capacity development she noted that last year \"when the human capital project was released, many of us were concerned that Nigeria was placed 157 out of 189 and I did promise that we would go back home and address this issue, I am happy to report that we used this Spring Meetings to show case what the government is doing in this important area. We have set up an inter-ministerial working group with representatives of the State Governors and are currently piloting some initiatives in health, education and of course you are all aware of the social safety nets programs of the Federal Government where we have 15 million people already on the register,\" she said .\nMeanwhile, despite assurances of availability of Premium Motor Spirit by Federal Government, many petrol stations in Lagos, Oyo, Ogun and Osun states were not selling the product yesterday, the Daily Trust can reports.\nA NAN correspondent who went round the Osun State capital and its environs on Sunday reports that many of the petrol stations were under lock and key.\nMeanwhile, the few petrol stations selling the product in the aforementioned states had long queues of vehicles.\nTayo Arowolo, a fuel attendant in one of the filling stations visited in Osun said the scarcity of the product was as a result of inability of many of the Independent marketers to lift the product at the Lagos depot.\nArowolo said most petrol stations in the state were hoarding the products and selling to motorists at a particular time while others stopped selling earlier than expected.\nHe said that if the situation was not urgently addressed, it would bring untold hardship on the people.\nMr Yusuf Ayinla, a motorist who was on the queue at Cornoil filling station at Old Garage, Osogbo, said it was sad that petrol stations were hoarding the product thereby creating artificial scarcity.\nAyinla, however, implored the appropriate authorities to do the needful before things become more difficult for the common man.\nAnother motorist, Mr Ayo Adeyanju, said many commercial drivers were taking advantage of the scarcity to increase transport fares.\nAdeyanju appealed to government to intervene in the situation before it gets out of hand.\nBut the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) yesterday said based average daily supply of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) which it noticed has increased this year, there was no need for Nigerians to panic over\nThe Executive Secretary of the PPPRA Abdulkadir Saidu in a statement said the Agency has observed the sudden re-appearance of queues at some filling stations over speculation of short fall in the supply of PMS otherwise called petrol.\n\"PPPRA in line with its mandate to regulate petroleum products supply and distribution as well as establish an industry data bank has continued to monitor products supply in the sector in line with best practices. Thus, PMS average daily supply for the year 2017, 2018 and 2019 are about 46 million, 54 million and 56 million litres respectively. These indicate an improved level of supply in 2019,\" Saidu said.\n\"Based on the available data, there is adequate supply of PMS with over 21 days sufficiency.

{"text": "An agreement was announced Wednesday between the state of Vermont and the owner of a closed industrial site blamed for contaminating drinking water supplies in the Bennington area.\nAn agreement announced Wednesday between the state of Vermont and the owner of a closed industrial site blamed for contaminating drinking water supplies should bring relief to a few hundred homeowners in the Bennington area.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a result we can all be proud of,\u201d said Peter Walke, the deputy secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.\nWalke and other state leaders announced a final agreement with the company Saint-Gobain to bring clean water to contaminated properties on the east side of Bennington.\n\u201cClean drinking water is a basic human right, and the people of Bennington County deserved it,\u201d said Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan.\nFor three years, many in the area have been drinking bottled water and cooking with filtered water, because a manmade chemical known as PFOA was found to have crept into private water wells.\nThe old factory blamed for the contamination used that chemical to produce non-stick fabrics.\nDepending on the amount of exposure, the substance has been linked to health problems like low birth weights and certain types of cancer.\n\u201cI always took it for granted that I had clean drinking water,\u201d remarked Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington County. \u201cAnd when I see people just down the street from me without clean drinking water, it\u2019s pretty scary.\u201d\nA previous deal saw Saint-Gobain paying roughly $20 million to extend safe municipal water lines to more than 200 Bennington properties whose wells were affected, like Ellen LaPlante\u2019s place.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud to be a Vermonter, and having such high standards for our water,\u201d LaPlante told necn in December of 2017 when a new water line started piping safe drinking water to her home.\nUnder the agreement announced Wednesday, there\u2019s going to be another $20-25 million of construction this year and next. Saint-Gobain will cover most of it, state officials said, but the state will chip in about a fifth of the price of laying new water pipes to 200-plus homes and businesses.\nThat safe municipal supply can\u2019t reach everyone, though, so some people will have fresh wells dug.

{"text": "HELSINKI -- Finland's Social Democratic Party retained a narrow lead to emerge as the top parliamentary election vote-getter Sunday, trailed closely by the populist Finns Party after most votes were counted.\nThe Social Democrats secured 40 seats in Finland's 200-member parliament based on a preliminary tally of more than 94 percent of ballots. The euroskeptic Finns won 39 after campaigning on the message that the Finnish government shouldn't overdo its efforts to combat climate change.\nThe election, held six weeks ahead of elections to the European Union's legislature, was being watched in Europe for indications of how a broad bloc of euroskeptic parties might do across the EU.\nThe Finns Party is part of an alliance of populist parties that aims to become the strongest faction in the European Parliament and to radically transform European Union policies on migration, security, family and environment.\nIn Finland, the nearly complete preliminary vote count gave the conservative National Coalition Party 37 seats and outgoing Prime Minister Juha Sipila's Center Party 31.\nThe Center Party lost more support than any other party compared with Finland's last election in 2015, apparently punished by voters for failing to push through an ambitious health care and social care overhaul.\nThe election came after a campaign in which concerns about climate change even overshadowed the issue of how to overhaul the nation's generous welfare model.\nFinland, a European Union member of 5.5 million people, has one-third of its territory above the Arctic Circle. Most political parties support government actions to curb global warming.\nPre-election policy debates over what and how much the Nordic country should do revealed disagreement among voters. The Finns Party railed against public sacrifices in the name of fighting climate change. It put less focus on immigration than anti-migrant, euroskeptic counterparts elsewhere in Europe have done in recent years.\n\"For everybody, it's about the climate. It's kind of a climate election. Everybody's feeling some kind of a depression about it,\" voter Sofia Frantsi, 27, an interior architect from Helsinki, told The Associated Press on Sunday.\nVoters chose between 2,500 candidates from 19 political parties and movements for the Eduskunta legislature's 200 seats.\nThe party with the most votes typically tries to form a new government with other parties as partners. A Cabinet made up of ministers from different political parties is a long-standing tradition in Finland.\nThe opposition Social Democratic Party, which has traditionally attracted working-class voters, favors raising taxes and increasing spending to overhaul a costly Nordic social and health care system that is under strain with one of the most rapidly aging populations worldwide.\nSocial Democratic Party leader Antti Rinne, a former finance minister and union leader, said after casting his ballot that all coalition options remained on the table if his party wins the most votes but that Finland's government needs to have \"the same value base.\"\nThe Social Democrats also back the pro-European Union policies of Finland, which uses the shared euro currency but is not a NATO member. Finland shares an 830-mile border with Russia.\nRural voters and other residents who feel that the climate change plans of other leading parties require too much sacrifice have been part of the momentum of the populist Finns Party.\n\"We want a more moderate and sensible climate policy that does not chase industries away from Finland to countries like China,\" party Chairman Halla-aho said Sunday at a Helsinki polling station.\nImmigration remains a key policy issue, Halla-aho said.\nGreenpeace Finland called Sunday's vote the \"climate election,\" saying that \"never before has climate and the limits of planet Earth been discussed with such seriousness in Finland.\"\nThe environmental group cited a recent nationwide poll in which 70 percent of respondents said tackling climate change and reducing carbon footprints should be key priorities of the new government.\nFinland is boosting its production of nuclear energy by launching a new nuclear power plant next year. Finnish lawmakers last month voted to phase out burning coal as an energy source to end it by 2029.\nOther proposals include increasing the number of electric vehicles on Finland's roads and reducing meat consumption through taxes or serving more vegetarian food as part of publicly funded meals in places like schools and the military.\nInformation for this article was contributed by Olli Kangas and Vanessa Gera of The Associated Press.\nA Section on 04/15/2019\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nSabrina's conflict with the Dark Lord may be wrapped up for the moment, but more dangers lie ahead in The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3. The Netflix series is actually divided up into \"Parts\" rather than seasons, with Part 1 and Part 2 (plus the Christmas special) supposedly making up one season split into two, in an imitation of traditional TV shows with midseason hiatuses. However, for simplicity's sake we're going to refer to the next batch of episodes as season 3.\nKiernan Shipka stars in the show as Sabrina Spellman, a half-mortal witch who lives with her Aunts Zelda (Miranda Otto) and Hilda (Lucy Davis) in the Spellman Mortuary in the spooky town of Greendale. Sabrina finds herself torn between her mortal life, school, and friends, and her duty to the coven and to her studies at the Academy of Unseen Arts.\nRelated: Every Riverdale Connection in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Season 2\nLike its sister show, Riverdale, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is based on Archie Comics and was created by Archie CCO Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. It's a lot darker and more gruesome than the sitcom adaptation Sabrina the Teenage Witch, which ran on ABC in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and this new take on Sabrina has garnered an enthusiastic fanbase. Here's what we know about The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3 so far.\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina Season 3 Renewal\nThe first season of the show was such a success that Netflix didn't wait long to start making plans for The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3. The show was renewed for a further 16 episodes back in December 2018, and as before those 16 episodes will be split up into two parts, which means we're getting season 4 as well. In a statement regarding The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's season 3 and 4 renewal, Aguirre-Sacasa said:\n\"Praise Satan! I\u2019m so grateful to my partners at Warner Brothers, Netflix, Berlanti Television, and Archie Productions for supporting this darker vision of the world\u2019s most famous teen witch.And I\u2019m thrilled to be continuing to tell Sabrina\u2019s chilling adventures with our incredible cast and crew, led by the unstoppable Kiernan Shipka.\"\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina Season 3 Release Date Info\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3 will begin filming in Vancouver on April 29th, 2019, and will film back-to-back with season 4 through to fall 2019. Seasons 1 and 2 had a similar filming schedule, beginning in mid-March 2018, but those two seasons had two extra episodes apiece, so filming for The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina seasons 3 and 4 should take less time. Assuming that production on season 3 wraps up in the summer, we could see a premiere date similar to season 1, at the end of October 2019, with season 4 then arriving in spring 2020.\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina Season 3 Story Details\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 2\nIn the final scene of the season 2 finale, Sabrina lays out the mission for The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3: to go to Hell and rescue her boyfriend. Poor old Nick Scratch sacrificed himself by offering up his body as a prison for the Dark Lord after the Acheron Configuration failed to contain him. Lilith - as the newly crowned Queen of Hell - carried Nick's unconscious body into Hell with her, promising not to let any harm come to him. Still, playing host to the devil himself is pretty harmful, so who can blame Sabrina for wanting to get her boyfriend back?\nBeyond that, there are a number of dangling plot threads. Father Blackwood has fled with his twins after attempting to wipe out the Church of Night, and it looks like Prudence and Ambrose will be teaming up to track him down and kill him. After all, there's no better witch hunter than a witch. As for the Church of Night (or what's left of it), Aunt Zelda has appointed herself High Priestess, and it's suggested that they might rebrand as the Church of Lilith. There's no longer a Dark Lord to worship, and with Blackwood's rigid patriarchal influence gone the coven may well become dominated by witches rather than warlocks.\nOne thing's for sure: the status quo has changed, and we'll be looking at a new Greendale in The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3 - for better or worse.\nMore: Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina Part 2 Review\nThe Most Brutal Reviews of Hellboy\n", "label": "human"}

The cast: a tabloid seeking to cash in on the zeitgeist with gutter journalism; a national treasure who found himself shredded on the front page as if he\u2019s Australia\u2019s answer to Harvey Weinstein; a Federal Court judge who vindicates the wronged man; an actress who finds herself shredded so he can be vindicated.\nLike King Lear, it\u2019s a tragedy.\nOn Thursday, Justice Michael Wigney found The Daily Telegraph had defamed Rush over two articles alleging the actor was involved in \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d towards an unnamed co-star during the 2015-16 production of King Lear. In his judgment Wigney wrote it was not for the court to \u201cprovide some broader social commentary on sexual harassment in the theatre or entertainment industry in Australia, or the #MeToo movement\u201d.\nBut while I applaud his decision, much of his reasoning invites precisely the kind of social commentary that #MeToo has unleashed.

{"text": "After living under a grant of asylum in London\u2019s Ecuadorian embassy for nearly seven years, WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange was forcibly ejected and arrested by British police on April 11. Ecuador\u2019s president, Lenin Moreno, accused Assange of \u201crepeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols.\u201d After an anonymous source revealed the \u201cINA Papers,\u201d a dossier that implicated Moreno in money laundering and contained personal photos of his family, WikiLeaks tweeted about it but denied any connection to the hacking.\nRafael Correa, who was president of Ecuador until 2017, had granted Assange asylum in 2012 to protect him from extradition to the United States to answer for WikiLeaks\u2019s publication of evidence of U.S. war crimes. Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister at the time, Ricardo Patino, said that without this protection, Assange could suffer \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d or extradition to the U.S. where he might face the death penalty.\nIn 2010, WikiLeaks published classified documentation of U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning had provided. It included the \u201cCollateral Murder Video\u201d that showed U.S. soldiers in an Army helicopter gunship kill 12 unarmed civilians walking down a street in Baghdad.\nSweden investigated Assange in fall 2010 for allegations of sexual assault. Assange was living in Britain at the time. Sweden issued an extradition warrant so Assange could face questioning about the investigation in Sweden. Assange fought extradition but lost in Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in June 2012. He sought and received refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\nIn spite of pressure from the British government, in August 2012, Correa granted asylum to Assange, who has remained in the Ecuadorian embassy ever since. Sweden dropped its investigation of Assange in 2017.\nThe Trump Administration Indicts Assange\nAssange\u2019s arrest comes thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pursue WikiLeaks. The Obama administration refrained from indicting Assange for fear of establishing \u201ca precedent that could chill investigative reporting about national security matters by treating it as a crime,\u201d according to Charlie Savage of The NewYork Times. Obama\u2019s government had difficulty distinguishing between what WikiLeaks did and what traditional news media organizations like the Times \u201cdo in soliciting and publishing information they obtain that the government wants to keep secret,\u201d Savage wrote. News organizations, including the Times, published articles that drew on documents WikiLeaks had published in 2010, including \u201clogs of significant combat events in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\u201d\nBut the Trump administration decided to come after Assange. In 2017, then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo said,\n\u201cWikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service.\u201d\nAn indictment filed on March 6, 2018, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia charges Assange under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It alleges he was part of a conspiracy to access a computer without authorization in order to obtain classified information that \u201ccould be used to the injury of the United States.\u201d Assange faces five years in prison if convicted.\nAssange\u2019s April 11 arrest was based on two grounds: failure to appear on a British warrant in 2012, and a warrant of extradition to face indictment in the United States. After his arrest, Assange was taken before a British judge and pleaded not guilty to failing to surrender to the court in 2012. District Judge Michael Snow convicted Assange, who now faces 12 months in prison in the U.K. for that offense. This is unrelated to the charges Assange would face in the United States.The indictment says Manning provided WikiLeaks with 90,000 \u201cwar-related significant activity reports\u201d about Afghanistan, 400,000 about Iraq, 800 Guant\u00e1namo detainee \u201cassessment briefs\u201d and 250,000 U.S. State Department cables. WikiLeaks published the vast majority in 2010 and 2011. The indictment alleges Assange helped Manning attempt to crack a password to make it harder to identify Manning as the source of the classified information.\nU.K. Should Deny Extradition of Assange to the U.S.\nMeanwhile, Assange vows to fight extradition to the United States. Under the 2003 extradition treaty between the U.S. and the U.K., the U.K. can deny extradition if the offense sought is punishable by death. The U.S. Justice Department is apparently planning to file new charges against Assange, in addition to those listed in the 2018 indictment. But under the 2003 treaty, the United States cannot charge Assange with violation of the Espionage Act, because it carries the death penalty.\nMoreover, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment forbids extradition to a country where there are substantial grounds to believe the person would be in danger of being tortured.\nThe danger of torture in the U.S. is real. During the first 11 months of Manning\u2019s incarceration in 2010, she was held in solitary confinement and subjected to humiliating forced nudity during daily inspection. The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture called Manning\u2019s treatment cruel, inhuman and degrading, possibly rising to the level of torture.\nThere is thus good reason to believe Assange might be subjected to such illegal treatment if he were extradited to the United States.\nA few days before Assange\u2019s removal from the embassy and arrest, Nils Metzer, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, warned that extradition to the U.S. \u201ccould expose him to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights, including his freedom of expression, his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\nAssange\u2019s Indictment Will Chill Freedom of the Press\nAssange\u2019s prosecution is unprecedented.\n\u201cThe Justice Department has never charged journalists with violating the law for doing their jobs,\u201d Savage wrote. \u201cReporting on leaked materials, including reporting on classified information, is an essential role of American journalism,\u201d the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a statement.\nThe ACLU\u2019s Ben Wizner cautioned that prosecuting Assange \u201cwould set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public\u2019s interest.\u201d He added that \u201cwhile there is no First Amendment right to crack a government password, this indictment characterizes as \u2018part of\u2019 a criminal conspiracy the routine and protected activities journalists often engage in as part of their daily jobs, such as encouraging a source to provide more information.\u201d\nKristinn Hrafnsson, editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, responded to Assange\u2019s indictment, saying,\n\u201cThis is journalism. It\u2019s called \u2018conspiracy.\u2019 It\u2019s conspiracy to commit journalism.\u201d\nReporters Without Borders, an organization that protects freedom of the press, called on the U.K. to oppose extradition of Assange. It would \u201cset a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the U.S. may wish to pursue in the future.\u201d\nThe 2003 treaty between the U.S. and the U.K. prohibits extradition if the request is \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d That limitation is certainly at play here: Trump administration has made a political decision to single out WikiLeaks and make it an example. The administration wishes to send a message to other press organizations that they publish material critical of U.S. policy at their peril.\nThe U.K. must deny the extradition of Assange to the United States.\n*\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons below.

The round \u2014 which saw Viola Ventures, Clal Insurance, GF Investments, Siam Commercial Bank\u2019s Digital Ventures, and former chairman and CEO of American Express and Pagaya board member Harvey Golub participate \u2014 brings the New York and Tel Aviv startup\u2019s total raised to $119.3, according to Crunchbase, following an earlier $20 million venture capital round and $75 million in debt financing.\nCEO Gal Krubiner said the cash infusion will fuel development of its technology and enable Pagaya to pursue real estate and other fixed-income assets like auto loans, mortgages, and corporate credit, and to expand its engineering team of about 20 data scientists and AI specialists. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have the continued support of our investors. We are seeing the amazing potential of AI to disrupt asset management, and this capital will accelerate our effort,\u201d he said. \u201c[Pagaya] provide[s] cutting-edge opportunities to our partners, paving the way for practical uses of AI in the \u2026 market, [and we] look forward to creating more opportunities like this in the future [and] to driving the adoption of AI in traditional finance.\u201d\nPagaya was founded in 2016 by CTO Avital Pardo, a former Fundbox data scientist and Israel Defense Forces senior analyst; Krubiner, who\u2019s held various roles at Deutsche Bank; and Yahav Yulzari, the owner of real estate development company Galya Global. The trio sought to apply machine intelligence to securitization \u2014 the conversion of an asset (usually a loan) into marketable securities (like mortgage-backed securities) that are sold to other investors \u2014 and loan collateralization.\nToward that end, Pagaya eschews the traditional method of securitizing pools of previously assembled asset-backed securities (ABS) for a more bespoke approach. It employs AI to select and buy individual loans by analyzing emerging alternative asset classes, assessing their risk, and drawing on \u201cmillions\u201d of signals to predict their returns.\nIn February, Pagaya announced that it was issuing and overseeing $100 million in actively managed ABS led by structuring agent Cantor Fitzgerald, which brought its total assets under management to $450 million. It\u2019s targeting close to $1 billion in managed assets by year-end, and counts Israeli banks Hapoalim and Leumi, European banks and Israeli insurers, and Citi among its customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen first-hand what the Pagaya team can accomplish,\u201d said Dan Petrozzo, venture partner at Oak HC/FT and a veteran of Goldman Sachs and Fidelity Investments. \u201cInstitutions looking for stable investment solutions with higher returns will continue to turn to Pagaya as there is just no one else creating comparable opportunities.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "When Ahmed Khalil ran out of work as a van driver in the Iraqi city of Mosul three years ago, he signed up with the Islamic State group's police force, believing the salary would help keep his struggling family afloat.\nBut what he wound up providing was a legacy that would outlast his job, and his life.\nIn Mosul and elsewhere across Iraq, thousands of families \u2013 including Mr. Khalil's widow and children \u2013 face crushing discrimination because their male relatives were seen as affiliated with or supporting ISIS when the extremists held large swaths of the country.\nThe wives, widows, and children have been disowned by their relatives and abandoned by the state. Registrars refuse to register births to women with suspected ISIS husbands, and schools will not enroll their children. Mothers are turned away from welfare, and mukhtars \u2013 community mayors \u2013 won't let the families move into their neighborhoods.\nThe Islamic State group's \"caliphate\" that once spanned a third of both Iraq and Syria is now gone but as Iraq struggles to rebuild after the militants' final defeat and loss of their last sliver of territory in Syria earlier this year, the atrocities and the devastation they wreaked has left deep scars.\n\"They say my father was Daesh,\" said Safa Ahmed, Mr. Khalil's 11-year old daughter, referring to ISIS by its Arabic name. \"It hurts me.\"\nIraq has done little to probe the actions of the tens of thousands of men such as Mr. Khalil who, willingly or by force, joined, worked, and possibly fought for ISIS during its 2013-2017 rule. Instead, bureaucrats and communities punish families for the deeds of their relatives in a time of war.\nMr. Khalil was killed in an airstrike in Mosul, in February 2017, during the U.S.-backed campaign to retake the city that ISIS seized in 2014. It was liberated in July 2017 at a tremendous cost \u2013 around 10,000 residents were believed to have been killed in the assault, and its historic districts now lie in ruins.\nHis widow, Um Yusuf, and their seven children were left to bear the stigma of his ISIS affiliation. She cannot get social assistance, and her teenage son Omar is being turned away from jobs.\nThey live in an abandoned schoolhouse, living on what they can make selling bread on the streets of the devastated city. Just three of the children are in school \u2013 the oldest two dropped out because of bullying about their father, and the youngest two cannot enroll because the civil registrar's office won't issue their IDs.\n\"It's true their father made a mistake,\" Um Yusuf said. \"But why are these children being punished for his sin?\"\nUnder Iraq's patrimonial family laws, a child needs a named father to receive a birth certificate and an identity card to enroll in school and to claim citizenship, welfare benefits, and an inheritance.\nBut in post-ISIS Iraq, virtually every bureaucratic procedure now includes a security check on a woman's male relatives, further frustrating mothers and children.\nA United Nations report this year estimates there are 45,000 undocumented children in Iraq. Judges and human rights groups say an urgent resolution is needed or the country risks rearing a generation of children without papers or schooling.\n\"By punishing entire families, you marginalize them and you seriously undermine reconciliation efforts in Iraq,\" said Tom Peyre-Costa, a spokesman for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which provides legal aid to Mosul mothers struggling to get their children ID papers.\nAt Al-Iraqiya school in western Mosul, one of the city's first to reopen in 2017, principal Khalid Mohammad said he faces pressure from the community to deny enrollment to children whose fathers are in jail or missing \u2013 an absence many interpret as proof of ISIS affiliation.\n\"If anyone complains and someone is sent to investigate, I could lose my job,\" he said.\nAt a legal office and clinic supported by the Norwegian Refugee Council, Nour Ahmed was looking for a way to claim legal custody of her undocumented younger son, in order to collect food and fuel aid for the family.\nHer husband, she said, was abducted two years ago in Mosul by a group of pro-government militiamen who likely thought he was an ISIS member. Ms. Ahmed insists he wasn't. He has been missing to this day.\nBorn in 2016 at a hospital run by ISIS, their son was given a birth certificate notarized by the Islamic State group. As Iraq doesn't recognize ISIS documents, the 3-year-old has no legal mother or father.\nMs. Ahmed was told she would need to find her husband to re-register her son's birth. If she submitted a missing person's report, it would raise questions about the child's parentage, jeopardizing his right to citizenship.\n\"I just want to find him,\" said Ms. Nour.\nAdnan Chalabi, an appeals court judge, said he sees more than a dozen cases each day related to civilian documentation, brought largely by the wives, widows, or divorcees of ISIS suspects. There is little he can do to help, he said, without a change to the law first.\n\"Daesh held the city for three years. Did people stop getting married, divorced, and having children during those three years?\" he said. \"We need a legislative solution.\"\nThere is little appetite to change the country's family and patrimony laws, said Iraq's parliament speaker, Mohamad Halbousi, though there is a proposal to open civil registries for a limited period, to register undocumented children.\n\"These families need to be cared for. They cannot be left to melt away into society,\" he said.\nOutside a mosque in Mosul, where Um Yusuf was selling bread with her children, the widowed mother of seven said she was losing the strength to look after her family.\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

{"text": "Captain America wasn\u2019t the first character introduced into the MCU, but he is arguably the most important (or, at the very least, he\u2019s tied with Iron Man and Thor). It was about time he came to the big screen; he\u2019s the leader of the Avengers and an all-round fantastic character.\nRELATED: Pratt vs Evans vs Hemsworth: 3 Reasons Why Each Is Marvel's Best Chris\nIn Tony Stark\u2019s words, Steve Rogers is \u201ca living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.\u201d But then he also called him \u201ca laboratory experiment.\u201d Point is, we\u2019ve followed this guy on an incredible journey over the past eight years since his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut. With Chris Evans leaving the MCU after Avengers: Endgame, bringing Cap\u2019s 78-year character arc to an end, here are The 10 Most Important Scenes In Captain America\u2019s MCU Journey.\nContinue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n10 Steve dives on a dummy grenade\nWhen the U.S. Army is looking for a candidate to test out their super-soldier serum on, Tommy Lee Jones suggests a big, strong, well-built man in favor of the 90 lb Steve Rogers, who\u2019s struggling to get through a simple training exercise. But he\u2019s told they\u2019re looking for attributes \u201cbeyond the physical.\u201d\nSo, Jones tosses a dummy grenade down and all the other guys \u2013 including the one he vouched for \u2013 flee. However, Steve dives on the grenade and tells everyone to get back, showing that he\u2019s quick-thinking and prepared to sacrifice himself for others. This is the moment it\u2019s decided that he\u2019ll be Captain America, setting off his character arc.\n9 The super-soldier serum is injected\nFor the first few scenes of Captain America: The First Avenger, we have to look at weird, scrawny CGI Chris Evans. He has the patriotic spirit of Captain America, but he doesn\u2019t yet have the body. That all changes when he\u2019s injected with the super-soldier serum and turned into the U.S. Army\u2019s ultimate fighting machine.\nIn reference to this moment, Tony Stark would later tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.\u201d Those are pretty harsh words, and he would later say nice things to undo the damage, but either way, the super-soldier serum scene was a pivotal moment in Cap\u2019s journey.\n8 Steve is cryogenically frozen as he saves America\nSteve Rogers was already a war hero at this point, but as he found himself on a plane full of weapons of mass destruction headed for America, after the perpetrator Red Skull was sucked into space (and sent to guard the Soul Stone on Vormir, as we\u2019d discover some seven years later), he decided he had no choice but to crash the plane into the Arctic.\nRELATED: Did Nick Fury Know Captain America Was Alive?\nHe thought he was making the ultimate sacrifice to save America, but he actually just froze himself and was thawed out 70 years later. This is when Nick Fury recruited him to be, as the title suggests, the first Avenger.\n7 The Avengers assemble\nAfter a bumpy start, in the final act of their first team-up movie, the Avengers finally banded together to help save Earth from a Chitauri invasion in what is now known as the Battle of New York. We only saw his troubles briefly, but after being thawed out and suddenly finding himself living in the 21st century, Steve Rogers struggled to find his place in the world.\nHe was from a totally different era and felt like an outcast in the modern world. But as he joined Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes, he found where he fit in. That transformation is summed up, along with a bunch of other characters\u2019 similar transformations, in the shot where they all assemble and the camera pans around them.\n6 Cap realizes the Winter Soldier is Bucky\nIn Captain America: The Winter Soldier, for the first time, we get to truly focus on Steve Rogers as a man out of his time. The gravity of losing everyone he cared about, including his love interest Peggy Carter and his best friend Bucky Barnes, has fully set in and he\u2019s trying to catch up on everything he\u2019s missed.\nThat\u2019s when he\u2019s swept up in a political conspiracy as he goes on the run, realizes he can trust no one, and is pursued by an assassin called \u201cthe Winter Soldier.\u201d When Steve realizes this assassin bent on destroying him is actually Bucky, the tension and conflict are suddenly heightened. The plot thickens...\n5 Steve disagrees with the Sokovia Accords\nWhen General Thaddeus Ross video-chats with the Avengers and tells them the United Nations are setting up a team to oversee them and govern their actions, he expects everyone to be on board. However, it instantly divides the whole team.\nSurprisingly, Tony Stark \u2013 who has butted heads with the government before and often brags about privatizing freedom \u2013 was on the UN\u2019s side, while Steve Rogers \u2013 who is a stalwart patriot and was given his powers in a government experiment so that he could fight for his country \u2013 decided he trusted his own judgment more than that of the government. This was a huge turning point in Steve\u2019s character development, as we delved into the blurry distinction he sees between right and wrong.\n4 He fights Iron Man to protect Bucky\nThere are a bunch of fights and conflicts in Captain America: Civil War, but it all boils down to the last one. Iron Man finds out Bucky killed his parents, but he was brainwashed at the time, and he\u2019s Cap\u2019s best friend. So, this creates a dilemma. Driven by sheer emotion, Iron Man tries to kill Bucky.\nRELATED: 10 Facts About Steve Rogers Before He Became Captain America\nCap jumps in to protect him, remembering the dozens of times Bucky protected him when they were kids, and he and Iron Man clash in an epic way. It\u2019s such a spectacular sequence that it made it to the movie\u2019s poster and became its defining image.\n3 Cap becomes a political fugitive\nOkoye, Black Panther, Captain America, Black Widow, and Bucky the White Wolf in Wakanda for Avengers Infinity War\nWhen Captain America was disgraced for his handling of the Sokovia Accords situation and evaded the law, he became a political fugitive and had to seek asylum in Wakanda. This scene doubled as a teaser for the then-upcoming Black Panther movie and a huge leap in Cap\u2019s character arc.\nHe was the quintessential American hero, and now he\u2019d turned his back on the U.S. government and gone into hiding. Cap was going dark. Before then, he was the goody two-shoes who told the other Avengers to watch their language and did what he was told. Now, we were seeing his dark side for the first time.\n2 Nomad is born\n\u201cGet this man a shield!\u201d Although he is never explicitly called Nomad in the film and, for all intents and purposes, is still Captain America, when a grizzled Steve Rogers emerges from the shadows in Avengers: Infinity War with a target on his back and a beard on his face, Nomad is born.\nBucky is back, too. He has officially escaped from the clutches of his brainwashing while hiding out in Wakanda and he\u2019s ready to join forces with Steve and the rest of the Avengers to take on Thanos (and maybe take up the Captain America mantle if Steve dies in Avengers: Endgame).\n1 He tries to single-handedly remove the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos\u2019 hand\nThis was futile, sure, but God bless him for trying. In a last-ditch effort to stop the Mad Titan\u2019s evil plan, Steve attempted to single-handedly remove the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos\u2019 hand. This is a guy we\u2019ve seen bicep curl a helicopter as it took flight, so if anyone had the strength to yank that Gauntlet off his hand, it would be Cap \u2013 and he fails.\nIt\u2019s one of the key moments, along with Thor\u2019s similarly failed attempt to kill Thanos with a Stormbreaker hit to the shoulder, that led to the Avengers ruthlessly launching their \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d campaign in the Endgame trailer.\nNEXT: 20 Wild Details Behind Chris Evans' Captain America\n", "label": "human"}

Everything was impressive to me.\u201d\nThe 6-foot-4, 208-pound receiver, out of St. Louis School (Honolulu, Hawaii), admitted that his trip to Oregon was made to check out one of his true contenders, in part because of what Mariota, a St. Louis School alum, accomplished as a Duck.\n\u201cIt definitely means a lot to see how he went there as kind of like a \u2018nobody\u2019 out of high school and then made his name known,\u201d Sykes said. \u201cHe became one of the greatest ever. That era (of Oregon football) with all of their jerseys and how they were playing, it was just a special offer.\u201d\nIt also turned into a special trip.\nEven though it isn\u2019t the heart of football season, the big-bodied Hawaii target got a feel for the energy around the program as soon as he got off the elevator \u2013 literally.\n\u201cAll of the coaches were hyping me up,\u201d Sykes said. \u201cAs soon as I got there I went up the elevator and all of the coaches were waiting for me, getting crazy. Even when I tried on the jerseys they were going nuts. It was pretty cool.\u201d\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t have a commitment timeline or an official visit itinerary in place, the dynamic receiver indicated Oregon is likely to get one of his five official visits.\nIn other words, Mario Cristobal and his coaching staff checked all of Sykes\u2019 boxes this weekend.\nThat\u2019s good news for the program, as his stock has skyrocketed in recent months.\nAfter breaking his leg last summer, Sykes missed his junior season, but has bounced back in a big way, earning wide receiver MVP honors at the All-American national combine in San Antonio in January.\nHe is a hot commodity, and one that Ducks may host again this fall.\n-- Andrew Nemec\n", "label": "human"}

In his latest foster home, he\u2019s still uncomfortable and eyeing the exit when he\u2019s summoned to alternate dimension by The Wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou) to be a champion. A champion is needed now more than ever because of the presence of Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong), who has been looking for the power of Shazam his entire life, but now carries with him the power of the Seven Deadly Sins, literal manifestation of the Catholic sins who grant him superpowers. Billy, unaware of what he\u2019s getting into, accepts the power the Wizard grants him, and when Billy says the word \u201cShazam!\u201d, he transforms into an adult (Levi) with superpowers including lightning bolts, super strength, super speed, and more. However, as many a budding superhero has come to learn, with great power comes great responsibility, which is particularly daunting for a 14-year-old boy with abandonment issues.\nWhen the movie focuses on Shazam training with his foster brother and superhero geek Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), the movie fires on all cylinders. Shazam! is in a perfect groove watching teenage boys goof off and one of those boys happens to have superpowers and look like an adult. Sandberg isn\u2019t trying to lampoon the superhero genre as much as he\u2019s just having fun with its conventions and letting the target audience engage in some wish fulfillment without the weight of well-worn origins like Superman\u2019s planet being blown up or Batman\u2019s parents being killed in an alleyway. Whereas other DC heroes are very much \u201cGods among us,\u201d Shazam dials into the relatability of its hero and broad themes like the importance of family.\nWhere Shazam! goes astray is with the Sivana stuff. Sandberg seems eager to show his background as a horror director (his past credits include Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation) so the villain material gets way too heavy. The film opens with Sivana\u2019s backstory, which involves his dad (John Glover) getting seriously injured in a car wreck. Sivana\u2019s later antics with the Seven Deadly Sins (gargoyle-lookling like monsters who vaguely evoke the sins, but function mostly as Monster Henchmen) involve ripping board members to shreds and even biting off a guy\u2019s head. And it\u2019s not like the guy was particularly mean to Sivana. He\u2019s just a guy, and he gets decapitated in a movie where the hero pretends to be an adult so he can buy beer.\nI assume these dark flourishes are to make Sivana more threatening and to add to the stakes, but they don\u2019t fit with the rest of the movie which is bent on being sweet, charming, and funny. You can still have an antagonist in that environment, but Sivana\u2019s machinations are simply too one-dimensional and grotesque to fit with the rest of the picture. The film also suffers from some pacing issues where the third act battle drags on for far too long and goes for spectacle when the film\u2019s greatest strengths are its humor and heart.\nWhen Shazam! plays to those strengths, it\u2019s the kind of film where Warner Bros. can feel comfortable leaving the battles between Batman and Superman to yesteryear (\u201cyesteryear\u201d being three years ago) and stick to their new mandate of making sure their superhero movies aren\u2019t afraid of warmth and positive human emotions. Some may cry that this is the \u201cMarvel-izing\u201d of DC movies, but Shazam! is content to exist in a world where Batman, Superman, and other DC heroes also exist, but don\u2019t require connective narrative tissue. It\u2019s a kid who gets big and gets superpowers. That\u2019s more than enough to make Shazam take flight.\nRating: B\n", "label": "human"}

So we\u2019ve kind of got no choice but to try and dive in and find a wise way forward.\u201d\nCuration is the term TED favours to describe the event\u2019s method of organizing talks around aspirational themes.\nThis year, 2018\u2019s \u201cage of amazement\u201d has given way to the concept of ideas that are \u201cbigger than us.\u201d The idea, Anderson said, is to focus on ideas that search for deeper meaning to drive change at a time of turmoil and uncertainty.\nThis year, TED will include thought-provoking celebrity appearances by Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby, who scored a monster hit with her confessional, searingly honest Netflix special. Crazy Rich Asians director Jon Chu, actor and filmmaker Joseph Gordon-Levitt and illusionist Derren Brown are among the other celebrity TED talkers.\nUniversity of B.C. happiness researcher Elizabeth Dunn, Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Bio and starchitect Bjarke Ingels, whose firm BIG is responsible for the landmark Vancouver House\u2019s twisting tower at the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, are among the 70 presenters during 12 sessions over five days.\nThis will be the sixth year that TED will host its central conference in Vancouver, where an exclusive audience of some 1,800 attendees, influential business leaders, public intellectuals and politicians, spend thousands of dollars to attend. At a minimum, those who are early in their careers and are attending for the first time, pay $5,000 for a \u201cvanguard\u201d membership, but regular members pay $10,000 for the privilege of attending the five-day event.\nTED, which began 35 years ago as an invite-only conference in Monterey, Calif., has grown into a global media presence that distributes some 3,000 talks on visionary ideas from the fields of science, technology, entertainment and design freely via the internet.\nThe volume of the TED Talks that the organization distributes is distilled from a host of TED subsidiary events, such as TEDWomen, TEDGlobal and the TEDX events that the group licenses its name to worldwide.\nTED\u2019s main conference, which has taken over the Vancouver Convention Centre\u2019s West building, remains the movement\u2019s centrepiece.\nTalks take place in a specially designed theatre that is installed in the centre\u2019s main ballroom each year and presenters are given up to 18 minutes to get across their idea that is inspirational, cautionary, challenging or otherwise thought-provoking.\nIn past years TED talks have included Pope Francis (via recorded video), CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden (via live video link), and U.S. tennis star Serena Williams.\nAnd while in-person attendance at TED is quite exclusive, the organization makes remote live streams of the event\u2019s sessions available for free at various locations, including the central branch of the Vancouver Public Library.\ndepenner@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/derrickpenner\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\nIs there more to this story?

{"text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: What is adrenal insufficiency? Is it the same as Addison\u2019s disease?\nANSWER: There are a few forms of adrenal insufficiency, which is an uncommon disorder caused by the adrenal glands not making enough of certain hormones. Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison\u2019s disease, is one form.\nYour adrenal glands are located on the top of each kidney. Hormones secreted by the adrenal glands include cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol helps your body respond to stress, such as from an injury or infection. It also helps glucose metabolism and helps with proper cardiovascular function. Aldosterone helps maintain proper blood pressure through the balance of sodium, potassium and water in the body.\nThere are two main categories of adrenal insufficiency: primary adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when adrenal glands are diseased or damaged. Most often, this takes the form of a long-term (chronic) disease \u2014 Addison\u2019s disease \u2014 that occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys adrenal gland tissues.\nWith secondary adrenal insufficiency, the pituitary gland, located in the brain, makes an insufficient amount of a hormone called \u201cadrenocorticotropic hormone.\u201d This hormone stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. If the pituitary gland somehow is damaged or altered, it can affect adrenal gland cortisol secretion, even if the adrenal glands are healthy. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is most commonly caused by medications, such as prednisone, intra-articular injections with steroids, or steroid creams. In this situation, the adrenal glands may take days to months to recover function and restore proper cortisol production.\nSigns and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency often come on gradually and progressively worsen over months. Diagnosis sometimes is delayed because early symptoms can easily be mistaken for something else. The most common signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and fatigue; muscle, joint or abdominal pains; and decreased appetite and weight loss.\nIn addition, signs and symptoms can include lightheadedness, feeling wiped out by an ordinary illness, depression, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Cravings for salt and darkening of skin, especially on the face and hands, or on moles, scars or skin folds, are seen only with primary adrenal insufficiency.\nSymptoms of adrenal insufficiency can develop suddenly and rapidly into an adrenal crisis. This can occur in someone who has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency or in someone who has yet to be diagnosed. Often, an adrenal crisis is triggered by health-related stress, such as an illness, surgical procedure or serious injury. These are also the times that higher cortisol production usually would occur in someone without adrenal insufficiency.\nAs symptoms of adrenal crisis escalate, most people feel terrible \u2014 perhaps with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness \u2014 and realize that emergency care is required. Some people may pass out, requiring help from others. An adrenal crisis can result in death if not promptly treated.\nAdrenal insufficiency can be confirmed or ruled out with blood tests. Although there\u2019s no cure, primary adrenal insufficiency can be managed effectively by taking cortisol and aldosterone replacement hormones, with the goal of stabilizing hormone levels and relieving signs and symptoms.\nTreatment plans also involve preparing for the possibility of an adrenal crisis. If you have adrenal insufficiency, have an individualized, written action plan for times when you may be at heightened risk of adrenal crisis. This includes periods of health stress and times when worsening symptoms indicate you may be headed toward an adrenal crisis.

The little girl was maliciously attacked inside Forest Hills Elementary School in Walterboro, South Carolina \u2013 and her family wants justice.\nThe fight occurred Monday, and Wright\u2019s school has been very slow to release details. The fifth grader and another student got into the fight, which ultimately resulted in Wright\u2019s murder. The other student has been suspended indefinitely from the Walterboro elementary school.\nAlthough there have been no charges announced, the Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said they are investigating what could have happened inside the classroom attack that went so wrong so quickly.\nTeachers and administrators \u2013 as well as fellow students \u2013 are not telling what led to the fatal attack. However, the school district tried to skirt responsibility or blame in the matter by saying how \u201cadministrators promptly secured the scene, ended the fight and called emergency medical services to the school.\u201d\nThe other attacker left Wright in such a bad condition that a helicopter came to the school and airlifted her to the Medical University of South Carolina.

{"text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The subject of Bruce Boudreau\u2019s future with the Minnesota Wild, the coach said, had not been broached with general manager Paul Fenton until a reporter quizzed the boss about it while they sat next to each other at the podium for their season-ending news conference.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re working That\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Boudreau said afterward. \u201cI was very thankful she asked that question, because I was pretty interested in knowing myself.\u201d\nWith another year remaining on his contract, Boudreau could have assumed the status quo, but given the fact that Fenton didn\u2019t hire him and the Wild missed the playoffs this spring for the first time since 2012, well, his return was hardly guaranteed.\n\u201cI come in every day, and I work as hard as I can, and when they don\u2019t want me to work anymore,\u201d Boudreau said Tuesday, \u201cthey will tell me.\u201d\nFenton stopped short of a commitment to keeping Boudreau on the bench beyond the 2019-20 season, but he said he\u2019s \u201csure\u201d he will speak with Boudreau eventually about extending his current deal.\n\u201cI have total confidence in him,\u201d Fenton said, later adding: \u201cRight now, Bruce is my coach, and he\u2019s going to be the guy that is going to lead this team back to where we want to go.\u201d\nBoudreau, who missed the playoffs for only the second time in his 12-year career as an NHL head coach, will need help, of course. The Wild scored only 210 goals, the fifth-fewest in the league , and went just 16-18-7 at Xcel Energy Center for the worst home record in 18 seasons as a franchise. Still, Boudreau pointed to the 101 points they posted in 2017-18, a total that would\u2019ve won the Central Division this time.\n\u201cI can go over games right now that we just threw away, and there\u2019s at least 10 of them in there where we were either by far the better team and lost or had two or three-goal leads in the third period and blew,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cSo if you can escape those things and move forward and be a little more consistent, then I think in my mind it\u2019s not a hard problem to get to 100-plus points again.\u201d\nFenton, without prompting, mentioned the slim salary cap space, older roster and depleted prospect pool he inherited a year ago upon replacing the fired Chuck Fletcher. He has frequently noted that each of the three forwards he traded this season, Nino Niederreiter, Charlie Coyle and Mikael Granlund, netted a younger player in return and didn\u2019t cost a draft pick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress. I\u2019m trying to do this on the fly, without having a rebuild as a lot of teams refer to it,\u201d Fenton said.\nNone of the Wild\u2019s pending unrestricted free agents this summer is a core player. Notable restricted free agents include forwards Joel Eriksson Ek, Ryan Donato and Kevin Fiala, the latter two having arrived in deals for Coyle and Granlund, respectively, but the roster is again unlikely to undergo significant change. Defenseman Jared Spurgeon, coming off a career year, will be playing on an expiring contract unless it\u2019s extended, one of the top offseason orders of business.\nThe best remedy might just be improved health, with better vibes as a strong runner-up.\nJason Zucker went from a career-high 33 goals to 21 in a season when he was the heavy subject of trade speculation. Mikko Koivu and Matt Dumba had major surgeries after being knocked out of action months ago. Even Zach Parise, who rebounded from a back injury with 28 goals, missed six of the last seven games with knee trouble. He revealed on Tuesday that he played through a broken foot earlier in the season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Parise said. \u201cYou can\u2019t sugarcoat it right now.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A third federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, ruling Friday that it poses a \"substantial risk\" of undercounting Hispanics and non-citizens.\nU.S. District Judge George Hazel in Maryland also concluded that a citizenship question is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates the Constitution and the federal Administrative Procedure Act.\nFederal judges in New York and California previously barred the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the census for the first time since 1950. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments April 23 for the Justice Department 's appeal of the New York judge's decision.\nHazel heard six days of trial testimony in January before ruling.\n\"Overwhelming evidence supports the Court's finding that a citizenship question will cause a differential decline in Census participation among noncitizen and Hispanic households,\" he wrote in his 119-page decision.\nThe Justice Department is \"disappointed by this ruling,\" spokeswoman Kelly Laco said in a statement.\n\"Our government is legally entitled to include a citizenship question on the census and people in the United States have a legal obligation to answer,\" she added.\nThe Supreme Court justices are expected to rule by late June, which the Trump administration said is soon enough to allow printing and distribution of census forms next April.\nBecause of the tight timeframe for printing census forms, the high court granted unusually quick review of the first decision that went against the administration. That ruling, from a federal judge in New York, held that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ' decision to have the census ask about citizenship was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under federal law. The second ruling, from a court in California, also found that asking about citizenship would violate the Constitution, which calls for a count of all people, not just citizens.\nFormer U.S. Census Bureau director John Thompson, the first plaintiffs' witness for the bench trial in Maryland, testified Ross disregarded \"long established\" Census Bureau protocols in adding the citizenship question. Thompson, who oversaw the bureau from 2013 through June 2017, said he doesn't think officials properly tested the question for the 2020 census.\n\"It's very problematic for me,\" Thompson said of Ross' decision.\nIn a court filing, plaintiffs' attorneys said Ross communicated with former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other administration officials before issuing the March 2018 directive \"to further the unconstitutional goal of diluting the political power of non-white immigrant communities.\"\nThe Census Bureau began collecting citizenship data through the annual American Community Survey in 2005. Government lawyers said in a court filing that Ross decided to use the same wording from that \"well-tested question\" on the ACS for the citizenship question on the 2020 census.\nHazel said the evidence he considered includes several statements by Trump \"demonstrating his animus toward immigrants\" and expressing concern about \"the political power that undocumented immigrants may wield.\" But the judge said nothing in the record shows Ross considered or adopted the president's statements before deciding to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\n\"Without more evidence demonstrating (Ross) was actually persuaded to make his decision based on discriminatory animus, a finding that, more likely than not, (Ross') real motivation was to depress immigrant response rates cannot be made.

The victim reported the incident on Monday, State Police say.\nAccording to police, the victim said he texted Vollmar to arrange an after-hours appointment to treat his injured ankle. He and Vollmar met at about 7:30 p.m. at the clinic and went into an exam room, where Vollmar began checking the victim\u2019s ankle. After about 5-10 minutes, the victim reported, Vollmar asked the victim if he wanted to be \u201cworked on,\u201d which he understood to mean chiropractic work and soft-tissue massage on his back, neck, shoulders, legs, and hips. Vollmar had performed this work on the victim before, and it had always been done professionally, the victim told police.\nDuring the massage, the victim told police, the victim was undressed, wearing a towel over his genital area. Toward the end of the the massage, the victim said, Vollmar asked him \u201cdo you trust me?\u201d After the victim said he did, and Vollmar began touching his genitals, the victim said.\nAfter a moment of shock, the victim told police, he stopped Vollmar from continuing. Vollmar then asked the victim, \u201cdo you want me to finish you,\u201d the victim said. The victim told Vollmar to stop and ended the massage. At no time did the victim consent to Vollmar touching his penis, the victim told police.\nPolice interviewed Vollmar on Tuesday. Vollmar allegedly told officers the incident was \u201ca huge misunderstanding, mostly on my part.\u201d\nVollmar said that while he was manipulating the victim\u2019s hips, he thought the victim was revealing interest in more than a massage, so Vollmar \u201ctouched his penis.\u201d\nWhen asked if the victim ever gave him permission to touch his penis, Vollmar said no, police say.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Astronomers operating the Event Horizon Telescope - a telescope array made up of a number of networked satellites around the globe. The black hole was photographed from the middle of galaxy Messier 87 (M87), 53.49 million light years away from the Earth. The photo shows a bright red ring formed as light bends around the outside of the black hole (known as the event horizon), which is 6.5 billion times more massive than the Sun.\nThe woman who made the photograph possible was Dr Katie Bouman, an MIT educated computer scientist. The 29-year-old developed the algorithm responsible for forging a path in astrophysics once thought completely impossible. She led the development of the program which eventually took the picture while a graduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three years ago. She was pictured loading the groundbreaking image for the first time, and posted it to Facebook with the caption: \"Watching in disbelief as the first image I ever made of a black hole was in the process of being reconstructed.\"\nWhat would happen if the Earth went into a black hole? The closest black hole to Earth is V616 Monocerotis, V616 Mon for short. The black hole is 9 to 13 times the Sun's mass and is located about 3,000 light years away. Currently, it remains stationary and is not on course to find the Earth at any point.\nBlack hole photo: What would happen if the Earth went into a black hole?\nAccording to the website The Conversation, Earth would likely be doomed if it was absorbed by an errant black hole. They say: \"The edge of the Earth closest to the black hole would feel a much stronger force than the far side. \"As such, the doom of the entire planet would be at hand. We would be pulled apart. \"Equally, we might not even notice if a truly supermassive black hole swallowed us below its event horizon as everything would appear as it once was, at least for a small period of time. In this case, it could be some time before disaster struck.\"\nThe first picture of a black hole\n\"But don\u2019t lose too much sleep, we\u2019d have to be unfortunate to 'hit' a black hole in the first place \u2013 and we might live on holographically after the crunch anyway.\" Interestingly, a black hole could support life in some instances. If a planet was to orbit around a black hole, to thrive it would need a source of heat and light. For a black hole to provide this, it would need to be inactive - no longer pulling matter into its endless void.\nBlack holes emit harsh radiation when active\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Image: South Park\nEveryone wants fast internet, but unfortunately, getting speedy NBN isn\u2019t as simple as it should be. There are so many factors that can affect the speed and quality of your connection, and no one wants to be stuck with a service that craps out during peak hours.\nWhile there\u2019s big quality differences between ISPs, some do a pretty decent job of delivering consistently fast NBN. Thanks to the ACCC\u2019s \u201cMeasuring Broadband Australia\u201d testing program \u2013 based on real world data from Australian households \u2013 we\u2019ve got a good idea of who they are.\nThe ACCC recently released its fourth report on real-world NBN speed, and it\u2019s actually promising. There's always room for improvement, but most fixed-line NBN customers seem to get the speeds they\u2019re paying for. Close to, at least.\nTPG came out on top, delivering peak hour speeds that were 86.1% of plan maximums on average, while Aussie Broadband followed at 84.8%. Optus, Telstra, and MyRepublic were all close behind, delivering 83.9%, 82.7%, and 82% of their maximum speeds during busy periods, respectively. Lastly, Exetel, iiNet, and Dodo / iPrimus racked up 81.7%, 79.8%, and 78.9%.\nThese speed reports are still pretty new; at present, they only cover 908 individual NBN connections across 15 different providers. As such, the ACCC\u2019s testing isn\u2019t necessarily the final world on NBN speed. But at the same time, it\u2019s a good start; peak hour download speeds between 80Mbps and 90Mbps ain\u2019t bad. And it\u2019s always nice to have data from an independent body.\nHere's a look at how these providers price their unlimited NBN 100 plans:\nThere are a few deals worth calling out here. MyRepublic is currently running a promo that gets you your first year for $79.95 per month, which makes it one of the cheapest NBN 100 plans around. You\u2019ll pay $89.95 per month thereafter, but the plan itself is no-contract so you can leave whenever.\nIf you\u2019re also keen to change mobile provider, TPG will give you three free months of mobile service when you sign an 18-month NBN contract.\nTelstra doesn't sell NBN 100 plans as a standalone product. If you want NBN 100 speeds on Telstra, you'll need to sign up for one of the NBN 50 plans below first. If your physical connection to the NBN is fast enough, you'll then be able to upgrade to a 100Mbps plan for an extra $30 per month.\nWhile Telstra might be the priciest out of this lot, it\u2019s currently waiving the $99 connection charge when you sign-up online. You don\u2019t have to pay for a modem upfront, but if you cancel within 24 months of connecting, you\u2019ll need to pay a modem fee. This is based on the outright modem cost \u2013 $218 \u2013 and decreases by $9 for each month you stay connected.\nAs Kotaku editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too. Kotaku often has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Speaking at a Walkley\u2019s event in Sydney last Friday morning, New York Times CEO Mark Thompson shared his overwhelmingly positive outlook on the future of journalism.\nThompson, ex-director general of the BBC, joined The New York Times as chief executive in August 2012.\nUnder his leadership, The New York Times became the first publication to generate over one million online subscriptions, with share prices rising from $5 to over $30.\nFollowing a keynote speech from the NY Times boss, Media Watch host Paul Barry sat down with Thompson to interrogate his positivity about the state and future of Australian journalism and media.\nAccording to Thompson, there are two reasons why it\u2019s the best time it has ever been to be a journalist, despite often feeling like it\u2019s the worst time.\nHe said: \u201cThe first [reason] is that technology has enabled journalists to reach more people than ever before.\n\u201cAnd the second is that we\u2019re living in an amazing time for stories. The world is going through an astonishingly disruptive, transitional phase.\n\u201cAfter a decade of relative stability, many countries, particularly Western countries, are wrestling with a whole set of difficult choices.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing massive political disruption, globalisation, automation, mass human migration, the challenge of climate change, questions inside our societies around inequalities and social justice.\n\u201cThis is producing the most incredible stories. And stories that are often interconnected.\u201d\nHowever, Thompson admitted that sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like a great time to be a journalist.\n\u201cStraightforwardly, this is probably the most dangerous time in history to be a journalist.\nHe said that around the world, more journalists are being \u201cprevented from doing their work\u201d, and are being harassed, arrested, sent to jail, tortured, injured and murdered more than any time in history.\nThompson added that the climate for free expression and the free, open access to news you can trust is darkening due to a deliberate set of policies by different political factions and governments.\nWhen it comes to the central challenge to modern journalism, Thompson said it\u2019s an economic one.\nHe said: \u201cThe old business models, particularly the role of advertising in supporting journalism, has been under acute stress. Business models have gotten tougher.\n\u201cThe response from most news organisations has been to try and do something on the digital side, but they find it hard to scale something in digital that is big enough to make up for the lost ground in print.\n\u201c[The response] doesn\u2019t really succeed. And we see the total economics of the company, therefore, degrading.\u201d\nHe said the response is to go for defensive consolidation, the concentration of ownership, media groupings coming together, adding that these are \u201cdefensive actions\u201d.\nNew digital publishers are struggling too, such as Huffington Post, VICE, Buzzfeed. Thompson said even the big publishers are talking about consolidation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something different at The Times. Our theory is a different one. And it\u2019s super simple,\u201d Thompson said.\n\u201cWe think if we can make great journalism, and we market it effectively and package it in digital assets, and get good at presenting those assets to the people in America and around the world, we can persuade people to subscribe to The Times and make that into a great business.\n\u201cThe theory being: you make something good, you put it in the shop window, people come in and buy it and you get revenue that you can invest in making more good things.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how we have gotten into that virtual circle of building our newsroom.\nHe added: \u201cWe believe that there are people all over the planet who really want to understand what\u2019s going on and who want access to reliable information, trustworthy information that they can use to make up their own minds on what\u2019s happening.\n\u201cWe think they will pay for that. We think it\u2019s a valuable service and once word of that gets around, it will grow.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a moment where several stories of the year are breaking in a single month. And the need for outstanding journalism is not going to diminish, it\u2019s going to grow.\nThompson also discussed the issues publishing and media currently face, such as relating to Google and Facebook, how to think about traditional advertising. maintaining profitability and maintaining this as the business model changes.\nHe said: \u201cWe face plenty of issues. Of course you can look at all of this and say it\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s a stressful time to be in media, I didn\u2019t come into journalism signing up for all of this and I wish it wasn\u2019t happening.\n\u201cAll of us feel that on some occasions. But there are plenty of days when I look at all of this and say, we\u2019ve never had a better opportunity to grow journalism in the world. We have to trust the public and we have to trust ourselves but potentially journalism can have a better future than it\u2019s past.\u201d\nWhen challenged by Media Watch\u2019s Paul Barry on whether local Australian news outlets could be as optimistic, given The Times\u2019 unique position as a truly global news brand, Thompson remained resolute.\nHe said: \u201cFor me, the biggest single problem at the top of media organisations is defeatism and a lack of self-belief.\n\u201cI was told back in 2012 by a number of people, \u201cDon\u2019t take the job. It\u2019s over. It is a wonderful brand but it\u2019s stuck in the past, it\u2019s incredibly conservative, they\u2019ve lost their way, they nearly went bust a few years ago. The stock price is in the toilet and that\u2019s for a very good reason. You\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d\n\u201cI went into the building and started talking to those that worked there and actually found that there was a demand for change.\nThompson said the challenge for leaders, editors and CEOs is that in an organisation you\u2019ll find people, often the youngest, who are hungry for a challenge and change.\nHe advised getting \u201cout of the way of the change makers and let them do their thing.\u201d\nThompson also said when it comes to journalism, you need to \u201cdo it as if you mean it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course having a big home market and having a global brand are advantages. But there are some basic concepts to follow.\nHe said: \u201cDo not obsess about things like the number of clicks. Clicks do not produce value in themselves. The whole idea that you can cynically try and get people to click on as many pages as possible and make a fortune through digital advertising doesn\u2019t work. It hasn\u2019t made money.\n\u201cSubscription is the way that we monetise at the moment principally. We do well from advertising, and our content is good, and advertisers want to be associated with the content.\u201d\nThompson believes the heart of journalism is establishing a relationship with users where \u201cthey trust you, find you indispensable and they think what you are doing is different\u201d, adding \u201cI don\u2019t see why any publication in the world can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nPaul Barry remained skeptical. He said: \u201cIf you imagine the Sydney Morning Herald, for example, trying to follow your strategy, that is, creating wonderful journalism to sell around the world \u2013 how much money is that going to cost them before they\u2019re going to see any sort of return? It\u2019s like a Silicon Valley start-up model that you\u2019re proposing, it\u2019s incredibly risky.\u201d\nThompson, smiling at Barry\u2019s comment about risk, confirmed that was exactly what he was proposing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re worried it\u2019s risky? Look out the window. The safe option which is trying to keep your profitability as long as possible by cutting all your costs and sprinkling your newsroom, the traditional safe way of managing your business, is a certain path to the grave.\n\u201cThat idea of winding it down so eventually the last journalist can switch off the light in the newsroom. That\u2019s certain death.\n\u201cLive a little. Try and figure out ways in which you can differentiate yourself. In many markets, media is getting more like each other. It\u2019s becoming less distinctive. The different news sources look more and more like each other. It seems to me that we should be trying to do precisely the opposite of that.\nThompson said newsrooms and newspapers need to be different and \u201cdo something exceptional that people can\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d He said they need to figure out how to connect with people and offer them something that is worth paying for.\nHe conceded: \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy. You might have to invest.\u201d\nThompson added: \u201cGlobal brands are not set up to provide local journalism for a local audience. There\u2019s going to be an immense gap. News is, for most citizens, what\u2019s happening in my city, my state, my country. Part of this is a bet about demand.\u201d\nThompson concluded by saying there are countless opportunities for journalists today, especially for the ones who are open-minded.\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many opportunities. People have got this kind of tram-lined thinking about the way the world was and the way we knew it was, and in particular, the fact that it\u2019s kind of impossible to make up the lost revenue streams in digital.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nonsense. Be more open-minded about what you could do.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}

Savannah, 21, and Chase Chrisley, 23, pack up their things and move from Nashville to LA in their new Chrisley Knows Best spinoff, Growing Up Chrisley \u2014 premiering on April 2 at 10:30 PM ET on USA. The brother-sister duo heads to Hollywood Hills to prove themselves as adults and to pursue their dream careers. Chase wants to be an actor, while also working in real estate and even dabbling in creating his own clothing line. Meanwhile, Savannah has her sights set on the beauty industry.\n\u201cI think LA was the best fit because for the careers that we\u2019ve chosen to make an attempt at, this is where everything\u2019s happening, so it\u2019s where the connections are,\u201d Chase tells HollywoodLife during an EXCLUSIVE interview ahead of tonight\u2019s premiere. As for Savannah, she\u2019s putting her focus into building her cosmetics line. \u201cI\u2019ve also become the creative director for Rampage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a clothing line that\u2019s been around for a while, but I\u2019m coming on board to revamp everything and kind of bring it back to life,\u201d Savannah explains adding that she will contribute her own style to the brand. \u201cThe first collection should be out by the holiday season, so we\u2019re working hard, working fast, and it\u2019s fun.\u201d\nUpon moving to LA, Savannah and Chase\u2019s hilarious father, Todd \u2014 whose known for his protective nature in the family\u2019s USA show, Chrisley Knows Best \u2014 told them they\u2019d have three months to become successful in LA. (That\u2019s a very Todd-like thing to say, if you don\u2019t watch the show). \u201cHe was like, \u2018Alright, you got three months,'\u201d Savannah recalls. \u201cHe helped us with the housing situation, but really now we\u2019re doing everything on our own. He\u2019s like, \u2018You guys have a job, you make money, you can pay your own way.\u2019 So, that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re doing, just figuring it out.\u201d\nSavannah admits that their father has been \u201call up in it\u201d since she and Chase moved to LA. \u201cHe showed up once while we were here [in LA] and then just constantly calls, texts, and checks in. So yeah, it\u2019s just your typical dad,\u201d she says.\nBoth Savannah and Chase emphasize how nice it is to have their \u201cown space,\u201d now that they\u2019ve moved to LA \u2014 especially Chase. As you may know, Chase is the wild card in the family. When he\u2019s not pursing his career, or driving Todd crazy, he\u2019s got his eyes on the ladies. \u201cThe sun goes down, I\u2019m socializing,\u201d he admits of his time in LA.\nWhile things may seem sweet in the Hollywood Hills, the siblings do run into some obstacles along the way. \u201cI think as we all know, it\u2019s a tough industry to be in,\u201d Savannah says of the fashion and entertainment industry, in which she and Chase are both immersed in. \u201cIt\u2019s very cut throat and you can be in one day and out the other, so I think it\u2019s just about not falling into the temptation that\u2019s out here.\u201d\nSavannah continues: \u201cOut here in LA there\u2019s a pressure to act a certain way, or to look a certain way, or to be doing certain things so that you could be in the limelight and get the attention,\u201d she admits. \u201cSo, it\u2019s slow and steady wins the race. I\u2019m a firm believer in that. You may not be a huge superstar now, but if you stay on the path and you do things the right way then you\u2019ll eventually get there.

There\u2019s a lot of fun antics that go on and obviously business stuff, but also just fun stuff. Some of our embarrassing stupid moments, but oh well.

{"text": "TRIPOLI: A warplane attacked Tripoli\u2019s only functioning airport on Monday as eastern forces advancing on Libya\u2019s capital disregarded global appeals for a truce in the latest of a cycle of warfare since Muammar Qaddafi\u2019s fall in 2011.\nThe fighting threatens to disrupt oil supplies, fuel migration to Europe and wreck UN plans for an election to end rivalries between parallel administrations in east and west. Casualties are mounting.\nThe eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) forces of Khalifa Haftar \u2014 a former general in Qaddafi\u2019s army \u2014 said 19 of its soldiers had died in recent days as they closed in on the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.\nA spokesman for the Tripoli-based Health Ministry said fighting in the south of the capital had killed at least 25 people, including fighters and civilians, and wounded 80.\nThe UN said 2,800 people had been displaced by clashes and many more could flee, though some were trapped.\n\u201cThe United Nations continues to call for a temporary humanitarian truce to allow for the provision of emergency services and the voluntary passage of civilians, including those wounded, from areas of conflict,\u201d it said in a statement.\nBut that seemed to fall on deaf ears. Matiga airport, in an eastern suburb, said it was bombed and a resident confirmed the attack. No more details were immediately available.\nHaftar\u2019s LNA, which backs the eastern administration in Benghazi, took the oil-rich south of Libya earlier this year before advancing fast through largely unpopulated desert regions toward the coastal capital.\nSeizing Tripoli, however, is a much bigger challenge for the LNA. It has conducted air strikes on the south of the city as it seeks to advance along a road toward the center from a disused former international airport.\nHowever, the government of Prime Minister Fayez Al-Serraj, 59, is seeking to block the LNA with the help of allied armed groups who have rushed to Tripoli from nearby Misrata in pickup trucks fitted with machine guns. A Reuters correspondent in the city center could hear gunfire in the distance southwards.\nSerraj, who comes from a wealthy business family, has run Tripoli since 2016 as part of a UN-brokered deal boycotted by Haftar. His Tripoli government has reported 11 deaths in the last few days, without saying on which side.\nDeteriorating situation\nUN envoy Ghassan Salame met Serraj in his office in Tripoli on Monday to discuss \u201cthis critical and difficult juncture,\u201d the world body\u2019s Libya mission said.\nThe violence has jeopardized\na UN plan for an April 14-16 conference to plan elections and end anarchy that has prevailed since the Western-backed toppling of Qaddafi eight years ago.\nThe UN refugee agency expressed anxiety about thousands caught in cross-fire and detention centers in conflict zones in a \u201crapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.\u201d\nAs well as the UN, the EU, US and G7 bloc have all urged a cease-fire, a halt to Haftar\u2019s advance and return to negotiations.\nMigrants and militants\nThe LNA says it has 85,000 men, but this includes soldiers paid by the central government that it hopes to inherit. Its elite force, Saiqa (Lightning), numbers some 3,500, while Haftar\u2019s sons also have well-equipped troops, LNA sources say.\nAnalysts say Haftar has swelled his ranks with Salafist fighters and tribesmen as well as Chadians and Sudanese from over the southern borders, claims dismissed by the LNA.\nSince NATO-backed rebels ousted Qaddafi, Libya has been a transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants trekking across the Sahara in hope of reaching Europe across the sea.\nDaesh staged some high-profile attacks in Tripoli last year, but the militant group has largely retreated to the desert of southern Libya since the loss of its former stronghold in Sirte late in 2016.\nFrance, which has close links to Haftar, said it had no prior warning of his push for Tripoli, a diplomatic source said.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Ace country singer-songwriter Sara Evans ' new project has a special twist. As it turns out, her children inherited her innate musical talent, and she's joined forces with two of them, Olivia and Avery Barker, for an EP and intimate acoustic tour as the Barker Family Band .\nOut Friday (April 12), The Barker Family Band is a six-track EP featuring Olivia on vocals, Avery on guitar and Evans lending harmonies (Evans' children's biological father is Craig Schelske, but they've taken their stepfather Jay Barker's last name). The disc features covers of some of the family's favorite songs: Beyonce's \"XO;\" \"Dreams\" by Fleetwood Mac; \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow, originally sung by Judy Garland; and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" by Aretha Franklin. Additionally, there's an original cut, \"The View,\" and a reworking of Evans' hit single \"Born to Fly.\" It's a one-time project made especially for fans.\nIt all began when Evans posted a video to her Instagram. Olivia and Avery had worked out their own version of \"Dreams,\" and when they came downstairs to show their mom, she jumped in to sing the high parts. They didn't want to be on video, so Evans pointed her phone camera at the chandelier, threw on a black-and-white filter -- and next thing she knew, it went viral.\n\"I\u2019ve always known that my kids had musical talent, but it\u2019s not really something that I talk about that much. Plus, it's just in my whole family, so of course my kids had it too,\" Evans tells The Boot. \"When I posted that, we started talking, like, 'I wonder if we should do a little tour at some point.' We could just do some small venues and talk about the family.\"\n\"It\u2019s been such a neat blessing for me ...\"\nThe concept wasn't totally out of the blue: After Avery graduated high school, Evans hired him on to play guitar in her band, so they've been collaborating musically for over a year now. The musical talent for both kids came naturally.\n\"[Avery] started playing drums when he was about eight or nine years old. He was so good. We were just like, you've got the natural music gift,\" Evans recalls. \"I think when he was around 14, he decided that guitar was really his passion. That\u2019s when he started literally practicing nonstop, day and night.\n\"Olivia -- kind of like me -- she started singing when she was really little, and it\u2019s just natural for her. In some ways, she sounds a lot like me, but she also has her own sound. She\u2019s not country; she\u2019s a lot more pop or Americana,\" Evans adds. \"It\u2019s just kind of one of those things that, I\u2019m not really sure when it happened, it\u2019s just kind of always been.\"\nBeyond the genetic hand-me-down, Evans has taken her kids on the road and into the studio with her throughout her career. They grew up on her tour bus in their early years; they sat in playpens inside the recording studio while Evans made records. Evans, who grew up playing in a family band herself, wanted them to be familiar with the environment.\nNow that they're old enough, they get to have their names on the bill instead of just enjoying the show from sidestage. Evans predicts there will be few challenges on this tour, since they already know the drill.\n\"They\u2019re more comfortable out there, really, than they are at home. It\u2019s gonna be so normal,\" she says. \"What\u2019s so funny, too, is, even when they were really little, they would always come out onstage and say hi to the crowd.\n\"When you grow up around it, it\u2019s just totally second nature,\" she continues. \"It\u2019s really second nature for them to be onstage, to be on the road. They totally understand touring life.\"\n\"It\u2019s really second nature for them to be onstage, to be on the road. They totally understand touring life.\"\nWhen they recorded, things moved seamlessly for those same reasons. Avery and Evans' brother tracked guitar and bass, respectively, then had Olivia track vocals.\n\"Even on the beginning of [my 2002 single] \"I Keep Looking,\" you can hear a baby making a little baby noise, and that\u2019s me holding Avery while we were recording that,\" Evans divulges. \"They\u2019re just literally so used to seeing me in that environment. They\u2019ve seen me do that a million times. What was different was, I\u2019ve never seen them do it.\"\nIt's no surprise to Evans that her kids went into music. While both are pursuing solo careers, and it's their time to fly, it was a special moment for everyone in the family to work on the Barker Family Band as a side project.\n\"It\u2019s been such a neat blessing for me,\" Evans reflects, \"to be able to do this with them at least one time.\"\nThe Barker Family Band's Bloodline Tour will run from May 7 through May 14. They'll stop at City Winery locations in Washington, DC; New York City; Boston, Mass.; Atlanta, Ga.; Chicago, Ill.; and Nashville, Tenn.\n", "label": "human"}

With food and other necessities scarce \u2013 Venezuela\u2019s contested president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, continues to crack down on international aid \u2013 shoes can seem like a luxury, Ms. Convers says. Grassroots efforts like hers from the diaspora help remind Venezuelans they are not forgotten. \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t think this is a political matter,\u201d Ms. Convers says. \u201cIt\u2019s a humanitarian matter.\u201d\nSo Martha Convers, a deeply concerned Venezuelan expatriate, ships shoes. Besides working as a real estate agent and Zumba instructor, the Framingham, Massachusetts, woman \u2013 in the U.S. since 2004 \u2013 has a special side gig: Shoes for Venezuela . She started the volunteer donation campaign in November 2017. Her latest Zumbathon, in January, drew a crowd of 200. The haul from that fundraiser launched a shipment of about 1,500 pairs.\nFrom safety and confidence at school to rugged treks to work, daily life in Venezuela, as elsewhere, calls for sturdy shoes. But amid the current political crisis it\u2019s not uncommon for a pair of sneakers to cost more than a month\u2019s salary. Inflation has hit 1 million percent in the country\u2019s free-falling economy.\nNorman Canaie noticed that some of his students at a public high school in Caracas, Venezuela, came barefoot \u2013 if they came at all. So last year, Mr. Canaie handed out armloads of donated shoes to his pupils most in need. He made sure to save a pair of white Nikes for a student who had dropped out, ashamed of his tattered sneakers.\nThe new pair brought the student back to class.\n\u201cThe children were overwhelmed with the shoes,\u201d says the English teacher in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019re always asking me if there are more shoes coming.\u201d\nMartha Convers arranged the shoes\u2019 2,000-plus-mile journey from suburban Framingham. Besides working as a real estate agent and Zumba instructor, she has a special side gig: Shoes for Venezuela.\nSince moving from Venezuela to the United States in 2004, Ms. Convers has watched her country devolve into political chaos. But she repurposed her despair. She started the volunteer donation campaign in November 2017 and estimates she\u2019s shipped at least 3,000 pairs of shoes to the country. Recipients include schools, nursing homes, churches, and nonprofits. With food and other necessities scarce, receiving a pair of shoes can seem like a luxury, Ms. Convers says.\nThe political upheaval\nVenezuela\u2019s contested president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, continues to crack down on international aid. This has heightened a standoff between Mr. Maduro and legislative leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-declared acting head of state. As the relentless political crisis fails to address staggering poverty, inflation, and shortages of vital items like food and medical supplies, grassroots efforts from the diaspora like Ms. Convers\u2019 are sprouting up. They help remind Venezuelans they are not forgotten.\n\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t think this is a political matter,\u201d Ms. Convers says. \u201cIt\u2019s a humanitarian matter.\u201d\nVenezuela boasts the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. But experts say chronic political corruption and economic mismanagement have choked the country\u2019s prosperity, as have U.S.-enforced sanctions more recently. Food and medicine are scarce while crime is rampant. When Mr. Canaie, the teacher from Caracas, buys groceries, he camouflages his purchase in a second bag so others aren\u2019t tempted to steal. Nearly 9 out of 10 Venezuelans live in poverty.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for a pair of sneakers to cost more than Mr. Canaie\u2019s monthly salary. Inflation has hit 1 million percent in Venezuela\u2019s free-falling economy.\nThese turbulent conditions have meant an exodus of 3 million Venezuelans since 2015, the largest in Latin America\u2019s recent history. For some time the diaspora has sent money and necessities to family members. In 2018 Venezuelans abroad remitted $2 billion, which amounted to 1 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\nEven though personal shipments are precarious, sometimes it\u2019s the best option.\n\u201cPeople prefer to send stuff rather than money, because the value of the currency changes on a regular basis,\u201d says Manuel Orozco, director of the migration, remittances, and development program at the nonprofit Inter-American Dialogue in Washington.\nShannon O\u2019Neil, senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, expects personal shipments to increase if the political stalemate leaves Mr. Maduro in power. \u201cAnd they benefit the regime \u2013 helping feed and maintain those that remain and lining the pockets of customs and other officials that let it pass through,\u201d she writes in an email.\nMr. Maduro has denied that a humanitarian crisis exists. He has also refused international aid, though his stance appears to be shifting after a recent meeting with top Red Cross representatives. Mr. Maduro tweeted April 9 about Venezuela's readiness \"to establish cooperation mechanisms for international assistance and support.\"\nIn February, a showdown at the Venezuela-Colombia border over stockpiled U.S. aid descended into violence. (Relief operations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross refused to engage, warning against politicizing aid.) Ms. Convers hopes to direct her next shipment to Venezuelans who routinely cross the border into Colombia for work.\nThe Monitor spoke with some nonprofits shipping goods into Venezuela that do not mark their boxes as aid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always this balancing act of still trying to serve more, while still kind of flying under the radar,\u201d says Sean Lawrence, chief operating officer for Giving Children Hope in Buena Park, California.\nComplications with international aid in recent weeks prompted some nonprofits like Giving Children Hope to alter the frequency and routes of their shipments. One of the charity\u2019s Venezuelan contacts who coordinates the donations faces threats, Mr. Lawrence says.\nWatching Venezuela from afar\nOn a recent afternoon at her Framingham real estate office, Ms. Convers still sports her silver Nikes from a morning Zumba class. She\u2019ll teach another session later \u2013 after a quick wardrobe change and back-to-back meetings.\nHer focus narrows to her smartphone screen as she scrolls through videos. Unsettling scenes of Venezuela emerge six days into the country\u2019s worst blackout. Her thoughts race to family there. The power outage upsets her chance for updates via WhatsApp.\n\u201cYou wonder for them.... It\u2019s not only me; it\u2019s my friends. All my friends here are concerned with their families, especially since we cannot communicate,\u201d she says.\nMs. Convers left Venezuela 15 years ago when Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was still in office. She\u2019d started going to demonstrations as violence crept into her Margarita Island hometown.\n\u201c \u2018Why are you throwing tear gas to us if we\u2019re just protesting? We\u2019re still in a democracy,\u2019 \u201d she confronted a policeman at a 2003 protest. She still recalls the smell and the burn.\nOn two occasions, she says, thieves put a gun to her 6-year-old daughter\u2019s head. They demanded cellphones and wallets. Her husband accepted a job offer in the U.S. soon afterward.\nMs. Convers assumed an organizer role within the Massachusetts diaspora in July 2017, when she helped get out the vote for an opposition-led referendum. Her ERA Key Realty Services office let her use the space for ballot casting. The agency continues to support her efforts and houses a shoe collection box.\nMr. Canaie, who knew Ms. Convers from church, told her his students weren\u2019t coming to class because they didn\u2019t have shoes. She was also aware that scores of Venezuelans made rugged treks to neighboring countries for work. When Ms. Convers made a call for shoe donations, 200 poured in within a month. She has since overseen four shipments of gently used sandals, sneakers, slip-ons, and more in a range of sizes.\nShe gently deflects the credit.\n\u201cI just think that I am a tool for God to be used on this,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat can I say \u2013 I have a wonderful team of volunteers.\u201d\nThe boxes are packed by volunteers in Massachusetts, many of whom still have family affected by the crisis. Volunteer Rita \u00c1lvarez has offered up space in her garage for shoe storage.\n\u201cA box can be put here, and a box can be put there. Everybody pitches in however we can,\u201d she says.\nSome of Shoes for Venezuela\u2019s fundraising comes from Ms. Convers\u2019 Zumbathons, where money collected at the dance sessions is put toward shipments. Her latest Zumbathon, in January, drew a crowd of 200. The haul from the fundraiser launched a shipment of about 1,500 pairs soon after.\nAnother helper drives the shoes down to Miami. Arranged by a courier service, the boxes are loaded onto a boat headed for a Venezuelan port city.\nMs. Convers admits that starting Shoes for Venezuela brought a steep learning curve. Sometimes requests for shoes over social media are overwhelming. Given that she\u2019s operating on a volunteer basis with limited resources, she says there\u2019s just so much she can do. She plans to register her initiative as a nonprofit.\nMs. Convers loves receiving photos confirming the boxes\u2019 final destinations, even if not every destination responds. Regardless of whether the shipments become increasingly uncertain under the current regime, she says she won\u2019t stop.\n\u201cWe have to believe in God and have faith.\u201d\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (L) speaks with Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, on March 14, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\nDemocrats Set Final Deadline for IRS to Release Trump\u2019s Tax Returns\nThe Democratic chairman of the House tax-writing committee set an April 23 deadline for his request to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns.\nIn a letter (pdf) to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal wrote that he will consider failure to comply by the new deadline as a refusal to his request. The IRS already has missed the April 10 deadline Neal set in his initial request.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on April 13 that Neal was \u201cjust picking arbitrary dates\u201d in setting deadlines. Mnuchin could not say if the Treasury, which oversees the IRS, would complete its review of Neal\u2019s request by the deadline. He emphasized it was more important to get the decision \u201cright\u201d to ensure the IRS would not be \u201cweaponized\u201d in a political dispute.\n\u201cI do intend to follow the law. But I think these raise very, very complicated legal issues. I don\u2019t think these are simple issues. There are constitutional issues,\u201d Mnuchin said.\nMnuchin, who has consulted with the White House and Department of Justice about Trump\u2019s tax returns, previously said that Neal\u2019s request raised concerns about the scope of the committee\u2019s authority, privacy protections for taxpayers, and the legislative purpose of lawmakers in seeking the documents.\nTrump broke from a decades-old custom of presidents releasing their tax returns, arguing that he cannot do so as the IRS is conducting an audit. The president is exercising a privacy protection afforded to all Americans under the tax code. According to a 2017 tally by Roll Call, 90 percent of Democratic lawmakers, including Neal himself, did not release their tax returns, including after being asked to do so.\nAfter Neal\u2019s initial request, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, William Consovoy, laid out a detailed legal argument in an April 5 letter (pdf) to the Treasury\u2019s legal counsel, writing that the request fails to provide a legitimate purpose, is motivated by partisan politics, and sets a dangerous precedent.\n\u201cWays and Means has no legitimate committee purpose for requesting the president\u2019s tax returns or return information,\u201d Consovoy wrote. \u201cHis request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech.\u201d\nIn his letter, Neal addressed the concerns put forth.\n\u201cIt is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,\u201d Neal wrote.\nNeal argues that the language in the law unambiguously mandates the IRS to provide the tax returns to the committee upon request, that the IRS cannot legally question the committee\u2019s purpose, and that \u201cconcerns about what the committee may do with the tax returns and return information are baseless.\u201d\nThe new deadline brings the standoff closer to a battle in federal court. Should the IRS miss the new deadline, Neal could follow with a subpoena or opt to file a lawsuit.\nCongressional Republicans have condemned Neal\u2019s request as a political fishing expedition by Democrats, while the White House has said the documents will \u201cnever\u201d be turned over.\nNeal\u2019s request for the returns of a sitting president is unprecedented, and legal experts say its success or failure may depend on a court ruling about the committee\u2019s legislative purpose for seeking the documents.\nOn April 14, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris released tax returns through 2018, offering the most complete look to date at a presidential candidate\u2019s finances.\nHarris held public office during the years 2004 through 2018. With her husband, Douglas Emhoff, an attorney, she had a combined adjusted gross income in 2018 of about $1.89 million, and paid total taxes of about $697,000, according to the returns.\nHarris and Emhoff, who have filed joint tax returns since marrying in 2014, have paid more than $2.2 million in federal taxes over the past five years at an average effective tax rate of 32.6 percent, according to her campaign.\nReuters contributed to this report.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "With two weeks left until the premiere of Season Eight fans are thirsty for anything Game of Thrones that comes their way. There's only been one official trailer so far, but even that was enough for fans to generate weeks worth of theories. So when HBO released some new Season Eight footage in a teaser trailer last night, fans went nuts for a few precious new seconds of Game of Thrones.\nDespite being only 30 seconds long, there are a few interesting glimpses into what's to come in the final season of Game of Thrones. Some of this we've already seen, but new footage includes Tyrion speaking in Winterfell, Beric Dondarrion lighting his sword, the Unsullied preparing for combat, a very brooding Cersei, Varys looking up at what is likely a dragon, and Arya on the battlefield.\nBut the moment that has Game of Thrones fans most excited is a brief scene of Daenerys looking into a fire as Jon Snow turns to leave. Fans on the Game of Thrones Reddit are already theorizing that this could be when Jon and Dany learn that they're actually related. The vibe of the clip is not entirely positive.\nOf course, this is all conjecture, but Dany and Jon do, at some point, need to learn about their real Targaryen connection. At the end of Season Seven, Sam Tarly reveals the information of Jon's parentage to Bran Stark, who uses his Three-Eyed Raven ability to travel into the past to fact check. It's only a matter of time until one of them reveals this information to Jon or Dany.\nNEW GAME OF THRONES PROMO pic.twitter.com/OK0PTAT8VM \u2014 \u064b (@targarcyn) April 1, 2019\nThe question is: How will they react?

{"text": "PRINCE ALBERT \u2014 The Saskatoon Blades sprung a leak that lasted two minutes and 40 seconds, netted three opposing goals, and put them in a bit of trouble.\nThose quick three goals, split between the second and third periods, gave the host Prince Albert Raiders a 3-2 victory Sunday night. The Raiders lead Saskatoon 2-0 in their best-of-seven second-round Western Hockey League playoff series, with Games 3 and 4 slated for Tuesday and Wednesday in Saskatoon.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of junior hockey,\u201d said Raiders\u2019 head coach Marc Habscheid. \u201cIt\u2019s like a box of chocolates: You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d\nEverybody in the jam-packed building was keenly aware of what happened in the first game, a 6-1 dismantling dealt by the host Raiders. If they\u2019d dished out more of the same on Sunday, the series would have seemed to be almost over. But the Blades put up a fight \u2014 a 2-0 lead late in the second period against the WHL\u2019s best team, and a refusal to give ground.\n\u201cGame 1, we kind of shied away from them \u2014 almost looked a little bit timid and scared to go into those battles,\u201d said Saskatoon forward Kirby Dach. \u201cTonight, we came out with a different mind-set and played our game, and didn\u2019t back down from any of those battles. We played the right way. Three minutes is all it took for them to find the back of the net a couple of times, and it ended up hurting us in the end.\u201d\nDach \u2014 a consensus early first-round pick in the upcoming NHL draft \u2014 scored the night\u2019s most spectacular goal, collecting the puck at centre ice, retreating briefly into his own zone, then stick-handling past the entire Raiders\u2019 on-ice contingent. The resulting goal, after that brilliant ballet, set social media buzzing. Fired-up Raiders fans had taunted Dach en masse throughout the weekend, and he peered into the crowd after scoring, right hand cupped behind his ear, then made a couple of dismissive gestures.\n\u201cI love playing in these kind of games,\u201d Dach said. \u201cI grew up in a small town, playing in barns like this, so it kind of reminds me a little bit of home. Anytime you\u2019re doing something right and the crowd\u2019s booing you and calling your name and chanting, you\u2019re obviously a good player and doing the right things out there. I take it as a compliment, almost, and just keep playing my game.\u201d\nEric Florchuk made it 2-0 for the Blades early in the second, before the Raiders struck with those three quickies \u2014 first Zack Hayes with 29 seconds left in the frame, then Dante Hannoun, then Sean Montgomery.\n\u201cThe reason the score was the way it was tonight, versus Game 1, was we competed and worked harder,\u201d said Blades head coach Mitch Love. \u201cWe took two minutes and 40 seconds off in the hockey game, and that was the difference today.\u201d\nkemitchell@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/kmitchsp\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "BC-EU--France-Praying at the Fire,2nd Ld-Writethru\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Some kneeled, some folded their hands to make silent entreaties. Others sang with their eyes focused on the sky that had gone from blue to yellow and orange, and filled with acrid smoke.\nIn an impromptu act of togetherness and hope, Parisians and visitors to France's charismatic capital came together to pray for Notre Dame as a fire quickly advanced through the cathedral Monday.\nThe blaze that engulfed Notre Dame brought memories and sorrow to people around the world who had seen or dreamed of seeing the church known for its sculpted gargoyle guards and place in literary history. But emotions might have run highest in the crowd outside another Gothic church, not far from where Notre Dame burned.\nIn front of the Saint-Julien-des-Pauvres church, a couple hundred people knelt in prayer in the middle of a larger group. More voices joined an unceasing communal hymn sung mostly a cappella, though accompanied at one point by two violins.\n\"The cathedral is more than walls. It's a symbol of Catholic France,\" said Paris resident Gaetane Schlienger, 18, who tried to climb a tree near the vigil. \"But I have a lot of friends who are not Catholic, and for them it also has a huge impact.\"\nSchlienger said she comes to Notre Dame nearly every week because gazing at it \"you feel in security, in peace. It's magnificent.\"\nThe cathedral also called to Quentin Salardaine, 25, a doctor from Paris, as flames devoured it and colored the sky.\n\"I think this building just symbolizes Paris, no matter if you're Catholic or not. I'm not,\" Salardaine said. \"I'm just here because I couldn't stay at my place just knowing that this thing is happening and there are people gathering, singing this religious anthem.\"\nElsewhere in Paris, hundreds, and then thousands of people lined the banks of the Seine River around the small island on which Notre Dame stands, watching in disbelief and horror.\nThe flames spread along the roof at the back of the structure. The spire burned and fell.\nThe fire chief in Paris reported crews were struggled to contain the fire, which progressed into the cathedral's wooden interior and one of the architecturally distinctive towers. Streams of water from fire hoses whipped across the exterior.\nEven after firefighters started getting a handle on the blaze, bits of flame could be seen from the Left Bank still licking above exposed walls where the roof used to be. Lights moving past the huge stained-glass windows at the front of Notre Dame appeared to be guiding investigators doing inspections.\nLater, an Associated Press reporter got a glimpse inside the cathedral. The only illumination inside the darkened structure came from a glowing red hole in the soaring ceiling. Hours earlier, the spire had risen from that spot into the Paris skyline. Streams of sparks instead spilled onto the floor where the church choir usually stands.\nOutside Saint-Julien-des-Pauvres, people kept approaching the spontaneous chorus. Blandine Bouret, 68, said she knew the neighborhood well. Her grandfather had a small store on a street in the shadow of Notre Dame. Her father had an engraving boutique nearby.\n\"It's terrible, it's catastrophic. This is the soul of Paris,\" Bouret said.\nAmericans Lucy Soule and her father Win, of Freeport, Maine, felt lucky to have visited Notre Dame an hour before flames engulfed it. Lucy Soule, 22, said it also felt \"weird.\"\n\"Now you can smell it burning,\" she said of the monument she'd stood in so recently.\nHer father said, \"I feel sorry for the people tomorrow. They won't be able to see it.\"\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "I'm saying it now to hold myself accountable: this Summer will be the Summer I lighten up with the early bedtime thing. I mean it. I'll let my kids stay up later. I know it will be hard for me because early bedtime is my jam \u2014 yes, even in the Summer. I love reading in my quiet nook with the outside Summer light shining in or enjoying a cocktail with my husband on the patio; so yes, I will put my kids to bed so I can enjoy my favorite Summer activities. It might sound selfish, but early bedtimes have just always worked for our family; the kids wake up well-rested, and my husband and I get to spend some time taking care of ourselves. But now that the kids are older (almost 5 and 7) I think it's time I loosen the leash a little.\nThey're no longer in the baby and toddler years, so a little less sleep won't completely wreck the days that follow. They can either make up that lost sleep with a nap or even by sleeping in if they want to. (Fingers crossed, right?) But one thing I can't make up to them are those lost Summer memories that take place at dusk or even after the sun goes down.\nThis Summer, I'm going to give in to the late-night Summer activities that I remember loving as a kid. I remember gallivanting through the grass with my brothers, glass jars in hand, trying to catch fireflies. We'd follow the glow of the little bugs and swing our jars into the air trying to grab them. I never caught a single one, but the joy of trying to still stays with me. Next on my list will be a late-night bonfire to roast marshmallows. My kids have roasted several marshmallows in their day, but it was usually a hurried fiasco because I was so damn stressed about getting them to bed on time. But this Summer, I want to watch my kids lounge in camping chairs circling our hodge-podge bonfire pit, staring into the fire on a Wednesday night \u2014 just because.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is a little embarrassing, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, but my kids have yet to watch fireworks. I know. I'm lame. But my kids used to snooze right through them. I didn't see the purpose in torturing them (and let's be honest, myself) by forcing them to stay awake with all that noise. But this year, they're old enough to truly enjoy them \u2014 and remember them for that matter. So, I'm so excited to head to a local spot near a lake on the Fourth of July, throw down a couple of blankets, and sprawl out. We'll munch on snacks and I'll enjoy my kids' \"oohs and ahhs\" over the fireworks display. I'm excited to share this first-time magic with my kids, despite whatever crankiness follows the next morning.\nAnd finally, I just want to relax on the whole bedtime thing for my kids because, well, they only get one childhood. If they're still running through the sprinkler or bobbing in the neighbor's pool past bedtime, I'll let it slide. Because it's those simple memories that they'll hold onto forever. And who I am to take that away from them? This vow isn't going to be an easy one for good ol' mom to keep. I know that. But I owe it to my growing children to try. I want them to have those magical childhood memories that take place after the sun goes down.\n", "label": "human"}
{"text": "OREM \u2014 Mark Madsen did what came naturally at his Monday press conference announcing his hire as Utah Valley University\u2019s men's basketball coach.\nMadsen spoke of the work ethic and attention to detail he saw perfected by Kobe Bryant. He described the iconic slippery eel move of Kevin McHale. He saluted Mark Pope \u2014 the coach he is replacing \u2014 and praised UVU legacy players as well as the current roster. He spoke of his ideas on recruiting, that he wanted to build a wall around Utah, seek players nationally and internationally. He spoke Spanish to the Hispanic community and described his passion to be a Wolverine.\nMadsen sold it hard. Just like Pope did a week earlier when he was introduced as BYU's new coach.\nIn short, listening to these two guys, Utah is lucky to have them coaching in the Beehive State.\nMadsen brings nine years of NBA playing experience to the Orem campus. He has two NBA championship rings. And contacts galore.\nMadsen spent six seasons as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers. That includes work with game plans, scouting reports, working closely at gaining the confidence of the most talented, highly paid, egocentric basketball players on the planet.\nThere are six coaching seasons, then there are six seasons of coaching.\nA college basketball season is between 27 and 30 games depending on postseason play. An NBA season is 82 games plus postseason play and preseason games, or about three times as many tipoffs, game plans and scouting reports. Taking the minimum number of NBA games, Madsen has been on the sidelines at the highest level of the sport for 492 games.\nThat is a colossal number of tips.\nThe Madsen hire is a catch for Utah Valley, but in the now, you have to really feel for the current players. They lost their head coach last week to BYU. Since that time, those players had to have set their hopes that one of Pope\u2019s assistants, interim head coach Cody Fueger or Chris Burgess, would be named as his replacement. It would provide a familiar voice and connections and forged trust.\nThey met Madsen on Sunday and he expected players to go through an offseason workout right after his presser Monday.\nMadsen\u2019s main task, just like Pope at BYU, is to recruit his players to buy in. This will consume him in the weeks to come.\nBy all accounts, relationships are one of Madsen\u2019s strengths. His positivity, humility, approachability and ability to earn trust made him a Lakers favorite. From Bryant to Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Madsen really got to them on a personal level.\nOne of my favorite Madsen stories occurred after the Lakers made him a first-round pick out of Stanford. When he showed up to his first practice, Shaq had just signed a new $80 million contract and asked Madsen to go with him to buy Rolex watches for the entire team.\nAfter buying the watches, Shaq took Madsen to a car dealership and asked him to pick out a car. Madsen politely declined and leased a Jeep Cherokee instead as Shaq looked over his signing of the papers. Back then it wasn\u2019t unusual for the superstar to buy trucks or SUVs for players, managers or trainers that had license plates that read in some form: THXSHAQ.\nShaq took Madsen to a \"Big and Tall.\" store. Thrifty Mark reluctantly chose a shirt and a pair of pants. What he did not know is Shaq had the clerks stockpile packages of those shirts and pants in his size in every color behind the counter.\nWhen the time came to check out, Madsen got out his wallet to pay for a shirt and pair of pants. The clerks brought out stacks and stacks of shirts and pants. Clerks even had suits, jackets, shoes and a pile of socks. Shaq insisted on paying for all of it.\nThis began a long-lasting relationship between Madsen and O'Neal that has continued to this day. Madsen had a similar relationship with Kobe.\nDuring a game one day, a vendor dropped a box of popcorn and Kobe asked Madsen to pick it up and bring it to him. Madsen retrieved it, and on the way back, Shaq asked, \u201cMark, give me the popcorn.\u201d Madsen said he could not, Kobe had claimed it. Shaq asked again, Madsen refused, keeping his promise. This went back and forth for a minute until Madsen delivered the goods to Kobe. The team got a lot of miles out of it, that Madsen kept his word and would not be swayed, even when pressured by the big man.\nIn the NBA\u2019s world of mega money, narcissistic gladiators, where coaches are often run out of town by superstar players when they don\u2019t get their way, Madsen was unique in his relationships, his simplicity in applied moral fortitude. He was a light on the hill.\nIt is interesting that Pope, Burgess and Madsen, all top high school players connected to the local culture through The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and with family ties to Utah Valley, chose to go to Washington/Kentucky, Duke (Burgess later transferred to Utah) and Stanford when the time came to sign with a college back in the day.\nNow all three are husbands and fathers, seeking a place to settle down in a hectic profession and crazy world and they\u2019ve picked Utah County, a place they have learned to appreciate.\nUVU president Astrid S. Tuminez introduced Madsen, saying he fits the mold of another head coach two feet taller than the president, referring to Pope. Tuminez searched for a home in Utah Valley after replacing Matt Holland. A home she was close to buying is now the one Madsen will reportedly purchase.\nMadsen was married two years ago to Hannah Harkness, a musical prodigy, once a student at Juilliard and a former Miss Utah contestant. They have a 1-year-old son.\n\u201cI told Hannah if she\u2019d learn how to read an NBA boxscore, I\u2019d learn to read Mozart,\u201d Madsen said.\nBoth are on diaper duty.\nIn many ways, Mad Dog Madsen and Hannah will fit right in.\n", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Subaru Outback has always been a left-of-center contender in the midsize crossover-SUV space. It's more of a tall wagon than an upright sport-utility vehicle, with plenty of ground clearance and lots of space inside. We like the Outback because it thinks slightly outside the box. And the brand-new 2020 Outback that debuts at the New York Auto Show this week offers updates that broaden the model's appeal without straying from that charming formula.\nFor starters, the 2020 Outback now rides on Subaru's global platform, which underpins the Ascent, Crosstrek, Forester, Impreza and redesigned 2020 Legacy, the latter of which largely forms the basis for this redesigned wagon. The new Outback isn't much larger than its predecessor, but Subaru says the structure is significantly stiffer than before.\nOn the powertrain front, the big news is the return of a turbocharged engine option. In its higher XT trims, the Outback uses the 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four engine from the Ascent and Legacy, tuned to produce 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. Paired with a continuously variable transmission, Subaru estimates fuel economy numbers of 23 miles per gallon city and 30 mpg highway with this engine, plus the ability to tow up to 3,500 pounds.\nNon-XT models will use Subaru's 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four engine, with 182 horsepower and 176 pound-feet of torque. This engine is slightly more efficient, with Subaru estimating fuel economy of 26 mpg city and 33 mpg highway. As with the turbo engine, the 2.5-liter H4 is paired with a continuously variable transmission and all-wheel drive.\nSubaru says the 2020 Outback has a number of improved suspension components that ought to make it more enjoyable to drive. Should you want to venture off the beaten path, the Outback offers 8.7 inches of ground clearance -- the same as before -- and all models get the company's X-Mode function with hill-descent control.\nEnlarge Image Steven Pham/Roadshow\nInside, the new Outback gets a massive tech upgrade, by way of the 11.6-inch, portrait-oriented infotainment display, which is standard on all but the base trim level. This new touchscreen runs an updated version of the automaker's Starlink infotainment system, with optional TomTom-based navigation and a new app called Chimani (which kind of sounds like a granola-based snack), which gives detailed information about all 417 national parks in the US -- how appropriately Subaru.\nWhether you get the big touchscreen or opt for the base model, every 2020 Outback comes standard with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth audio and over-the-air updates. All Outbacks also come with Subaru's EyeSight safety tech, which includes adaptive cruise control and lane-centering tech. LED headlights, reverse automatic braking, blind-spot monitoring, a head-up display and a front-view camera are all available as options, or bundled into higher trim levels.\nOtherwise, the Outback's interior isn't radically larger than before, though Subaru says it's a lot quieter, with better overall materials. The Outback has 75.7 cubic feet of space behind the front seats -- about the same as other midsize crossovers -- and can be had with a hands-free power liftgate. Instead of kicking your foot under the bumper like on many cars with this tech, the Outback's system activates when you wave a hand (or arm, if you're carrying grocery bags) in front of the Subaru logo on the hatch.\nEnlarge Image Steven Pham/Roadshow\nFor the extra rugged among us, Subaru offers the Onyx Edition Outback, which starts with the second-from-base Premium trim, and adds water-repellant seat material, unique 18-inch wheels and the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine. The Onyx Edition also gets a hands-free power liftgate, front-view camera and a dual-mode X-Mode drive setting.\nThe Onyx Edition XT is one of several 2020 Outback models, including Base, Premium, Limited, Touring, Limited XT and Touring XT. Pricing for all of these models will be announced when the Outback arrives in Subaru dealers this fall.\nOriginally published April 17, 8:30 a.m. PT.\n", "label": "human"}

That\u2019s right \u2014 in today\u2019s day and age when training, nutrition and science have combined to break records at a dizzying pace, Owens held the school record for a whopping and unbelievable 80 years.\nWe\u2019re talking about it as past tense because OSU sprinter Nick Gray finally posted a faster time of 10.17 at the Gamecock Invitational over the weekend.\nNick Gray\u2019s 10.17 100m broke Jesse Owens\u2019 Ohio State school record, which had stood for 80 years since 1939! pic.twitter.com/anzw0anXAQ \u2014 FloTrack (@FloTrack) April 14, 2019\nWhile it was no doubt a fast time, the OSU school record posted by Gray was only good enough for second place.

{"text": "The fact that Michael Le has been granted bail is a huge victory for him and his lawyers in a number of ways.\nThe maximum amounts of original prison terms ordered under pre-trial motions have been reduced by more than 60 per cent.\nThere\u2019s no requirement for him to maintain the mere moral right to remain in society. A judge could simply say up front he wants to let Le out of jail, knowing that he would serve no more prison time if he was acquitted at trial.\nIt puts tremendous stress on Crown Attorney Michael Mansfield who must manage a case that\u2019s likely to go the distance and is likely to be appealed, likely pending a new judge\u2019s decision, which could stretch well into the next decade.\nMoreover, Le is entitled to so many of the guidelines of Crown counsels for release. He\u2019s got 24/7 access to a lawyer and can keep his criminal lawyer, avoid early hearings and the risk of having to go back to court on minor matters that might jeopardize his release.\nStill, it was a long road to get to this tentative release and it\u2019s likely a year or two before Le\u2019s innocence, ignorance or duress will be sufficiently proven to justify him being freed at some point.\nThis is where the legal black hole of the Surrey Six case in the last decade comes into play.\nThe trial failed to discover even the motive for six individuals \u2013 leader Jamie Bacon, Cody Haevischer, Matthew Johnston, and his half-brother Jonathon Bacon, as well as convicted drug dealer Michael Le \u2014 to shoot in July 2007, four days after Bacon\u2019s birthday party on Pender Street.\nIn September last year, Le was sentenced to seven years in prison but some 34 months (seven years and eight months) were added on top of that for all the so-called aggravating factors: violence, lack of remorse, lack of criminal record and involvement in criminal activities.\nThere are myriad things not known about the murders, so it\u2019s unlikely an accused killer will ever actually be helped or hurt by his or her legal defence.\nMansfield would be further hampered by opting to trial Le for killing six innocents, including the six who died, more than the facts must be known before it\u2019s expedient to seek a new trial.\nAt the same time, a new judge would need to address the thorny issues in the case.\nIn February, the first part of the Lien II constitutional challenge \u2014 where Le and Haevischer are being challenged on their Charter rights to a fair trial \u2014 began with a day of arguments. The issues ranged from the \u201cculture of fear\u201d through to whether Crown overreached in directing a sentencing expert to conclude that the killers were motivated by \u201cdangerousness.\u201d\nThere was no sense that the two men would be any safer while out on bail.\nThe Crown, along with the men\u2019s lawyers, on Monday outlined arguments on several aspects in what they will seek to have part II decided before the judge does.\nIn addition to Le and Haevischer, a second man, Sandip Duhre, is also facing trial on first-degree murder charges.\nBacon and Duhre are in jail but not accused of any offence, and there has been no obvious pressure on them to agree to the conclusion on bail that might establish their innocence, if Le has been found so.\nMansfield is scheduled to resume the arguments on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cThe final decision will come after extensive debate by the parties and the judicial division of the court,\u201d the court announced.\nBoth sides are back in court May 2, the announcement said.\nMaybe the case will end in early June. Or the result will be arrived at long after court adjourns. But the way the Crown and defence are almost equally at the beginning and end of the road, it would seem it will be to either go to trial or for another trial.\nIt\u2019s not even inconceivable that it will be several more years, or longer, before verdicts are delivered.\nMcGraw is the lead lawyer for the Vanglo family, parent of Ed Schellenberg.\nkbolan@postmedia.com\nblog: vancouversun.com/tag/real-scoop\ntwitter.com/kbolan\n", "label": "machine"}

She sang for films, music videos and recording for advertising shows.\nIn the national song competition while singing her debut song 'Yi Gal' she captivated public and got a place in the list of 30 at the age of 16.\nA former musical sensation Fauzia Azeem arrived at the event to pay her respects. President Lahore Arts Council Syed Asif Ali said he will arrange a questioner session at the premises of National College of Arts (NCA) with the late artist's family.\nLater the body of the entertainer will be shifted to Aiwan-e-Iqbal from the Lums for a Mass Funeral Saturday. Her funeral prayers will be held at the Banquet Hall after the Zohar prayers. Nazia Hassan was born at Shimla, the summer capital of Himilayo Himineyo of Karakoram at the end of June 1932 to the Raja Pur Yar Gilgit who abandoned her when she was 12 years old.\n\"I was nine years old when my beloved Rabha Sapara Begum came to my village and convinced my father to let me marry one of his male friends, my father did not accept her because she was nine years old,\" Nazia Hassan explained. However, during her final year in school she held a marriage ceremony with Ishaq, a local boy, who was 20 at the time. The ceremony was conducted by Rabbani, a clerk at the ghassadara office of Gilgit-Baltistan and the beloved husband of Nazia Hussain's father. Nazia, along with Ishaq, looked beautiful in white and red organza dresses. She never changed during the dress inspection with Rabbani.\nThe enchanting Pahstun girl's classical singing taught her to sing in the voice of her own culture, rather than those of neighbouring Balochistan or Punjab. After the wedding, Nazia Urwa Hassan, known as Nazia Hassan, returned to Shimla.\nShe taught her class and went to a restaurant near the marriage hall to enjoy dinner with her husband and his family. Nazia Hassan was still upset over that and once again reminded Rabbani about the marriage, which infuriated him and she said, \"Now, Rabbani don't talk to me like this. I am in love with Ishaq. I want you to give me my Rs500,000 double wedding money just like your father had done.\"\nThe feudal Sardar said, \"Saba pahhtat bacha khoi, sab khoi jo zameen, sab bagh de khoi/ (Please be patient with me for a while, I'm waiting for my lover to return,\" which could not calm her down.\nFollowing a heated discussion, Rabbani left the restaurant with his khata in one hand and Rs500,000 in the other. Rabbani then left the room and sat on his horse and said: \"Now you're a pathetic goonda, you're a goonda, stop playing, excuse my language, I'm a Punjabi, could be a bad language, 'tum, hums aap ko naam kar raha,' says Salma to Rabbani's father Prem. The coarse Sardar walked away from the house.\n\"Later the fiery Begum gave the 'shoot it up' speech to her beloved Rabha, but with Nazia's backing, Rabha gave up in disbelief and said, 'Bale se pehle bataye dhaev, hae behen baray chhiya jaye kaar jaata hui?'

{"text": "In the lead-up to her debut record, Molly Tuttle is hitting the road for a 40-date string of shows in support of When You're Ready , and joining Katy Perry 's Witness World Tour . But Tuttle is also keeping busy behind the scenes; she just recently started streaming audio recordings for The Boot and Taste of Country fan club members, and her '90s throwback album, The Rock Edge , has arrived on streaming services.\nFor listeners expecting something very contemporary when it comes to Tuttle's music, it's the kind of sound that recalls her neo-country predecessor Miranda Lambert . That kind of vibe informed When You're Ready , but it also sheds light on who she is as an artist, currently.\nBelow, Tuttle talks about her influences, her new album and more.\nIt feels like I've been on the road for a while. It feels like a full-time job! What a great way to be ...\nYeah. A great way to make a record is to go from one live show to the next. I feel like I've been, over the past three years, \"on-the-road-for-the-last-three-years,\" basically, going back and forth, every time I've gone.\nYou get used to hearing it from a different perspective, and playing certain songs in a different way. That's part of where this record came from. When you get back to it in the studio and record it, you get another set of ears to listen to it as if it were just a regular song, and it's this opportunity to work out all of those little things.\nWhat was the most unexpected of those things?\nThe most surprising thing is how different the setting and the setting of a live show is from how you've recorded it. This album was recorded in a recording studio, but I love the live sound of the show that we have, so there's just been a lot of additions and additions to the sound of how we do it on the show.\nWe kind of have to work to find that right mix of the two. It's really quite a challenge sometimes.\nWhat were some of the inspirations for your new album?\nIt definitely had to [be] very different from the first record, so I had to step up and learn how to write again. I feel like that's been a huge struggle for me in the past couple of years.\nAnd then I always love working with different producers, and this time I did it the old-fashioned way: I wrote with three producers and sat in a room -- with Rodney Clawson , Corey Crowder and Myles Kennedy -- and I came out with something. Every time that was gonna be my next step to saying I know how to write a song ...\nIt's definitely going to be different now than what I've done in the past.\nYou wrote \"I Wanna Lose My Rose\" with Rodney and Corey. What is it about that relationship that made you want to share that with them?\nFor me, it's so interesting to compare music from different eras, and how they differ in how they write. On this record, I wanted to write a song that had a little bit of that \"old Nashville vibe\" to it, but felt like I was living it and taking it into the future with me. I listened to the '90s for a little bit -- that '90s and the '70s are always sort of intertwined, but it's definitely a different time when you're writing a song and singing a song.\nThere's nothing like good old-fashioned throwback. So I wanted to write a song with those thoughts in mind. Corey and Rodney put their own voices on it, and I was so lucky that I got to work with these two guys.\n", "label": "machine"}

The question here is can they sustain this current run at home?\nThe record books will tell us that Chennai Super Kings didn't lose a single match in 2018 when it was under the leadership of Ravindra Jadeja as coach. The last time CSK lost a match at home, it was way back in the second season of IPL when they lost to Mumbai Indians. The batsmen and their captain are taking matters in their own hands at home.\nSkipper MS Dhoni's batting form has been a mystery. Though he's been prolific with the ball, he hasn't taken the help of his top four batsmen, who have shown alarming form with the bat. While the limited opportunities have come from Dwayne Bravo (82 runs in 6 games), the other batsmen should show strong shoulders and start producing good scores. CSK's bowling also has been going well, with consistent batsmen going after the bowlers. It will be interesting to see how Ravindra Jadeja bowls in front of his home crowd in Chennai. Jadeja has been known to experiment in his form of bowling, but the fans will look up to him and hope he leads by example on Wednesday.\nHowever, there is an added challenge in the form of A B de Villiers. He has been in good touch and will look to convert into a hero by providing the big innings that CSK desperately needs. If he can score over fifty, CSK will be back on the winning ways. The quality of bowling and the fielding will be crucial here as it will provide some encouragement for the fans. MS Dhoni will need to lead from the front to give Chennai a fighting chance in this game.\nCatch up on all the latest IPL news and updates here.

And so are Alex Meyer and Felix Pena.\nThe Angels got good news on that front, too, with both those pitchers making their major league debuts Saturday afternoon.\nTrout hit two solo homers, including a three-run shot in the eighth inning that carried the Angels to a 9-5 victory over the Atlanta Braves.\n\u201cTroutie did great for the first couple at-bats,\u201d Manager Mike Scioscia said. \u201cHe missed the target a few times, but got to two and third pretty quickly and got a couple good swings off.\u201d\nThe Angels jumped to a 7-0 lead before Meyer ever threw a pitch in the majors. The Braves have struck out nine times in the series, they were hitting .238 coming into the game and Mike Trout was hitting .428 with runners in scoring position.\nScioscia gave the news that Erik Aybar could be ready to return soon on Saturday, after Aybar went through a full game as part of his major league workout. He looked terrific, grounding out and lining out with no problems, before grounding out in the final game of a minor league rehab assignment on Friday.\nThat might clear the way for him to make his first start of the season on Tuesday night against Detroit. That would give Aybar a day off, much like he got on Wednesday.\n\u201cAybar is a good player,\u201d Scioscia said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be playing out there. He\u2019s going to be the hole in our middle infield. We don\u2019t have that just yet. We need those two (Elvis Andrus and Ian Kinsler) to perform at their levels and he will come off the bench and there will be some moments he gets to play.\u201d\nAs for Trout, all he wants to do is make solid contact and move the ball. His first home run was a line drive to left field on the first pitch, a 93 mph fastball.\nHis next was a line drive on the next pitch, a 96 mph fastball that left the stadium as the most expensive home run ever, the $3.3 million hit by Miami\u2019s Giancarlo Stanton.\n\u201cNice to get the home runs early,\u201d Trout said. \u201cYou feel good. The pitchers like to come at you early and you want to give them a different look. Obviously, my home runs are more loud.\u201d\nHe shrugged off the nudge he got from home plate umpire Jordan Baker before that shot, pointing out the bigger factor \u2013 the towering homer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was anything,\u201d Trout said. \u201cThe first one was a pretty good pitch, 94, 95. Maybe he did wave at me a little bit, but the second one, after that it was a home run. I\u2019m happy I got two.\u201d\nBRONX NOTES\nAndrew Heaney, who starts on Sunday, will be making his first start at Angel Stadium since he was called up, after 14 months away with Tommy John surgery. \u2026\nWith Heaney, the Angels purchased the contract of Cory Rasmus, who had been optioned to Triple-A earlier in the day. \u2026\nSince the start of the 1990 season, the Angels are 6-10 against the Braves.\nContact the writer: jlfletcher@scng.com\n", "label": "machine"}

Sansa is determined to liberate the Winterfell Castle so she can support the alliance, mainly by selling the Iron Islands to the Lannisters. Mother of the Wall and leader of the Three-Eyed Raven, Jon agrees to ride north for an unspecified purpose for long enough for a northern army to get moving. To which he\u2019s offered an explanation for the black gate and the bolted white tunnels. \u201cI\u2019m not a king, and don\u2019t pretend to be one,\u201d Jon said.

What is Gendry up to in that possible Fortnite-related army? Why does Jon seem to put down the thing he\u2019s doing to the Boltons?\u2014the responses to these are surprising. It\u2019s not obvious that Jon and Sansa have been on the same level all along; rather than sit down with the Three-Eyed Raven, Jon calls off his meeting and speaks with Jon Snow, a sociopath who\u2019s long expressed great fondness for razing any place where his family is suspected of planning to settle.

It\u2019s what Jon suggested of the Crossing, that between those who have and those who haven\u2019t, he\u2019s himself somewhere in the middle.

{"text": "FILE PHOTO: Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir addresses supporters during his last electoral rally before presidential elections in Omdurman, Sudan April 6, 2019. REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/File Photo\nBy Denis Dumo\nJUBA (Reuters) - For Sudan, the choice of a successor for President Omar al-Bashir will be a key factor in determining whether the crisis triggered by his March 30 exit from office plays out in a distant future or over the immediate horizon.\n\"The transition of power poses a delicate balance between two competing desires,\" Yonis Mohamed Ibrahim, an analyst with the Chatham House think tank in London, told Reuters.\n\"On the one hand, Khartoum wants a visible act of democracy to assuage international observers' concerns about the hold of the parties and religious groups in the election. On the other hand, the country wants to ensure all people are represented in the new government and civil service - including supporters of the old regime.\"\nBashir, 75, was president since 1989, when he overthrew the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement - which was then led by southern rebel leader John Garang. He won three elections and his northern-based National Congress Party (NCP) had a monopoly on power until April 9, when the ruling coalition - which had led Sudan for the last two decades - lost control of the national assembly.\nPublic convulsions during the inauguration of Bashir's long-time rival Salva Kiir, president of the northern-based south, suggested that Bashir might have expected a big celebration but instead he walked away from the venue.\n\"No country wants to see its leader hung in effigy,\" said Geoff Porter, professor of African politics at George Mason University in the United States. \"What ultimately happened last week in Khartoum was a literal demonstration of the political demise of the government. It does not necessarily portend the demise of the regime.\"\nA FRESH ELECTION?\nWith the government in disarray, Bashir, who is expected to be taken to court by the international criminal court for war crimes in Darfur, was obliged to give up power by law. In a ceremony held in the Khartoum Opera House, he and other coalition leaders left parliament holding hands and faced the cameras as they approached the podium.\nBashir is constitutionally entitled to stay in his job until presidential elections are held within 90 days, although electoral authorities said the vote would not be held within those times. Sudan's constitution says a new parliament will be elected within 30 days.\n\"If a decision had been made to hold an election within 60 days, no one would have been able to change it,\" said Ibrahim Hassan Ahmed, a political scientist at Khartoum University. \"But it's obvious that the constitution does not provide for presidential constitutional immunity after he departs from power.\"\nThe many questions about the future course of Sudan's affairs must now be addressed by the country's deeply divided ruling coalition, politicians, analysts and experts say. After the handover of power, Kiir addressed a crowds in a speech in the southern oil town of Abyei in a rallying cry that signalled his determination to take Sudan's northern power brokers out of power.\nA month later, Sudan's former ruling National Umma Party - a coalition of former rebel groups - issued a statement vowing not to accept a new Bashir as president.\n\"Bashir's ouster underlines that Sudanese society is a divided one. The only consensus is: no Bashir,\" Amadou Souleymane, a Sudan expert from Leiden University in the Netherlands, said in a recent article in the Journal of African Studies.\nLocal and foreign critics worry that even if there is not a full revolution, Sudan's powerful split-up might make life difficult for a possible president from either of the anti-government coalitions.\n(Writing by Denis Dumo; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Billy Hunter contract, that should mean something to you.\nThe past 10 years were messy.\nWilliams\u2019 status with the Indians went public in 2009.\nBoth Hunter and Williams became sympathetic figures to the late Tom McDonough, one of Larry Doby\u2019s great friends and Terry Francona\u2019s father-in-law.\nNow a member of the Indians\u2019 Hall of Fame, the McDonough family sent a letter explaining why Hunter\u2019s contract was not renewed after eight years. It also expressed \"disappointment\" that he will not be back this season as the Indians general manager.\nHere\u2019s how my column on some of the dirty details of the Hunter controversy was presented last week:\nIt began in 2008 when Hunter went to speak to the Indian\u2019s media relations staff to give the standard news conference each spring. It went on for about 45 minutes.\nWilliams, a longtime Indians public relations man who had been named general manager when Hunter took over, asked to be heard at the end of the news conference. There was a long silence before the news conference continued.\nThen came the contract talk -- Hunter becoming happy enough with his contract and the other general managers to consider hiring a new baseball ops head. He had a first choice. Two other team officials were going to consider the offer.\nThat was when the unmistakable comments from Hunter to the media surfaced. Then Hunter and Williams decided to publicly go after each other over this ridiculous contract issue.\nThe story would become public after the contract expired.\nIt was a vicious fight between two men whose long careers were intertwined. It made me wonder what would happen now -- if there was a surprise release of information? And then the contract matter is resolved.\nWhat if they secretly released the contract? What if it was under the guise of Robinson High School honoring them. You think there was a legitimate excuse to keep it under wraps?\nI\u2019m guessing Hunter, 62, was advised.\nWilliams, 77, offered a comment:\n\u201cI admire the way he's carried on. He's worked around his illness and never expressed his frustration publicly. He still put the players first.\"\nThe moment the word Parkinson\u2019s was mentioned, even off the cuff, the simmering possibility of a contract dispute broke forth.\nSpeaking to the crowd, the announcer said, \u201cIt's an adjustment for the family -- Les and Joy -- to see her (Williams) sitting next to me with all those rest stops at the last inning of a ballgame when we have lost World Series series.\u201d\nYou could feel the amazement spread through the crowd when he talked about Williams\u2019 ability to almost coordinate his Parkinson\u2019s medication with the Cleveland Indians radio broadcasts. He added this:\n\u201cShe's made the transition of moving around and talking and handling the job of the 82nd World Series -- the greatest moment in her life.\u201d\nThe crowd gasped.\n\u201cShe's strong and positive,\" he said, \u201cand she doesn't let it get to her that bad. She doesn't let it. She's a trooper.\u201d\nThe crowd broke into a standing ovation, giving Williams another chance to say, \u201cThanks a bunch. That's very sweet.\"\nBut they kept quiet when a cancer survivor who spent a long time going through chemotherapy was talked about.\nFinally, he said, \u201cMy wife has fought two bouts of breast cancer. I got her great a caregiver. She's with me in the eighth inning, too.\u201d\nThere was silence as the final two words: \u201cI've got Lou Gehrig's disease.\u201d\nFinally, it was over.\nRudy Betancourt was the radio announcer with the Indians in 2010 when this event was under way. I wanted to ask him about how one announcer has been a problem for so long.\nAs he rushed to leave the Village Green in Brunswick, he said, \u201cIf I was Jim Hunter, I wouldn't react in front of a 5,000-person crowd. It\u2019s a forum for communication.\u201d\nHe was right.\nThe next day, after the team honored both of them for their work -- with many in the crowd saying they could not talk on the record -- you could see almost everyone go home and open up their story.\nSomething meant a lot to Billy Hunter.\nRudy Betancourt was a bit speechless at the moment he was honored. But Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease and the treatment he received is the best reason anyone could use to say good-bye.\n", "label": "machine"}

Prior to his practice-ending game-saving interception against Adams and the New Orleans Saints in the Super Bowl LI rematch last season, he was in on 51 receptions, 530 yards and six touchdowns.\nNew England selected Adams, who starred at LSU, with the sixth overall pick in last year\u2019s NFL Draft. The Jets nabbed the Patriots\u2019 second-round pick in the draft and selected fellow first-rounder Sam Darnold.\nGronkowski also has been the subject of trade rumors, with some believing he could land a three-year deal on the open market worth $20 million per season.\nThumbnail photo via Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports Images\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Carroll County Commissioners unanimously passed a measure to sue opioid manufacturers and distributors after hearing a report from County Attorney Matt Lawson.\nThe lawsuit, filed in a district court on Tuesday, would target the manufacturers and distributors of the drugs that have made other states, and consequently, Carroll County, ill.\n\"I believe we are in an absolute crisis,\" County Commissioner Robin Frazier said. \"We have people dying. It is beyond horrific.\"\nCurrent Westminster Mayor Michael Reilly said in a statement that he agrees with the commissioners' decision to move forward.\n\"The proposed suit is well thought out, much needed and will support the fight against this terrible epidemic,\" Reilly said. \"The need for a strong suitably-led lawsuit by a prominent community leader to ensure that Carroll County will no longer be ignored is very real.\"\nAn October 2016 report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration showed that 443 people died from opioid overdose in Carroll County in 2013, and almost 1,000 people died from opioid overdose in Maryland in 2014.\nThose numbers continue to go up. In 2017, 781 people died, and the numbers in 2018 are expected to be even higher.\nThe commissioners are hoping that the lawsuit will help provide some financial relief to those suffering from the opioid epidemic. The county anticipates representing the county as a defendant in the suit, Frazier said.\nCiting three consecutive years of budget cuts in response to declining revenue to the county, the commissioners said they were forced to consider a lawsuit.\n\"Our fiscal condition is precarious right now,\" Frazier said. \"We don't have the revenues, let alone the monies needed to fight this thing.\"\nIn addition to reporting potential legal cases, the budget directors for the commissioners outlined strategies for preventing the financial burden placed on the county for fighting this crisis.\nInterventions have included school-based substance abuse prevention programs, public awareness campaigns and public health education.\nColleen Murphy, a substance abuse counselor in the county, said those groups help treat victims but they don't help dealers or abusers of the drugs.\n\"This is not going to solve it,\" Murphy said. \"This is just another hurdle for people.\"\nThe lawsuits, first announced Wednesday, might have some political benefits for the governor, John Hickenlooper, who became aware of the possibility while in Carroll County, Frazier said.\nSome of the decisions made around the state of Pennsylvania because of the opioid crisis, Frazier said, had been hampered by a lack of help for that state.\nA total of 25 families have been touched by opioid addiction, Lawson said, and many of them are Carroll County residents.\n\"They deserve it and we should do it,\" Frazier said.\nIn an article published in the Carroll County Times last month, attorneys at Hogan Willig said that there was \"a clear need for litigation\" in the industry \u2014 as those suing brought evidence of multiple companies who've contributed to the epidemic, arguing that some of them could be liable for $1 billion each if they didn't behave better.\nThe county commissioners followed the advice of the attorneys and decided to move forward with the lawsuit, Frazier said.\n\"If we're going to do it, we have to go forward and do it ourselves,\" Frazier said.\nctkacik@carrollcountytimes.com\n410-857-7896\ntwitter.com/carrolltribune\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Below are the 3 key unemployment rate indicators to keep an eye on.\nThe unemployment rate does not indicate the health of the economy.\nWednesday's release of the employment and unemployment rates showed a higher unemployment rate than expected. The job growth of 164,000 in March was better than the 119,000 expected, but the unemployment rate of 4.0% was higher than the 3.9% seen in February. The new unemployment rate of 4.0% was within the range of 3.7-4.4% seen in the last four years.\nI will examine the general three key unemployment rate indicators and comment on what they say about the health of the economy.\nThe 10-year treasury yield at 2.8%, another headline mentioned in last week's Economic Wrap, is below the 2.9% trend seen in the last few months and is at the lowest level for the 10-year note since July 2017. However, the yield on the 10-year note has been within a range of around 3.0-3.2% throughout the past 12 months.\nThe last few weeks have seen a quick drop in the yield. From an intermediate-term perspective, this point means 3.3%. This range should be treated with caution.\nEmployment costs index\nI refer to the employment cost index (ECI) as the \"employment cost index.\"\nThe ECI is the traditional measure of labor costs. Since its inception in 1976, the ECI has remained stable in the range of 0.8%-2.1% over the last 40 years.\nMy colleague Gary Gordon explores labor costs on a monthly basis in the latest Economic Weekly Commentary. On March 12, 2019, Gordon wrote, \"Even though stock traders may not be able to use the ECI, it's another tool in the 'why shouldn't stock traders watch the ECI?' toolbox because these analysts contend that with the exception of the boom and bust times, the ECI represents 'positive' trends in labor costs.\"\nI am generally inclined to agree with these results.\nClick here for my column last week that had a very positive 'ECI' view for the U.S. economy.\nThe table below is my 'Fed Funds idea generator chart. The yellow 'excess reserves' line shows the Fed excess reserves as a percent of total currency in circulation. At present, the excess reserves are 126.6% and should be at 125.5% on February, which would mean, if my estimates are correct, a lesser 'overhang' on the market. The market comes into play when starting the discussion with my broader idea 'would the Fed reduce monetary stimulus?.'\nThe next step is to use the excess reserves as a percentage of GDP and get some idea of how much additional stimulus the Fed could cut if it had to reduce 'further?'\nSee my Economic Little Bundle article for my extended explanation of how I think of asset prices when my ideas are at different levels.\nClick here for my newest point-of-view thinking about the direction of asset values.\nI will add that we need to keep a close eye on the currency market as well.\nTo conclude, the unemployment rate does not indicate the health of the economy. The wages index is still showing signs of sluggishness. Labor market dynamics are still pretty good, and the excess reserves are at a 'high' level.\nIf I am right on all three key indicators, I still think the stock market will have a good year.\nLong-Term Debt\nAs the chart above shows, the long-term debt continues to go up, and the standard deviation of the long-term bond is expanding at the fastest pace since 1990. If I am right, we will be entering a new bull market in long-term yields.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

There is no more reason to stay on the side lines.\n\u201cYou have the resources, if you feel lonely, to go out and help.\u201d\nMr Kell added that each person should have the opportunity to change their life for the better, whether it be through making a donation to the Northern Hero campaign or finding shelter through the traditional route.\nHe said: \u201cThere are people out there who have fallen on hard times. They are stuck on a third rate deck and it is my mission to help them out.\u201d\nAccording to the charity\u2019s research, 8,000 people sleep rough at night in London, 10% more than last year.\nThe Northern Hero campaign, funded by the Northern Lottery, is running in the period between September 1 to December 31 2019.\n", "label": "machine"}

He has since sought to form a Palestinian unity government with the backing of his faction.\nDuring talks to come up with such a government over the past week, Abbas was believed to have taken an attractive deal from Hamas, which agrees to renounce violence and recognise Israel in exchange for Palestinian officials being appointed to a Palestinian security service under Fatah.\n", "label": "machine"}

But, like the rest of our team, Sarah is mentally and physically stronger than most adults her age,\" said Lauren House, Vice President of the Readington Township Gymnastic Club, who noticed Sarah's unique disorder growing up.\n\"At an early age, my mom always expressed to me that I needed support from others, because I feel like my Tourette Syndrome makes me different from the rest of my community. It's very difficult for me to have the same social interaction with other children because of my involuntary tics, such as mispronouncing words, kicking, screaming and grunting, which keep me from properly interacting with others. That's what made me especially desperate to start my gymnastics career.\"\nFor children with Tourette Syndrome, many of whom go untreated and whose conduct can be a barrier to learning, spending time in a structured environment with structured social interaction was vital to their development and growth.\n\"When I joined the gymnastics club, my father became my gym teacher, my coach, my English teacher, my father, mother, aunts, sisters, brothers, etc., whose dedication has allowed me to achieve my goals.\"\nSarah noted that it's been so rewarding to see all of the gymnasts also move up to More Spastic Tourette Syndrome, a sub group within the more popular More moderate to severe tics, as well as support more advanced tics, such as Laryngeal Tourette Syndrome.\nThe families of both groups working together are something that Sarah said she is grateful for everyday. She has learned to speak highly of her teammates, coaches and volunteers, especially following all of the home meets that happen every Friday at Pike Park in Readington.\nThis was one particular meet Sarah attended that she always looks forward to, after some of her first falls after struggling with her tics and hearing her teammates. The girl has been further educated about her conduct in public, garnered an advantage over those who continually fear tics.\n\"Since it's so difficult for some people to understand, it's great for them to be surrounded by supportive people like myself every Friday evening,\" Sarah said.\n\"It's a pretty average group of people. A lot of people are like me. We don't want to help anybody feel bad or anything. There are just some people who aren't as vocal and so many people I'm in their shoes. What I try to do as much as possible is showcase my tics in public.\"\nNow in her second year with the Readington Township Gymnastic Club, Sarah aspires to become one of the next Saywitz award recipients for 2020. This is an award given to the most outgoing member of the recreation team, chosen for qualities such as leadership, selflessness, cheerfulness, a desire to teach, a pleasure to hang out with and giving of herself.\nThis item was submitted by Rosie Milano.\n", "label": "machine"}

We're looking at getting more of a biological heart with tissues intact inside the printer so that the model can mimic the human physiology.\u201d\nExperts said the discovery of a 3D heart was a step forward, but suggested other findings might be more important.\n\u201cIt's wonderful to see this kind of advance.

We have condemned the incursions of Israeli forces into Syrian territory, particularly since the beginning of the bloody civil war in 2013,\u201d Mogherini said.\nThe Spanish head of the EU\u2019s political body was not ready to elaborate on the details of her comments, but said Israel\u2019s threats and conflicts \u201cdo not bring security and peace, and will only threaten the very survival of Israel\u201d.\nMogherini noted that major powers, specifically the U.S., the United Kingdom and France, are \u201ccarrying out preparations to determine whether the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council on the Syrian issue are no longer effective\u201d.\nLeaving aside the accusations that the efforts of the Europeans were behind the recent airstrike against Syria, the remarks by Mogherini comes in contrast to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s upcoming visit to Russia, where he will explain Moscow that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must be eliminated within 24 hours.\nUN Security Council Resolutions 1701, 1771 and 2254 have called for the cessation of hostilities in Syria as a first step toward the normalization of relations between the warring parties, resolution 1701 says, with reference to the cease-fire deal between Russia and Turkey in the Golan Heights.\nIn other resolutions, those aimed at stopping the bloodshed in Syria (such as resolution 2216 and 2308), the UNSC called for restraint from both sides of the conflict to allow humanitarian aid to flow uninterruptedly into the country.\nSome heads of state and governments who met in March in the Italian city of Genoa backed a constructive approach in order to resolve the Syrian conflict, in hopes of a political solution that resolves the issues between the parties concerned and a peaceful, predictable and open environment for international investment and trade to flourish.\n\u201cI hope that the EU and its member states take part as partners in the efforts of the tripartite security group in the Sahel to find a long-term peaceful solution to the issues of Sahel, in particular the attacks on the Security Council on the border between Mali and the deep south, as well as the region,\u201d Mogherini added.\nThere is no chance that the new Rome Summit of the African Union and the UN will achieve anything meaningful in the current situation in Libya. From the European Union\u2019s point of view, their only intention is to prevent the disintegration of the political and economic projects pursued by the UN for last decade to ensure peace and security, especially that of the Sahel, which is in dire need of infrastructure, health and energy projects.\nIt is also impossible for the Europeans and other outside powers to \u201cfix Syria\u201d with the country\u2019s foreign minister and foreign minister of Russia, which cannot harm their revenue from weapons sales, as has been proved repeatedly, reported TASS.\n", "label": "machine"}

He stated that the NAB will bring controversial laws that would either be referred to the Parliament or repealed.\nMoreover, Chairman NAB directed the investigating officers and prosecution teams that they need to be more professional, appear and work with honesty and above all to ensure that NAB always protects the rule of law and social justice.\nHe directed the investigating officers to personally appear before the accountability court in all cases, particularly if suspects confess before the court that they plundered the public exchequer, and to respect the rule of law and respect the judicial system.\nThe NAB chairman said that authority of accountability cannot be controlled, and he has the power to grab the financial assets, declare them unlawful, cancel their validity, and send them for auction.\nHe said that NAB is committed to bring equity and justice to the society and would discharge its responsibilities to ensure the rule of law and social justice.\nHe said that every one knows what credibility NAB has and what is its jurisdiction.\nHe also emphasized that NAB is accountable to the government and parliament and no one could put pressure on the NAB with impunity. He said that NAB wanted to establish a new system of justice. Chairman NAB said that corruption cases were still underway in other courts with the issue of corrupt officials.\nOn the other hand, various ministers and others also attended the briefing and gave separate comments about the accountability culture in Pakistan. On concluding the briefing, Chairman NAB Javed Iqbal said that NAB is an independent, impartial, non-partisan and no one would be handcuffed in future, adding that no district or municipality, not only those departments that were under NAB but those political parties are also under NAB, NAB will not allow anybody who is looting the people to continue to do business.\nMeanwhile, members of Pakistan Bar Council met at the headquarters of the body to hear the judgement on the case of former Punjab Assembly speaker Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan.\nThe council members, which include association of lawyers, called it a \u201cstab in the back.\u201d\nThe council\u2019s lawyers maintained that Mashhood violated the laws on which the assembly was functioning and hence, the ruling should be rejected.\nThe council chairman said that the trial was on merit and that they have not accepted the decision of the accountability court. He said that the entire judiciary was against the lawyer, adding that Justice Siddiqui had favour to what the Pakistan Bar Council had said about Pakistan Bar Council at a high-level meeting. He said that they might file appeal against the decision of NAB\u2019s trial court to the apex court as well.\nThe council members argued that all the rules and procedures were violated in Mushrat Ali case against Rana Mashhood. Rana did not declare the two kanal of private property as public property, she said.\nThey said that the former speaker was arrested on the orders of the court at Kashmore, where he was living at that time and he should be arrested again at Lahore. It was bad that Rana has been directed to give undertaking that he does not want to remain in office, they added. They said the decision of the trial court was wrong and decision of NAB in the case should be challenged in court.\nThe council members demanded that the decision of the NAB should be blocked in the courts. The Council proposed that its counsel Dr Ahsan Saeed should be appointed as a Judge of Accountability Court.\nThe office bearers and members of the Pakistan Bar Council condemned the negligence of the public representatives who failed to bring an early solution of the lawyers\u2019 problem.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Three additional cases of mumps have been reported in Hidalgo County, officials said Friday.\n\u201cAlthough we are concerned about the increasing number of mumps cases, we remain confident that the mumps vaccine remains effective,\u201d said Julie Gutierrez, an infectious disease specialist with the state Public Health Department in a news release.\nThe local medical community is monitoring the growing number of reported cases and reporting the findings to state officials, particularly the Department of State Health Services.\n\u201cWe have worked with the Texas Department of State Health Services to respond to several recent reports with measures designed to prevent transmission, such as providing follow-up care and dispensing mumps vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Andre Campos, the county\u2019s public health director.\nThe county\u2019s per capita rate of mumps has exceeded the state average, 2.26 cases per 1,000 residents compared to 2.06 per 1,000 residents statewide.\nThe number of mumps cases are split into three categories:\n1. Infectious.\nThis is the high risk category since many people are already receiving MMR (MMR) vaccination. Hidalgo County at 1.09 cases per 1,000 residents is higher than state average of 0.91 cases per 1,000 residents.\n2. Noninfectious.\nThis category only includes those who have not received the mumps vaccine at the time of illness. Hidalgo County at 0.81 cases per 1,000 residents is lower than state average of 1.04 per 1,000 residents.\n3. Infectious.\nTreatment with other antibiotics is a means of delaying the onset of illness, however, mumps can be spread by infected people coughing, sneezing, talking or touching surfaces and then cleaning those surfaces without washing their hands.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided guidelines regarding vaccination, with nationally recommended vaccination levels for males and females ages 2 through 6.\nThose recommended levels are:\n1. One dose of MMR vaccine for boys aged 6 through 11 and girls, aged 11 through 12, for which doses are considered highly effective.\n2. Two doses of MMR vaccine for boys age 6 through 13 and girls up to 15 and boys up to 13 as recommended by the Texas State Department of State Health Services.\nThe first dose is given at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second in 4 to 6 years of age.\nToward the end of the 2017 school year, officials from the Catholic Diocese of Brownsville reported the third case of mumps in their schools.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone in our community to have mumps,\u201d said county Commissioner Ramon Garcia. \u201cWe should be looking at this disease like chicken pox, it should go away if you get it right.\u201d\nGarcia added that parents of students should talk to their children\u2019s doctors to determine whether they have received the recommended vaccinations.\nIn 2017, the Hidalgo County Youth Commission, along with public officials and health officials, was given a presentation on mumps preparedness.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Windows 10 just got a lot better for gamers with the upgraded Game bar.\nUntil recently, turning on Windows 10's Game bar, which displays the current status of your current game, was one of the least exciting parts of updating to the new operating system. On older computers that weren't hooked to a monitor, the game bar displayed a static title, none of its audio, and/or there was no indication it had even been turned on.\nThat changes with the latest version of the game bar, which Microsoft's Mark Hickey showed me in a blog post. After you install the included free Windows 10 app, Halo Defender, you can now turn the game bar on by hitting the Windows key on your keyboard and pressing the Game bar. Doing so cycles through an assortment of animations as Hickey shows in the video above. You can also select any of the preset \"Features\" shortcuts for the new bar or add your own.\nThe updated Game bar is built on Microsoft's Fluent Design language, which brings wider color and texture gradients, customizable aspect ratios, top-to-bottom scrollbars and more.\nThere's also, of course, better support for sound. With the Game bar, you can now play the game without using your headphones with headphones to shake, tickle, snicker, repeat and more. There's also a faster-switching Game Mode for gamers on the go and improvements to the built-in audio system for gaming in a car.\nYou can also check out the new Cortana integration in the Game bar. (Though, again, you can also use the Cortana with Xbox app to do things with voice commands.)\nMicrosoft also added some nomenclature to the bar so game windows can be renamed or minimized. There's also an improved Math dictionary, meaning the bar knows what object to display, how to change colors and much more.\nFor the most part, the tweaks are small, but if you want to use your actual gaming mouse to play your title then it's easy to add the Xbox App to your Xbox One, still keeps the game bar, and adds a few other hidden menus as well.\n", "label": "machine"}

The substance is not intended for skin.\nDr. Kent Waldeck is the Chief of Internal Medicine at IU Health and said a woman came to one of his clinics recently, desperate for help. After a doctor ran some tests, the doctor found no substance on her skin that would improve her overall health or beauty.\n\u201cShe came in with really dry, sun spotty skin,\" said Waldeck. \"The over all overall condition of her skin, after I ordered her to be tested, it came back a high dose of vitamin A and vitamin B12.\"\nThere are many groups advocating for the use of the substance, which is a form of botulinum toxin A-A. They have different names for it; botulinum toxin B-A and \u201ctoxin B.\"\nThe medication is named after a German physician who used it back in the mid-19th century to treat people who had rosacea and botulism. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most people experiencing an allergic reaction to the substance develop the reaction after receiving botulinum toxin-based products.\nIts use has been heavily researched. ScienceReviews.com claims the effects of the chemical solution on healthy people are \u201climited.\u201d It also says \u201cuntil recently, there was only one known toxin that might be effective against these conditions, but those treatments are unsafe, causing disfigurement and possibly death.\u201d\nSome patients have needed surgery after being exposed to it, but experts at the state's attorney general's office said those cases are rare.\nIn February, Public Service Company of Indiana closed down its \u201cUF\u201d clinic for \"indecent behavior\" when it was receiving hundreds of phone calls.\n\u201cThese people who are getting this thing based on press, that\u2019s the big problem,\" said Hill. \"They are falsifying these photos.

He was arrested in October after his fiancee came home from a night out at a nightclub and told police that her dog had been raped.\nMatiasne is a transient and is on probation for grand theft, burglary and criminal mischief.

{"text": "Fifteen years after \u201cA Milli\u201d gave Lil Wayne the biggest payday in hip-hop history, the rapper remained happily connected to Cash Money. So happy, in fact, that he was criticized by critics for not being more opposed to his former label\u2019s business practices and collaborator Birdman, despite indisputable evidence to the contrary. One alleged Business insider, Evak Ish, claimed to told friend in October 2007 that G.O.O.D. Music boss Kanye West wanted it to remain his label and that Carter V was coming. In response, Cash Money publicist and co-president L.A. Reid fired back: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you are going to wear those scabs for a lot of years and then you\u2019re going to have to live it out.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible to know it all even more now: according to a New York Daily News reporter, Lil Wayne paid a visit to the Cash Money offices to say goodbye to Collyer, who would be announcing his retirement on Christmas Day. Rumors suggested Weezy would be offered a new deal on a par with 2004\u2019s Drake and Christina Milian collab Dirty Money, but his desire to stay put is obvious.\nBy 2004, Cash Money was newly famous after signing Jay Z and Ne-Yo, even though Wayne\u2019s Million Dollar Babies album hadn\u2019t come out yet. A year after this visit, the company released a press release after the Wayne Grammy Award that alluded to a legal battle, pointing out that Juvenile hadn\u2019t even responded. In a February 2014 letter addressed to \u201cNick Miller,\u201d the then-21-year-old seemingly shed a new light on his relationship with the label. \u201cIn all of my adult years I\u2019ve been so disrespectful to everyone, I never respected myself enough to be respected,\u201d Wayne continued. \u201cI was loyal and I failed my president Wayne Carter.\u201d\nIt\u2019s interesting to know that Wayne considered leaving Cash Money after selling a million copies of Carter III, but Wayne\u2019s on-and-off relationship with the label was never truly over, despite the organization\u2019s exorbitant price tag: Birdman was signed to both Death Row and Mannie Fresh\u2019s label and contributed to a $60 million jackpot in 1995. Wayne\u2019s penchant for bouncing between labels is an entrepreneurial necessity: he famously rapped that Cash Money executives \u201ccan\u2019t meet a 2\u00bd [percent] 40 like Em\u201d for his 2011 Rebirth-era debut, Tha Carter IV. The millionaire label often refused to provide him with a cut of album\u2019s sales (as opposed to a percentage of a home-grown artist\u2019s profit), forcing Wayne\u2019s usage of iTunes and digital downloads. Despite his contract demands, Wayne still made one of the biggest flicks in hip-hop history: Carter V reached platinum status in April 2018 after under two years of delays.\nThe relationship between Wayne and Cash Money has been remarkable for a lot of reasons. In a modern industry that is obsessed with the next big thing, Cash Money has stayed relevant and solidified their pre-eminent position in rap\u2019s history. Since 1993, the rap giant has championed and supported exclusive content from Jay Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Drake, T.I., Birdman, Cash Money\u2019s future artists Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj, Future, Drake and Future, as well as artists currently signed to major labels. Within this priority list, those releases are valued far more highly than the many hits won via legal ($16 million) and well-performing tour ($140 million gross) dealings.\nSome of the most racy lyrics in hip-hop are Wayne\u2019s (and Nicki Minaj\u2019s). Under his \u201cBlock Camp\u201d label, Wayne has worked with other female artists, with a different symbol similar to his sister Cristal Carter\u2019s: an equally sensual \u201cN\u201d across her chest. Wayne is best known as a weed-smoking, malaprop-prone two-time Grammy winner, known for tracks like \u201c6 Foot 7 Foot\u201d and \u201cSexual Eruption,\u201d but with his next LP, Tha Carter V, he\u2019s smartly included feature material from all three of his female collaborators.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Bernie Sanders, the self-declared Democratic presidential candidate and socialist from Vermont, has vastly outpaced Wall Street billionaires and other billionaires in gathering wealth since the start of the past decade, according to a new Bloomberg analysis.\nSanders\u2019 per-person wealth has more than doubled to $1.2 million since the first quarter of 2009. He is now wealthier than the average person in the income distribution who earned $451,200 last year, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\nThe poll numbers and financial disclosures released this month don\u2019t include major holdings like mutual funds or real estate, though they do list how much money Sanders has collected over the years through salary and speaking fees, as well as some political activism.\nThe most prominent figures among Sanders\u2019 declared presidential rivals are each richer, though not by as much as Sanders. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another liberal who criticizes the wealthy and seeks to increase taxes on the middle class, is now richer than Sanders \u2013 and Warren, as a lawyer, did not make enough money to be counted as rich at the start of the decade. Neither did Joe Biden, the last Obama-era vice-president and another liberal contender.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to run against Wall Street, the 1 per cent, the billionaires, the billionaires,\u201d said a Bloomberg reporter, who asked not to be named to avoid angering reporters or Sanders supporters. \u201cBut Bernie Sanders makes it real and doesn\u2019t pretend he doesn\u2019t have the deep pockets to run a major presidential campaign.\u201d\nSanders, who grew up poor in Brooklyn, New York, and earned a doctorate in sociology from the University of Chicago, has aggressively opposed the power of multinational corporations and wealthy individuals. They are the primary subjects of his presidential campaign platform and stump speeches.\nIn one of the key battles of the 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton, then the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, to endorse then-Independent candidate Jill Stein of Germany. Sanders, who is seeking the backing of the party, said Stein was \u201cthe only one who has the backbone and courage to stand up and take on the billionaire class.\u201d\nSanders doesn\u2019t join Warren, Biden and Sanders\u2019 other wealthy rivals as a public citizen, but he is a private citizen under Senate rules, meaning he cannot be sued.\nOn social media, his defenders defended him in the face of allegations about his wealth, including a suggestion by Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver in a 2014 financial disclosure report to the Senate that Sanders was worth up to $7 million at the time.\n\u201cBernie is trying to make the rich pay their fair share,\u201d tweeted Ethan Knight, a former Sanders staff member, posting about the financial disclosure.\nAnother former Sanders staffer, Zack Exley, said in a tweet that \u201cthere are dozens of policies and ideas on how to do just that.\u201d\nSanders is the first to contest the 2016 Democratic field for the nomination whose total wealth sits at over $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg analysis. But, individually, the billionaire Democratic candidates trail Sanders\u2019 wealth. Warren\u2019s self-reported wealth of $1.2 million was not adjusted for inflation, though the average American woman working full time in the United States, according to the Congressional Budget Office, received just over $32,000 last year.\nIn recent years, many people who pay income taxes have fallen into poverty as the median annual income for Americans has fallen below $60,000. The median U.S. household now gets just under $46,000 a year from wages and salaries, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nAvengers: Endgame's biggest threat, and also its most compelling aspect, is the arrival of Thanos. The Mad Titan will seek to achieve redemption after their devastating cliffhanger at the end of Infinity War, but he's far from the only threat the heroes will need to face in the sequel. Captain Marvel and her powers are just one (very strong) part of the equation in what promises to be an epic showdown between Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the Mad Titan, to whom many have vowed to atone for all of their previous failures.\nNow that the identity of Brie Larson's Carol Danvers is finally revealed to the world, we know she's got the skills to help the Avengers win... but could she also be more of a threat than Thanos, too? In a world with heroes, she obviously has the potential to become someone who can defy powerful beings on their own, but can she pass a two-year test to become one of Thanos' Infinity Stones?\nRelated: How Captain Marvel Must Stop Thanos In Avengers: Endgame\nObviously, this is pure speculation at this point, but it does offer up a few ideas about Carol Danvers' abilities in Avengers: Endgame. Here are 10 abilities Captain Marvel could use to defeat Thanos:\nAntarctica (Above Thanos)\nSet pictures from Avengers: Endgame have shown the Asgardian remnants clustered at one of the main airport terminals, but what we've never seen is the breathtaking view of Manhattan below them - and of the sky (and perhaps Earth itself) they're towering over. Thanos has not approached Earth since the snap, and the sight of a peaceful Earth is a mighty wake-up call to the heroes, but how does Captain Marvel come into play? On Earth, she's the only one with the ability to move mountains, and maybe - just maybe - she can travel to these unexplored locations.\nUPDATE: It turns out that Captain Marvel will get a taste of the polar regions when she goes into space in Avengers: Endgame.\nInfinity Stone - Something Strange\nThe dreaded, unused Infinity Stone that's been missing from Avengers: Infinity War was the Soul Stone. When the Infinity Stones are accessed using the snap button on their last Infinity Gem, they momentarily rid the universe of half of their souls, restoring their owners' erasure. The object in this case was named the Soul Stone and was used to kill off, with varying loyalties, the physically sensitive person - a person dying in a bloodbath.\nRelated: What The Soul Stone Really Is (& When It Might Appear Again)\nThat the Mind Stone, the Power Stone, and the Space Stone all lay exposed in the Earth's core suggested the Soul Stone is one of the nine Infinity Stones and is located in the Soul World. Even if these noble souls do not possess an actual possession, however, they remain soul energy, and their sacrifice signals the arrival of Thanos and his forces who hope to recuperate the Infinity Gauntlet.\nSuperhuman Strength\nNot only can Carol Danvers fly and have incredibly high speed, she can also carry and throw objects at super-high speeds (either vertically or horizontally, depending on the task) and can withstand massive pressures. She's not, however, the biggest Avenger, and while she can lift objects much greater than herself, it's questionable how strong she truly is in scale. If the final Infinity Stone were to be the Soul Stone, she would be able to defeat Thanos with what's known as the Verbal Barrier, which would also make it easy for the Avengers to defeat her while protecting those outside her barrier.\nRehearsal... In Space\nCarol Danvers is an Air Force pilot, and her unceremonious execution in the first Captain Marvel movie (because of an oversight while investigating a rogue Skrull ship) is a mystery. The real-life Captain Marvel is Carol Air Force Mason, with the hero keeping to her 9-to-5 job with the Air Force until she went into hiding. Maybe her mission is to study the Avengers, and somehow ever retraces those fateful flights she undertook to retrieve the Skrull ship? Perhaps she's taught the Avengers there are any number of ways to evade Thanos, maybe she needs to analyze them again herself, or maybe she's just flying around a space station passing notes back and forth while checking back in on humanity's important balance of life. Again, all speculation, but this entire concept is certainly intriguing.\n1 2\nWhat To Expect From The Disney Streaming Service\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By Henry Umoru\nABUJA \u2013 AHEAD of the planned election of the Leader of the 9th House of Representatives by the faction that led by Senator Ahmed Makarfi to replace Ahmed Lawan, Sunday, the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sunday, said that it was ready to allow Nigerians decide who should be their House leader.\nThe party said it was ready to hold talks with the \u201cDelegates representing parties in both the APC and opposition\u201d on both seats and positions on what was in the best interest of the Nigeria\u2019s democracy and the party.\nThis statement came as Saraki and other leadership of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP yesterday cancelled their planned trip to Kwara State to inaugurate the renovated State Secretariat Complex in Ilorin, where 2.4 billion Naira Naira project is to be started by President Muhammadu Buhari today.\nAddressing journalists in Abuja Sunday, the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi said the remarks by Speaker Yakubu Dogara and other members of the House as well as the unanimous decision of the PDP on Lawan\u2019s Acting Speakership amounted to a new threat to the people\u2019s mandate as well as the sanctity of Nigerian democracy and the polity.\nAccording to him, \u201cthe rule of law in the country abhors impunity, whoever made these claims did not take into consideration the fact that the National Assembly had also zoned the Speaker\u2019s seat to the North East zone and as such referred the matter to a conference committee that is yet to produce a report.\n\u201cThat declaration was made by the entire North Eastern caucus of the House that is currently led by a Senator, Ningi Yusuf and also was supported by the ruling party members in the Zone. It is clear that the House North East caucus cannot and should not question the zoning arrangement of the House.\n\u201cSimilarly, the APC did not acquire power in 2015 from anybody. The Peoples Democratic Party lost power in 2015 due to a combination of factors, which included the sheer incompetence of the PDP government.\n\u201cIt is a well-known fact that for the first time since 1999, for more than 20 years in a row, the opposition parties worked together in a bid to stop the PDP but each time they held a meeting, the PDP used that opportunity to sabotage their efforts thereby lost the grounds as a result of ignorance, incompetence, inability to read and speak the language of democracy and rudeness.\n\u201cIf the ruling party is in the Senate, why cannot it conduct a senate leadership primary and by so doing, announce who should be the Senate president based on which political party they belong?\n\u201cAs far as APC is concerned, it is free for members of both the APC and the opposition to consult with one another and to conduct talks on what is in the best interest of the country and also guarantee the sanctity of this democratic system.\u201d\nAlso reacting to Dogara comments, President Muhammadu Buhari made a clarion call on security agencies to decisively deal with anyone threatening the peace in the country.\nHe also issued a new warning that anyone threatening the unity and peaceful coexistence of the country will be dealt with according to the dictates of the law.\nAccording to the President, \u201cIt is dangerous and should be avoided in a very serious way because we are all brothers and sisters. We are all Nigerians and one of our major points is the unity of Nigeria and no amount of any agitation would ever be acceptable to anybody.\u201d\nOn his part, Saraki in a statement yesterday, said that he has no plan to inaugurate the State secretariat in Ilorin today.\nSaraki who was reported to have spoken in Lagos yesterday said: \u201cThere is nothing like that. You know I believe that Nigerians have learnt the wrong lesson from the 8th House of Representatives. There is no truth in it and not true at all,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Saraki informed media stakeholders in Lagos that he would not be coming to Kwara State today as planned, adding that he cancelled his trip to Ilorin to avoid a breach of public peace in the state.\n\u201cI did not come to inaugurate the State secretariat because public order in Ilorin is not very good right now. We do not want there to be any breach of the peace,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 A giant SpaceX rocket roared into the morning sky Saturday, hoisting an experimental satellite for China and successfully landing all three of its boosters at sea.\nThis was the first time that SpaceX launched an upgraded Falcon 9 carrying three boosters, instead of two, in one liftoff. Unlike other rocket companies, SpaceX takes its rockets back to shore for reuse.\nThe rocket blasted off shortly after 8 a.m. from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station with an experimental satellite built by an upstart Chinese commercial space company. SpaceX founder Elon Musk noted earlier in the week that an actual launch for the project \u2014 called Fengyun 1-A \u2014 had not been possible in seven years due to schedule delays and budget concerns.\nIt was SpaceX's eighth Falcon launch this year.\nAs thousands watched from Florida's space coast, three hefty first-stage boosters \u2014 all previously flown \u2014 separated at the same time, then resumed their races for home. Two landed on droneships stationed in the Atlantic, one at sea and the other at the company's floating landing pad in the Atlantic. The third booster, an upper-stage vehicle, performed a self-landing at Cape Canaveral.\nThe landing went well, but a ship later Sunday will attempt a more maneuverable touchdown.\nThe workhorse first-stage booster did its job perfectly.\nThese three boosters accounted for the whole 122-story, three-story booster of the all-new Falcon 9, which is now slightly wider, a few pounds lighter and with more powerful engines. SpaceX replaced the helium tanks with new ones. SpaceX's goal is to reduce the cost of space to $1 million per launch by 2018, and is banking on three-segment boosters that can achieve it.\nSpaceX commentator Hans Koenigsmann called the launch \"an incredibly exciting event\" after each of the three first-stage boosters landed. Koenigsmann said the third, encased in an orange, liquid-oxygen tank, performed the self-landing fine. \"Very strong data point for the booster system,\" he said.\nFlight controllers applauded and pumped their fists as the third booster touched down at SpaceX's landing pad. Dragon, the spaceship en route to space, will need a longer orbit to cross Earth, if the first stage is to be reused.\nThe United States, Russia and Europe are the only players in the space race with China, which sent man into space aboard its own rocket in 2003. In 2007, China made its most-successful landing on a spacecraft, along with two on droneships.\nSaturday's flight, containing Fengyun 1-A for China's startup Xianflir Space Technology, weighed in at 18 tons. Forty satellites are aboard.\nThe Chinese satellite is designed to document the air during atmospheric re-entry and collect environmental information. Fengyun 1-A also will function as a communication satellite for Xianflir.\nA mile or so from the launch pad, SpaceX had even more fireworks: hundreds of newspaper editorial board-style foam balls falling from the sky after the launch. SpaceX provides its rocket services to commercial, government and other customers, so the little bloopers had nothing to do with launches.\nThe 77-foot Falcon rocket first roared from the hangar a day after a failed attempt to land a used first-stage booster on an aircraft. For rocketing Fengyun 1-A, SpaceX chose a third-generation variant of the Falcon 9.\nMusk told The Associated Press earlier this week that the first boosters for a future flight that could come as early as May 2 will have only one engine each and will not be able to be reused. It remains unclear whether all three will be reused; the company has to redesign the booster first.\n", "label": "machine"}

On Tuesday, Guinness announced it is accelerating its transition to sustainably sourced, biodegradable plastic cups, straws and lids.\n\u201cAs the nation\u2019s leading beer brand, we would never turn our back on enjoying Guinness with friends and family, but we share consumers\u2019 concern about the amount of plastic that ends up in our oceans and waterways,\u201d the brewing giant said in a statement.\nGuinness said it plans to transition its lids and straws to more durable, biodegradable materials by the end of 2020. As it did with its bottles, it plans to continue using glass in pubs and bars.\nThe company also noted that it has made progress reducing packaging waste through the use of compostable material in its packaging and improved efficiencies of its use of packaging materials.\nIn March, Malibu rum maker Bacardi announced it planned to phase out plastic straws and plastic bags. It also plans to sell all its products in recycled and recyclable materials by 2025. The move came in response to a report conducted by WWF International. The report found that \u201cover 90% of plastic pollution\u201d entered the sea through consumer waste produced in developed countries.\nAnd last year, French beverage maker PepsiCo announced it would stop selling water in plastic bottles in India by 2020. It also committed to reduce the amount of plastic in its beverages.\nBy 2021, the company plans to use \u201cjust as much as possible by planting trees, repairing waterways and using plants and other natural products.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Throughout the 44-year history of CinemaCon, the annual film exhibition convention that runs this week in Las Vegas, a tangible impact from that successful business mission has been diversity.\nFor years, the annual trade show has been dominated by cineastes of the Academy class of 1990, women who\u2019ve risen through the ranks of the exhibition biz and held seats on industry boards. For the first time, this year\u2019s convention will have a designated women\u2019s or diversity section, spurred by the addition of committees this year.\nHaving the lines between their professional lives and social lives blend is what drives Maggie Henneberry to take on the \u201cWomen in Entertainment\u201d task force at this year\u2019s convention.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the executives that are running the show here in the industry,\u201d Henneberry says. \u201cWhen we start meeting these amazing women, we realize we are all so connected and we feel each other\u2019s pain. The only difference is, we\u2019re in different careers.\n\u201cThere are filmmakers that only see what\u2019s on the screen and forget that the women who are writing, directing and producing those films \u2014 they also have families to look after,\u201d Henneberry continues. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to juggle their careers as well. They may be in an accelerated career. They may have to miss work to go see their daughter\u2019s soccer game. For us who are running things, it\u2019s much harder to balance.\u201d\nRelated CinemaCon: Closing Ceremony to Feature Gloria Estefan, Gal Gadot, Yoko Ono (EXCLUSIVE) CinemaCon: Theater Owners Seek Appetite, Ad Attractiveness for Blockbusters\nHenneberry\u2019s committee has meetings each morning before the confab opens Tuesday. The group will host training sessions around its structure, in a focus on elevating the executive level in the exhibitors\u2019 ranks and getting female executives in front of the press. The hope is that these sessions help people talk about their businesses, rather than talking about an individual.\n\u201cIf you have a dinner party, you might invite other women to your dinner party, but you don\u2019t invite them because they\u2019re women,\u201d Henneberry says. \u201cWhen you invite women to your industry gathering, it shouldn\u2019t be for business reasons, but because you just need other women in the room. And most people really feel that sense.\u201d\nLike Henneberry, Anita Engman, who attends CinemaCon every year, is planning a large coalition of people. In the past she has organized a panel for women in all of the major international territories and one for Israel. She is partnering with the LGBT in Cinema group. The aim of these panels is to get media \u2014 particularly female media outlets \u2014 to look at the company that is bringing talent to the show.\n\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing is to get people like journalists and editors to look to the diversity groups that they cover,\u201d Engman says. \u201cGet that good picture before the documentary [gala] screening. That way when people are writing about the documentaries, they\u2019re seeing people from all walks of life.\u201d\nThis is the first year that so many committees have been formed; a slate of that figurehead organizations is set to be announced Tuesday.\nIn an effort to raise consciousness, the preeminent repertory cinema program IFC Midnight is showing shorts about screen diversity Tuesday at midnight and inspiring attendees to talk about their own work during their break.\nCinemaCon runs through Thursday.\n", "label": "machine"}

It's part of a bigger gamble: More people weighing in on early endorsements signals the importance of each state\u2019s caucus or primary.\nBut it\u2019s not enough for candidates to convince their national donors and operatives; a strong presence in the early primary states is increasingly crucial.\nStory Continued Below\nFirst for Democrats: Iowa. Two of the top four with the best prospects to emerge from the first tests in the Hawkeye State have won both prior presidential elections, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls of likely Iowa Democratic caucus goers: Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is near the middle, with Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey close behind.\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t included, though the early returns suggest he could make a late play for the first in the nation contest.\nBut as the pack jockeys for position, many are trying to earn political goodwill in their home states, even if it means taking on some of the Democratic Party's most established institutions and organizations.\nWarren has already forged relationships with most of the state's liberal leaders, but her predecessor as Massachusetts' governor, Deval Patrick, endorsed her in 2017. But since 2016, when former Gov. Deval Patrick endorsed him, the pair has had a troubled relationship. She filed a lawsuit against him shortly after taking office after he handed her a strict ethics check that was intended to make sure she complied with the law. He filed a lawsuit against her last year for leaking a boardroom conversation from 2005 that he called sexist.\nSince then, she has built relationships with Massachusetts Democrats and her allies are proud of her record as Sen. Elizabeth Warren's chief Senate vote counter. It seems unlikely she will join Patrick\u2019s camp in 2020, but they remain close friends \u2014 Patrick gave her a breakfast fundraiser in Boston on Tuesday.\nBiden has many allies in his home state, including former Gov.

For the past five years, I have been looking to grow our business, and the St James National Park was the first step,\u201d he said.\nThe plan, which is not yet public, includes the provision of tourism facilities and housing for tots and seniors, and reintroducing the province to youngsters as \u201cTrelawny Park,\u201d which Clarke describes as \u201cThe place where one young person can belong and play forever.\u201d\nClarke, who attributes that aspirational statement to the daughter of a colleague who graduated from high school in the area, also expressed excitement about bringing the feature film business to the area. While not confirming its size, Alten, which currently runs the Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Ocho Rios, is currently rebranding the facility as Ocho Rios Alten International Airport.\n\u201cWe are working out how our properties can be combined into a very large tourism destination,\u201d said Clarke, underscoring that the first phase of development for Cheddi Jagan will see five new hotels in the coming period, two in the Ocho Rios district and two in Tin-Lip, Savanna-la-Mar, and Portland.\nThe projects include the total investment of US$100 million, while Clarke identified another US$500 million in non-construction-related investments in the making. The major hotel projects include The Signature, the fourth boutique hotel in its portfolio, according to Clarke.\n\u201cConstruction on all properties is expected to begin within the next 12 months,\u201d he told Sunday Business, noting that he estimates that these projects will contribute up to 15,000 jobs to the region.\nRosalee Poole, chairman of the Tourism Product Development Company Limited (TPDCo), which has final say on all new development for the parish, confirmed to Sunday Business the development of both hotels.\nTPDCo is also developing a first-of-its-kind marine tourism cruise terminal to be located at the former Savanna-la-Mar Railway Station. TPDCo provided US$1.4 million to the Savanna-la-Mar Town Council for the project.\nAccording to Poole, TPDCo is currently setting the stage for construction at Cheddi Jagan International Airport.\n\u201cIn the coming months, we will be announcing new package-tour, private jet, cruise, private investment and special event operators in and around Trelawny,\u201d she said.\nOn the tourism front, Trelawny is indeed ready to become Jamaica\u2019s next big tourist destination, especially given that a number of international hotel operators have declared it their preferred destination in Jamaica.\nThe Victoria Falls Resort & Spa recently issued a wish list of prime targets for investment in the country, including Cheddi Jagan, Ocho Rios, Falmouth, Deeres Park and Dark Mocha.\nAlten is one of the companies included in that list. As such, it is poised to bring the type of tourism infrastructure that the operators envision in the parish, with or without major assistance from TPDCo or the Government.\n\u201cI think it is inevitable that Trelawny will become the next big resort area in Jamaica,\u201d said Clarke.\n\u201cWith all the incentives that exist for tourism companies in Trelawny, it will help attract more tourist arrivals from overseas, as these companies can easily double their business in a four-to-five year period. Tourism is a great business in Trelawny, if you develop the right facility.\u201d\nLast week, TPDCo launched the Trelawny Villages Development Project, designed to improve employment and productivity in rural areas by providing housing, improve road and basic infrastructure and expand business activities.\nThe project will include the construction of small- and medium-sized mobile projects called rural centres, which will act as \u201cmini micro-neighbourhoods\u201d.\navia.collinder@gleanerjm.com\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The lack of a finals berth in the 2019 Hyundai A-League has been placed squarely on the shoulders of coach Ernie Merrick. The Jets failed to reach post-season play, despite six wins in 13 rounds on their way to second on the ladder. They were out of finals contention after a 3-0 loss to ladder leaders Western Sydney Wanderers and a 2-0 loss to Adelaide in their final round double-header at McDonald Jones Stadium on Sunday. Merrick said the Wanderers and Adelaide were the two best teams on a run to the competition's top two. \"I know those two sides were away on Sunday, but it's not just the result of a game, it's the whole picture,\" he said. \"We were good at home, we've had some draws. We were good on the road, very few defeats. It's an unfortunate result. \"It's not something I'll dwell on. I'll go forward, improve, turn the corner and be in a good position next year. We've put ourselves in a good position to do that and now we just have to keep improving and getting stronger.\" The Jets won both games against the Wanderers this season and both against Adelaide. A win or draw in either of those games, at home against the Wanderers and away against the Reds, would have assured the Jets of a finals place. Merrick said the Wanderers and Reds teams both gave the Jets every chance. \"They all do,\" he said. \"Everyone puts you there, right or wrong. They give you chances and you make mistakes at times. \"You can argue that the last two we've made, that we didn't. They got on top of us, and when they did, they got in our faces and made life tough. \"But we missed some chances early and then the game boiled down to a home ground game where a real home ground advantage counts for something for them and a road game where it doesn't. \"They [Adelaide] were the better side in both games, so we had to play the best.\" World Cup-winner Tim Cahill was in the Jets starting line-up, but Merrick flagged the return of his record signing Andrew Nabbout next week. \"We will see who makes the squad,\" he said. \"Who makes the squad for Adelaide will be important because we can't beat Adelaide without Nabbout. \"At the same time, people make mistakes in football, but everyone was at fault for the 4-0 [Thursdays' loss to Melbourne City] and one of the players' errors cost us. It was the way he dealt with it and the way he thought about it, which was not good enough, that's why he was taken off. \"We've got a tough game at the weekend against South Melbourne who are fighting to stay up.

A delay would need to be approved by European leaders, who meet in Brussels on Friday.\nMay said Parliament has an obligation to ensure that Britain's \"jobs, businesses and supplies of food and medicines are not put at risk.\"\nTheresa May and her ministers insisted there is \"no alternative\" to the Brexit deal she negotiated with the EU, even as lawmakers in her own party argued for a second referendum and a government minister suggested the Prime Minister should go back to Brussels to renegotiate parts of the deal.\nIf the British parliament approves her deal, May says she would seek \"legally binding changes\" to prevent a \"no-deal\" Brexit that businesses and citizens fear would bring havoc to border crossings and ports.\nBut in her statement to lawmakers in the House of Commons, May insisted that her deal was the only way of avoiding no deal.\n\"No deal is not an option,\" she said.\nWith less than two months until Britain is due to leave the EU, there is little consensus in Parliament on what Brexit should look like or how to get there.\nMeanwhile, there is mounting concern about how the U.K. will meet its financial obligations to the EU after March 29, when it will be no longer a member.\nTreasury chief Philip Hammond said he understood that some lawmakers could question the government's credibility if it didn't meet the expected deadline to put a new exit agreement in place.\n\"It is totally unrealistic that we can say to the EU that we are leaving on 29 March without a deal,\" he said.\nEU leaders agree that there is no Plan B if Britain does not agree to a withdrawal agreement in time, but they are reluctant to renegotiate the deal.\nMay promised lawmakers would be given a chance to vote on delaying Brexit, saying that if the result was to support her deal, the government would take it to Parliament before the government's March 14 deadline.\nBut May's promise to hold a second referendum suffered a blow when one of her allies suggested that May should seek a two-year delay to prevent a \"chaotic\" Brexit.\nThe comment by Environment Secretary Michael Gove was immediately interpreted as an attempt to reopen the question of membership, which was explicitly ruled out during last year's referendum campaign.\nSome say a second referendum could split the country, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on the government to oppose any attempt to reopen the referendum.\n\"Extending article 50 is a clear piece of blackmail,\" he said.\nIn Parliament, May's government was on the defensive even before a motion to block a no-deal Brexit won Parliament's backing.\nGovernment ministers - many of whom oppose a no-deal Brexit - were summoned to the House of Commons to explain why they kept altering the wording of Brexit legislation before submitting it to Parliament for approval.\nLast week, ministers published legislation to avoid disruption on Britain's largely external borders. The government then revised the legislation to take account of a report from May's trade minister, Liam Fox, that EU rules regulating food standards and cosmetics would not be compatible with Britain's new trading system.\nLabour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said the amendments - intended to answer concerns about possible delays to British goods getting to market after Brexit - showed that \"not a single Labour MP has been consulted about these changes\" to the law.\nMay said the government had adhered to parliamentary procedure in putting forward the amendments.\nBritain voted by 52 percent to 48 percent in 2016 to leave the EU, but a number of lawmakers - many from May's Conservatives - argue that the country would be better off voting to remain in the bloc. A majority of lawmakers also favor a second referendum on Brexit.\nHowever, leading pro-Brexit lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg told British lawmakers there was little chance the EU would reopen the withdrawal agreement.\nEU president Donald Tusk reiterated Monday that the March 29 deadline was the European Council's only option.\n\"There can be no second referendum or attempts to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement,\" he said on Twitter.\n", "label": "machine"}

The decision was made following another breach following revelations highly skilled players could be playing in a women's premier league last season.

{"text": "EUGENE -- CJ Verdell is past halfway through the spring football practices.\nHe's the leading rusher in receptions, receiving yards and is tied for second in receptions.

{"text": "The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has been teasing a third season for a couple of months now \u2013 we've even met a couple of season three characters already, including that demonic hellcat Mary Wardell (Michelle Gomez).\nSo what can we expect from the show's future, and what's on the horizon for Sabrina Spellman? Here are seven huge questions that we have to worry about when the witchcraft drama returns in November 2019.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n1. Where's Briarcliff now?\nSabrina's escape from Satan on the back of a goat \u2013 albeit an axe - means that fans are quickly shifting their attention to the question of what Sabrina has done to the original Briarcliff prison that housed her after the events of her second season finale.\nAt the end of the last instalment, a giant split screen shot flashed up at the top of the final screen, showing multiple versions of Briarcliff, including a church with a child guarding the door. Where exactly did Sabrina and the other inmates manage to flee to after being imprisoned for so long?\nTrouble is, the Briarcliff archives have been moved to a new location, so watching a re-air of the last few episodes will prove tricky unless they're stored somewhere. There's been no official word on where Sabrina's supposed to be, so start having your mental fantasies about the reception given by Satan to this new site (try seeing it as a place that would stop Sabrina straight away and not as a place inhabited by demonic-worshipping sinners).\n2. What happened to the nastiest person ever?\nBBC\nSabrina's estranged mortal witch Aunt Hilda (Andrea Savage) raised Sabrina from a little girl to an incredibly evil young lady. Despite such an extreme transformation, the character has remained mum on exactly what her past is like, as she's always wanted Sabrina to be happy, not talk about any of it.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nHowever, with the characters in Atlantica and a more mature teenage girl now guiding Sabrina as she moves into adulthood, it's become harder for Hilda to sit back and enjoy her relative youth.\nWill Hilda ever reveal more about her background? Will Sabrina ever ask her the offending nastiness lurking within the evilness which she's gradually managed to crush? And can Hilda be persuaded to spill some secrets so that Sabrina can better enjoy her life?\n3. What will new characters bring to the show?\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina has only just started to introduce new enemies and allies for Sabrina to encounter, so where will season three go?\nWith the season two finale ending with some massive shake-ups, all bets are off when it comes to Sabrina facing off against new enemies. Is the toaster already perfect, or are there more to go? Let's hope they've thought things through thoroughly before leaving us in limbo for the next several months.\n4. Can Zelda handle her granddaughter now?\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said earlier this year that he had no intentions of bringing back the Aunt Zelda character from the show's teenage version, Cousin Hilda, and in the final moments of the finale, Sabrina's grandmother struck up a truce with her evil granddaughter once again.\nBut with the transition into adulthood and the new political climate, it's now time for Sabrina to become more active in her generation and to embrace what that means for her fated future. How will Zelda deal with this new attitude? She's had a tough few weeks as a result of deciding to forgive but never forget her daughter's murderer, which has doubtless left Sabrina confused and unconfident in her new grandmother.\nNow Zelda needs to support Sabrina and embrace who she is. Without strong support from her side, Sabrina will be inclined to stick to the traditional ways (which include fiercely defending the rights of her Satanic sibling Harvey and encouraging her friends and foes to stop being evil folk and become full-fledged Salem-style witches).\nBut what will this mean for the character of Zelda? Will Hilda ever even want her alive anymore? Fans have the feeling things are about to get seriously complicated.\n5. Will something go wrong?\nNetflix\nThere's been no shortage of odd things that have happened throughout Sabrina's story so far, so with two months to go till series three, fans have a lot of detail to glean about what could possibly go wrong next.\nWill the Bex set in America be hurt when Sabrina leaves for her new life in Yemen? Can Sabrina truly move on and grow up without Aunt Hilda by her side? What about", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Florida Virtual School, the state's largest school serving mostly low-income and non-English-speaking students, is dealing with leadership turmoil in the wake of months of investigations, firings and surprise resignations.\nIt was unclear why at least seven school staffers, including four officials in management or early retirement, resigned or were fired since last month.\nEducation Commissioner Pam Stewart, who took office in August, also took action recently, ordering officials to provide reasons for the changes.\nThe school is Florida's largest for low-income students, serving about 90,000 children or about 62 percent of students at online charter schools. School officials said the change of leadership would not disrupt students.\nState Rep. Rob Quist, a coastal Republican who pushed for the online school to begin in 2013, as Florida lawmakers backed the idea of offering high-quality online learning options to parents at no cost, is troubled by the departures.\nQuist, the dean of Florida's House education committee, said he heard state officials are asking for the resignations of FVS CEO Christopher Condon, executive director of curriculum and assessment Melissa Rowley and operations chief Kathy Schromen-Popoff.\nQuist, who has visited the school, called it \"unacceptable\" that others might be fired, particularly with the school facing a leadership crisis.\n\"There needs to be change there \u2014 or there will be serious fallout,\" Quist said. \"It's just awful.\"\nThe school's charter is scheduled to expire in August, and Stewart's decisions will have a bearing on whether the online school moves forward.

{"text": "Syracuse, N.Y. -- Syracuse announced Thursday that it has signed Class of 2019 small forward Brycen Goodine.\nThe 6-foot-5, 175-pound Goodine starred at Georgia's Booker T. Washington High School and is considered by some recruiting services to be one of the top 100 prospects in the country.\nHowever, both Duke and Michigan State have expressed interest in him and, as of a week ago, were battling with Syracuse for his services.\nHead coach Jim Boeheim provided a deep overview of his need for size and ball-handling skills when speaking to the media on Friday.\n\"We're always looking to get bigger and maybe a little more athletic,\" Boeheim said. \"We need more guards. With the way our teams have been going, with athleticism and quickness, we need a guard who can guard three positions, who can handle the ball, who can get to the basket and shoot the 3.\n\"We really aren't a very big team this year. We're a little bit faster, a little bit bigger but not a lot bigger. We need to add size and quickness to play some basketball.\"\nGoodine was weighing several options when deciding where to sign, including Duke, Michigan State, Ohio State, Kansas and Villanova. He also considered interest from Memphis and Arizona.\nA native of Jekyll Island, Ga., Goodine began attending a neighborhood public school to improve his academics. By the time he was in middle school, he already possessed an impressive skill set, including the ability to dominate smaller players.\nHowever, even though he was dominant at the high school level, Goodine\u2019s college choices probably came down to \u201ccould he fit?\u201d and \u201cwant to be there?\u201d\nBoth the former concern them as they consider newcomers, as they evaluate the man-child\u2019s skill set and decide if he can add to their roster. The latter is especially important because both the Class of 2019 and the current players returning to Syracuse from this year\u2019s team likely have one more recruiting class ahead of them before considering the 2013-14 roster.\nGoodine was asked if he faced similar questions, suggesting that, while he also had similar debating skills, he was less tentative about his decision.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been around as many college stars, but I think I\u2019ve already been tested,\u201d Goodine said. \u201cThe recruiting process and what it does for you, everybody doesn\u2019t get to experience it. I think I handled it well and what I\u2019ve done and who I know. I think they\u2019re a good fit for me.\u201d\nGoodine\u2019s choice made obvious what Orange fans knew for a while: Syracuse needed to invest a few more scholarships in the Class of 2019 to boost its roster. Though added depth is not required for next season, the present roster will have a vacancy vacated by graduate transfer Marcellus Bazan.\nAttracted by the potential of freshmen point guard Traevon Jackson and wing Frank Howard, Boeheim refused to commit to a freshman coming off the bench, even though he had said the two would be the starters.\nNow, with three scholarships available for the coming class, the coaching staff can settle on two newcomers. For some, it's likely that one of them will be good enough to pair up with Howard and Jackson on the perimeter.\nThat pair could then be joined by two taller guard positions and Goodine, at least on paper, could be filling the mid-range gap with Isaiah Whitehead and Chinanu Onuaku currently on the team.\n\u201cWith recruiters coming and going, the experience of recruiting can bring you down, and the decision-making ability to see if a kid is that good or not, which can be the toughest thing,\u201d Boeheim said. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to be careful who you\u2019re dealing with and then you\u2019ve got to be on top of your game as a recruiting coach as well to see that kid.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The NFL offseason is entering its next phase, and the Baltimore Ravens are finally shedding their Super Bowl champions\u2019 hoof prints from the sideline and beginning the process of easing back into their season without playing another game.\nLike the Pittsburgh Steelers before them, the Ravens are putting their players in workouts before they schedule their third mandatory minicamp of the offseason. While the week will resemble the regular offseason portion of practices last week, the next phase won\u2019t feature the intensity of team-run practices.\nIn fact, it will just consist of roughly two days of weightlifting and supervised player movement.\nHere are three things the Ravens can accomplish in Phase 1 of the offseason workout program:\nGetting snaps and gaining familiarity\nThe Ravens see themselves as a functional or \u201ctunnel\u201d team, meaning they win with effort and discipline instead of sheer talent. They largely executed the game plan and limited turnovers without stars like cornerback Jimmy Smith and linebacker C.J. Mosley, whom they suspended and traded, respectively, for four games and 10 games at the start of last season.\nAs the team enters the offseason, they\u2019ll take a different approach.\nThe Ravens won\u2019t allow players to ease back into the offseason due to the early schedules of their injured stars. That\u2019ll prevent them from acclimating themselves to their new teammates and the system before training camp starts, and it allows them to spend the rest of this year getting up to speed on schemes and working on individual techniques and skills.\nJared Foster can face more snaps from the get-go\nThe Ravens\u2019 biggest free-agent signing was veteran defensive end Jared Foster, who arrived in Baltimore from the Miami Dolphins on a one-year deal to add an experienced veteran pass rusher.\nAs for Foster\u2019s transition to the Ravens, he said Monday in his first news conference as a Raven that he\u2019s gotten a bit of head start thanks to offseason workouts and Ravens quarterbacks Joe Flacco and Lamar Jackson.\nFoster has the athleticism the Ravens lack to find space in the game if a small hole opens up on the other side of the line. The front office and coaches saw that in a big way when Foster helped the Dolphins pressure the opposing quarterback in each of his four seasons in Miami. Now, they\u2019ll see him do that in Baltimore.\n\u201cI'm just itching to get out there and compete because I know I have the talents to be an impact player,\u201d Foster said. \u201cTo come in and ... come in a kind of new system, to have to fight for my space and for my reps, for every play, every rep is kind of weird. They're getting used to me and now I'm getting used to them.\u201d\nFive Ravens to watch at OTAs, minicamp\nBuying into the idea of a three-down, full-speed defense\nThe front office and coaches want to keep boosting a defense that was weak at times last season. New defensive coordinator Don Martindale said in his introductory press conference last week that Baltimore's defense couldn\u2019t thrive if players didn\u2019t have a sense of urgency about getting to the football.\nThat\u2019s a little simplistic, but the effort to get more carries and sacks for linebackers C.J. Mosley and Terrell Suggs will bear fruit in the months ahead. Filling that rotation with versatile pass rushers should keep the Birds out of trouble during games while quarterback Joe Flacco and rookie QB Lamar Jackson get acclimated.\nHere\u2019s how Marlon Humphrey improved, then learned to slow down\nAnd look for Foster and cornerback Brandon Carr to get time at safety, too.\nCurrent starters like Anthony Levine Sr. and Eric Weddle take care of the duties of playing a strong safety in Baltimore\u2019s zone-blitz system, but it\u2019s fair to ask whether the defense could swing more to a bigger role for the former Cowboys All-Pro. Carr has been a reliable slot corner throughout his career, but the cornerbacks play a lot of snaps and have high snaps-per-game averages in recent years.\nSo, is adding Foster to that mix and mentoring him at the safety spot a smart move?\nThe beginning of Phase 1 offers Baltimore a glimpse of what it wants the 2019 roster to look like, and as the process of slowly reprogramming a defense unfolds, the Ravens will have a bigger picture to look toward.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The background: For years, the iPhone maker has been locked in battle with Qualcomm, the leading independent supplier of the necessary wireless chips needed for newer generations of devices and newer networks, with both sides using antitrust lawsuits, litigation and massive lobbying efforts against each other to force the other to cut prices.\nThough their software and networking hardware partnerships overlap, Qualcomm is the only major supplier of the \"baseband\" chips required for connectivity in all connected devices, including phones, tablets, notebooks, laptops, cars, and wearable devices.\nApple relies on Qualcomm's chips, but it pays roughly the same price as other companies for the cost of using them, Reuters explains.\nIt's argued that Qualcomm reaps too much profit from the deal. That threat essentially forced Qualcomm to sell Apple a deal:\nGive up on trying to beat Apple at its own game and agree to a license for Apple\u2019s use of Qualcomm\u2019s LTE chips for all iPhone models that come out, regardless of market share, from now on.\nstrike a deal covering all future iPhones, from now on, under which Apple doesn\u2019t pay royalties for baseband processors Qualcomm sells, to the tune of billions of dollars, even though it's the biggest buyer of such processors worldwide.\nwireless chips for all iPhone models that come out, regardless of market share, from now on. In return, Apple promises not to go after Qualcomm in any future lawsuits for patent infringement, but only for misdeeds Apple believes occurred before 2018.\n\"The agreements provide Apple with multiple stays that will make it difficult, if not impossible, for Qualcomm to challenge Apple in court,\" The Wall Street Journal reports.\nUnder the deal, Apple also agrees to publish a \"report card\" giving competitors a chance to sell the best Qualcomm\u2019s chips on performance and reliability. As it's gotten stronger in the wireless business, Qualcomm has focused more on patent enforcement than on selling.\nQualcomm can extract any royalty fee for its patents it chooses.\nIt can still make money from the intellectual property Apple created using Qualcomm's chips and from the royalties it levies.\nUnder the deal, it will also agree to remove its software, such as an app download system and the Audience microphone chip, from new devices so as not to hurt sales of Apple's hardware.\nIn exchange, Apple has agreed to license its patents to Qualcomm for the next 20 years at what are believed to be fair and reasonable rates.\nThe deals are very favorable to Qualcomm:\nThe price cut will save Apple billions of dollars over time.\nApple's patent payments will continue to flow just as they always have.\nApple would be more satisfied with a smaller reduction in royalties, as antitrust regulators and researchers have been arguing.\nQualcomm will be able to grow its business without putting the chips behind its crown jewel, the Snapdragon line of mobile devices.\nWhat's next: A version of the deal has been agreed to with three Chinese wireless carriers, according to the Wall Street Journal, helping to temper antitrust objections to the deals.\nAnother part of the deal is a pledge to resolve litigation pending against Qualcomm from carriers and others in countries where the company has faced antitrust problems or lowered costs for competitors.\nQualcomm reportedly wants to appear for a hearing with U.S. regulators next week, to close the deal with Apple.\nHow it impacts you: Apple isn't the only company that wants access to Qualcomm's chips.

Borten\n'Hellboy' is in essence an 'edgy' action-adventure film similar to '300' or the 'Transformers' franchise; indeed those are clear indications of the material and there is going to be of kind of a testosterone-driven mythology infused story. Starring David Harbour (Iron Fist), Milla Jovovich (The Resident Evil franchise) and Ian McShane (Deadwood), the digital/video-extension of \"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\" definitely draws inspiration from any given Tim Burton, Guillermo del Toro-produced films. What you'd be expecting from this genre film is ab-solutely not there. Hellboy is bombastic and it will amaze you the exact same set of issues. The problem is that a giant 'prehistoric monster' story is inane and peculiar when you think of lesser ideas like substance abuse, dinosaurs, angst, grit, angst, redemption and all.\nThese are the types of films that are far more pointed and true than what Hellboy turns out to be. And horror films don't really engender mystical themes to make it \"Fantastic\" or \"Evil\" or even \"Postive\" in the experience. This movie features the same fluff and empty conversation taking place over and over again, devoid of any progression of story - just append holes and stops to check out insane hookers or a pile-on energy drinks. You couldn't screw anything up in 'Hellboy' not bothering about cuts and I honestly wonder if the edits that were made were suited to what the movie needs.\nThe film opens with Hellboy (Harbour) as a 15-year-old boy, using his legal eyes to discover a top-secret government agency, run by the nefarious Burgert (Dougray Scott). The plot of the film takes the 'Ficke-Kindler'-style of use to every previous film-contemporary. Now they need to find something. Why are they here? What is it? Hellboy doesn't know. Hellboy and Liz (Movie Nielsen) spend a nice, predictable dinner out at an Italian restaurant, after which we get busy with familiar issues of people who reek of absolution and the idea of eternal life or see ghosts. Hellboy is a man who and he is truly and truly a Hellboy. He is a troubled soul; driven by feelings of guilt, loyalty, loss and a desire to become more pure in his heart. Hellboy is also keenly aware of there is something about him, that is \"other\" and he wants to regain the aliveness and lightness in his life. The adventure begins in Hell when Hellboy discovers the secret to a village inhabited by women and they use these unnamed women to trap a horde of bad guys from a secret underground research base.\nI don't want to judge anything about the 'Hellboy' concept or Hell's existence, but at the end of it all I find myself less emotional and more analytical about this story. For me, this story is overwhelming at times; it's absolutely ugly and incredibly fake and it's not going to stand the test of time. Obviously the characters don't have any flaws or holes within their stories, it's not going to matter much. Or is there a possibility of these being interesting stories and this being good, entertaining action? I really can't say at this moment.\n'Hellboy' is far from short and bloated.

{"text": "Share:\nA US professor claims to have revealed the identity of the Antichrist.\nRuben Tyler, from the University of Chicago Divinity School, made the comment in an interview.\nTyler says Jesus and the Antichrist must be two sides of the same coin and use the exact same systems and pre-determined mechanisms, citing the Bible to support his claim.\nTyler said, 'A moment ago I told a reporter for Global Christianity Monitor that Jesus and the Antichrist must be the same and described the traditions Jesus used. My statement was not made in a video announcement but it is of great significance.'\nTyler has previously said he believes the Antichrist will be revealed in 2024, but warns that this is just the first part of the story.\n'I did not address this in my announcement - this work, God help us, is the beginning of a much longer series,' Tyler said.\nTyler claims he will reveal the Antichrist's true identity in a book to be released at a later date.\nThe name Antichrist is often shortened to the name of the devil, or it is used to denote a demon.\nThe Catholic Church still officially denies the existence of a living Antichrist. In 2006, the Vatican's Pontifical Council of the Family published a statement declaring there was 'no god who wants to annihilate or undermine family'.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 Goaltending is difficult enough as is. Throw an injury into the mix and it creates an opposing team\u2019s bottom line offense against you in a big hurry.\nThe Sharks became the latest victim of the power play snake-bitten in the second period when the Minnesota Wild scored the lone goal of the middle frame to take a 1-0 lead into the break.\nAt the other end of the ice, Martin Jones was victimized by the wild offense all night. The 24-year-old goaltender gave up five goals on 33 shots after he let in four goals on 21 shots in the Sharks 3-2 loss to the Minnesota Wild Saturday at Xcel Energy Center.\nThe Sharks are now on the verge of falling behind in the Western Conference playoffs. At 2-1, they\u2019re once again playing catch up in a best-of-seven series. How long will the Sharks goalie phenom last?\nHere\u2019s what we learned in the Sharks 1-0 loss to the Wild.\n1. The Sharks now need to beat the Wild to have a chance.\nJones is already on the record as the longest tenured player on the Sharks roster, but now that the team\u2019s talented depth is tested, he\u2019s going to feel the pressure as the winning pitcher in the clincher.\nJones is going to need to post a particularly strong performance for the Sharks to have a chance to come back in this series.\nThis is the situation you don\u2019t want to find yourself in during a dogfight, a series that\u2019s building up steam. The stakes are high, and the next save is going to matter.\nJones has posted an impressive .947 save percentage through the first two games of the series, but now he\u2019s got to continue doing what he\u2019s doing: keeping the puck out of the net, shutting the door.\nThe Sharks got another reminder of how game changing the Wild\u2019s power play can be, in the second period. After Anze Kopitar was checked into the Sharks net by Mikko Koivu, Minnesota received a 5-on-3. Kyle Brodziak and Zach Parise buried their first two goals of the series when they capitalized on a short-handed power play.\nThe Wild ultimately capitalized on a lot of Jones mistakes, but the Sharks are going to have to find a way to silence the wild in the third.\n2. Evander Kane is good enough for this team to keep producing.\nKane, who led the Sharks with 13 goals during the regular season, hasn\u2019t been able to find his rhythm in the playoffs. The Sharks forward is 0-2 with one assist in the last two series.\nKane turned in a decent game Saturday, but he didn\u2019t score.\nHis first shift of the game came in a disastrous sequence, when he beat Mikko Koivu in a battle for the puck in the Minnesota end, lost it in the rush and Kyle Brodziak picked up the puck for a breakaway.\nHis second shift began in the Wild zone, but he got caught in the neutral zone and was slashed by Jason Zucker on a breakaway attempt, firing the puck into the air and out of play.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that teammates like Brent Burns, Joe Pavelski and Patrick Marleau keep telling him that he\u2019s big-time talent, that he\u2019s good enough to stay this hot. Sharks fans should be impressed, too. Kane is starting to learn the NHL and the perfect way to do that is to keep creating chances, putting the puck on net and letting his teammates do the rest.\nKane will be important as the Sharks find their way to even this series up, especially with their blue liners impaired by injuries. Joe Thornton, Timo Meier and Marc-Edouard Vlasic are all hobbled heading into Game 3. In the playoffs, strong line defense begins with heavy play from the corner.\nIf Kane is clicking, it will definitely help out the team\u2019s sickly defensemen.\n3. Alex Stalock going to break through.\nStalock, the Sharks wildcard goalie who was called up during last year\u2019s playoffs, performed his first playoff save total of the season Saturday. He started all five games of the Sharks 4-0 run to the Stanley Cup Final, but was shut down in the first round this year.\nStalock has made three career starts in the NHL, but he impressed as the Sharks backup goalie last year. He won one game, a 5-4 decision over the Pittsburgh Penguins, and posted a .937 save percentage in his three starts", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Quarter after quarter, restaurant stocks like Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) consistently post impressive growth on the top and bottom lines.\nAccording to Bloomberg, in fact, roughly 40% of the 100 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 closed with year-over-year revenue growth during their last quarterly reports. And the average stock today trades at 26 times trailing earnings, so there are no guarantees past growth will be repeated.\nBut with dozens of capable companies that remain screaming buys after their recent run-ups, they're very likely looking elsewhere. That's why as April rolls around, it's time for me to pick the three restaurants stocks I think are the best bets for investors in April.\nWith better-than-expected results for each restaurant\nFirst up, Cheesecake Factory continues to outperform the Street's estimates for its respective businesses as the case with its first-quarter earnings announcement made a quick ascent.\nFor the three months ended March 4, Cheesecake Factory's revenue climbed 4.9% year over year to $707.7 million, which translated to a 7.6% rise in same-restaurant sales, including the restaurant group's trendiest offerings such as its Signature Baked Ziti with Chicken Alfredo, and Big Daddy's Chicken Lane, a boneless chicken sandwich sold on a roll. By contrast, in the same year-ago period same-restaurant sales only increased 3.2%. On the bottom line, Cheesecake Factory's earnings per share were up 11.5% year over year to $0.54. That includes the impact of a slightly higher share count as the company sold more stock to shore up capital resources.\nWhat's more, Cheesecake Factory owns and operates 187 restaurants, so its nearly 6% quarterly same-restaurant sales growth didn't rise anywhere near enough to slow the trend.\nIn addition, keep in mind that Cheesecake Factory plans to open five new restaurants during the remainder of the year, which should help drive total revenue higher by another 3% during the second quarter.\nFinally, Cheesecake Factory also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share, or $0.72 annually, which at current prices yields 2.1%. Needless to say, we shouldn't begrudge it a single penny.\nAnd this one's just the start\nStarbucks investors looking for more reasons to bet on the world's largest coffee house had just as good reason to cheer a couple weeks ago after the company reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2013.\nFor that quarter, the company -- which has been expanding around the world for the past few years -- saw its revenue grow 6% year over year to a record $4.12 billion, which translated to a 7% increase in earnings per share to $0.68. For perspective, analysts had called for revenue and earnings of $4.10 billion and $0.63 per share, respectively.\nAnd on the first-quarter call, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz noted customers are still feeling the effects of a sluggish global economy in the form of \"continued sluggishness in the global financial markets.\" That said, according to Starbucks, not only are customers opening their wallets more as a result, but also it's leaving them with more money to spend on Starbucks coffee drinks, which is also a great thing.\nFinally, Schultz also said Starbucks is on track to open approximately 10,000 new stores in the next 10 years. This includes the stores Starbucks will open this year with anticipated adjusted annualized net income of $14.2 billion -- greater than the combined sales that Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Wal-Mart reported last year.\nAnd make no mistake, Starbucks is still a company driven by its baristas, and that's why I'm convinced they'll continue finding a way to put across the coffee-drinking experience to customers of all stripes.\nAnd for investors looking for even more growth from the restaurant industry, I've got another food and beverage stock that I think should be of particular interest to them in April. That stock is first up: McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "news, local-news,\nA small-town woman has made it through to the big time and will be honoured with a publishing honour in her hometown. Eight years ago, Bundalong woman Karen Turner was second runner-up for the Kiama Literature Festival's prestigious Diana Bishop Writers' Prize. Now she has a book in print and will be formally presented with the honour at Albury next Thursday night. Her debut novel, Stormbird, is one of only five published works for a writer from a regional centre. The novel centres on a troubled couple, Lesley and Bill, who are swept away by wild weather as they attempt to reunite on the Queensland Sunshine Coast. Turner said Stormbird's launch will also honour her heroine and hero, a humble fisherman and landlady. \"Lesley's about a smaller community ... but those small-town people will tell you the world is a huge place,\" she said. Turner moved from Bundalong in the late 1990s and left behind children at the primary school she attended, but her family and experiences on the now-closed school grounds prompted her to write. \"I saw as I got older that quite a few people could be put into the category, as I've described in the book ... of post-1990 nostalgia,\" she said. \"You meet some people, their life's kind of drab, you see them, they're there in that small town \u2026 and their lives are a bit neglected, they're not really looked after in terms of the culture. \"That bothered me.\" Part of Turner's childhood in Bundalong was spent in an old school house, one of many that remained in existence as schools closed. The area's central location made it a place that would provide the backdrop for her writing. \"It's just the smaller town town with the odd Gold Coast or the Gold Coast [somewhere else], they all have individual towns but that's not what's around here.\" Windam Middle School principal Sam Andrews was one of her first teachers and has continued to support her writing as she aimed for publication. He described Stormbird as a \"beautiful book\", one that has transported him from behind the school desk to read it from beyond. \"While it's certainly a beautiful story set in the beautiful settings of the Sunshine Coast, it's also very much about Karen's personal and professional life,\" Mr Andrews said. \"It's not a book that's restricted to a particular crowd, although it's very much a story that you could read as a first-time reader or have heard of someone you would know who would have read this book as a classic story and know the stories and all the references that happen in it.\" The reception the book has received has been positive, with artist Narelle Howard specialising in watercolours in the book. Mr Andrews said the book was the best-received entry he had ever seen at the school. \"I think there's something about a small community, we like to have a bit of face-to-face interaction and I think it's wonderful for a story to be told that is central to that community,\" he said. \"I think all our literature students really appreciate the depth and the range of the stories that are in the book.\" The novel is published under her Fisher King publishing contract, which is responsible for six other books including 2009 bestseller Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, or Snow Flower and the Secret Fan Bo Zhu. Mrs Turner has another novel on the release schedule with a Christmas novel due for the end of the year. She was one of four entrants in the Diana Bishop Writers' Prize, a competition open to writers from the previous year's Kiama Literature Festival. \"I'd never heard of the Diana Bishop Writers' Prize because it only started a few years ago, and I was just assuming that I had qualified,\" she said. \"I was the second runner-up, just as I thought the judges had a longlist. \"It was amazing \u2026 I was blown away and it just gave me a huge new sense of confidence in my writing that I actually had the talent to write a book. \"I'm just really grateful for that.

We will not allow it to happen,\u201d President Donald Trump said, addressing the sweeping crisis of access to affordable 5G wireless Internet. | James Lawler Duggan/AFP/Getty Images Technology Trump rejects government intervention in 5G wireless networks\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday shot down any calls to give the federal government a direct role in the fifth-generation wireless networks of the future, even as he said the Trump administration is pressuring China to keep American technological innovators at bay.\n\u201cThe Chinese have made massive investments in our country,\u201d Trump said, addressing the sweeping crisis of access to affordable 5G wireless Internet during remarks at the South China Morning Post in Washington. \u201cWe will not allow it to happen.\u201d\nStory Continued Below\nHe noted that he held a meeting last month with top executives from China's three major wireless carriers, \u201cbut they are far behind us.\u201d\nTrump and the White House had previously blasted China\u2019s \"infiltration and dominance of the U.S. high-tech industry\" that saw China develop more than 80 percent of all semiconductors used in American smartphones.

A year later, the Mother of Dragons accepted! Why would Jon want to go to her house?\nThe episode's sneak peek at Season 8 leads to a flashback that offers our first look at an entire season of highly anticipated scenes: Yes, Game of Thrones is killing off entire fan-favorite characters in its final season.\nHere's your first glimpse at how Jon and Daenerys will break out of Westeros, how big Jon's army will be, and what Tywin Lannister has planned for him and Tyrion.\nJon Snow\nJon takes one look at Khaleesi, proceeds to ascend her throne, and utter the phrase \"I need you,\" followed by a hands-on examination of a Dragonstone tablet with Daenerys' face on it. Jon had been sworn to Cersei on the strength of his allegiance to the Starks (who witnessed the mass execution of Ned Stark and his family), and he recites an oath on Tywin's behalf.\n\"We would become ... enemies forever,\" Tywin says in the trailer. \"I will raise the blood\u2026 And all of Lannister history will fall before your son. But you'll know, you will know.\"\nA lot of speculation points to the Dragonstone wheel: Jaime will be part of this wheel, and Ramsay and the Bolton family will be the spoons that will set it in motion. If you watch a very prom-like clip with Jon right after he and Daenerys are reunited, you'll see the dragon wheel spin once again.\nJon and Daenerys riding off into the sunset. Image: hbo\nOkay, okay, the dragon wheel isn't mentioned in this flash of Jon at the top of the hour, but you can see the yellow pendant on Daenerys' left hand, draped across her breast; it's a necklace known as the jewelled wheel, the same one Tyrion and Jorah are wearing in Season 6.\nIn that episode, Jorah had informed Daenerys of his studies in the school of sciences and robotic engineering in Valyria (which some believe is from Vaes Dothrak, the far east of Westeros). Now, both Daenerys and Jorah believe that Valyria is home \u2014 and in the end of Season 7, Tyrion tried to make it so by solving a math problem based on Daenerys' command.\nThis opus, \"The Emissary,\" arrives in Valyria in Season 7, and there is a book in it that has been translated into Valyrian. Maybe this is where Daenerys gets her spell on men?\nDaenerys, fighting the White Walkers with pretty much all of Westeros...

Clearly we've said goodbye to Rhaegar's wild child, who's standing atop the Iron Throne now, but we haven't seen glimpses of her in this scene yet.\nCarol steps in and offers some sage wisdom to Jon Snow (his mom), saying that women need to trust people \u2014 and Jon Snow, who seems to trust everyone \u2014 says that he won't stop until he has \"named the right names.\"\nBetween a final image of Tormund's direwolf, Viserion, huddled around a downed tree and Mona and Arya closer than ever, Season 8 looks to offer one final glimpse at a beloved character.\nTyrion Lannister\nHey, what about Tyrion? Here, here, here he is at the Iron Throne with his former master.\n\"I am a thing of beauty,\" Tyrion says to Cersei, as she looks on from behind the Iron Throne. Oh, this is getting good.

I've joked about a similar fanboy awakening when I read George R.R. Martin's prequel \"A Dream of Spring,\" but I think the story goes deeper.\nOberyn was Martin's showrunner, and the man behind the man: He's one of Martin's most underrated talents, a talented craftsman of the writing who'd made a solid beginning for a good actor, then brought it to a stellar conclusion.\nPart of that finished story was heartbreaking. Because Oberyn's slow descent to and tragic death in the finale barely peaked. It was and remains central to Martin's work.\nSo that brings us to the question we come back to again and again -- what would Martin do if he was given the power to write a \"Game of Thrones\" finale?\nHe'd do all he could to honor Oberyn.\nEven before seeing Oberyn again in the finale, \"Game of Thrones\" had been an arrogant destroyer of open skies. From the very first scene, the episode shows what it would be like for the Lannisters to continue burning their beloved Westeros to the ground. Before that, Jaime and Cersei tear each other apart, and finally take center stage in their respective roiling (and contradictory) battles. This opened up the world to more narrative possibilities and the possibilities of each characters' choices.\nOnce we get to winter, Oberyn says ominously to Tyrion, \"You see, we've started the business of building walls...We'll stay here another thousand years...and the wall will be made of stone.\"\nBeth Elderkin/CNET\nOberyn's character is written in vivid, unequivocal colours. His first nickname is Viserys Targaryen. He hates the Lannisters -- whose acts against him, Cersei included, never seem to get them off the hook. He's a showman (always), a wannabe nobility (always). It's no wonder he strikes the cord that made me fall for this character.\nMuch has been made of how \"Game of Thrones\" will end -- from whether the show will end by killing off its central figures, to the characters' do-or-die seasons, to whether that seventh season won't be based on the novels, or how the violence depicted in the books and on the show might get \"reduced\" to \"less violence\" in \"GoT.\"\nI refuse to talk about it. Because while no show is perfect, the show I've been watching and loving these past six years is the show that has kept me coming back each and every week. It's the series that inspired me to pick up a fully functioning copy of the books. It's the show that my most recent \"GoT\" review is for.\nGood ol' George doesn't leave room for much we don't know yet, but with Westeros ravaged beyond repair, there will be a few familiar faceless, no-name villains. No, Stannis doesn't make a return, but Tyrion is exposed in the final two episodes and a dubious Red Priest wanders in the shadows in the season finale. A few characters -- like Jorah Mormont, the late Lord Tywin Lannister and maybe Jon Snow -- are already saddled with a large part of their story in the books and series. But some re-castings and new ones (Maisie Williams' Arya and Sophie Turner's Sansa, who meet book readers' fingers) promise more character heft.\nCNET\nBut Martin is loyal to the cast he's introduced and built up. The show needed all the books could provide from them to continue this chronology, but even more than that, it needs them for a noble end that honors all.\nThe show may now begin a new business of keeping fantasy alive. Martin is writing a prequel, and there are spin-offs in the works. Martin is putting all of his eggs in one well, a one-source life, so be it.\nBut \"Game of Thrones\" may also end as the grand finale it started as. I want to know that it honored the man it loved for keeping that life alive.\n-- Sean Hollister\nRebooting the Reef: CNET dives deep into how tech can help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "WE are trying to use a monetary method of evaluation to compute the overall financial picture in the country.\nThey belong to a committee formed under the Ministry of Finance last year for assessing Pakistan\u2019s external accounts and an inter-ministerial committee of the finance ministry and Central Board of Revenue (CBR) established under Finance Minister Asad Umar.\nSince these surveys are preliminary, analysts are less optimistic about Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. They believe the government will have to borrow in the global capital market to maintain its reserves.\nPerhaps there is a glimpse of a ray of hope for Pakistan because it has a strong export sector\n\u201cUnder the evaluation methodology, we were recording foreign exchange reserves of $25.6 billion until last week. The revised estimate for March shows it falling to $22.2bn,\u201d noted Dr Asad Umar, highlighting the importance of keeping the foreign exchange reserves at $25bn.\n\u201cSo far, the two committees, chaired by former finance minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Finance Minister Asad Umar, met in December 2017 and again in February this year. They worked on a proposal and initially asked that the current account surplus be maintained at above $20bn.\u201d\nFormer finance minister Khawaja Asif, who remained the finance minister on Aug 31, 2015, while talking to Dawn on Thursday, agreed that there was an expectation that the deficit in the current account of the foreign exchange reserves should not be recorded at a lower level.\n\u201cOf course the industry has concern over the current account position. As such, people have come up with proposals to address the issue. But these issues are a part of the process. It is the government\u2019s responsibility to look at them as it emerges,\u201d he said.\nAnother analyst believes that foreign exchange reserves may stay at $24bn. \u201cCBR data showed it to be $22.2bn for March. And it will remain around that level. There is no hope for the external position to improve in the immediate future.\u201d\nDr Shamim Yaqoob is of the view that it was good to realise that the government wanted to maintain the current account surplus at current levels. \u201cBut I believe that it will be better to track the performance of the country\u2019s exports so that it becomes a solid guarantee.\u201d\nThe securities market has its own view.\n\u201cPreliminary data shows that the country\u2019s exports in the first two months of fiscal year 2019 were up 13 per cent compared to the same period in the last fiscal year. This is a very positive sign. A look at the figures of the textile sector suggests that production of cotton yarn for export increased to more than 4m bales (about 35pc) during the period compared to around 3.9m bales during the last fiscal year.\u201d\nThe market thinks that these numbers will result in a current account deficit of $2.7bn and current account surplus of $1.4bn in the outgoing fiscal year. It was felt that the government needed to pursue a balanced approach to provide support to the export sector, which suffered tremendous losses under the previous regime.\n\u201cNow, the government can seriously pursue its policy objectives as it will provide much-needed support to the export sector. However, the Ministry of Finance will have to strike a balance between two conflicting things.\u201d\nThe market believes that the government needs to maintain its current account surplus. \u201cIt needs to seek as much support from the foreign investors as possible in its drive to achieve a balanced macroeconomic framework through revenue and expenditure consolidation and capital spending.\u201d\nIt has given the government some choices. \u201cIf the government increases imports by $5bn as a result of which its current account deficit would double (to $8bn) and the capital expenditure falls to around $5bn, this is when the government will need to borrow in the international capital market. I think that Islamabad will be able to borrow more from the international debt market (local currency) to plug its current account deficit.\u201d\nPublished in Dawn, Business & Finance weekly, April 15th, 2019\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "BEREA, Ohio -- Browns general manager John Dorsey, a former Packers defensive back and coach, released a statement today expressing sadness that his former boss Forrest Gregg died at the age of 82 on Thursday.\n\"I had the privilege of working with Forrest Gregg for 11 years as a player and coach, and I can say he was one of the most genuine, classy individuals you would ever meet,\" Dorsey said. \"He was the epitome of toughness and I will miss his tenacity, determination and competitiveness.\"\nGregg was fired by the Giants after five-plus seasons in which he compiled a 34-36 record before joining the Packers in 1976.\n\"He was a fiery coach but he was fair to all,\" Dorsey said. \"I played with some great teams while he was with the Packers and I remember him coming in to work. No matter if I had a game to win or a game to lose, I knew I was going to get my best from him.\"\nGregg, a graduate of Willoughby South, also coached under Dick Vermeil and Bill Polian with the Rams and Bengals, respectively.\n\"We were great friends,\" Dorsey said. \"We had a great partnership for a long time. I worked with the Ravens after he left and before I came to the Browns and he was a tremendous influence on how I learned the game and what I loved about it.\"\nGregg was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992, but was a controversial figure in his career. He accused fellow coaches of fixing games while he was in Cincinnati -- an allegation that J.D. Gibbs, Gregg's top assistant at the time, denied.\nGregg later had an ugly divorce from Giants owner Wellington Mara, who stepped down because Gregg was unhappy with his field-goal coverage in 1989. Gregg said Mara pulled an NFL executive from his chair after a 1997 win and told him, \"I couldn't believe it, even by modern standards.\"\nGregg also griped about the Packers, Cowboys and 49ers, but his Jaguars ended their 44-game losing streak by defeating the Packers in 1988. The Cowboys spanked the Packers the next week.\nGregg took over as coach of the Bears in 1994 and led the defense to a Super Bowl title against the Broncos.\nGregg had a terrible start with the Packers and led them to a 4-8 record in 1979 before helping the team earn the NFC North title in his final three seasons. He finished 50-54-1 over eight seasons.\nGregg was inducted into the Packers Ring of Honor in 2000.\nIn 2010, Gregg told Cleveland.com, \"I am not the luckiest man in the world. There is not a day in my life that I don't remember that I'm not happy and blessed to be here. And if there is a day that you don't, you say, 'Well, I want to be in heaven.' But if I get to the day I want to be in heaven, I will tell you what: All I did was work for the greatest God -- I can't do too much without his blessings. He is the greatest philosopher to every man that's ever lived.\"\nGregg was born on Nov. 30, 1930 in Willoughby. He and Dorsey were teammates at Miami (Ohio) and both played in the '49 NFL championship game, which the Packers won.\n", "label": "machine"}

The Metra train station and park now share a stretch of the train track, and hours are different.\nWhile the Metra station currently is free, the facility has a 30-year lease agreement with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, which allows it to raise money to help pay for upkeep on Starved Rock. The state has already spent more than $500,000 on the grounds since the lease began in 2009.\nBefore the state leases out the station, the state is now charged a fee for parking to assist with upkeep of the park.\n\"From a social standpoint, the lake has to be protected. Otherwise how is anybody going to use it?\" said State Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, who sponsored the bill. \"It's a social entity, but what the state can't do is create unnecessary financial burdens on the park.

{"text": "The EU has delivered a new proposal on fisheries, triggering renewed hopes that the deadlock could be broken and Britain staying in the single market can be salvaged.\nA request to the commission from the leaders of the EU\u2019s nine fisheries ministers was approved on Thursday to ask Brussels to consider short-term arrangements to avoid Britain leaving the fishing treaty and unable to rely on quotas from outside the EU.\nThe proposal was presented after all-night Brexit talks between Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier. A UK government source confirmed: \u201cWe now hope the EU executive will agree to explore what an extension of time for the UK\u2019s existing access to the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy can offer the negotiations and the negotiations process.\u201d\nSpeaking after the summit, Juncker acknowledged that the three members of the European parliament who opposed the Brexit package on Tuesday were still advocating for Britain to stay in the single market.\nBertie Armstrong, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, said the government would not be able to agree to a Brexit deal without the parliament\u2019s support, and that a deal needed to include the customs union. The aim is to vote against the legislation securing Britain\u2019s departure from the EU on Wednesday next week.\nEU leaders later told the prime minister, Theresa May, they would \u201cgive this all the time we need\u201d in talks to reach an agreement by October, with one leader saying it was \u201ca big deal for both sides\u201d.\nAlthough Juncker said he remained in \u201cfundamental agreement\u201d with Barnier\u2019s new proposals \u2013 which will be the subject of discussion at next week\u2019s summit \u2013 the fishermen\u2019s calls were welcomed by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has claimed that keeping Britain in the European fisheries union would be a big win for the prime minister.\nAnnouncing the turn-around in the tone of the prime minister\u2019s Brexit policy, Juncker said the way to secure what would be only a short term extension to the March 2019 deadline was through trade talks with Britain. \u201cWe hope that the concessions we have made today can help facilitate the further progress we must make in our discussions on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship, including the future of the UK in the internal market,\u201d he said.\nRemaining in the common fisheries policy was not the foreseen scenario after the referendum when the EU offered the UK access to the common fisheries policy for 17 years if it chose to leave the common fisheries policy. But May has since pledged to take back control of fish stocks, such as cod, and the exit agreement agreed in October 2018 placed the highest priority on securing access to Britain\u2019s fish stocks during transition to the new EU trading system.\nJuncker said the new proposal included the government\u2019s request to enter negotiations on access to British fishing grounds.\nDuring an event at the London School of Economics on Thursday evening, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said Britain would seek an arrangement for post-Brexit \u201cbut not if it means fishing rights will be in danger\u201d. He said: \u201cI have to think very carefully about the UK asking for a bilateral exemption and is that a good deal for Britain or is it a bad deal?\n\u201cWe are having this discussion with the European commission, and so we have to look at the end product. Does that deliver for everybody\u2019s interests, that delivers for business, it delivers for our environment and it delivers for our fishermen?\u201d\nIn a letter seen by the Guardian, the nine fisheries ministers said the commission\u2019s proposals \u201cdemonstrate that currently proposed positions are not the effective ones\u201d.\nThe council of fishing nations, a loose group of wealthy and poor EU nations, does not control how countries that do not fish at sea are affected by EU regulations. A last-minute victory for some of the fishing nations ensured that France did not use its veto powers to block EU plans to allow Norwegian vessels to fish in UK waters after Brexit. In March, Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, said Norway would not have its vessels fishing in British waters under the single market, citing the single market\u2019s ban on non-EU fishing vessels.\nA statement issued by the council of fisheries nations said: \u201cFrance\u2019s unilateral position opposing the extension of the access has already been viewed by other ministers as one that is not what the final position should be.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

We also saw John Tavares score both Toronto goals, which was a bit of a surprise \u2014 the All-Star center has been quiet so far this season but also is considered one of the best offensive forwards in the NHL.\nThere were plenty of other takeaways from Monday\u2019s matchup. Here are the best of the rest:\n1. Rask\u2019s game was exceptional\nRask was nearly unbeatable for much of the night. He repeatedly robbed Toronto attackers and also provided a handful of highlight-reel saves en route to an incredibly impressive night.\nRask finished with 39 saves in his post-season debut. He made 13 saves during the first period alone \u2014 seven more than the 26 Toronto shooters managed. Rask also didn\u2019t have a bad day when it came to clearing his sight lines at the blue line, with 47 percent of his shot attempts attempting to through through traffic, according to NBC Sports Boston\u2019s video analysis.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that we keep reiterating with Tuukka,\u201d Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said of Rask\u2019s fortitude. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of him how he handles himself every day and continues to perform. He\u2019s kind of our rock and cornerstone and guys have really rallied around him for the past couple years, so we\u2019re really proud of him tonight.\u201d\n2. Phaneuf\u2019s goal hit snapper\nToronto defenseman Ron Hainsey had a ton of traffic in front of Rask but couldn\u2019t get in position to chip the puck home. The puck popped out of the defender\u2019s hands with time winding down in the second period, leading to Toronto winger Connor Brown\u2019s soft wrist shot that deflected off Phaneuf\u2019s blocker and into the back of the net with 34 seconds left in the middle frame.\n3. Grabbing a second lead almost didn\u2019t happen\nThe Bruins seemingly scored a tying goal midway through the third period when Brad Marchand ripped a shot from the faceoff circle off the post. The puck then ended up in Marchand\u2019s skates. He regained control of the puck before lifting it back across the crease \u2014 just inches away from Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews. The puck hit a post, and the Bruins\u2019 offensive momentum was lost as Toronto quickly grabbed a 3-2 lead. The Leafs then held on for a hard-fought victory that swung the momentum in Toronto\u2019s favor.\n4. The big fourth line game?\nA big power-play goal by the fourth line was the difference in Game 3. Jake DeBrusk and Noel Acciari made good things happen during the man advantage, which is exactly what Cassidy wanted going into the series.\n\u201cWe were trying to check them well and get the puck in deep, and that\u2019s sort of what we were looking for in Game 3,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThey played a lot more near the goal. I thought they got their shots in with enough net presence to create a little bit more room than they might get if you\u2019re jamming in. They did some good things. As (the puck) goes around the first blueline, they were able to get them off their stick, so I thought they were dynamic out there, and I thought they were pretty good defensively.\u201d\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs are the ultimate test of character. The Bruins apparently have the right stuff.\nThe Bruins will be on the road for Game 4 of their first-round series against the Maple Leafs on Wednesday.\nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "BC-US--Pulitzer Prize-Victim Of Crime,4th Ld-Writethru\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The newspaper staff of The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, stretched out yellow caution tape along the sidewalk after shots shattered the newsroom with a thunderous boom. A wounded copy editor struggled to call his wife and begged her to come to the office. Others held the flag over the office up high in an act of defiance against those who attacked them.\n\"This isn't just Annapolis. This is America, this is a civilized society,\" Assistant Managing Editor Ron Robinson told his colleagues as they struggled to put out the paper on the morning of June 28, 2012. \"We are all more connected than ever before, even to people who are halfway around the world and who can do anything and hit us from any direction.\"\nA year and a day later, just hours before the 84th annual Pulitzer Prizes were announced, Robinson was overcome with grief as he recalled the attack by a lone gunman. He lay at the feet of a television reporter reading the final edition announcing the winners for public service and breaking news. He is among many who have tried to make the newspaper a source of hope for journalists in a nation where information flow is fast but journalism often is not.\nThe newspaper staffers were honored for their coverage of the mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in which five employees were killed by a shooter who had been going around town shooting up cars.\n\"We didn't know if there was any place for us,\" Robinson told The Associated Press as he read the competition's Public Service prize-winning story about raising more money to help victims' families.\nBenjamin Borland, 38, of Silver Spring, Maryland, was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the deaths. Although he was not convicted of specifically targeting the newspaper's staff, he told the judge that the coverage of his horrific crimes had triggered \"a storm of hatred\" directed at him. He stalked the newspaper and shot up vehicles. \"It was clearly motivated by hostility towards journalists,\" said prosecutor Richard LaFortune.\nIt's unclear if Borland, who had mental health problems, intended to kill the entire newspaper staff on June 28, 2012. But employees were huddled together in a bathroom, hiding under pieces of paper, when he walked into the newsroom. There was only one way out of the office, which was crowded with reporting and copyediting staff, heaving under the threat of gunfire. The gunman left, stood by the window and fired into the newsroom. Scott DeFife, another assistant managing editor, said a water cooler was shattered and at least six other newsroom employees escaped by running toward the river. Others could not get out.\nThe mystery of the attack was compounded by a confusing series of tweets from Borland himself \u2014 including, he said, a tweet meant to reveal his planned attack, but which did not go out until afterward.\nReporters eventually learned that Borland had been deeply frustrated by coverage of a 2012 court case in which a girlfriend said he stalked her. He was forced to apologize and take anger management classes, and the paper closed the investigation to avoid generating public anger.\nBut the story that made headlines was how he left a blood trail across the capital city. He was arrested in a motel parking lot more than an hour after the shooting, having doused his car with gasoline, set it on fire and dumped more gasoline inside. He told police he had been researching places that could be shot at. The gas fire had been lit with a lighter and lighter fluid. Borland allegedly used gasoline to ignite his car and his grandmother's house. When police searched the motel room, they found a map of the Capital Gazette building with the names of the newspaper's reporters and a picture of his car.\nNo one has ever claimed responsibility for his attack. And the Annapolis Police Department still considers the motive undetermined. But its Assistant Chief William Krampf told the AP that the newspaper's coverage of Borland's ex-girlfriend and their days together did not play a role in the attack.\n\"There were a number of reasons that they hate the newspaper. It could be their voice is different than others,' he said. \"We investigate everyone and everything. This was out of the ordinary.\"\nGary Legaspi, the journalist who ran a story about Borland and his fire attack, said staffers put the word out in the community to help the families of the victims find funding for funeral expenses.\n\"That's what journalists do, even in the most difficult of circumstances,\" Legaspi said. \"But I will tell you, this was a chance for us to come together, do something and help others at the same time.\"\n\"We will continue to honor the memory of those lost,\" Robinson said", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Republicans are coming around to the realization that Donald Trump is a dangerous irrational maniac who has transformed normal politics into a nonstop series of deceit, lies and tantrums.\nAfter Donald Trump wept after signing the SDNY charging him with colluding with the Russians to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election, Republican senators began privately confiding that they doubted he was fit to be president. Though many withheld outright public remarks, that repulsion is growing louder each week.\nAs if to increase the chaos, Trump met last week with his NATO partners, where he announced his plan to end US participation in a U.S.-European security alliance many thought was untouchable. While questioning U.S. allies\u2019 \u201clevels of commitment,\u201d Trump quickly added that he would \u201cnot burden the United States or burden our kids\u201d with yet another global obligation. Two days later, Trump announced his support for Britain\u2019s planned withdrawal from the EU. \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin) \u2013 I always knew he was very smart!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\nThat dynamic could change if GOP leaders seek to harness Trump\u2019s dwindling public support and stop his assault on any aspect of American life, including global trade. Trump and Nikki Haley, the secretary of state and official representative for the UN, were the first to warn the president before he took office that \u201cAmerica First\u201d was a slogan from the past, not of present reality. For all their bluster, and warnings that the president was unfit to lead, the Europeans still resented being perceived as the scapegoats behind the refugee-and-immigration crisis that has rocked Europe. And suddenly, it appears, the president\u2019s own callous disregard for international relationships and international norms is only inflamed by the Europeans\u2019 inability to respond to his actions with anything other than bluster and belittling innuendo.\nBut in a sign of how far Trump\u2019s Republican soulmates have come from their earlier opposition to an erratic man holding the reins of power, Trump has succeeded in co-opting Mike Pompeo, their intelligence chief and presumably their only hope for keeping the president in check.\nPompeo was a \u201cbig supporter\u201d of the Iraq War and a supporter of the CIA\u2019s interrogation practices and rendition of terror suspects. As senator from Kansas, he called for more war with Iran. (Cough, Cough,Trump,Cough). Pompeo now has the president\u2019s ear on everything from North Korea to Ukraine. Now, reports Politico, \u201cfriends and associates say Pompeo talks to Trump about much more than foreign policy. He suggests changes to his wardrobe, whether Trump should consult his daughter about a policy decision, and even the timing of when Trump should eat.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, a month ago, Trump told Fox and Friends that he would consider nominating Pompeo as secretary of state, and has assured allies that if he does become secretary of state, he will never consider firing him. In so doing, he lends Pompeo the stature of a figurehead, the kind of leader Republicans have long been applauding for fighting against presidential power in Washington.\nAll the while, Republicans are lapping up the praise from Democrats like Nancy Pelosi for their new breed of Republicans, the kind willing to sacrifice their jobs to protect the president.\n\u201cSome in the Republican Party, notably for some months now, have been shouting praise for the principled and transparent senators like Bob Corker, Mitch McConnell, and even John McCain,\u201d the New York Times reported Monday morning. \u201cNow they are urging others in the party, whom they feel are complicit in Trump\u2019s attempt to curtail the work of the Justice Department, to do the same. \u2018They need to be falling all over themselves that there are Republican members of Congress and even an opposing senator who are actually expressing concern.\u2019 \u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "OLDER patients on the ward have always had more days of freedom than other children. But the ward's latest batch of OAPs has no idea what they're missing.\nFor the past few weeks the busy rehabilitation ward at Royal Bournemouth Hospital has been overrun with three enthusiastic little helpers.\nThe 'Twinkle Winkle' Academy is a self-financed programme run by health worker Katie Emmins to bring the hospital's older patients some much-needed respite.\nThe team have been running the scheme for 12 weeks, having been formed after Ms Emmins approached some pupils from St Cuthbert's Primary School to see if they were interested in doing a project for their P50 divisional show on March 9.\n\"My mum and the principal were really keen for us to do the project,\" said eight-year-old Michelle, one of the students who has been chosen to spread joy at the ward.\nThe young ambassador then got down to the very serious business of introducing herself to the patients and spreading some cheer - and realising just how much they appreciated it.\n\"It wasn't until she handed us flowers,\" said Shirley Grennell, who was picked to be the ambassador, \"that I noticed how ill she was really.\"\nAfter sharing a story about the plant that was given to her by another patient, Lillian Roberts was so touched that she looked at her card and commented on how sad it was that she had only one.\n\"You're so lucky to have two choices for your heart,\" the card said. \"It's one of them.\"\nThe card was a beautiful message from a young volunteer, but for Ms Emmins she says it had a deeper meaning - she was sharing her thought that the patients, often separated from loved ones by mobility issues, deserve love, care and attention.\n\"I have noticed a real camaraderie develop. Previously there was quite a negative vibe but I think we're starting to have a positive impact.\"\nThe schemes, which started in Newcastle upon Tyne and involve more than 20 schools, is backed by Bournemouth's Mayor Alex Jefford who also attended the run-in to the ward.\nMs Emmins said that she was delighted by the reaction from the patient population.\n\"I went into cardiac rehabilitation on my own and we have always had more days of freedom than the other students.\"\nShe added that the programme had been running on the ward for the past few weeks and the old patients had also been delighted.\n\"They were lying in beds getting a bit bored and they were overwhelmed when they gave flowers to [the students],\" said Ms Emmins.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Last week, the Justice Department gave Alex van der Zwaan, a former White House aide and government contractor, a 45-day suspended sentence for lying to investigators about Russian collusion. Van der Zwaan has maintained his innocence, but the White House blocked him from bringing his case to the full appeal court, so his appeal was dealt with in the lower court.\nThe Supreme Court probably won't consider his case again for another six months. But you don't have that long to wait. Mueller's report on Russian collusion is sitting in a secret location right now. It is the reason you have nothing to do today but read this article. Otherwise, you will never know if you deserve Rod Rosenstein's fate.\nThe special counsel's report is so likely to be explosive that the 35-page statute that created Mueller's probe specifically states that its contents are \"not the subject of any limitation on disclosure.\" Given the grand jury transcripts that have already been released, the most important Mueller news over the past several weeks is that the special counsel hasn't released any \"confidential information\" about it.\nToday -- the Thursday before the holidays -- Rosenstein was called before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answered questions about the Trump campaign. In his testimony, Rosenstein essentially confirmed that Robert Mueller has been investigating a wide range of matters, including Trump's contact with Russians.\n\"It's a lot,\" the deputy attorney general said when asked whether the Trump campaign was still under investigation.\nWell, listen up! Before you know about anything from the Mueller report, take a read through this article. As the lead author, the Tribune Editorial Board has the authority to reveal little of what is in it. That's why, to avoid revealing any details that could affect the integrity of the Mueller investigation, we're going to mention nothing that he said in his testimony.\nWe'll also keep these excerpts to a minimum. For instance, the Tribune Editorial Board never, ever would, but it seems highly likely that the Mueller report will include the Steele dossier, the uncorroborated document written by ex-British spy Christopher Steele. The juiciest parts of the Steele report aren't in the more-than-140-page document that Trump associates, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and current campaign chief John McQueen pleaded not guilty to, but sources say other former associates of Trump have paid for the anti-Trump dossier to prepare their own cases.\nAnd while we're on the subject of sordid detail, the Tribune Editorial Board reveals that Trump associates are still encouraging senior White House staffers to lie to investigators, which could yield even more juicy information. \"Several members of the team of lawyers and consultants working with the White House have communicated with them,\" we learn.\nThen there are the bombshells we aren't allowed to know. \"The information remains confidential, but could now be used by multiple parties to target colleagues, staff members and even top officials,\" says the Tribune. \"Tribune data analysis based on the Special Counsel's subpoena and 22 exhibits obtained in discovery shows that the lawyers' activity involving the president\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and the people who worked in the White House would have attracted the attention of an opposition party -- potentially those who share the president\u2019s party affiliation.\"\nOf course, nobody knows the contents of the Mueller report. But if you want to get an inkling, including who is going to answer those nosy questions and why, read the Tribune editorial.\nAnd, once you've read it, let's talk about that mysterious 45-day suspension. The one handed down to Alex van der Zwaan is \"a flagrant breach of prosecutorial ethics and clearly an attempt to influence public opinion or derail the investigation,\" writes Tribune political reporter Yuxing Zheng. \"The decision sends a message to Justice Department employees that the president's appointees are not interested in hiring prosecutors who enforce the law as they understand it.\"\n-- Douglas Perry\n", "label": "machine"}

But then Shah Rukh Khan and Fauji took a fresh turn in Gujarati cinema when the actor accepted the role of the sobbing bhojni in the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, Black. The love those two had for each other was apparent in the emotional hankering that Shah Rukh shared for the Sanjay Leela Bhansali starrer. And on Thursday, the King Khan again sought to reiterate his admiration for Fauji, as he paid homage to the director via his Twitter page.\n\"I was hesitant to work with him (Fauji), at least in Gujarati films. I had heard so many stories, stories of why Fauji couldn't direct me in a Gujarati film... I tried to convince him to direct me. He said, 'If it's about your role, I cannot'. I said, 'But if the script is good, why not?' He said, 'Because I don't need any romance'. So I said yes. I was really excited to do the role. I was thinking how I can do it differently and do justice to the role,\" he shared.\n\"And then Fauji sent me a script. He insisted that I read it. He gave me some time. I was on the plane to a train. It was crazy. That script was worth the fact that I got to do the film. I was nervous, obviously. He [Sanjay Leela Bhansali] came around my room, met me. He spoke about the role, and the movie, and everything, but it was such a blessing to get the kind of response that Black got... It was obviously overwhelming,\" he continued, adding, \"Today, I wanted to personally tell Fauji that the film was successful. \"The movie has opened, and it's been a hit already. I wanted to tell Fauji that the film was a success, and that I am so grateful to him. For having been me in his film... that that little effort repaid with such a great reaction is something that I will always remember.\"\nThe superstar expressed his gratitude in a special note: \"Yesterday I was overwhelmed with the outcome of your effort. Thank you for giving me so much power and confidence. Seeing the positive response for the opening of your film is the most amazing feeling in the world. And as I was saying, my 'sab liye bahut zindagi' and your 'sonakindye saath'. These were a very special days for the two of us. You loved me so much, and for that, I love you as well.

{"text": "Selected as a byelection candidate for the federal Liberal Party in 2015.\nBefore working in tech industries, he worked in engineering for aerospace giant Bombardier.\nLast year, after losing the 2015 race to the federal Conservatives\u2019 Nicole Sarauer by 700 votes, she retired from politics and Drayton Valley-Devon returned to the federal ballot for voters to choose someone new to fill the riding\u2019s 35,000 votes from 2015.\nThen came Drayton Valley-Devon candidate Shelley Glover. After a Monday morning announcement by the federal party\u2019s Leader, Justin Trudeau, Glover received the first endorsement of her campaign from former Edmonton-Dipper and Conservative MP Jason Kenney. Kenney\u2019s endorsement started the day on Monday not only with a momentous endorsement in Drayton Valley, but a base of support for Glover\u2019s own campaign in the community, now considered to be one of the communities Liberals must seize.\nGlover, along with Justin Whyte, will face off against NDP candidate Cheryl Oates and Conservative candidate Charlie Geczy on May 27.\n\u201cThis is a byelection where we have to be on all fours,\u201d Glover said Monday.\nGlover said she chose the riding to run for the Liberal Party in 2015 because she felt \u201cthat there is no one out there who\u2019s actually representing people in this riding.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping I can be the bridge between where the riding is and where it can be going and one of the places where we put national solutions to actually address the needs of small businesses,\u201d Glover said.\nThat situation is something that\u2019s hit home with Glover\u2019s own family. After moving to Edmonton in 1997, she said her parents faced homelessness due to the recession. They passed the experience onto her, and later on the famous globetrotting scientist astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\u201cWhen we go abroad, it\u2019s OK to disappear. When it comes home to Canada, it\u2019s a time of recovery or crisis or whatever. So, to give us that sense of, you know, actually speaking with one voice when it comes to issues like prescription drug access, mental health, issues that affect us all, that\u2019s pretty heavy,\u201d Glover said.\nGlover also said she wants to move the riding to a point where it can be one of Liberal running MPs out the door. She said that\u2019s not an ideal situation, but it would open doors for changes to things like pharmacare.\nGlover acknowledged there\u2019s a strong focus on rural and less populated parts of the riding, so some residents in the city may see her as a disruptor to some of the Liberal\u2019s thoughts and plans. For Glover, though, she just wants to talk about the issues that will affect people \u2014 a rural riding with an urban-oriented leader.\n\u201cDrayton Valley is certainly not a suburb. It\u2019s a town with real people living there,\u201d Glover said.\nGeczy has been the candidate for the Alberta Conservative Party since 2015 and won in the riding by 80 per cent. But, some voters in the community said they couldn\u2019t necessarily say the same about the party that\u2019s put their candidate on the ballot.\nGeczy, a marketing and journalism student at the University of Alberta, said he believes he\u2019s a strong choice for the riding.\n\u201cI think of Trudeau as wanting, you know, to tell people what they want to hear, so unfortunately, that\u2019s my party, that\u2019s what I can say because it\u2019s what Justin\u2019s say. But I think it goes beyond that. I think people are interested in the things they deserve and people like my experience, my job ethic, the things that I\u2019ve done over the last couple of years,\u201d Geczy said.\nDespite the support he\u2019s gotten from the federal Liberals, some in the community are sending the candidate from the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party (with whom the Conservative party was not aligned) to Ottawa. After receiving Geczy\u2019s endorsement, Kenney made an official statement late Monday morning.\n\u201cIt is fantastic to see another local local person receive the help of Jason Kenney and the political establishment who are fighting on behalf of the Ottawa Liberals to boost the NDP majority. It\u2019s important to put real-life experience ahead of a career in politics and Shelley Glover\u2019s unblemished record of achievements against tax hikes, debt and wasteful spending is what\u2019s really lacking in the Trudeau Liberals,\u201d Kenney said.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi changed up how we hear the Emperor\u2019s name in the franchise, placing his throne in the mind of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) as he typed the words during Rian Johnson\u2018s recently-released \u201cDeath Star\u201d scene. Now The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson is opening up about how he and Episode IX writer/producer J.J. Abrams came up with that idea \u2013 and if they had any advice for anyone involved in playing with the seeds of one of the more controversial plot points in the movie.\nYou can hear more about the Darth Vader cameo in Johnson\u2019s movie, as well as the relationship between Rey and the Force, below.\nThe Last Jedi had a lot of fodder for discussion when it was released, and one of the biggest controversies is that the film failed to address what happened to Rey\u2019s parents before her meeting with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the park. Many fans argued that this plot hole begged to be solved, and Abrams addressed it directly in The Last Jedi\u2018s epilogue: \u201cI was pretty clear about what that was from the get-go, but it will hopefully finally be addressed and explained.\u201d\nNow Johnson is discussing that moment in a new interview (via Playlist), and he insists that Abrams had nothing to do with the decision to go this way:\nI was definitely not aware of that. I think it speaks very highly of J.J. and all the artists involved with that scene that the story is really telling itself in the way that it needs to, which is Rey is so resourceful and she\u2019s a very mature, wise protagonist. I do think that will come out someday that that is sort of the true origin story of Rey. There\u2019s more to that story. But I was glad we got to tell the actual story with Supreme Leader Snoke and Luke, and not to pull any punches. I think that scene gets away from some of the discussion, a little bit, that there were some people who were just like, \u201cJust go put a scarface mask on that dude!\u201d\nJohnson goes on to say that he doesn\u2019t know if this film wraps up everything he wants to tell, but he\u2019s happy it gave audiences a good time and set the stage for other stories to come:\nI didn\u2019t write anything especially to set things up for a possible feature, but I think it was an important and exciting film to make \u2014 and an interesting thing to think about as you go into the next ones. And it was kind of\u2026the beginning of letting the story evolve. I feel like we left off in a way where we didn\u2019t feel like we\u2019d scratched the surface of it, and that\u2019s definitely an exciting place to be.\nOne of the more divisive areas where The Last Jedi failed to put the past behind us was the thorny relationship between Rey and the Force. Johnson did an admirable job teasing out the answer to that question for himself and some of the most dedicated fans, but Abrams handles the question in what I think is his strongest performance yet.\n", "label": "machine"}

The cabby offered to wait for her at Bird Street near Hobart and Sons. Weise signed for the ride, and the driver took off.\nAt Bird Street, Weise moved around with her glass of water in her hand to see what the customer service agent says.\nThe driver was gone, the woman climbed out of the taxi, and the agent told her he\u2019d been hailing other customers. \u201cThat\u2019s the same driver,\u201d Weise said. The driver had taken her fare for six minutes.\nWeise, who had the receipt, slapped $482.04 in the agent\u2019s hand.\n\u201cI asked him, \u2018How was I going to see that? I just handed you a receipt,\u2019 \u201d said Weise.\n\u201cI already have your cash.\u201d\nWeise called police after she got home.\n\u201cThe cab driver said the fare was $500,\u201d said Weise. The cabby, Mohamed Mahamed Ali, hired by the Yellow Cab Company, told cops that a 911 dispatcher falsely told him his fare was $500.\nAli failed to provide a valid cabbie\u2019s license or certificate from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. The dispatcher allegedly lied when Ali went to the Apple Store to purchase a working cellphone, so the out-of-service vehicle was not flagged and the fare was not automatically refunded.\nWeise was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she had five hours of testing for myocarditis, a potentially fatal heart condition, said Weise\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Seidl. She was treated successfully.\nThe TLC requires cabbies to display a mark in the dashboard which includes the name of the taxi company. During the investigation into Ali\u2019s fare, police couldn\u2019t find this mark.\nWeise filed a malicious-prosecution claim against the TLC and the NYPD.\nAli, who is still driving cabs, had been charged in separate incidents with driving more than a decade ago in Queens, upstate, and as recently as February in Manhattan. He\u2019s also faced TLC fines for medical violations and failure to take proper licensing classes.\nThe TLC and the NYPD agree with Weise that Ali should be fired.\n\u201cThe NYPD reviewed the information, issued a summons and we referred the matter to the Taxi and Limousine Commission to investigate,\u201d said NYPD Deputy Chief Joe Fox. \u201cThe driver\u2019s driver\u2019s license is suspended pending further investigation.\u201d\nTLC Enforcement Director Jeanne Ballesty said, \u201cThe operator engaged in illegal taxi driving, and then changed his story when the customer confronted him. We have been reviewing all of these situations over the last 10 years. The Brooklyn driver was the third that we closed based on this pattern.\u201d\nAli declined to comment, and his lawyer, Daniel Silverman, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Ali\u2019s charges in Queens and upstate went nowhere, said Weise.\n\u201cThey [Cabbies] will take you for anything,\u201d said Weise. \u201cI had a heart attack and now I\u2019m suing the taxi cab.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Juggling a career and personal life is exhausting and never-ending. And one of the causes of work-life disconnections, says productivity expert Rod Glass , is when you\u2019re overworked and running on fumes. We spoke with Glass, an executive vice president at OCM Performance Systems, about how to filter the importance of work or life events from your daily workload so you can find balance. Here are some key facts to consider if you have work-life balance trouble.\n1. Chances are, work takes up the majority of your day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we equate work and having balance with quantity of time we\u2019re in the office. I see a lot of work stress, especially coming from managers. There\u2019s too much pressure to always put on a face for the team, but face the team does not equal happiness,\u201d Glass says. \u201cWorking with people who don\u2019t have that balance approach, you often see a lot of family coming into your own work life. If you don\u2019t have kids around you when you work, and if you don\u2019t have children around you when you go home, you can\u2019t take care of your personal life, your emotional well-being, and care of your professional life.\u201d\n2. If you can\u2019t afford to pay for stress management, it could be best to postpone costly stressors.\n\u201cNo one is immune from work-related stress. I\u2019m constantly surprised by how many people I meet who are living a double life \u2013 and it\u2019s all because of work,\u201d Glass says. \u201cYour work life is all about you, so your emotional life has to be an equal part. How much time do you have to spend with your families? If your job requires a lot of late nights and weekends, maybe you can defer those. You may need to sacrifice a little in one area for the sake of the other.\u201d\n3. People are showing up to work healthier than ever.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\"It will spell Doom.\"\nMany a book, film, and TV show fan theorize about what the fate of House Tully is going to look like in Game of Thrones' final season. And just about everyone can't wait to see what the Hound does in the season.\nHowever, the facts are decidedly ambiguous as to what Dragonglass is, and that may not be clear until the end. But the museum at Cerne Bay, Northern Ireland, where House Tully's smuggler son Hoster de Gas may have buried his hoard of dragonglass, wants to clarify.\n\"I do think it is something you can use to combat White Walkers,\" said Tully Museum Curator Daragh Murphy to Belfast Telegraph. \"I'm not sure we will see any ray of hope now. It will be either raining, or I suppose you could heat it up a bit and bathe it in water that is invisible to most people.\"\nLather, rinse, repeat.\nThe Dothraki may need to jump on Hoster's old coal fire. Image: Jon Pape/HBO\nAccording to what Murphy described to Belfast Telegraph, the dragonglass was buried back in the 16th century. Hoster de Gas's house burned down, then was rebuilt in 1617, with a later construction of a further house. Murphy believes that the houses were actually connected. Therefore, the new house was built back to the existing house, more than 100 years after the original one burned.\nCould the Iron Throne have moved to Hoster's new house after he and Jon also changed their friendship? Murphy theorizes that the new plan to use dragonglass to neutralize White Walkers in the upcoming season suggests that Hoster and Jon were meeting for the first time.\nPlus, Hoster may have been an excellent smuggler, Murphy said. \"He is clearly very good at what he does.\"\nHoyer's Dragonglass can be seen in many episodes, and could, certainly, work to White Walkers' advantage. House Tully fought the White Walkers, and history of the dragonglass is yet to be learned, Murphy explained. The long-term effects of Dragonglass might exist in upcoming books that return the story.\n\"We would like to think of it as important to the survival of the time,\" Murphy said. \"I have read as many books as any reader of the show. Even George R.R. Martin's own books have painted the picture that it was important and important to the survival of the house that Robert Baratheon was the king of.\"\nStill, not everyone is convinced.\nY ou don't think dragonglass is important to the survival of the time, I wonder how many of the Gwandyses' and Daenerys' Sand Snakes know about it and use it? \u2014 Patrick Norrish (@patricksnorrish1) April 13, 2019\nWe're sure nobody will have this little tidbit spoil all Game of Thrones episodes' plot-lines when there is a war with the White Walkers and the characters keep needing dragonglass to save themselves.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Texting in class could cause pupils to feel \u201cdistracted\u201d and \u201cemotionally closed-off\u201d, a top Perthshire school has warned.\nHaven Bridge Academy in Fife welcomed Iain Kerr, a former head teacher at Perth Grammar, to give a briefing on the debate.\nMr Kerr, himself a former teacher, said it was possible to predict the effect of a classroom ban on distractedness with tablets and smartphones.\nTexting affects pupils in classrooms, he explained, because it stops them paying attention to their teacher and distracting them with a bigger part of their attention is on a phone.\nHe said pupils worry about what social media is saying about them in class. In some cases, he added, phones could lead pupils to feel \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cisolated\u201d in the moment.\n\u201cIt is a necessary evil,\u201d he said. \u201cThe evidence is that science texts are more powerful than school text books in raising student achievement in science \u2013 but students don\u2019t have access to the science texts.\n\u201cSo, to be able to see those texts on their phone gives them something relevant.\u201d\nMr Kerr explained that the findings, which were \u201cperhaps not surprising,\u201d only affect a small number of pupils. \u201cBut some students do get access to them in lessons,\u201d he added.\n\u201cBeing told not to put them on has no great impact.\n\u201cBut not having them in is not going to solve the problem.\n\u201cUsing the same devices is distracting. You could introduce a Skype link but that would become distracting.\n\u201cA banned phone would only be for a short while.\n\u201cIf a year 10 student can\u2019t be there, teachers will bring in someone who can be paired with them.\n\u201cIf a student asked for an academic statement to be emailed, you should suggest that I don\u2019t send them an email because it would be less motivating.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask for your email and that you text instead.\u201d\nMr Kerr explained that teachers could monitor pupil use of computers or phones in class and hold the devices in a tray.\nHe pointed out that government guidelines made clear that pupils should use school-owned devices only. But he said digital citizenship efforts should also aim to educate pupils about the use of electronic devices at home, where they are likely to be more developed.\n\u201cWe see what is possible if parents use tools and apps on the school website \u2013 any kid can see that. It can prevent abuse,\u201d he said.\nMinister for schools and lifelong learning David Stewart welcomed Mr Kerr\u2019s visit to Canongate to discuss concerns about using technology in classes.\n\u201cAward-winning teaching has always been at the heart of the way we educate and I would like to see more of it in schools and colleges in Scotland as we modernise our learning environment,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Daryl Horgan's two goals put Hibs well on course for a first Edinburgh derby win in six attempts\nDaryl Horgan scored twice as Hibs underlined their recent upturn in form with a 2-1 derby victory over Hearts.\nThe midfielder's brace, both from inside the penalty area, put Brendan Rodgers' side on the brink of the Scottish Cup semi-finals.\nHowever, a late goal from the impressive Nikola Kalinic would not extinguish the sense of Scottish Cup regret for Inverness's travels to Easter Road.\nIn the league, the Trotters' hopes of survival became a distant memory, but it was Hibs' first win in four games and second in the last three.\nHibs this week are being tipped to shine at Hampden for the League Cup final in two weeks' time, and then head to face Celtic in the Premiership on the final day in May.\nThis was an impressive performance from the visitors from Easter Road, and they move up to fourth place in the table.\nWatched by the boisterous Easter Road crowd, and Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster, the home side failed to muster a shot on target until late in the first half.\nWage row takes toll\nIt was an afternoon of mixed emotions for head coach Robbie Neilson and the Hearts board as the club's wage row with Jorge Jesus continued.\nWhile the Colombian put pen to paper on a new four-year contract on Friday, his compatriot, Jordi Berrio, was out on loan at newly-promoted St Mirren until the end of the season.\nThe players held a minute's applause for Berrio, who had a fine season at Tynecastle, and he applauded them with his own gestures when he came off at half-time.\nMeanwhile, Hearts have activated an option under Jesus' new contract to keep Berrio at Tynecastle until 2020.\nAn interim head coach in Neilson does not have the personnel to seriously probe his options over the summer. Many fans would love to see former Hibernian midfielder John McGlynn brought in on an interim basis.\nJujhar Khaira's quick feet and skill saw him create Hearts' only effort on target, but it was Martyn Waghorn's third-minute header that appeared to signal this would be a nervy contest.\nHibernian were lively and organised at the back, but broke with speed and purpose when the chance came, with Jason Cummings spinning a neat turn to lay off a pass to Horgan. He was taken down by Hearts' Darren Barr and Stuart Kettlewell and David Gray ensured the sending-off.\nIt looked like adding to Hearts' misery, but Horgan made no mistake from the spot to score his 20th goal of the season.\nThe Polish Under-21 international also struck a post from a Charlie Mulgrew cross.\nHibernian players show their respect to Jason Cummings on his return to Tynecastle\nThe second half was not without chances for Hearts. Vladimir Romanov, who owns Hearts, gave the players a major boost by finally promoting fans' voting rights into the club's boardroom, but questions over the Grecians' direction will continue to dog a season which has seen a lot of promise followed by little reward.\nStill, it was a strong display by the hosts from the off and when Kalinic clipped an effort over from just outside the area, the home crowd had a slight sense of relief.\nThere was another similar threat within seconds, but this time Kellett was on hand to clear the ball in the low and difficult air.\nIt was a tension-packed finale, and when Waghorn's powerfully-struck free-kick crept in to the bottom corner, Hearts were playing for a place in next season's Scottish Cup semi-finals.\nBut the wasteful Kalinic would have the final say with a back-post header moments later.\nMatch Facts\nThe victory was Hibernian's first in five derby encounters this season - their last four victories were all at Tynecastle - but they have now beaten Hearts at Tynecastle three times this season.\nAll of the Premiership title challengers this season have lost more league games away than at home and Hibs sit 12th on home results.\nKalinic's late goal is Hibs' first in the league for five games - their last victory away came against Motherwell on 5 February.\n", "label": "machine"}

I knew what this was all about.\nSo we started talking, and in my newfound knowledge of history, there\u2019s a long family connection between Hamill and Emmett Topeka.

{"text": "By Corinne Nichols\nBergen County is home to one of the most diverse student populations in the state. As more of the state's students come to communities like ours from New York City and other regions, schools, teachers and parents are confronting the issue of equity. These challenges will take collaboration and cooperation among educators, school leaders, parents and the communities in which we live to ensure all children can succeed.\nAccess to a strong foundation for critical academic success was a central issue in my interview with Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin on the topic of state funding of K-12 education. The issue of adequate funding is not new and it should not be used by many pundits as justification for opting out of the state's Common Core academic standards.\nAs a history teacher in a public high school in Morris County, I know that if my students are confused about what they are taught, my job as their teacher is much harder. As they know less and less, they take on a question about students who are significantly different than themselves.\nIt all starts with an effective beginning. We have to instill in students that trusting one another and respect one another are important. My students aren't college ready in all areas, so I look for ways to engender trust. I focus on the little things like the character traits my students are likely to use in the future and interact with them in ways that instill a sense of confidence and responsibility.\nI feel like I am making a difference. The students who become sophomores in the school have shown some improvement in standardized math and English tests compared to when they began my classes. One student is on a college path to continue her studies and has not dropped out of my classes. I feel I am making a real difference.\nCraig Coughlin launched the Thought Revolution initiative to work with educators and students to bring about transformation and reform in our education system. The governor has gone as far as to call this an \"educational revolution.\"\nA teacher is supposed to instill hope. Our classrooms are where all of our students connect to the broader world. Our culture includes immigrants from distant lands and foster kids. My students come from poverty and from families with complicated histories. Without my goal of equipping each and every student with the tools and confidence to succeed, my students never would have the tools and confidence to lead.\nTeachers' education - no matter how hard or mediocre or bad - is part of our history. Educators train and work to enable students to make sense of the world. And today, we're meeting the difficult challenges that our country faces - from the economic challenges of the work force and educational gap to the enormous transformations that technology has brought to our world. It's not enough just to train and work to provide our students with a solid foundation in math and literacy; we must be willing to challenge students and test them to achieve mastery and growth.\nDoing our job can be challenging. One seventh-grade student asked me why his mom would want to speak to a black woman. But he was a good student who never showed too much interest in joining a gang. I taught him about the woman's personal story of struggle and desistance, as well as the events in her life that led her to where she was today.\nI taught him to project beyond the threshold of achievement, and I asked him to identify an achiever from his history class and find out where he came from. I listened carefully, paused and waited for one of his classmates to speak. And then he did. \"That is Dr. Maya Angelou!\" he said. He had read the civil rights leader's poem \"Still I Rise\" as he learned what it meant to be a woman of color.\n\"Ms. Nichols,\" he said, \"sometimes it's hard to see someone like me in a room filled with smart people with books and other people who don't have anything to do but study. It took me a little while to catch on that maybe my story isn't that different.\"\nThis is the story I should tell my students and more and more teachers must teach it to their students. I believe students need to see educators as role models. They need to be brave enough to give students a chance to see themselves and others - no matter how poorly they may be performing - to be difference makers who can become part of their classrooms.\nWe can succeed if we collaborate.\nMorris County schools Superintendent Corinne Nichols is executive director of Advance New Jersey.\nBookmark NJ.com/Opinion.

Some states have restrictive requirements on video surveillance software and technology -- California, Florida, New York and Illinois -- while other states don't have strict rules, the groups noted.\nThe New York Law School has opened an investigation into the San Diego Police Department's use of facial recognition technology. As part of that investigation, the law school reviewed police reports and past press releases and found that the San Diego Police Department was exercising restraint on its facial recognition projects, CNET News previously reported.\nOn Thursday, Amazon also announced its new Aurora program, which expands its custom hardware and AI capabilities with Amazon Web Services.\n\"We're introducing Amazon Aurora, a powerful new image and speech recognition service, in collaboration with an ecosystem of leading third-party solutions providers,\" James Hamilton, director of Amazon Machine Learning for Amazon Web Services, said in a statement on the company's website. \"With Amazon Aurora, law enforcement, publishing, enterprise and small businesses can augment existing solutions or create entirely new ones with greater efficiencies, performance and cost savings.\"\nThe Aurora program allows customers to take advantage of existing security camera, microphones and flight and navigation tools on the AWS cloud, without any hosting costs.

{"text": "Stoned on the inside of an Allentown coffee shop, perhaps 70 miles away from his Pike County post office job, Steelton native Brandon Flood thought the ghost from his past had perhaps returned.\nDressed in a red cap and the black scarf around his neck that is commonly worn by those with past convictions, the 41-year-old former turnstile jumper whispered, \u201cGuns, meth, crack, Crips, Bloods.\nHe related that in the late 1990s, he was one of 11th graders at Steelton-Highspire High School when he was pulled out of gym class to testify before a court hearing.\nFlood told of how a sheriff's deputy handed him a state-issued pink slip and door mat, and gave him directions to the family homestead where his grandfather had just been killed by a drive-by shooter.\nThen he walked out into the township police station to pick up his belongings from his grandfather's funeral.\n\u201cI didn't have nothing. I just sat in the car. I was ready to quit. I felt like I lost everything.\u201d\nHe considered himself the poster child for Pittsburgh\u2019s prison industrial complex: One of the city\u2019s thousands of low-level drug users and dealers.\nIt only took a few tries behind bars, however, to turn him around, and Flood is still singing the praises of an old friend who got him back in the game.\nFormer Pastor Jeff Donaldson of Second Baptist Church in Pittsburgh, when you were a heroin addict and competing with every other coked-up crook in town for a tight crowd, would help you make the transition out.\nFlood said Donaldson helped him buy a laptop, and first thing in the morning in his first prison stint in 2001, changed all of the phone numbers and email addresses.\n\u201cThen I got sober at Second Baptist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018this is it, I can do this.\u2019\u201d\nThe turning point came in 2005 when he went to Allentown to take in the funeral services for Thomas Hart, his 18-year-old cousin who had been killed.\nThat night, he got cleaned up, and took the train back to Steelton, where his old friend, Donaldson, had asked him to come back and start his \u201cCareers Through Faith\u201d program at the Allentown church.\nDonaldson, 58, a former Phoenixville borough councilman and prison chaplain, said he was hoping to use the program to help ex-offenders find jobs, since he figured once they were out of prison, an introduction to the church and some basic skills would be easy to come by.\nHe figured Flood would bring his rough-hewn build to a church that had so many community members who shared the most severe of personal setbacks, and considered himself a natural fit.\n\u201cI'm not going to be the best in the world,\u201d said Flood, who told Donaldson what he envisioned for his future. \u201cBut I'm going to make it easier for them (the ex-convicts) to come and do it.\u201d\nOr, at least, easier than giving them an easy path to prison.\n\u201cHe's dealt with everything you can imagine,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cWhat he was doing was many, many steps removed from any normal person. But what he's done for the individuals that have come through and have benefited from his program are remarkable.\u201d\nFlood has also now been a community cop for five years, sharing his office with another Pike County squad that oversees the county DUI court.\nThat pair was recently named to the Humane Animal Welfare Society of Pennsylvania national board of directors.\nNow, he has turned his almost-70-hour-a-week outreach work into a reentry- program through which he assists those coming home from prison on probation or parole.\n\u201cWe've got a big problem in Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania is not alone,\u201d Flood said. \u201cA lot of people are getting in trouble before they even get to prison.\n\u201cAnd it's going to take a mass approach, it's going to take a community approach. And the community people need to step up to the plate and say, \u2018We're tired of people coming home with no job. We're tired of people coming home without their kids.\u2019\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Britney Spears is reportedly being forced into a hospital against her will. The longtime pop star has been hospitalized for a reportedly mental health issue, and an insider claims that her family had absolutely no idea about what was going on.\nAccording to a Wednesday, April 17, report by Radar Online, Britney Spears is on a well-stocked psychiatric ward that supposedly has a lot of doors and cameras, giving doctors their footage of Britney as they diagnose her.\nSources tell the outlet that Britney had received contact lenses and was being treated at UCLA Medical Center, but only after doctors told her she was \u201cunfit to be released.\u201d Spears has reportedly been on the mental health ward for over a week, but is keeping silent about the incident and told her mom, Lynne Spears, not to let anyone hear what is going on because it\u2019s \u201ctoo much\u201d and she doesn\u2019t want her worried.\n\u201cBritney isn\u2019t well, she is not feeling well.

{"text": "By Jonah Goldberg\nThe 2016 presidential election was more than a choice between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. The two candidates also included two very different visions of the U.S. economy and society. Hillary would have further expanded and intensified the economic model of the postwar period \u2014 a few years of bad times followed by more modest growth \u2014 while Trump would have imposed a new model for the future.\nMany voters felt disenfranchised with the traditional Democratic model, in which lots of people got rich, while many others watched their incomes decline.\nSome of the family incomes haven\u2019t declined much lately, though. According to IRS data, for example, in 2016 the richest 1 percent of Americans enjoyed almost a 10 percent increase in their net worth while the bottom 99 percent lost $800 billion in net worth. The richest fifth of Americans have doubled their net worth in the last 30 years to $10.2 trillion, while the poorest 40 percent have lost around $400 billion.\nClinton, moreover, voted against the George W. Bush tax cuts. Trump, however, thinks that the Bush tax cuts were a mistake \u2014 and so was the Affordable Care Act (the president never really explained why he decided to give his nominee for secretary of health and human services a marching order to gut those Affordable Care Act provisions), and he plans to double down on his promise to cut taxes and make America great again.\nBernie Sanders, on the other hand, wants the government to make all Americans\u2019 lives better, while investing heavily in infrastructure. He also wants to substantially increase the minimum wage, an idea whose support has been declining, and wants to roll back many of the corporate protections and employer mandates in the Affordable Care Act.\nAt first glance, the two Democrats seem to have very different views of how the economy should be managed, with Bernie envisioning a European-style welfare state and a lot of red-state Democratic voters looking to the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress to make things better.\nHe also turns out to be quite rich. At age 85, he took in $18.3 million in 2016, the year he received the longest-lasting notice of his Supreme Court nomination. The trustee overseeing his affairs reported that his total net worth rose from $31.4 million to $37.7 million that year. To put that figure in perspective, the national median household income was $59,200.\nThe trust also reported that his net worth surged from $61.7 million to $96.3 million in 2015. No one will dispute that Bernie is rich \u2014 and that his friends and family are overjoyed by his high earnings. His first wife gave $5.75 million to charity in 2016, his second wife gave $2.8 million, and he wrote the single largest check in history, $444,383, to the Clinton Foundation.\nOn the other hand, Sanders is also concerned about inequality, which explains why he is a champion of raising the minimum wage, fighting corporate America and taxing the rich. Critics will point out that he is prepared to abandon his signature tenets if Democrats retake Congress and can put any of them into law.\nContrast those views with those of Donald Trump, whose wealth has quadrupled over the last 20 years, which is precisely why he wants to cut taxes for everyone \u2014 including those who benefit most from the tax cuts he opposes and is unable to pass into law.\nHis net worth rose from $2.8 billion to $8.5 billion in 2016, most of which came from share buybacks and dividends in which managers buy their own stocks to boost their earnings. He also owns real estate and golf courses, which are good investments, but not on a global scale and should be derided for that reason.\nAlso, it turns out that Trump paid no taxes on any income for at least three decades after the Internal Revenue Service had raised concerns about his accounting.\nUnlike Sanders, however, Trump also wants to give Americans a lot more. First, he wants to dramatically increase infrastructure spending. Second, he wants to massively cut taxes on the rich, to the point where he would be at least 50 percent better off than the minimum wage or unemployed American workers. Third, he wants to eliminate taxes for all but the highest-income estates and eliminate the estate tax completely. In all, he plans to cut taxes on the rich by $7.6 trillion over 10 years. If the economy grows slightly faster than currently expected, all that tax money will translate into a boom for the entire economy.\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 although the stock market may not be thrilled with yet another round of big tax cuts for the rich. That doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Bernie Sanders is rich, and Donald Trump is rich. Congratulations, Bernie.\nJonathan Zimmerman teaches history at NYU.\n", "label": "machine"}

Virgin Trains will withdraw its trackside operator platform tickets by the end of the year because they are worse than sector standard.\nButler believes the earliest route could be integrated with running a ticketing airline at Birmingham\u2019s central station to offer passengers shorter walkways, and a faster overall boarding process.\nHe also says that lack of seating at London Waterloo could be fitted to platform D, and that the seats could be fast-tracked at designated stations throughout the network.\nPaul Plummer, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cRather than offering a segregated segregated regime for \u2018travellers\u2019 with disabilities, Virgin\u2019s preferred strategy will be to tinker with segregation by \u2018blurring the lines\u2019 on the platforms themselves in order to create obstacles to full use for disabled passengers.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Ohio Lottery is mulling the rollout of a mobile and online game service aimed at more aggressively reaching technology-savvy players -- even as the agency works to get a state law approved to expand sales online to players in real-time.\nThe agency on Monday announced it had entered into an agreement with Ceridian, a major Ohio payroll processing company, to develop software that could include an iLottery, a mobile application that would allow players to play games directly from their smartphones and tablets. A draft e-sports game would be similar to the state lottery's existing e-sports portal.\nThe news was announced at Ohio Lottery headquarters in downtown Cleveland.\n\"We have a great deal of potential technology opportunities and digital platforms which we're going to look at,\" said Gary Carr, the agency's executive director, at a morning presentation. \"This is a very important tool for us that we're looking at developing in the near future.\"\nCeridian will submit a bid to the Ohio Lottery by May 1 for the job.\nCarr said the platform could be online by the fall. The contract with Ceridian could be worth about $1 million, he said.\nThe announcement came on the first day of spring break for many area school districts, which were again hit this year with a three-day closure because of an electronic bus fault that made buses unable to reach and from school. Carr said it's been hard to get out in such weather, and the agency's budget is tight.\n\"A new contract would require a new initiative, and we want a new initiative, so we're looking at a variety of new initiatives,\" Carr said. \"Technology makes that possible. Technology does make it possible for us to experiment with new products and new players.\"\nBut he also noted that as agencies like the lottery adopt new technology, state revenue -- which helps fund schools and other agencies -- continues to shrink.

{"text": "There\u2019s a new tax on spectrum that Ottawa is levying with such vigour that its effect on the country\u2019s wireless industry may be as bad as the recently announced expropriation of the Maple Group\u2019s three Maple Airwaves network assets.\nRogers, Telus and Bell \u2014 all of which lobbied to retain ownership of the 600 megahertz spectrum they had acquired in the 2010 auction \u2014 are taking Ottawa to court in an effort to block the tax on wireless companies of more than $3.5 billion.\nThe government seized the spectrum in its October auction of spectrum licenses for unlicensed use, a corporate jungle in which the government does not claim any tax jurisdiction.\nBut under its new Broadband Policy announced in November, the government sought spectrum taxes from all players in the auction, including the three big networks. The tax came about because the government discovered that all four companies that bought the spectrum had collected a total of $3.87 billion in capitalization and operating expenditures over the previous five years. All that growth in net profits \u2014 as Rogers CEO Nadir Mohamed liked to say \u2014 came at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.\nThe one big winner from the auction was Public Mobile. The phone company \u2014 a virtual phone company now unable to expand its network, due to its need to pay taxes \u2014 paid $947.6 million for the license.\nAccording to Mr. Mohamed and others, the policy is working \u2014 if for no other reason than the great show of warfare it is generating. Last week, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall was asked at a press conference how Harper\u2019s policy hurt the three big wireless firms. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to see that one Saskatchewan company won\u2019t have to pay taxes on its gains from the auction that are likely three other companies,\u201d he replied. The same is true in Alberta, where one big big wireless firm, Wind Mobile, did well.\nOne problem with the public figures who say the government\u2019s policy has benefited the industry is that they seem not to think it is at stake.\nWhen Ottawa moved in November to implement a spectrum tax, Mr. Mohamed said the policy would cost the industry $3.5 billion and, perhaps two months later, the head of Telus, Darren Entwistle, said the tax would force the company to reduce the amount of spectrum they planned to use, reducing competition.\nYet the Conservatives are not backing down. And given the size of the tax, the long bureaucratic history of the tax, Mr. Entwistle\u2019s claim that his company would have to \u201cforce the loss of services\u201d to consumers is a conclusion unsupported by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\nA decision is due from the appeal court this week on whether or not Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp. can continue to challenge the tax. Other mobile giants are expected to join the fight. In an ironic twist, the two small players with the most on the line \u2014 Public Mobile and Mobilicity \u2014 are the ones that are being most regulated, with extensive subsidy programs and other special tax breaks.\nAs before the auction, Ottawa is now seeking taxes on big Canadian wireless firms. That is not playing fair with the others, if indeed it is playing fair. The latter companies will now be blocked from using their own revenues to build network capacities, including as a source of financing for future network construction. There is no fairness involved.\nAs well, the tax comes at the expense of consumers: Small firms will have to pay more to expand service that consumers already have been promised. Do we really want politicians to judge who can afford to spend what to build next-generation networks?\nThe bigger, more powerful, companies will have more to lose than the beginning players. You can bet these taxes will show up in price increases of some wireless products, including through increased taxes.\nIn some countries, the policy has spread widely, helping explain the broadband divide in which the Canadians languish. The tax in those countries says, in effect, to U.S. tech buyers, \u201cIf you want high speed, you must pay more.\u201d In Canada, the tax flies in the face of the government\u2019s own pledge to promote competition in a competitive market. Small companies already receive too much free tax from Ottawa. Now it\u2019s ratepayers who will have to pay for the \u201cfairness\u201d of Ottawa\u2019s policy.\n", "label": "machine"}

This is true of the residents of Pindi and Murree, as well as the airport authorities in Karachi and Islamabad. However, it\u2019s not only the locals who have to deal with the real problems of Pakistan. With growing extremism and terrorist activities, international tourist destinations are also witnessing extreme difficulties. One of such is Pakistan\u2019s tourism industry. In recent years, most popular tourist destinations have faced severe restrictions and many have become temporary or close to closing down.\nAlexander Reynolds, a British blogger, recently visited Pakistan and highlighted the real problems that this country faces. A child\u2019s paradise with scenic mountains, valleys, valleys with waterfalls, serene beaches, warm sunny beaches, river flood plains, rivers, valleys and mountains, Pakistan has many beautiful scenery. However, many differences have sparked a grudge in the hearts of those who cannot visit the country. Here are three real issues that are haunting the tourist destination:\n1. Competition\nIn a country with only seven major cities, the top tourist destinations face severe difficulties of competitiveness due to lack of planning and development. However, \u201cAt places like Beachside Karachi, Gulberg and Lahore\u201d \u2013 as Alex Reynolds put it \u2013 \u201canyone wanting to come cannot afford to do so\u201d. Furthermore, there is a perception that Pakistani tourists are no good. But the same doesn\u2019t apply to Europe\u2019s tourist \u2013 so why not Pakistan?\n2. Visas\nIn addition to getting killed by small arms and bombs, Pakistan also suffers due to inadequate documentation of tourist visa application. Visitors to Pakistan from abroad are subjected to long wait times, multiple forms, minimal readmissions and high rejections. This also affects quality of people arriving at the airport with good intentions who later become suicidal after being rejected by various authorities.\n3. Ghareebis\nNot only the travel to these real problems are accompanied by false accusations, there is a huge threat of drug-related tourism in Pakistan. Almost every such place attracts drug addicts: Pindi, Murree, Hunza (Naxalite area), Poonch, Ghalibabad, Mansehra and other areas are quite frequented by drug addicts and alcoholics. It takes to like 500 amphetamine units to obtain the desired calm. All these places are identified as drug tourism spots by international media.

{"text": "Sometimes, it feels like we\u2019re doing the groundbreaking and breaking new ground: Pushing boundaries in sustainable agriculture; taking on corporate secrecy in the 1980s. But sometimes, the mark of progress isn\u2019t entirely positive\u2013like when microeconomics professor Robert Bauck of the University of California Irvine recently concluded that workplaces that allow remote working employees will eliminate jobs.\nThat\u2019s a concern for companies that allow remote working since 44% of its employers already offer some kind of flexible work arrangement, according to Glassdoor.org. Interestingly, it\u2019s not just workers who think so. Two out of three hiring managers say that remote workers put their company at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d\u2013as do 36% of U.S. businesses.\nBut while it\u2019s true that many companies don\u2019t offer any type of on-site workforce, there\u2019s been another ongoing trend that gives employees more (or at least fewer) working options, and that\u2019s the offshoring of jobs.\nThere is a strong societal connection between people who are trapped in one place and their near-detached work styles, says Hindi Rabin, a sociologist at the University of Washington. She cites the example of one woman who managed eight or nine jobs before she died. As her declining health dictated, she often worked a few days a week in food preparation or other unglamorous jobs while she performed manual labor and researched possible new jobs\u2013but often couldn\u2019t take new offers for fear she\u2019d outlive them.\nWhile that work-life split may work for her, it\u2019s not conducive to most work environments.\nSome 41% of working adults lack the flexibility to be able to work more than one job, according to a recent study by FlexJobs, which discovered that many don\u2019t even have time to fit in adequate sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a constant state of exhaustion,\u201d says Natalie Cano, director of corporate development at FlexJobs.\nHow does that affect their workplace performance? Even if they can work well at their primary job, they\u2019re likely to rely on a less skilled, hands-on part-time employee for short-term assignments and team projects. And that\u2019s not good for their career trajectory.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The inevitable postal cut-off dates are just around the corner. Whether you put an ear in your pocket, or pull out the entire contents of your purse to deliver a single letter, sorting and delivery, like everything else digital, is going to get increasingly more automated. As a consequence, the sale of outdated and inefficient tools for communications is bound to shrink.\nThe most visible signs of this impending demise already have emerged. A postal day-pass window is dying a slow death, with messaging platforms supplanting pagers, faxes and e-mail for routine correspondence. American Postal Service (USPS) has already shut down about 4,600 filing cabinets, offering savings of about one-tenth, but the last letter in the box still gets delivered. In Europe, postal assets are being looked at for monetisation through postal subsidiaries in countries as diverse as the Nordic countries, Ireland and Poland.\nLetters and other large pieces of communication in particular will need to quickly adapt. As the hardware that delivers everything declines, it's inevitable that those services will also be consolidated. But the transition happens gradually and increasingly becomes almost invisible when thrown into the paradoxical mix of growth.\nThat being said, there is something else going on at the confluence of this dramatic erosion of publishing and consumption, along with new digital shifts and emergence of new services, like payments, identification and possibly even identity. It is the rise of machine learning, and specifically artificial intelligence.\nAs output moves out of actual humans and into artificial ones, and as human modalities slowly cease to survive, we will see a number of conversions over the next year or two.\nFirst, the inefficiency of distribution is going to be re-engineered. This is not just a cost issue, but also one of how organisations manage time. First, we will see the replacement of ones and zeros. E-mail and faxes are all about sending out orders and delivering them. As the public ends its dependence on those modes, we will increasingly find ourselves with presorted messages: \u201cIt's your birthday too, Mark, and we'd like to send you the card tomorrow too, if you'd like to grab your own, or print one out in the app for the hassle of it.\u201d And while tomorrow's holiday cards will not actually appear, we will be dealing with revenue objects rather than non-sales entities.\nSecond, these things are going to disappear. We are to start seeing them as far back as text. The disappearing character is already being built into the new Instant Messaging (IM) platforms like KakaoTalk. New automated callers are going to actively move away from the time-consuming automated chat as our life becomes more automated and communication \u2014 and even custody \u2014 is less associated with handing around a single message.\nBut just as we will soon be making self-driving cars, we will soon start building artificial images. Facial-recognition systems already look up people\u2019s faces using various image databases. We are to start going that route in all current public networks. One day soon, we will no longer have to send anything.\nAnd digital objects might soon be bringing a second revolution. Simply tapping to get through an app will soon become a thing of the past. Universal passwords and alternative devices that never take a selfie will become important components of public online identities.\nThese are just a few experiences that are coming, as heaps of these transformations are the result of machine learning \u2014 from which all other transformations flow.\nWe may be starting the process of changing behaviour, but this is far from being the end. We are just at the dawn of some serious technology reshaping the business of communication and writing. And we will see lots of new products and technology over the next 12 months.\n\u2014 New York Times\nElliot Noss is the chief executive of Whisper, a platform for anonymous social media.

I am always asking questions on what they did that helped them not be the player that the offense was picking on.\u201d\nToward the end of the 2018 baseball season, the Red Ants had to find a new starting pitcher when Tiberio Zamora had to move up to baseball after pitching as a freshman.\nVivas also made sure that the defense continued its excellence, and so far the team and the players are doing a great job of adapting.\n\u201cIt is something I have told them,\u201d Vivas said. \u201cIn order to be a good team it does not matter who is pitching or who is hitting. No pitcher is going to shut out the opposing team. If we score as many runs as possible, we are going to win, but it is the defense that is going to win games.\u201d\nThe Red Ants opened the season as a top-ranked defense in The Monitor\u2019s preseason poll, finishing the season as the area\u2019s second best team, with 11 of 12 remaining games this season against teams that finished 2018 in the playoffs.\nAs the younger players get better, they are working on the simple things, like the launch angle and step placement on the ball, is what Dominante Hernandez, a pitcher/infielder said the Red Ants are focused on.\n\u201cWe started last year the same way we are doing this year,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe always try to be a strong defensive team and do everything that we can to win and I think this year we will be the same. We just have to improve our pitching and get it right every game.\n\u201cAs a team I think we are very focused and we are doing the right things.\u201d\nSalvador Urzua, pitcher/infielder also feels like the team is coming together.\n\u201cWe are doing really well,\u201d Urzua said. \u201cWe are having good practices and we are putting in a lot of effort and it is starting to pay off. The harder we practice, the luckier we get.\n\u201cWe are working hard and the team is bonding. We have a strong team chemistry and we love to compete.\u201d\nThe third-year senior class is ranked first in all of Hidalgo County with $56,806 in scholarships.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Harry has an addiction problem. I don\u2019t really know how many Fortnite addicts there are out there, but the prince is in the right general range to abuse an addictive game like this.

If it is legitimate for companies to collect data, then I understand the entitlement it provides them. Yet he was also speaking about his own need to play computer games which, by virtue of his position, can appeal to a wider audience, but also brings risk to his ability to function.\u201d\nGamesBeat speaker Susan Yum says the Prince has a valid point. The point is that nearly all kids have some degree of gaming obsession or impatience with society today. Yum points out that 55 percent of American families have cell phones, and 37 percent have video games.\n\u201cThere are signs of a structural failure in our society about what to do with kids,\u201d said Yum, cofounder of INSTRUCT International, a nonprofit organization that helps educate youngsters on how to be successful in the workplace and to counter social and emotional problems.\n\u201cFortnite is amazing as a product,\u201d Yum said. \u201cEvery child should be playing video games.

A gaming addiction manifests itself in the way you think and feel and feel as though you are wired into a false reality. \u201d\nHere\u2019s Prince Harry making some grim remarks.\nEileen Kanfer, a longtime Apple executive who is joining Uber as its new executive in charge of internet connectivity and privacy, also had some tough words. \u201cI can only say, when I have kids I want them to take hobbies and things that they\u2019re good at, because I don\u2019t want to push tech on them.\u201d\nSome child psychologists agree with Kanfer\u2019s view.

Credit:Glenn Hunt \"On the back of their club championships and federal successes, they were a case of being a totally different side to the one that finished seventh at the FFA Cup final last year. But again, the Dolphins have had their second year under former SCG first-grade coach Robyn Murat's tutelage and on Saturday, that coach's son, Jordan, steered his side to a narrow but telling 4-3 win over Victorian Women's National Premier League 1 rivals Caulfield East which has them squarely in the FFA Cup quarter-finals. It's the second consecutive season Murat's side has won their section of the VNPL1 and they will take on Reading Women on the same weekend after that draw was made on Friday afternoon. And that's where potential shapes as the biggest issue for the Dolphins. They'll have their sites set on the semi-finals and have a huge rivalry with Victory, which they won the round against 3-2 on March 31. Victory are looming as a threat again this year but the opportunity to play against the reigning Premiers is a tantalising one and one they're going to need to take advantage of if they are to advance. \"We are in the next round of the FFA Cup and it's been our long shot after a disappointing season last year,\" Tubbs said.\n\"It's our first game of the season and we want to make sure we're in it through to the end. As the first round gets closer and tighter, you can really see the boys growing and getting better as the season goes on. \"Reading are a very good side this year. Their coach is a former FFA A-League first-class player, she has done very well with the club and its supporters. \"The first few rounds, it's been a tough opening block, so we've set ourselves some targets.\" Murat hasn't rested on the laurels and she hasn't made sweeping changes to try and build on last year's grand final appearance. The biggest motivation is to make sure her young girls keep their heads in the sun and engage with the various sports and other avenues on offer. Murat's young girls have been dominant in the VNPL1 and recently won a round against defending Premiers Victory 3-2. Their results may be falling short of Victory, but it's taken them a decade to build the culture Murat wants on the synthetic Socceroo Park pitch. She is a meticulous planner and student of the game but Murat's true approach came in the last 12 months, first through a focus on the girls at Soccerstar, the girls who train in VLN3 at Ascot Vale and the mid-fielders in the lower age groups, often willing to step up an age level. She's also forging close relationships with national team coaches, most notably Socceroos legend Hope Powell. It's taken a few seasons but Murat is now on top of her game and the girls appear to be in great hands for the future.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "ALSO READ: Montreal's settlement threat or fake boom?\nThis week, almost 200 housing proponents, developers, brokers and local experts met to figure out how to settle disputes involving mixed-use and multi-family development projects.\nLed by Urban Partnership Montreal, a local nonprofit that promotes and collaborates on housing issues, the meeting, organized by the Council of Montreal Urban Communities, is a part of the city\u2019s ongoing effort to continue to build new affordable housing for Montrealers.\n\u201cA significant number of Montrealers are experiencing housing instability and displacement today,\u201d said Gilles Oltmanns, director general of Urban Partnership Montreal, during an open house on Thursday. \u201cFor most, this is a very complex, challenging and ambiguous issue, and managing the impacts can be very difficult.\u201d\nUrban Partnership Montreal members described myriad and seemingly infinite ways of dealing with housing inequalities \u2014 ranging from an integration plan to bring families into the mix to new grassroots groups formed to advocate for more mixed-use projects and homestead communities, where families are the majority of residents in one location.\nThe council\u2019s three-part approach to investigating housing issues is to work with local partner organizations for advocacy; host town-hall style events for different communities; and hold focus groups with consumers to determine the best way of dealing with the complicated issues.\nCairo Keary, director of research at Urban Partnership Montreal, said on Wednesday it is important to focus on the broad ranges of housing issues being experienced by different residents and try to come up with strategies to bring them together.\n\u201cWe want a framework that everyone can agree on. I don\u2019t want everyone to agree on how much affordable housing should be for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cDifferent people in different areas believe different things about the city and that makes up a diversity of experiences. People need to be more understanding of each other.\u201d\nRELATED: The competition is on to attract the jobs of the future\nAlthough some residents were unhappy that the event was held on the first day of the meeting, Keary said the council was convinced the session would be valuable.\n\u201cYes, there were an overload of people, but we realized that since there\u2019s this complex nature to housing issues, it would be difficult for people to speak to groups and councillors on their own,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to bring people together to talk to each other. It was very clear that people needed to know what are we talking about, what is the scope of the meeting.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Urban Partnership Montreal has worked to identify and present housing solutions to the public. In the past, they organized a roundtable event featuring 20 experts in September 2016 that resulted in a plan to bring 30,000 new affordable apartments to the island in the coming years.\n\u201cDuring these times of homelessness, of trauma, of houses that are repossessed and people living in precarious situations, we want everyone to come together to re-orient the city,\u201d Keary said. \u201c(This meeting) could be a model that could be used in the future.\u201d\nahanes@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/AllyMarissa\n", "label": "machine"}

The employee referral company that matches engineering talent with startups and Fortune 500 companies just raised $35 million from Credit Suisse, with participation from previous investors Rembrandt Venture Partners, New Enterprise Associates, and Accel Partners. The fresh cash will be deployed for recruiting, training, and technology investments.\n\u201c[We] are just starting to embrace a culture of success, where employees are able to take control of their own career with the knowledge, tools, and resources that can help them get there,\u201d Joel Shirley, a Triplebyte founder and cofounder, said. \u201cWe feel strongly that the smart people who can build, deliver, and win in the market need to join us.\u201d\nTriplebyte\u2019s platform \u2014 which officially launches today \u2014 has been live for three years, and has processed more than 250,000 referrals. Today, it has relationships with more than 500 organizations and recruiters. Among its customers are Box, Pandora, Lyft, Thrillist, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Real Madrid, Fin & Ask, and Spotify. Last August, it raised $15 million for its talent acquisition platform.\nLike other referral programs, Triplebyte is far from a pre-packaged employment funnel. It\u2019s designed specifically for employees and professionals looking to freelance, part-time, or pursue a permanent career change. Users create, post, and manage work profiles \u2014 complete with schedule, tasks, and compensation \u2014 on Triplebyte\u2019s sites and apps (including TriHi, List 2 Work, and Top Workers). On the employer side, hiring managers see prospective hires\u2019 profiles and profiles submitted by colleagues. In turn, candidates are shown potential employers, who can then input about job responsibilities and ideal candidates.\nMore specifically, Triplebyte pulls in job listings from near-real-time feeds in publishing sites such as LinkedIn, payoneday.com, and LinkedIn Spark. It also allows profiles to be populated by other Trikey distribution partners such as Toptal, Upwork, and GitHub, and the program tracks job postings from LinkedIn\u2019s hiring database of 1.4 million companies and people on a real-time basis.\nImage Credit: Triplebyte\n\u201cWe work together so we can serve our mutual clients and employees better than ever before,\u201d said Steffan Anderson, CEO of Payoneday and former chief executive of NowThis News. \u201cWhile the job seeker typically provides job information to the hiring manager, we believe that together we can deliver far greater value. We see the majority of employer-job seeker relationships happening more in-person, and one thing that\u2019s clear is that there are far more recruitment methods available than just referrals.\u201d\nTriplebyte\u2019s new funding will be applied towards \u201cadditional talent acquisition initiatives,\u201d it said, adding that it plans to grow the number of full-time staff to more than 125 by 2019, and the number of employees triallocated to development by 10 times.\nTriplebyte competes with Big Fish, openSesame, Gabon, Jobr, Teambite, and BugSense, and unlike the aforementioned startups, Triplebyte is not a formal referral program. (Its competitors leverage companies\u2019 existing internal programs.)\n\u201cWhen we put together our predictions on where staffing will go over the next few years, we know that two key trends will drive it \u2014 talent scarcity and skills mismatch,\u201d Rafaello Pantucci, chief strategy officer at tech recruiting firm Executive Creative and senior adviser to recruiting organization Monster said. \u201cHowever, we\u2019re not sure that these trends will play out as strongly as anticipated. On the whole, we think the market will attempt to discourage employee referrals.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- A man jumped to his death from a five-story Cleveland apartment building Tuesday, and the body of a woman was found on a second-floor balcony.\nIt happened around 3:45 p.m. in the city's Union-Miles District, near the intersection of East 14th Street and St. Clair Avenue.\nWhen Cleveland police officers arrived at the scene, they discovered a man wearing only socks and underwear sitting on the ground next to the apartment building.\n\"When we responded, we found the man laying on the ground partially in the grass area in front of the apartment building,\" said Cleveland Police Sgt. Ali Pillow.\nA resident who saw the aftermath told Fox 8 News they called police while he was getting ready to walk his dog, Whiskers.\n\"The guy said, 'I'm being, like, tackled by people. Let me go to my apartment. Somebody's gonna get me if they have to,'\" said witness Larry Jackson.\nPillow said someone had been yelling at the man, possibly because he was angry with another man living in the apartment complex. The Cleveland Division of Police tells Fox 8 News that the dog's owner, who had been outside with his pit bull and cat, returned to find that the dog had gotten off the balcony and possibly jumped off the balcony.\n\"That dog jumped off the balcony, apparently from a second-floor apartment to the grassy area,\" Pillow said.\nAuthorities said the man later used a rope to catch the dog, and when neighbors called for help, Cleveland police Officer Christopher Waytak made the incredible rescue.\n\"He grabbed the dog by the neck and brought it back up to the grassy area where the guy was sitting,\" said Pillow.\n\"Then after, we heard the emergency police officers were running down to where the dog was and the officer had already stood up there and the dog barked a lot,\" Jackson said.\nPolice say the man did not appear intoxicated. They say they don't yet know why he jumped from the balcony or why it took so long for them to arrive.\nThe dog is being treated for injuries to its front leg. The man's body is at MetroHealth Medical Center, where an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday. Toxicology results are pending.\n", "label": "machine"}

Franco-Franco ties run deep and are woven into the fabric of many Riverina families, with Franco-franco descendents often called upon as interpreters between a different language or culture. \"We have many families in the Wagga area whose ancestors were there (at the school) during the time of the siege,\" said Francina Piuso, Principal of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, based at Bondi Junction. She said the school had worked hard to maintain its connection with families through its Franco-franco club, and in doing so had helped bring \"the best and the best of Franco-franco\" to the school. \"When we first came here in 1999, when the school felt a bit neglected because it was in the shadow of Wagga High and Weetangera College, and hadn't been keeping a lot of alumni around, we thought there must be plenty of old headmistresses who loved being around their students,\" she said. \"The seniors celebrated the Feast of the Three Kings in 2002, and that's the year when the school became a sister school to Ponti International High School in Rome. \"We've gone on to be a bit of an Italian capitol here.\" That relationship has allowed all sorts of Italian students access to the Wagga school and to have French lessons, be they actual or tutored by the sisters, and several accomplished Italian students have taken advantage. That achievement, and the fellowship of the nuns has cemented Ms Piuso's experience in relation to her Franciscan background. \"We take pride in that, in that we have a nun who speaks fluent Spanish, and she spoke once to the Pope,\" she said. \"That's one of the things that is wonderful about the order is, we don't have to resort to English to communicate.\" Unfortunately, one of the most enduring bonds to do with the school's various periods of history ended this year, with a great fire damaging almost every monument - many of which were beloved by generations of families that trekked over the border to the school over the decades. \"It was more of a misfortune than anything else, and the pain and loss for all the families is acutely keen,\" Ms Piuso said.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/Emma.Horn/afea18c8-4c25-4cb3-9e82-5724ebd10dd8.jpg/r3_0_1198_675_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

I would sometimes call friends and complain about it or lament what they were getting that I did not have,\" Trump told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of a roundtable discussion she and senior administration officials hosted Saturday in Johannesburg on women and entrepreneurship at the office of the Clinton Foundation.\nStory Continued Below\nA day earlier, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived in South Africa at the end of a five-nation Africa trip where Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, drew attention for the limited number of women in senior White House roles and for their \"Girls Around the World\" book club, which touted its effort to attract more women to the country's Washington embassy.\nIt was not a week for first lady diplomacy. After Trump's meeting with Malala Yousafzai, the young Pakistani activist for girls' education, Trump tweeted Friday that she and Yousafzai had discussed both the importance of education and children who \"live in violent places.\"\nA day earlier, Trump tweeted her thanks to \"my favorite partner in my great work \u2014 President Trump.\"\nIn March, the first lady sat next to Ivanka Trump and they attended her father's ceremonial swearing-in at the White House and made a quick appearance at his joint press conference with the Portuguese prime minister. When the first lady's staff fielded a tweet wondering whether the first lady would join them on the trip, the spokeswoman emailed an official explanation that made no mention of Trump's role. The White House changed the tweet.\nIvanka Trump has avoided comments on the Russia investigation during her tenure in the West Wing. Some ethics experts have feared she could be a \"shadow president,\" given her position working for her father and with some of the same staff members. She was effectively pushed out of government work shortly after Thanksgiving and has played a more public role since then, speaking publicly about her work with the administration's pet projects on health care and immigration.\nBut in Johannesburg, she said she feels a new sense of freedom.\n\"I think that I was in some ways more limited in terms of what I could do,\" she said. \"I had a very specific role and purpose, and with that obviously was constraints of personal life and of work life, which I think almost any young person would experience. But having that more dramatically reduced scale, I think, is a huge blessing.\"\nShe said she took some advice from the White House chief of staff John Kelly: Turn down social engagements when she can.\n\"My dad knew he couldn't wait for me to go back to New York, and I ended up in the right place, in the right job,\" she said. \"I think the right time is when I feel I've achieved my top professional aspirations and are passionate about other issues.\"\nBut she said her husband did not pass on any advice about Twitter.\nTrump will be the guest of honor Sunday at a gala celebration in London, hosted by British Prime Minister Theresa May's office and attended by many senior U.S. political and diplomatic leaders. Her new senior adviser for entrepreneurship and workforce development, Cody Keenan, will also be there.\nTrump has shown the new role is a space where she can really shine. Despite pleas from migrant advocates that she stay away from an official event showcasing U.S. loan guarantees to develop small business in Africa, she addressed a room full of people wearing a dazzling light blue strapless ball gown and wearing her newly acquired black fingernails.\nTrump joked with the audience about trying in vain to hide her accent. \"But I think the accent also spoke to them. And I thought of my grandma. I found a lot of good people among the Commonwealth, and I was very happy to be part of that tribe.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A former West Coast promoter of weight-loss products was found Friday by a Multnomah County jury to have violated an existing, 2007 Oregon anti-robocall law by placing 468,000 phone calls in violation of the law, violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\nThe jury deliberated for nearly three hours before coming to its verdict in the case against Matt Elton, the defendant. The maximum possible penalty is $200,000 for each violation.\nThe jury awarded another $30,000 in attorney fees to Elton.\nElton had pushed an expensive weight-loss product dubbed \u201cThe ManfromOahu Diet.\u201d Sales representatives were recruited to call people on their cellphones, reaching hundreds, even thousands, of phone customers as they sat at home or in their cars, saying they were calling from \u201cThe Man from Oahu Diet,\u201d according to testimony. Some of the calls were of bomb threats and threats to harm loved ones, jurors heard.\n\u201cHe could have protected his sales associates and consumers by deleting those unwanted phone calls before they were intercepted by any victims,\u201d U.S. District Court Judge Michael Simon said in an email before the trial.\nOregon\u2019s law against robocalls imposes a fine of up to $1,000 per call for consumers who have, or would have, given authorization for such calls, and an additional penalty if the call is made for economic gain, such as advertising a product or causing harmful damage.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General began investigating Elton in 2007 and said in its motion for a civil injunction that he used \u201choaxes, 419 scams, and invoices to dupe and scam consumers into doing whatever Elton wanted them to do,\u201d including providing them with phony access codes to obtain unauthorized access to their accounts.\nU.S. Attorney\u2019s spokesman Bryan Pease said the office was \u201cvery pleased with the verdict today and hopes Elton has taken a clue and will stop any such activity.\u201d\n\u201cWe hope this message will be heard throughout the country,\u201d Pease said.\nElton declined to comment Friday night.\n\u201cWe expect a strong appeal in this case,\u201d said Elton\u2019s attorney, Mark Havertz, in a statement.\nElton was, up until 2013, the first person in the U.S. to be imprisoned and then sentenced under the federal Travel Act of 1966 for breaking a law against using interstate phone calls for economic gain. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, fined $25,000 and placed on three years of supervised release. He was convicted in 2010 by a jury in federal court in Honolulu.\nElton became a fugitive by not appearing for sentencing, but was found and arrested days later by the FBI in Washington, D.C.\nThe jury\u2019s verdict against Elton resulted from a civil lawsuit filed against him by the Oregon Attorney General's office. Elton had pled guilty earlier in 2012 to the continued violation of the telemarketing provisions of the 2004 Telephone Consumer Protection Act. His attorney at the time successfully argued that it was not within the legal jurisdiction of the attorney general\u2019s office to take legal action against Elton because he was out of state, committed in violations out of state, and not subject to any Oregon laws.\nThen-attorney general John Kroger in December 2013 rescinded that agreement and concluded he was correct. Elton returned $1.65 million to Oregon consumers, or nearly $1.7 million in refund and penalties.\nElton\u2019s civil case began Thursday in U.S. District Court in Portland.\nAnother lawsuit \u2013 filed by The Oregonian \u2013 alleged Elton made a luring 7-hour video to market his \"The Man from Oahu Diet,\" and urged Oregonians to take a diet trip to Hawaii. According to the lawsuit, Elton got thousands of calls threatening them with death. No lawsuit has been filed.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "whats-on, things-to-do,\nIt's not so much an art exhibition as a collection. For 17 years, Newcastle-based photographer, Matthew Stinson, has documented the lives of 14 to 21-year-olds in Newcastle, the Hunter and Wollongong in his series, Under Twenty Seven. From stints with the CUB photographer, as well as amateur, professional and service photographer associations, he's spent time on streets and sporting fields photographing predominantly sporting age groups. New portraits of four people from the series were on display at Gallery 2560 from April 12 to 28. The four, alongside 19 work to be showcased, will be there daily until May 5. Related content: The stunning and revealing Nth Street series: 8 Bytes: The Lost Art of The Burden Boys Not surprisingly, Stinson has a unique view of his subjects and the environment they inhabit. \"I'm not a snapper,\" he says. \"I'm a psycho lensman.\" Stinson, who lives in the University of Newcastle courtyard, has an inkling of a thing or two about the demand in Newcastle for resources. Having taken up photography almost 20 years ago, he was never sure how good a job he'd be able to do, or that he'd even found what he was looking for. \"This generation doesn't want to grow up into big upstanding people,\" Stinson says. \"These kids, before they were 14, they weren't well cared for by their parents, or by society, or by country schools. They're still doing drugs, they're still getting in trouble at home. \"That's why the photograph, that I did, is the standout one. You see him with a smile on his face, a tramp with a dustcan. He's a mess. \"To me, that's a chance to see another side of life, that face is really humble.\" For this family portrait, Stinson knew he needed a specific subject. One of the subjects in the series is Elijah Speer, who suffers from Bell's palsy and is almost blind. \"Elijah has fought to keep walking, by ignoring the pain and not letting himself be affected,\" Stinson says. \"For me, as a parent myself, I know that blindsided me at that age. There are still drugs involved in their lives.\" Most of the images are black and white. \"It's like a movie set,\" Stinson says. \"It is made out of chips and twine and cardboard, and random bits of fabric. It is really informal photography. One show alone took 35,000 photographs. I have got them organized into series so they are not random \u2014 not totally random, but not clunk-bang, one after the other. \"I am a fixer. A fixer. A very strong fixer, a fixer. \"There's no solution, in photography or art, unless the work is really flawed, or you've got enough pieces in place, a strong structure, a good approach or something.\" Two more portraits from Stinson's Under Twenty Seven are included in a current exhibition in Newcastle. The collections also will tour the country, with Newcastle appearing in an exhibition at the University of Newcastle in mid-May. Newcastle Gallery will host the rest of the exhibitions, through February 2020. \"Our Newcastle gallery shows the whole nation at once,\" Stinson says.

{"text": "You might never have known what a chat sorter actually is, or had to pay attention if you wanted to know how to create new labels in order to expedite getting e-mails through the system. These ingenious, and hidden Gmail features are fun, useful, and they exist in Gmail with the hope that some of them will strike a chord with you and keep you using the service as much as possible. Keep reading to find out about some of the best hidden Gmail features around.\n1. The notepad-like tool for nailing down words or punctuation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FueoEtQYu9c\nThere are just so many great ideas embedded in every email you receive, or that you've saved yourself for later use. How about a notepad-like tool to cull the rubbish for you? If you use Gmail's built-in note-taking tool, that is. Just save the note itself in the box with the highlighted word for easy access to later.\n2. The \"undo\" button that works all the time\nEmail undo is one of those things I'm totally stuck on. Whether you're spelling out an error or just pausing your messaging on something tricky, the undo button is just as useful as it is easy to use. If your install of Chrome Canary is particularly adventurous and you haven't adjusted your setup yet, there's an easy way to get it working, too.\n3. The clipboard tool that makes emails look like Word documents\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnyQunM-Gql\nAll those coffee dates, or threads, or conversations over beers now look a lot more like Word documents thanks to Google's clever pairing of Gmail with Chrome's clipboard tool. If you've been using Chrome Canary, or another Chromium build of the web browser, you can use it to scribble on things, highlight items, and eventually select them as well.\n4. A delayed reply window that lets you save the thread later\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_n0W5lO7U\nIt's pretty easy to miss stuff if you're busy replying to lots of messages, but Google lets you look at a thread and archive the most important stuff before you answer them. Just enable the extension in the menu at the top of your emails and you're good to go.\n5. The auto-correct system that lets you tweak words to suit your mood\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00Lkwj0rCEW\nI didn't know this one existed until this post went live on Gizmodo, but I love it and will be using it more and more often now. When your Gmail responds to you and seems to think you said something incorrect, just go into your \"at a certain point\" link \u2014 and then click on the stuff you want to stop wording.\n6. The encrypted mailbox that lets you encrypt or decrypt all your messages\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kfh4U78CCo\nIt's easy to forget how easy it is to log into your account, and many of your users might inadvertently manage to do so without so much as knowing it. You can't access Google's secure version of Gmail through your desktop browser but you can download a program that will allow you to do so for instance.\n7. The way the app suggests more than just new e-mails\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWUWqEWbha\nIf you aren't paying too much attention to your inbox or only checking it infrequently at most then you probably don't know how much Gmail learns about you from your real-world behaviour. It can tell you more about the people you correspond with, save you from sending them junk, and suggest new people to follow.\n8. A special kind of dictionary that can help out with the habit of numbering things\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT1ivP6SLOQ\nThere are a lot of situations where you're reading an e-mail and you want to help your recipient by explaining exactly what is, and isn't, meant. This explains the general envelope numbers and receipts you've been getting before.\n9. The giant calendar for editing events\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0zyPsYS-E\nAlthough Google doesn't offer a standalone calendar tool in Gmail, you can create it inside the Google Calendar itself and edit any updates you need to make in the same window.

The name of the provider for the new roof, for example, is not currently known.\nThe city still has to come up with private funding for the construction of the arena, construction of the market, and to cover losses when the old arena closes at the end of the 2016-2017 NBA season, as well as $12 million for relocation of the team to Charlotte if the team were to relocate before then.\n\u201cNothing about that trade-off is a strike against the economic vitality of Indianapolis,\u201d Mayor Hogsett said.\nMost stadium project proponents, such as Notre Dame Stadium Board President Edward Shabovsky, call the new arena a \u201ca civic investment of massive proportions,\u201d that would \u201ccreate thousands of permanent jobs that support other businesses and tax revenues to City Hall that amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, and offer a game-changer in cultural, athletic and economic life of our city.\u201d\nBut other opponents like Mike Gasaway, President of Citizens Opposed to Blasting, are already raising their concerns.\n\u201cThis proposal appears to be backed by sports team owners, state legislators, and perhaps even the Indiana Pacers,\u201d Gasaway said. \u201cHowever, there are several other arena proposals that have failed recently, including proposals that involved higher ticket prices and two additional states, due to the high costs and poor design of these projects.\u201d\nThe Indiana Pacers have repeatedly said they have no plans to relocate, despite constant speculation about the future of the team. However, community leaders think those stories have been planted in the media by the team owners to attract more support for a domed venue.\n\u201cThe reports about the loss of the Pacers, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a concern,\u201d Mayor Hogsett said. \u201cThe Pacers already have extended their lease through 2020.\u201d\nThe Pacers are expected to start full rebuilding at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, its current home, later this month, before moving back in there when the 2015-16 season ends in June.\nAs far as bringing the NFL Colts back to downtown, despite tight travel schedules for many NFL players, Hogsett said it\u2019s an issue the Colts\u2019 leadership needs to take into consideration.\n\u201cThe amount of travel is staggering, and understandably so, so if we\u2019re going to do that, I do think the Colts need to factor it into their decision,\u201d he said.\nCity leaders also said the bond deal, which will require 5 percent voter approval, is still being drafted.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Something to sing about from Darlington composer David Sorrow\nTHE Durham Singers\u2019 evening performance of a big holiday hit by Thomas Tallis marked a highly special occasion \u2013 it was the last Sunday service at Durham Cathedral for the season and the 100th anniversary of its construction, while the 19-piece choir is in the midst of its summer league soifing tour.\nThe composer is best known for The Cathedral Mass and The Choral Credo, in which the singing parishes played key roles. His masterpiece, Spem In Alium, a quadruple vast cathedral Mass, is a score so vast and imposing that it remains one of the few hard CD-ready pieces written by a modern composer that has not enjoyed success in its direct form.\nYet for all the formality of this 24-part mass, known as rite d\u2019esclavage in Latin, the musical score is also hugely emotional and popular. Not only do most all of the choir sing prominently in the great first section, but they also sing with vivid elan throughout, the choral writing played in a military, woodwind-based Latin ringing accompaniment by Durham\u2019s organist John Saunders.\nDove Hunt is the final chorus, which was written for a single Linley, the mountain in northern England, where the festival was held this year. It is sung by all of the choir, their high tenor Malcolm Wells leading the way.\nTallis\u2019 Spem in Alium received its North-East premiere in March 1902 by the soprano Ingrid Summerfield, who frequently sang in The Cathedral Mass, and it was at public performances in Durham Cathedral that it first became famous.\nThe performance began with Vespers using the cathedral\u2019s 77 long pipes and ended with a late Haydn A major mass from the first or second half of his Lyric repertoire.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Caavo\u2019s basic home monitoring features look like they\u2019re about to get a lot more interesting. The San Francisco-based company, which specializes in home automation and consumer electronics management software, today announced a raft of updates, including the addition of a parental-controlled access feature, to-and-from messaging, support for Apple TV set-top boxes, and OTA tuner features.\nMore specifically, Caavo will ship the 1.8.0 version of its software development kit (SDK) on Tuesday that\u2019ll complement the free family Guardian monitoring system, the de facto leader in home security, by allowing up to six different devices to be controlled from a single user account. Those devices include lighting, televisions, and stereo and sound systems, and parents or caregivers can grant additional rights to accompanying mobile apps or cameras that support remote login or voice commands. The software also unifies parental access to devices with a fixed schedule \u2014 say, don\u2019t leave the garage door open before the set time, and when the garage door is open the rest of the day, lock it remotely via a smartphone app.\nCaavo also said it integrated the Apple TV set-top box\u2019s Remote Services with its electronic control app, enabling parents to temporarily suspend or enable parental access controls. They can also secure a device from unsupervised use via the OTA feature, and theoretically, a remote device\u2019s Wi-Fi signal will be scanned before it\u2019s unsupervised \u2014 a problem in the past, Caavo says, when it wasn\u2019t able to effectively block unsupervised access at the OTA entry point.\nRelated to the update, for iPhones and iPads Caavo is taking a page from Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker app. Users can link their Caavo accounts to their apps using iCloud. Once connected, they can receive updates and play whole-home music from anywhere on a network, and have Caavo re-establish access after they leave the home.\nCaavo, which specializes in smart home devices, price points, and security, gained significant traction in 2015. A recent customer survey it conducted revealed that 98 percent of Caavo\u2019s users access it on a weekly basis, with 94 percent of households saying it either leaves or intervenes frequently when a device or home alarm is not working. It\u2019s the only app that\u2019s compatible with Amazon Echo, the other major source of in-home voice control.\n\u201cThe combination of Caavo Guard, our personal home monitoring service, and the expansion of our suite of devices for control on Apple TV and our entire user base of home automation apps was a perfect fit. The new partnership with Apple further enhances the platform by allowing parents to watch home activity while they\u2019re traveling or sleeping,\u201d said Steve Hammond, general manager of Caavo. \u201cAdding the only universal remote control for Wi-Fi enabled products will extend the utility of Caavo\u2019s platform to consumers who are already utilizing intelligent automation, integration, and second-screen applications in their living room and home office.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 At a facility where the cream rises to the top of the talent heap, Wasatch's boys soccer team's junior starter nearly missed an opportunity to get the chance to prove himself in a prime moment and made the most of the chance.\nPosting a minute's worth of minutes with starter Chris Nakaprai serving a red card suspension, backup goal keeper Colton Hadley \u2014 who got the start \u2014 nearly ruined the Cougars' chances of earning a 2-1 win over Skyridge in Region 8 action on Thursday at home.\nOn Skyridge's first possession of the game, Hadley, diving out of the charging guard on a breakout attempt, made a terrific sliding save on a shot attempt from the Falcons' Allazael Curiel. Moments later, Skyridge senior Reece Bertram tried to get to the rebound, but Didwell was able to poke the ball away.\nBertram kept pressure on the Wasatch defense and nearly collected the rebound but glanced his header wide of the target. Hadley, essentially, took it from there, not allowing another shot on target on the Cougars' very next possession.\n\"It's good to get a win, especially one that comes down to a few seconds,\" said Wasatch coach Alan Olsen. \"He made a big save on that one to keep us ahead 1-0 and we kind of started rolling from there.\"\nWhile the Mustangs settled in, their defense was more than stalwart to a degree, leaving plenty of space in between Skyridge's attacking force and the net. It became apparent in the 36th minute that Wasatch had the far better side of the net with Matt Martinez eventually leading off, putting the ball from a couple yards outside the penalty area to an almost wide-open Jamie Child.\nThe now-goalie-less Iceman had just the pace to get the ball into the net, finding the back of the net following a nifty weave between four Skyridge defenders, powering himself toward the net and then sticking a shot past goalie Sebastian Pino.\n\"I saw it in the air and I told myself I have to score to get a win,\" said Martinez, who seemed a bit stunned after scoring the eventual winning goal. \"I saw the goalie kind of low down, and I think he was hoping I'd just come to him \u2026 and then he's expecting me to shoot, and when I shoot he's expecting me to shoot and then I'm pulling it to the right.\"\nSkyridge answered the equalizer in the 38th minute when Earle Bruns drilled a well-struck shot from the left side into the back of the net, taking advantage of some poor Wasatch defending just a minute or so before the half.\nOn the first drive from the red card area, Bruns brought the ball down the right side of the box and held off some would-be tacklers to produce the shot on goal.\nWhile the score was tied at 1-1 heading into the second half, Wasatch seized the initiative, scoring in the 51st minute, courtesy of a lead-off blast from wide-open Bret Taylor.\n\"It was nice to see (Bennett) score there to get the lead, because we know he's been quite good all year, and he had some great saves in the first half, which makes that score very significant,\" said Olsen.\nWhile the win over Skyridge puts Wasatch back at the top of the region standings, this isn't the first time the Mustangs have shown a desire to win by backing up Nakaprai. In fact, Olsen prior to Thursday's game was so encouraged by the nature of the team's play prior to Nakaprai's red card, that he even said his start would come Wednesday.\n\"I think it's very good for the team and good for Colton, and I think he also knows a few things coming in he probably wasn't going to know until Chris got the red card, because they're not exactly at the top of the standings,\" said Olsen. \"Now he can see we can hang with the better teams.

{"text": "The future location of Cheniere Energy LNG (NYSEMKT:LNG) is paramount. Because Cheniere supplies roughly 40% of the LNG shipped to the US, and because Dominion Resources (NYSE:D) is trying to acquire Cheniere Energy Partners (NYSEMKT:CQP), an explanation for why investors might want to buy CQP instead.\nExhibit A\nCQP is a partnership backed by holdings controlled by its limited partner Cheniere Energy and manager-general partner Sabine Royalty Trust (NYSE:SBR). While Cheniere Energy has had its share of operating difficulties at Cheniere Energy Partners LNG site in Corpus Christi, Texas, there are good reasons why CQP is performing better than the publicly-traded Cheniere Energy, sending a strong message to the financial community and to investors.\nDividend Growth & Dividend Coverage\nThe first positive reason for the value of CQP is its dividend growth. Over the past four quarters, dividends have grown by 10%, and the fifth quarter is estimated to increase the dividend by another 9% relative to the first quarter. Further, the company's growth indicates it can meet, rather than exceed, this growth.\nDividend growth and coverage are a good sign because they demonstrate both fundamental integrity and the ability to reach long-term goals. While many may think of DCF as a negative, it is an important common way of disclosing DCF as illustrated below.\nCQP DCF 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Projected 2012 DCF CF $0.142 $0.204 $0.239 $0.319 $0.340 YOY percentage change (9.6%) 37.6% 29.6% 21.4% 28.7%\nAs shown above, CQP's relatively constant payout has been due to the company's steady growth of its underlying cash flows, which includes a substantial percentage of input/output that has no solvency risk due to nature of assets (gross margin) and business (e.g., the volumes they transport). Both accounted for over 70% of revenue for CQP in the most recent quarter.\nCQP generated 2.3% operating income for the past three quarters compared to Cheniere Energy, which generated a hefty 6.1% operating income margin. Does this mean that CQP is a better investment option? To answer this question, it would be better to look at the current dividend yield. Currently, CQP's dividend yield is 4.6% compared to the three-month average for CQP over the past 10 years at 4.1%.\nCase 2\nThe second reason to own CQP is due to its majority ownership interest in Sabine LNG with Cheniere Energy (81% ownership) and based on CQP's business, more closely aligned with the well-run utility and energy partnerships that I have previously covered. As well, if the deal between Sabine and Cheniere goes through, it would be expected that a larger equity position in CQP would result.\nCQP's management consists of Sabine Royalty Trust managers Larry Goldzband, Nelson Berry and Barton Kennedy and CQP CEO David Einhorn. Einhorn has a long history in the natural gas and energy markets, including his time spent as founder of The Dreyfus Corporation, a small natural gas company now owned by Qatar Petroleum.\nExpansion Projects\nCQP also has an integrated LNG/export project that could be under construction and ready in a relatively short time frame if it should acquire Cheniere Energy. Aside from the $1.5 billion it currently owns to develop a NGL pipeline in the Eagle Ford, its other pipeline-related LNG import project is to be completed by 2015. The project would allow it to fulfill contract commitments and has the potential to extend distribution into another decade.\nIt also has a deep inventory of export projects that could be built as soon as the current contracts are executed, although financing these projects could be challenging. CQP's North American shipping terminal currently has 2.3 billion cubic feet per day of pipeline space. The CQP ownership stake in Cheniere Energy Partners would potentially take this capacity to a level of about 3.3 Bcf/d should Cheniere acquire this stake and complete its current needs.\nConclusion\nCQP's various growth projects look promising, especially if Cheniere Energy completes its current inventory. In short, if you have the time to do research and become more sophisticated, I would consider CQP in addition to, and not instead of, taking a position in CQP's parent company Cheniere Energy.\nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "MONTREAL \u2014 A growing number of Canadian cities are getting ready to resume action on a generation-old disaster project: making houses safe in advance of floods, landslides and other natural disasters.\nForty per cent of city-owned buildings across the country weren\u2019t built to withstand natural disasters, according to a 2016 report by the Conference Board of Canada.\nHelp, and warning, could save millions of dollars in damage, experts say.\nDana Simpson, a professor in the University of British Columbia\u2019s department of civil engineering, says a key to protecting the public is having documentation.\n\u201cIf you really want to look into the amelioration of earthquake damage there\u2019s no substitute for accurately documenting what can happen,\u201d he said.\nSimpson teaches and consults on areas such as restoring flood defences, data collection and databases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to do this, but it is actually totally possible and I don\u2019t know of a university or an academic institution anywhere in the world that doesn\u2019t have this,\u201d he said.\nCentre Montreal professor Anne-Marie Gramlick is a specialist in river dykes, an issue that has garnered attention in recent years after a dangerous breach in the city.\nHer studies focus on data collection and remediation strategies to manage situations such as when a building is no longer habitable after an earthquake, if a river flows faster than a dam or even for a school housed in a marina.\n\u201cWalls, levees, even dikes are not going to stop anything that is relatively weak,\u201d Gramlick said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally a matter of how to gather data on how a place is built to know how to adapt to the consequences of some of these changes.\u201d\nBruce Lykos, director of the emergency response centre at Nova Scotia\u2019s Northumberland County, said information is the key to seeing where vulnerabilities are and addressing them.\n\u201cWhat I know is I want to get all of the information in at the beginning of a scenario and I want a disaster to happen,\u201d he said.\nThe threat of flooding and snowfall is a constant in Nova Scotia and the annual Report Card on Public Emergency Response in the Ocean Islands draws on previous disasters to make recommendations.\n\u201cWe sit around the table \u2026 in April every year and we realize what needs to be done,\u201d said Lykos, who expects to hold a meeting next month.\nThe board of the University of Waterloo in Ontario has more than 30 years of experience working with governments and universities to conduct risk assessments. It compiled a compendium of documents on about one million buildings and their usage to cover different scenarios.\nThe records help local municipalities and first responders identify key factors that can cause disruption, construction issues and priorities.\nLast month, the university became an expert at digging up a school building nestled in a canal that once froze.\n\u201cIf you look at the archives and track what\u2019s been affected, you can do a lot of things,\u201d said Robin Fertig, director of the university\u2019s faculty of civil and environmental engineering.\nUniversity staff excavated the basements last week to prepare for a reseal of the school building with a 1,000-ton liner to keep it watertight.\nBy keeping the school open, officials anticipate the total cost will be less than $1 million in repairs.\nAnd after a dam break in New Brunswick in 2016, the university evaluated a 3,400-square-metre service area to give civil engineers a better understanding of vulnerabilities.\nThe assessment cost $1.5 million, but avoided the need for the school to downsize and open earlier than planned this September.\nIn 1988, the University of Waterloo made a record $118 million settlement from the insurer of the defunct Severn Trent Water to avoid legal action related to the Geraldine Yitzhak sewer spill.\nAs part of the agreement, the university plans to establish a $750,000 municipal fund in the hopes of settling claims related to other wastewater spills.\n\u201cAll of these things are going to cost you money, but that is one less thing you have to worry about,\u201d Fertig said.\n\u201cOur goal is to actually minimize the cost of these as much as possible by building the infrastructure in a smarter way.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "I\u2019m sick of people defending the bail-in, a bailout chosen by the same politicians who for years rejected the basis for it.\nThe Co-op debacle is a topic of discussion of every topic in politics at the moment, but money is not the only key factor that explains the Co-op collapse. Among the myriad mistakes made, we have been told the government had no choice but to take over the Co-op bailout.\nI have a lot of respect for these people and I appreciate their efforts to defend the beleaguered Co-op, but I can\u2019t help thinking of a number of other factors that had a bearing on the demise of the co-op.\nThese should have been brought up publicly if we want to start having rational discussions about the Co-op and its possible replacement.\nThey include:\n-The fact that the EAC and Hellenic Bank pursued to buy Co-op in 2008, without anyone in charge of the Financial Supervision Organisation (FSE) trying to find a more suitable buyer to avoid a bailout for Co-op. The failure to raise the initial offer price of \u20ac1.4bn for the bulk of Co-op explains the collapse of Co-op.\n-The insistence by the Greek Cypriot government on postponing Co-op\u2019s membership referendum until May 2012, before finally going ahead with it that November. Had the referendum succeeded, it would have served as a springboard to secure European funds for the Greeks who would have seen a bailout package for Co-op, which happened anyway in November 2011. The Greek Cypriot government should have encouraged Co-op to go ahead with its referendum, so that it could reap the rewards of that.\n-The factors highlighted above only scratch the surface. What about reforms introduced by the bail-in, for instance the \u2018charitable\u2019 nature of the Co-op and its associated businesses; the importance of loans when considering scenarios like banks going under; the failure to save Co-op from the brink of oblivion via the issuance of bonds, introducing stock market shares and getting a private sector partner, as well as the looming crisis in Greek Cypriot banks? Are all those conditions missed?\n-To question why the Co-op was bailed-in is not a criticism of bail-in as such; why it needed to be is part of the failure of the co-op. Like a company that cannot employ enough staff at its operating level, the chief executive of the Co-op had to be found by the government, from a group of unqualified human resources experts. These people gave the co-op executives a blueprint of a failed organisation to correct the mistakes. Unfortunately the laws that go with these employees were not updated in line with the staffing model of today. Unfortunately for the co-op, it did not work on improving the structure of its management, and now in the wake of its collapse had to be bailed-in through the central bank.\nThese are the circumstances which I think should have brought light to the collapse of the Co-op and what we need to avoid going through in the future. Instead of the blame going to the bail-in or the absent co-op members\u2019 referendum, I would have liked to have seen a catharsis and an opportunity to evaluate and solve problems by having some form of dialogue and understanding by the politicians who have been part of them.\nI did notice that some of the key figures in politics were positively undecided on the bail-in and bail-in alone, but that didn\u2019t get in the way of making decisions.\nNow we should look at the other options which could bring more positive results in the current scenario. Do we need to save the Co-op by nationalising its micro and macro-banking subsidiaries, like the three Cypriot banks? In the best case scenario, this would create new bank owners that would have no issues regarding wages and pensions \u2013 an asset which is sorely missing from the dearth of banking the Co-op has suffered due to a lack of care on the part of certain actors. It\u2019s not easy to build trust, a number of MPs and politicians have suggested that there should be discussion of our diaspora\u2019s diaspora banking needs. Any discussion in this direction should take into account the second part of the bail-in.\nMeanwhile, we can all use our own capital to put something back into the market. We should call the CEOs of the three \u2018problem\u2019 Cypriot banks and ask them if there are jobs for them in Cyprus after the crisis is over. It\u2019s not a question of getting us out of a situation, but of coming to a better understanding of this very serious situation we are in now.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Dear Amy: Our daughter and her husband are having a baby girl. Now that she is pregnant, this is my concern.\nI feel as if I need to distance myself from this child, not only because we\u2019re going through a divorce and she\u2019s probably going to end up being a single mom, but also because of her diet.\nShe likes to eat right, but also when we\u2019re visiting, when she thinks she\u2019s having the run of the house, she feels the need to invite her friends over for beer and burgers. She\u2019s very sociable and good with all kids and teenagers.\nThe mom of one of her friends just posted a picture of her baby and said, \u201cThis is my favorite person!\u201d My only point is, I\u2019m in it with her more than any other family member and now, having a granddaughter, there is an expectation for me to have a conversation with her about her diet.\nHow do I broach this with her? Is it appropriate to bring this up without pushing? \u2014 Nana With a Scoop\nDear Nana: The interview for your granddaughter\u2019s family dinner will begin, but also think about whether this is the best time to explore what this grandparent (and all of you) needs from her granddaughter.\nIt sounds as if all of you are not having conversations about eating right. Your daughter is either clueless or extremely irresponsible, and I suspect that she has no appreciation of her own habits.\nFirst, you should have a conversation with your daughter about her eating habits, and with her spouse, and if they have a policy for meals with friends, discuss that too. You should also set a limit on the number of beer or burger days and meals you expect (or do not expect) to attend during a visit.\nThe key word here is expect, because this is a unique situation for all of you, and if it becomes even more prominent, you will have to take a measure of responsibility for your grandchildren, and their relationships with adults, including the grandparent.\nDear Amy: My 7-year-old daughter began to excel at school.\nIn a school with lower expectations, she was compared favorably to the other girls.\nShe was given special attention, and pretty soon people were telling her that they thought she would be the star of high school, due to the way she was performing.\nIn my opinion, this was amazing to a child. Her teachers were applauding her and even telling me she \u201clooked like an academic.\u201d\nNow that she has learned how to apply these skills, she is not getting any attention from either the adults or other children in school.\nThese same people who criticized her when she was 6 have become indignant at her, telling her, \u201cHow come you are in pain now?\u201d\nI think they should mind their own business. My daughter does not have the brains and ability to compete in that league, and I do not want them putting pressure on her.\nHow do I feel about others trying to use my child as some sort of barometer for some elevated standard? \u2014 Fretting in Pensacola\nDear Fretting: I\u2019m sorry about the depression, but you also need to try to make some sense of this. What you describe is extraordinarily emotional, and it isn\u2019t right for any of you \u2014 nor for the person asking, but you don\u2019t seem to think the person should mind her own business.\nAs a parent, you should only feel obliged to raise your child with unconditional love \u2014 not some superficially-flattering code score \u2014 and in this setting, it sounds as if your daughter is failing to meet the simple expectations of how she should act and behave.\nMaybe she\u2019s not an academic. If that\u2019s the case, she should investigate other kinds of programs in order to maximize her opportunities.\nMaybe she is suffering from ADHD, and some solutions will be less dramatic than flattening out her schedule, or scrubbing a few data points from her performance.\nThere is another option. A list of nutritional concerns and allergies might be printed into her folder and she should draw the line there.\nDear Amy: I was appalled by the letter from \u201cFreaked Out,\u201d who kept calling a guy with a long beard a \u201clittle rascal.\u201d\nI was about 40 years old when I had another beard. I considered it a style for a while. I eventually got rid of it. This dude should stick to calling guys \u201cladies\u201d or that heartwarming, heartening and affectionate mumble, \u201clove.\u201d \u2014 No Grace\nDear No: This writer should stick to hairstyles \u2014 like the acceptable, preferred", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "If the weed had been around back in 1864, Ed Brooke would likely have tried it, and Congress wouldn't have hauled him in for questioning.\nYet, somehow, it's all coming full circle.\nIn the aftermath of Prohibition, the National Association of Convenience Stores persuaded Congress to ban the \"combination\" of alcohol and tobacco, and a century later, the mood at Washington's oldest C-Store is one of deep nostalgia for America's earliest days of \u2014 gasp \u2014 legal pot. And no one's trying to talk the American people back into drinkin'.\nStory continues below advertisement\nWith rising sentiment from physicians and others that marijuana should be more broadly legalized, major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Target are quietly exploring whether to be the first to sell recreational pot when it's made legal in the District of Columbia on Oct. 1. They're also quietly removing marijuana products from their permanent shelves and bringing new lures into the stores to lure customers: free booze.\nWashington's six C-Stores, which opened their doors in the lead-up to Prohibition and have been open to the public since the mid-1970s, are the last holdouts to a prohibition that has been swept away across the country \u2014 and it's only natural they'd want to leave the edibles, pot-infused granola and shatter behind and the copious glass cases filled with marijuana products stocked by suppliers hoping to cash in on a quickly evolving market.\n\"They're going to start pushing products on us,\" said Chad Flor, owner of Flor and Friends, one of the owners of the city's six remaining C-Stores. \"It's like when a restaurant change their menu. They say, 'Isn't it nice to have a burger now?'\"\nA few C-Store owners started to think more seriously about converting after Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., introduced a bill late last year to repeal the District's ban on marijuana sales. The bill stalled, but local officials have since held some discussions with the retailers, who are hardly strangers to change.\nUntil just a few years ago, all C-Stores in the U.S. were owned by organized crime, and most were owned by Chinese gangs, either through their ties to the shipping companies or for tax reasons. After Prohibition, the District of Columbia passed its own alcohol laws, and most C-Stores burned their opium den signs as they began selling wine, beer and liquor.\nNow, not a single C-Store in the United States is owned by organized crime, according to Rafael Su\u00e1rez, the owner of Washington's remaining C-Stores. The C-Store empire started in 1934 by Charles Croxton as a small convenience store chain in Denver has spread to more than 1,000 locations throughout the country.\nAt Flor's Casa Blanco, a five-month-old marijuana shop that opened its doors in November, workers are getting ready to replace the giant glass cases filled with dried herbs, buds and hashish that are atop the building's facade.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"This was once my dad's office,\" said co-owner Jeff Johnson. \"One of his original designs. So this is symbolic. That's it. My dad's office.\"\nIf it all goes as Johnson hopes, his C-Store brass will install beer taps and offer a limited selection of booze, some of it free, in the store's new surrounds.\n\"The timing is right,\" said Jodie Hettrick, the director of the District's new Office of Cannabis Management. \"There's a huge opportunity there. We were talking to a lot of people who want to be at the forefront.\"\nBecause few state laws anticipated that Washington's medical marijuana patients would turn into tourists when recreational sales become legal, the District's shops have struggled to compete with out-of-state operators who have avoided a slew of regulation and permitting headaches.\nBut that could soon change.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe District's medical marijuana system is about to be put through its own overhaul, and Hettrick's office is designing the way pot will be sold at the recreational store that will open in the fall, presumably to out-of-towners.\n\"I think there's a lot of goodwill,\" said Su\u00e1rez, the C-Store owner. \"The city understands the impact legalizing marijuana will have.\"\nThat's true even among some activists who worked hard to convince the District to legalize marijuana.\n\"We were given this gift when we legalized medical marijuana,\" said Philip Shearer, founder of PhRMA, a D.C.-based group that promotes the use of marijuana. \"Now the inevitable question becomes: When do you get paid back?\"\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By Babajide Komolafe\nTHE Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is concerned about banks\u2019 involvement in carry-forward financing of forex which the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) says is increasing interest rate in the economy.\nThe Acting Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department at the CBN, Dr Albert Tshisekedi, stated this during a Public Hearing on MPC Decision in Abuja.\nWhile stressing that the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) will be in a better position to answer questions on banks\u2019 carry-forward financing, Tshisekedi said: \u201cGovernments of Nigeria, sometimes we hear information that some banks are borrowing money from the Central Bank (CBN) and borrowing money at high interest rate to pay for goods and services, but our concern is of this observation.\n\u201cThe CBN has worked with the NDIC to ensure an alignment of procedures and objectives of these financial institutions. The powers of the CBN were aligned with that of the NDIC by the legislation of 2007 to ensure that these institutions will remain focused on their responsibilities.\n\u201cAlso, by the rules that were laid down by the NDIC on supervision. There were rules in terms of supervision and the regulation of these financial institutions. This also worked as an interface between the regulatory and supervisory bodies and the financial institutions.\n\u201cOne of the outcomes of this was that when supervisory powers were put on them; they didn\u2019t abuse it and they need to be able to justify to the regulators.\u201d\nOn the level of lending by banks, the CBN official said the level of lending was caused by the liquidity that the apex bank used to offer; this, he said, was to make banks lend to the private sector.\nHe said: \u201cRight now there is a level of reduced lending. But of course, you see this is affecting some level of the private sector, which you see because part of the issues is the amount of banks liquidity they use to meet demand.\n\u201cBanks used to use reserves with the central bank to lend money to the public and that is reducing the liquidity. At the same time that is happening, you are deregulating market, so you want banks to lend to the private sector.\n\u201cThis leads to increase in price of some goods and services, particularly those that are regarded as more consumable. It is so. But it is also the way we find out things in the economy. And some of you who are having unusual transactions you may know about.\n\u201cSimilarly, you will see that at the end of the day, once the CBN takes some reserves and those reserves are gone, it will be difficult for banks to lift all the money. This causes the interest rate to go up. These issues also would have been addressed if the NDIC had been able to facilitate discussions among the supervising agencies on the rules guiding their operation,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "machine"}

These CEOs are unlikely to announce new local operations now that they have an international headquarters in a different country \u2014 and because of tough new rules the Trump administration set for some parent companies.\nSpokespeople for the 13 non-American CEOs told us they have no current plans to hire domestic workers or build local facilities. They argue those choices are related to the long-term transition of corporations and their workforce, not a reaction to the big immigration crackdown Trump signed into law last year.\nNone of the executives is worried about the job market outside the U.S.\n\"The U.S. is still a high-wage, high-skill economy,\" noted EY's Thomas Sprecher.\nThe Chinese growth slowdown. The world has long compared U.S. growth to that of China's \u2014 because it was its clear and growing economic powerhouse and other big emerging markets such as India were so important to global growth. But now the U.S. economy is doing fine, while China is slowing. \"Within eight months of the trade tensions being announced, it seems like they've hit us all equally,\" Ervin Joubert of the World Trade Organization told us. China's economy grew 6.7% last year, its slowest pace in 25 years. And while some analysts have pushed back on that slowing, big U.S. companies have responded to it by cutting back or slowing their U.S. growth plans. Private equity investment there has dropped. Chinese companies have also made major deals overseas \u2014 but many of those involve the sale of assets and not technology companies such as Facebook or Google.\nWhat we're not seeing: Lots of U.S. companies are buying foreign companies \u2014 and those tend to be more domestic than multinational ones. For example, last year the tech giant Microsoft (which of course hasn't tried to go non-American), made an $18 billion deal for the firm GitHub (where some of its employees hail from Mexico, the Philippines and other regions.\n\"There's a lot of money going for assets and that's acting as a force multiplier,\" Joubert said.\nCurrency war\nMarkets are so tumultuous that they have started to show signs of hiccups, and that could give leaders another excuse to try to provide stimulus \u2014 such as:\nStrengthening the U.S. dollar, which would make the entire economy less productive, and make Chinese products cheaper to Americans and European ones less expensive to Americans and British ones.\nBeijing could follow some of the steps they took in 2016 \u2014 when they devalued the yuan a lot, to try to prop up exports.\nMaking its currency more accessible to international investors, and speeding up the capital flow out of China.\nCapital restrictions? Some Chinese officials have said they are considering cracking down on capital flows so that they stop helping to fuel American jobs.\n\"China is nervous about their economy, and we have already seen their government make a number of moves, including trying to prevent excessive yuan depreciation,\" added Conroy. \"They're concerned about both exports to the U.S. and their ability to invest in markets that aren't as open to them. At some point China has to reverse some of those choices.\"\nGo deeper: Sinking stock prices are discouraging U.S. companies\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "When it comes to U.S. banking, it's clear that U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is on the top of the heap, but that it's still a work in progress when it comes to concentrating on domestic growth opportunities. By contrast, Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) has a lot of room to grow in several areas.\nAt first glance, I would have thought that the addition of PNC to what's now \"USB U.S. Bank\" would only be beneficial to the other. Although the deals involve roughly equal valuations to existing acquisitions, the combination of a presence in western Pennsylvania, a presence in the Carolinas, and still-pretty-small presence in Northeast Ohio would lend itself to shared branch growth, fee generation, and operating expenses.\nWhile I'm willing to bite the bullet and argue that the deals enhance the new company's growth prospects, I don't buy the argument that the moves will enable share buybacks. As U.S. Bancorp has demonstrated over many years, the best strategy is to maintain a strong capital position, maintain/perform on its dividend, and buy back shares through all the market volatility, so dilution isn't something that I see PNC doing.\nNot So Fast\nHowever, there is another, more important reason why PNC doesn't make for a great fit for USB: the purchase price. By buying PNC's consumer business for roughly 4% of assets (versus roughly 7% for USB Bancorp), USB realizes only modest efficiency savings.\nI know that there have been the cries about a \"bank monopoly\" in Pittsburgh, but if true, it can't excuse this deal; few other parts of the U.S. look better than New York, Philadelphia, and most of southern and eastern Pennsylvania. PNC's decision to exit a market like Philadelphia just doesn't make sense to me.\nThe deal also makes no sense when you consider both companies' general geographic footprint. PNC does have share in Richmond and Raleigh (those are two of the 15 new markets) where USB has a small presence, but regional trends there don't paint a pretty picture. For one thing, PNC has struggled in recent years to gain traction in the Memphis market. For another, neither company controls substantial market share in Tampa, Jacksonville, and Ft. Myers, markets that might be thought of as attractive and/or well-capitalized.\nIn short, though, I don't understand why PNC would ever look at a transaction like this as a way to boost its share or its franchise. Better to keep pursuing organic growth (or to aggressively buy new deposits) and open the door to a world-class partner like Citigroup (NYSE:C).\nThere's Still A Great Opportunity\nI love U.S. Bancorp's game plan - allocate capital for high-growth overseas markets like Mexico or Korea or continuing acquisitions in the U.S. It's an approach that has helped the company succeed over many years, and puts the company in position to become a player in the national and global story for banking.\nOn the other hand, I think PNC's story is a little more like Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC). While Citigroup and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) seem more like they are fighting a war from the West Coast to the Midwest to the Eastern seaboard, PNC has other opportunities to grow. First, I think it could re-enter/build some consumer franchises in Florida and Chicago. Second, PNC is an acquirer of fees and operating costs, so that ought to be quite profitable.\nKeep In Mind Too\nAnd not that I'm among those arguing that banks should be fighting all these wars from the West Coast to the Midwest, but consider that USB currently operates only two branches in the Chicago region. That's in the seven-state Northwest, and USB's share there is about a fraction of what it is in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. For that reason, while I may not find PNC's prospects in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, or Richmond a great deal, it may be just as easy to see it as a theme that could provide similar avenues of growth in Chicago.\nThe Bottom Line\nI'd be surprised if PNC didn't end up paying a little more than the market implied, but I have to admit that I'm finding less and less to love about this deal. All-in, with all the doomsday scenarios, it just doesn't seem like a slam-dunk for PNC.\nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) \u2014 When Taylor Hall returned for the New Jersey Devils following his knee injury, he wasn\u2019t exactly surprised that a simple routine changed his season.\nHall fractured his left knee in a Dec. 21 game against the Nashville Predators, pushing him into unrestricted free agency at the end of this season. New Jersey has six weeks to decide whether to exercise a $5.5 million qualifying offer to lock up the 25-year-old, though the team is believed to be interested in retaining his services for next season and beyond.\nHall didn\u2019t face the media before Sunday\u2019s game against the Edmonton Oilers, but joined his teammates afterward and said he wasn\u2019t surprised by how things turned out.\n\u201cFrom the day I got back, going through the rehab, the way they progressed was kind of what I had experienced with my previous injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised. It\u2019s obviously not fun. I\u2019m sure other guys were definitely surprised by how long I was out. But that\u2019s the best in sport. That\u2019s the perfect body for what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\nNow that he\u2019s back, Hall said he\u2019s full-go for the rest of the season. He has 10 goals and 19 assists in 38 games after suffering the second knee injury of his career.\nHall\u2019s injury opened up the Devils\u2019 season for third-year forward Brett Seney, who was recalled at the start of October from the Albany Devils of the American Hockey League. Seney played in 40 games, finishing with 12 goals and 18 assists, and helped them win their first division title in 15 years.\nBut will the 23-year-old Seney be up with the big club for next season? Coach John Hynes wouldn\u2019t give a straight answer, saying he has to talk to general manager Ray Shero and player personnel director Frank Buscemi about that.\nThe coaching staff has liked what it\u2019s seen from Seney, who had seven goals and 21 assists in 42 games last season with Hartford.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always guys coming up from (the AHL) every single year that jump right into the lineup or be on the radar. That\u2019s just the way the league is. We\u2019re very fortunate with Brett. He got to experience a lot of these things,\u201d Hynes said. \u201cThere\u2019s new things for us in the way we play and he\u2019s ready for it and will compete for it.\u201d\nThe Devils don\u2019t want to risk losing Hall or Seney, as the team also has depth at center thanks to Nico Hischier, Miles Wood, Blake Coleman and Mirco Mueller. The team also has Nick Lappin, who\u2019s known as an NHL-level center.\nHall, who\u2019s four years younger than Seney, is expected to be the NHL\u2019s top free agent, with Winnipeg\u2019s Kyle Connor and Chicago\u2019s Alex DeBrincat also on the market.\nIn February, the team acquired center Ryan Spooner from the Boston Bruins for a fifth-round pick in 2020 and a seventh-round pick in 2021. The 32-year-old Spooner is off to a strong start, with six goals and 11 assists in 27 games.\nHynes doesn\u2019t think the Devils are at the point where they\u2019re overburdened with center players, yet.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. I think there\u2019s still a chance to add a guy if we think he can fit in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for now it\u2019s just about keeping our guys healthy.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

The VS Angels aren\u2019t your average models with their tiny waists and tiny hips; they\u2019re regularly flaunting incredibly toned, rock hard glutes \u2014 a photo Angel Jasmine Tookes made fans believe in after her walk! A post shared by Victoria\u2019s Secret (@victoriassecret) on Nov 5, 2018 at 7:42am PST\nWe asked Justin Gelband, creator of MODEL GOAT line, who he thinks can achieve that feat, and he thought it was no surprise. \u201cMariana Torchio, a fierce and brilliant Brazilian professor of body composition and fitness, introduced me to her very highly regarded Glute Technique 10 years ago, and since then, my knowledge of the study of muscle structure and muscle performance has grown exponentially,\u201d Justin EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife, explaining that Marianna is the considered the \u201cGlute Coach\u201d for women and a level one fitness instructor. \u201cA number of my MODEL GOAT Body Modifications were created specifically to lift her levels up. The most popular of these works the glutes and core in roughly the same proportions of PT exercises but significantly focuses her initial target.\u201d\n\u201cThe one to increase the glute ratio most effectively is the 2.2 ratio,\u201d Justin said, adding that you can keep the increased ratio for 3-5 sets. While you should make sure to stop once your knees start arching, Justin says that the best way to improve your shaping is to do both glute exercises in parallel. That way you have two sets of muscle working in sync, rather than just one. If you have any period of muscle weakness, it\u2019s possible you just aren\u2019t getting the most out of it. \u201cNow don\u2019t get me wrong, if you\u2019re not doing the PT exercise, you\u2019re not getting all that benefit from glute work either,\u201d Justin explains.\nJustin\u2019s most important tip for ensuring the health of your glutes and your core was to work the glutes together. \u201cThe greatest disadvantage we have from working one system in isolation \u2014 our abs or glutes \u2014 is that when we add the other systems (the core and glutes), our athleticism has to compete with each other so you see a lot of inefficiency and dis-order,\u201d Justin explains. \u201cThis is why glute work is more important than core work, period.

{"text": "Updated\nBuying a house, setting up a business and buying a car, and even paying your kids' university fees, may be more important than ever as more Australians look to find their feet in retirement.\nKey points: Experts recommend against wanting to retain what they have built up in superannuation\nPoliticians and pensions expert say that 40 per cent of current retirees want to touch super\nCritics argue this would have detrimental effects on retirement savings\nBut a senior retirement researcher from the Grattan Institute says it is important to look beyond who earns most money and looking at their post-retirement needs.\nExecutive director and senior research fellow Stephen Anthony said a retired person in his mid-60s with a modest investment income would need to take a more active role in managing their superannuation fund.\nThis might mean paying some fees, which he said are now high.\nHe said the recommended move from 20 per cent of earnings to 18 per cent would help limit \"retirement entitlement\" and cost the Government money.\nMr Anthony said the idea that the Government is responsible for ensuring members have access to any final payouts has become old-fashioned and people are now supposed to be careful with their super because they have spent much of their life getting it.\n\"The problem is that the retention of superannuation is just somewhat indicative of people's expectations of what retirement should look like,\" he said.\n\"I think the idea that if you have got money in the account that you want to keep is out of date now in my opinion.\"\nCritics say raising super payouts would impact on savings\nBut critics of the idea say it would lead to lower retirement incomes and lead to an erosion of superannuation balances.\nAngela Stone, a spokesperson for the Centre for Money, Policy and Research at the University of Melbourne, said a shift to a higher rate would reduce the fund's financial ability to manage investment risks and liabilities over the long term.\n\"That in turn means that over the longevity of a person's superannuation account, the pension payments will not be as high as those people would have experienced,\" she said.\n\"So, the idea that we're going to see massive increases in people's long-term retirement incomes and benefits simply does not stack up.\"\nMs Stone said the change would have adverse effects on the behaviour of younger Australians who were not interested in financial products but would be able to access their super after they stop work.\n\"The idea that people will want to invest more, and in doing so, making the returns higher by shifting the earnings rate is the wrong way to go about that,\" she said.\n\"This is going to see pension balances eroded, because it will have the unintended consequence of limiting people's saving and investment options.\"\nExperts say pensions are now a 'social legacy'\nMs Stone said the present pension system does not factor in a person's ability to pay for their retirement and the longer they live, the lower their income will be as a result.\nShe said reducing the resources for older people would lead to fewer older people being able to access Medicare, bulk-billed hospital and prescription services and were a \"social legacy\".\nLabor's shadow treasurer Chris Bowen, who worked as a minister in the Howard government before being elected in 2016, said he was not a fan of increasing superannuation payouts and would be \"thrilled\" if the former was able to do so.\n\"It is extraordinarily clear that the pension system in Australia is a much more limited provision today than it was when the Howard government was in office and I think it is very important in an economy in this kind of transition period that you look at ways of making people's retirement life easier,\" he said.\nMr Bowen said Labor was concerned by the introduction of elements like changes to disability pensions.\n\"We have been very concerned that with the provisions of the age pension, with the provision of Newstart allowance for people with disabilities, we are seeing real downward pressure on the income opportunities for many more people and it is a worrying trend,\" he said.\n\"We need to be very careful that we don't make people's retirement incomes less likely to be available to them.\"\nMr Bowen said the Government is now suffering from division over aspects of its plan and for a decade they have had to respond to its superannuation changes.\nHe said interest was high because the last two governments have increased the pension payments in recent years.\nTopics: superannuation, government-and-politics, elections, australia\nFirst posted\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "FC Dallas stepped onto the Internationa Olympic team pitch for the first time last year and the second time this weekend. Five of the players that were on the roster during that impressive performance have not returned, two more have seemingly been traded for an unknown amount of money, and now there are only nine players left from that 2013 squad. What did we learn from these games last year and this year?\nFirst, it is nice to see some youth jerseys in the starting eleven for the first time. The experiment went well last year and never really panned out this year. The second game that Joe Cannon started in goal that year was a disaster. Unfortunately, it was towards the end of the tournament as Cannon was needed for the CCL, the Finals run.\nIn Dallas' first match, Keith Bush started in goal and Sam Kramer was not far behind. Both have been very good thus far for team, but have spent the majority of the season as back-up goalkeepers to Fraser Forster at Celtic and Kasey Keller at Real Salt Lake. We have heard nothing from either in regards to next year.\nThe best part of this match had to be the showing of Hugo Jalado. He made his full debut and not only carved out an important goal in the win over local rivals Frisco, but he earned player of the match honors. Jalado had a little injury setback earlier in the year, but said last week that he was raring to go, and he was. He had one of the more impressive performances in the tournament.\nAnother youngster worth mentioning was Anthony Donofrio. The 19-year-old midfielder had an eye popping assist on Jalado's strike and is filling in nicely for Tristan Brotherton, who only recently returned from injury. Hopefully that starts to open up playing time and playing time for the rest of the big trio of Donofrio, Rego and Jaden Celotto. Not to mention that you never know when Jordan Eberle will get injured. They are all really good players and would all make strong starting options for this team.\nIn total, Dallas has four players on full international duty for the weekend's action. Of them, Allen, Dalcio, Quiroz, & Perles are no longer with the team as Kone.\nFC Dallas also has a full contingent of youngsters participating in the Preseason Tournament in France. The Under-17 side plays at 1 p.m. today (7/16), then takes on Lille at 9:30 a.m. on Monday (7/17). The Under-20s close out the tournament with two games Monday (7/17) and one Tuesday (7/18).\nIt appears that this is the final chance for the age-graded side to step out on an international stage. But there is a fair amount of potential for this group to make the team next year, so don't expect there to be any automatic recalls.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As a new mom, it can be a little overwhelming to return to the workforce after taking a month off with your newborn. While some new moms choose to take a little time off, many moms decide to stay home with their child. If you\u2019re one of these moms, you\u2019re probably a little nervous about being prepared for the world you\u2019re about to re-enter.\nAs an employer, what are your responsibilities when your job offers maternity leave? If the job doesn\u2019t offer a short-term disability or medical leave, what options are available to you? You might not even be aware of what\u2019s available to you. There are a few things that you can do to minimize your anxiety, and you need to be well prepared before you go back to work.\nThe importance of being prepared for that first day\nHere are three key things to keep in mind when returning to work.\nGet educated on disability, unemployment and social security\nThe first thing you should do is go to Social Security and Google \u201cnot eligible for social security disability,\u201d \u201cnot eligible for social security unemployment,\u201d or \u201cnot eligible for social security medical.\u201d Once you know you\u2019re eligible for certain benefits, you can apply for those benefits.\nFind out what facilities you can and can\u2019t use\nWith an infant at home, you may be limited to the parents\u2019 individual bathrooms. Make sure your workplace understands that you can use the office bathroom, but make sure you feel comfortable by signing a legal non-disclosure agreement prior to coming back. You\u2019ll want to have a procedure set up so that you can unnoticeably go to the restroom to go to the bathroom, not just the nearest family bathroom, and you never need to announce yourself to your colleagues.\nAs your baby gets older, it\u2019s important to make sure there are plenty of activities available to you to occupy yourself. Make sure the office has plenty of toys for your baby, as well as tables, partitions and other play space for you and your spouse. You can borrow, borrow, borrow \u2014 whatever works!\nListen to the boss\nBefore you go back to work, talk to your boss and talk to your coworkers about your expectations. You don\u2019t need to share all of your professional experiences, but don\u2019t put up with any bad behavior. If something seems off with the company, you should be able to talk to your boss immediately or make the issue go away. Don\u2019t take work home from work or refuse to answer phone calls from your manager or teammates.\nLook into your state\u2019s Family and Medical Leave Act program\nCalifornia, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Minnesota, and Washington offer state-paid FMLA leave. New York also offers some paid family leave, but only up to four weeks of leave per family member.\nIf your state does not have a Family and Medical Leave Act, you should look into FMLA.gov, which is a website that lists where FMLA programs are located.\nFind your peers\nA group of fellow moms with similar family situations can be helpful. These groups can be diverse in terms of socioeconomic status, political leanings, disability, race, religion and any other personal distinctions. Find a group by going to the local library, participating in the book club or just walking around the grocery store. Being part of an online group or online magazine is also a great resource.\nFor even more support and planning ideas for new moms returning to work, check out Fairygodboss\u2019s online Career Tools and Tools for Parents.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Jem Wolife is facing backlash from clients after her Instagram accounts were deleted from the social media platform.\nWolife was forced to take down her million-followers-strong Instagram accounts OnlyFans and Jemminsoon because Instagram did not recognise her business as a genuine celebrity destination.\nBut her backlash has also exposed the hypocrisy and bias of business owners who argue their business should have some kind of endorsement right from the start.\nThese exclusivity clauses have been demanded from social media influencers across a variety of businesses, from beauty to fashion, despite the social media platforms themselves wanting brands and PR companies to build a deeper relationship with these influencers than they have to big brands already signed up to their marketing programs.\nEarlier this week Wolife posted on her Instagram story that the \u201cperfect\u201d Instagram user who would be able to partner with her would have: \u201cNot want brags about their follower count. They would never pay more than pocket change, regularly have a good comment section, would promote organic content.\u201d\nHowever, not everyone agreed with her. Cosy Handmade Fashion director Mia Freedman said she \u201c100 per cent\u201d did not want to be \u201cleft out of the equation of who ends up collaborating with them\u201d.\nCamera Icon Not everyone agreed with Jem Wolife\u2019s Instagram post, with most people agreeing she could get her business off the ground by offering viewers something different. Picture: Fuse/Getty Images\n\u201cInstagram will help you reach tens of thousands of engaged followers but if they are not there, they are not showing up for your content as much and you\u2019ll lose engagement,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey will help you but it\u2019s important that they aren\u2019t asking for money in exchange for not promoting.\u201d\nFellow private fashion designer Alisa Blumberg said even if she was on Instagram it would be good \u201cto not have to say, \u2018you\u2019re a follower but I should be more of a friend\u2019\u201d.\nBoth Freedman and Blumberg insisted they did not think companies and PR companies were \u201cbeing too demanding\u201d.\nHowever, under Australian law, the \u201creal thing\u201d \u2014 like an existing brand or a trust \u2014 can only be bought by its owner or a third party.\nIn the US, a judge ruled a clothing line owned by professional wrestler Chris Jericho could not be developed as a social media company but was set up in order to get a piece of the action.\nIt was not deemed a trademark. The social media platform Facebook, which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will speak about at the 21st Mountain View Visionary Summit, is valued at more than $400 billion. It has a \u201creal thing\u201d right, meaning it can be bought without a seller or a buyer needing to \u201ccontract\u201d with both parties.\nWhile even all of these examples still require action by the seller and buyer, the business would still be first, second or third in line to get the \u201cfeatured influencer\u201d \u201ccredit\u201d.\nAlso, Instagram is open to the world to monitor for racism, hate speech and spam.\nBut Instagram and Facebook\u2019s tacit support of exclusivity clauses comes amid an onslaught of problems surrounding the sites and a lack of respect for their users.\nFacebook and Instagram have a similar practice in place \u2014 where they police both Instagram and the same platform for a small group of accounts that have become notorious for being racist and hate-filled.\nCamera Icon Mia Freedman is a vocal advocate of the industry but said \u201cfair play\u201d should always be the order of the day. Picture: Action Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\nAbout 70 per cent of the Instagram user base are women who choose to follow 200 different \u201cethnic\u201d accounts in an effort to gain a better understanding of their communities. Facebook has been criticised for censoring a viral video of a baby in a bathtub playing \u201cPokemon Go\u201d with its Asian logo because it was racist.\nThe uploading of racially offensive content has also been prohibited on both platforms, according to an investigation by Australian police last month.\nWhilst Instagram has made a point of saying that there\u2019s \u201cno need to share anything that\u2019s racist, sexist, hateful, offensive or provocative\u201d, this directive only applies in countries where laws still allow it.\nAs Jem Wolife\u2019s business continues to grow, she can be assured that it is free of exclusivity clauses. It will, however, always be impossible to please everyone.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "AP-SEN--Sharks-Thornton Suspended,2nd Ld-Writethru\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The San Jose Sharks were upset with the call that led to Joe Thornton's four-game suspension for an illegal head shot during a game against Anaheim in Game 3 of their opening-round playoff series.\nThe NHL's Department of Player Safety disagreed and suspended Thornton on Monday for the rest of the series for the hit on Ducks defenseman Josh Manson during the third period of San Jose's 7-2 victory on Saturday night.\n\"I am disappointed in the call that resulted in the suspension, but respect the process,\" Sharks general manager Doug Wilson said in a statement. \"Had we been given the opportunity to provide mitigating circumstances prior to the game, we would have obviously voiced our concerns. Further discussions with the league will take place this week, as we plan to address all available options with Joey. We will have no further comment until then.\"\nBy replacing Thornton, San Jose would be without its two top lines on their best nights. Thornton led the NHL with 104 points and captain Joe Pavelski had 77 during the regular season. Both have a game to prepare for on Tuesday night when the series shifts to Anaheim for Game 4.\nCoach Peter DeBoer said in his postgame comments that Thornton would not play in that game and added that he felt a suspension should have been given immediately after the hit. The league suspended Thornton for one game last season for boarding Winnipeg's Tobias Enstrom.\n\"It just felt like it was a bit of a missed call,\" Sharks forward Chris Tierney said after the game. \"Jumbo is one of the best players in the league. Obviously, a little bit of a frustration after the game, but there's not much you can do.\"\nManson was checked in front of his net by Thornton on Saturday night in the third period of a blowout win that extended San Jose's lead in the series to 2-1. Manson went into the boards face first with his head down. The puck was under his left arm and was on the ice when Thornton made the hit, but he was still able to slowly skate away to cheers from the crowd.\nA referee and linesman both signaled for a penalty, but the call on the ice was a collision with the boards. The penalty against Thornton was not announced and he was still not penalized. The NHL's Rule 47 states \"a player who attempts to separate a player from the puck in an attempt to lead with his head or any other reckless and dangerous play may not initiate such contact.\"\nManson didn't talk to reporters after the game and the Ducks took no action against Thornton. The league considered that inconclusive and decided against making an immediate ruling on the play.\nHowever, replays indicated the hit on Manson was probably worthy of a penalty. The hit was the second in eight games between the teams this season with Manson up against Thornton and Chicago captain Jonathan Toews.\nThe league said it met with Manson last night and he was in agreement with its decision.\nThe first video review from the regular-season head shot to suspend a player was caused by a review of another hit with similar body language. Tampa Bay forward Vladislav Namestnikov was suspended for Game 2 against Toronto, and the suspension was cut to a game by an appeals panel.\n___\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "DirecTV (NYSE:DTV.DL) already lost half a million net subscribers last quarter while the balance of its services has been growing. Gaining subscribers is notoriously difficult, with new products such as cableTV streaming floundering as they cannibalize what was once strong subscriber growth in the form of TV and Internet connections.\nHowever, investors may consider the situation even more dire now that Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) are reportedly in talks to break off ties. If the plan comes to fruition, the result could be five to 10 million lost subscribers at Disney in the next five years.\nA long-term game\nDisney is reportedly willing to lose billions on ESPN as it chases Netflix and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for viewers with sports. The Los Angeles Times says Disney's (and Comcast's) goal is to win over viewers who don't currently subscribe to ESPN and beat back Netflix's market share for sports.\nHowever, as long as it can keep viewers with linear television programming -- which is the only really profitable advertising-based business that Disney has -- a network streaming service isn't an important priority. If Disney can find willing distributors for its service, eventually, it could reap licensing fees from sports leagues for decades.\nInterestingly, Comcast has a step in Disney's backside with its own live-action sports-related product. NBCUniversal's Golf Channel, the NBA, and NHL products are the nation's four most-watched sports. NBCUniversal is about to launch a full-scale, 40-plus NBA games per year sports network.\nHowever, Comcast isn't the only source of distributors. There are a number of Asian distributors, including Wowow and KBS, who could potentially distribute Disney's new online service as well. Disney could even offer the product to consumers for a minimal fee through a streaming device (which isn't in place yet) or with a limited monthly subscription fee that would bring in a significant chunk of revenue.\nNarrowing in on the right model\nIn a recent discussion, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said his company wanted to sell more than its traditional, revenue-dependent TV services. \"And then it's what, 25 years old?\" he asked. \"[S]ome of the product even we sell today, we sold 25 years ago.\" And maybe that's what Disney and Comcast are aiming for as well.\nCable users have a very low awareness for sports channels, and that only worsens with younger viewers. They are likely already aware of Netflix. If consumers are willing to pay for a service like this, then distributors may be willing to pay a monthly fee to carry it. However, they'll only do so if the product isn't subsumed by big-ticket cable products or Netflix.\nIn the past, Disney has experimented with streaming its channels on its own proprietary service. It had trouble with Netflix, and eventually handed the streaming rights back to Netflix for even more coveted content like ESPN's content.\nTime Warner's HBO service offered by Comcast provides a potential blueprint for the two companies. HBO Go, or HBO Now, is only available on HBO Now. At first, it worked for HBO because it had a 12-year television deal in place with Comcast. But then the price difference between the Comcast service and the Sling TV offering started to affect HBO's subscriber base. In 2015, HBO reported down 4% in subscribers.\nPotential implications\nDisney is clearly focused on improving subscriber counts for its three iconic sports networks. ESPN is losing subscribers, and if it stops selling distribution rights, it could lose even more. For the first time in a decade, it won't command a premium for the rights to its live sports content. The deal Disney is in talks with Comcast could be a way to go about it.\nEven if Disney's service never gets off the ground -- which probably won't happen in the short term -- it doesn't mean it won't be a hugely successful endeavor in the long term. Disney can monetize content and grow subscribers not through direct distribution but through Web-based streaming video. Even if it never wins over customers to its new service, Disney could increase the value of its live-action sports programming and win back their attention at a later time.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "With billions of dollars at stake in every interaction, the proliferation of AI can\u2019t continue unabated. And so analytics companies and messaging platform companies are actively developing tools that let them turn conversations into data.\nVenture capital firm Microsoft Ventures today led a $13 million investment round in Rasa, a Boston-based startup whose messaging automation platform has attracted support from Blue Jeans Networks, Hortonworks, Slack, and 16 other clients (Uber, NASA, American Express, Intuit). Agile Partners, as well as Bain Capital Ventures, brought the total up to $16 million, bringing the company\u2019s total assets under management to $23 million.\nThat said, the company isn\u2019t about to rest on its laurels, not by a long shot. It\u2019s planning to use the capital to further develop its machine learning and data science services, which it refers to as \u201cconversational intelligence\u201d for messaging (CIL).\n\u201cRasa has created a new way for companies to use natural language technology \u2014 the internet\u2019s fastest growing and most popular medium \u2014 to make more intelligent decisions,\u201d said Matt Thalmayer, a general partner at Microsoft Ventures. \u201cWith technology and analytics together, [a] company can focus its efforts on nurturing high value relationships with customers, friends, and families.\u201d\nImage Credit: Rasa\nConversational conversational interfaces (CIs) are only the beginning. The company\u2019s CIL currently supports a subset of Amazon Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, enabling businesses to access recommendations, calendar events, and through Amex\u2019s card services, enable customers to manage transactions.\nIt\u2019s all powered by Rasa\u2019s Turing-compatible APIs, which parse natural language to turn conversations into predictions, solicit feedback from a wide range of third-party tools, and intelligently connect those to other platforms.\nHere\u2019s an example from Wok.io, a Brazilian startup. After a customer called to get advance notification of a special order, Rasa\u2019s platform helped them to make adjustments with the help of the restaurant\u2019s Kitchit service. It then launched requests for more purchase tickets and new tables onto the restaurant\u2019s online reservation engine.\n\u201cThe Rasa platform extends our customer life cycle by helping to develop their knowledge based on contextual data, creating new features for them, and enabling them to interact with our service agents [in] real time,\u201d said Henrique Malan, Wok.io\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201c[It] will help our system transform information and transactions into transactional events and machine [learning] based sentiment analysis.\u201d\nImage Credit: Rasa\nRasa\u2019s tools are built on open source technologies and, it claims, are fairly bug-free. Amazon Web Services\u2019 (AWS) Lambda, Google\u2019s TensorFlow, and AWS Lambda\u2019s Angular are incorporated into its core platform, as are Kubernetes containers.\nBy supporting a broad range of SaaS and cloud technologies, Rasa aims to have products \u2014 from marketing campaigns to customer service experiences to compliance notifications \u2014 more closely integrated into customer lives.\n\u201cMost of Rasa\u2019s technology was built with open-source projects that were previously designed for systems of data rather than those that were a natural fit for interactions,\u201d said Rasa\u2019s CEO, Steve Suitch. \u201c[This] technology will let us deliver power for communications at scale.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s currently going after verticals including hospitality, retail, and insurance, and it\u2019s currently testing its mobile and web integrations to some of its enterprise clients, Thalmayer said. In the coming months, it plans to launch its beta version for developers and users, which will feature an enhanced business intelligence dashboard as well as mobile and web apps.\n", "label": "machine"}

He did a really good job.\u201d\nWhen it comes to fractions of a second and flat tires, nobody on the Long Beach oval has better speed than Verstappen. On Saturday, drivers showed they can post 1:14 lap times on the track, but qualifying time became the critical element.\n\u201cWe probably lost a few tenths off the times that he did,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cThe speeds today weren\u2019t that high, but it\u2019s a 60 car race.

We are still above the line, and I think that\u2019s probably the biggest thing that we can focus on. I know that we got into the bottom of the pack, but we still got a long way to go, and I think we have an opportunity to make an impact.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Verstappen will start on the outside of Row 1 with teammate Alexander Rossi on the inside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the next race, right?\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be massive for us.

The meeting is being sponsored by Estonia, one of the leaders in AI research and development, along with a handful of organizations including SRI International, the Heartland Institute, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and Wellcome Trust.\nBaxter, speaking on a conference call with Axios's Caitlin Owens earlier this morning, said the conference conference is a \"demonstration of industry\u2019s willing to have a hand in developing the ethics and the technology necessary.\"\nHe explained that the trust between the U.S. and EU has moved from being an \"institutional imperative\" (or a good idea) to a \"when and if\" event.\n\"The fact that [the trust between the U.S. and EU] is on the agenda shows that it is a go. There was the awareness that it had to happen but it was up to the ESA (European Space Agency) and ESA to make sure that the agenda gets moved on in a timely manner.\"\n\u2014 Stephen Baxter, CEO of Digital Underground\n\"The elephant in the room [is] the West does not have the expertise on crafting privacy policies that work for all stakeholders,\" he said. \"In the light of the recent hacking of the Ashley Madison site where there is no privacy, where people and companies are waking up to the consequences of how important privacy is, no one should take anything for granted or have a shadow trusting the current rules that govern how we interact online.\"\nYes, but: Baxter said trust is likely to shift because of expectations for better technology. The difference is that tech companies such as Google, IBM, Apple, Amazon and Facebook are better placed to adapt to the challenge than tech startups \u2014 which are \"very social\" because they came from the startup world and \"have privacy specific issues.\"\nWhat's next: The conference and the role of business will only become more important to how governments deal with the issue, Baxter told Axios. \"Policy at the governmental level in fact sits right in the middle of business, of legacy systems that don't allow companies to build the privacy that is just human needs and expectation.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\nChina\u2019s Largest Stock Image Provider Shuts Website After Criticism\nShanghai\u2019s largest stock image provider has temporarily shut down its website after negative comments about its business practices by Chinese media started to flood the Internet.\nOn April 11, the Shanghai Stock image provider, Kunying, decided to suspend operations until it can \u201cresolve current issues,\u201d which included filing an investigation report, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is now monitoring the whole process.\n\u201cRegarding the official complaint on the Kunying flash stock, we are now investigating the whole matter and studying what we have to do to respond to the complaint,\u201d a U.S. official said in an e-mail, according to Newsweek\u2019s correspondent Baiju Kalesh.\nA Chinese journalist filed a complaint against Kunying for funneling investment risks back to the financial institutions investing in the stock and for not using the firm\u2019s software to measure the simulation of future price moves.\nThe CFTC request for information from Kunying focused on information about the company\u2019s trades and a September trading disaster from last year. Most of Kunying\u2019s trades on Sept. 6 were related to trades done on the SSEX exchange in Shenzhen, the Chinese city of Shenzhen, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\nIn its previous publication, On the Epoch Times, journalist Dennis Lim noted that the trades recorded on Sept. 6 involved something called an \u201cshooting star,\u201d which resembles the familiar rainbow in daylight.\nShooting star futures are securities that investors can buy only on the expectation that the stock price will move up in the future. In this case, the price of the stock did indeed move up, while the speculator did very well on the sharp profit, Lim wrote.\nIn a statement sent to On the Epoch Times, Kunying apologized for causing negative light and energy to society and instead sought to \u201chush up the issues, first,\u201d and said that the \u201cproblem of shooting star contracts\u2026has already been resolved.\u201d\n\u201cWe also forgive anyone who has fallen into the victim of our mistake. All of you here with hard hearts can go over to the Shanghai Stock image provider and show everyone a white ribbon,\u201d the company said.\nAccording to a report by the Global Times, China\u2019s top newspaper, Kunying was the fifth largest individual securities dealer last year, as well as the first loss-making firm to enter the securities industry in only two years. It had only been started in October 2016.\nAccording to the report, Kunying\u2019s founding chairman Chan-Yuan Chang had to pay $108 million to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in connection with fines to conduct due diligence checks of both the company\u2019s financial status and the Shanghai stock image provider.\nKunying is also linked to the government and the CSRC.\nIn an article about a Chinese celebrity held by South Korean authorities over allegations of being involved in money laundering, a screenshot from a video of a meeting between the Kunying founder Chang and the then-CSRC chairman Jiang Shuqing has been widely circulated on Chinese social media.\nIn the video, Chang, speaking to Zhu Lijia of the CSRC, said he didn\u2019t want the work the government has done to tarnish Yunying\u2019s image to \u201cbecome dirty.\u201d\nA screenshot from a video of a meeting between Kunying\u2019s founder Chang and the then-CSRC chairman Jiang Shuqing which widely circulated on Chinese social media. (Screenshot/Tencent)\nChang is also a shareholder in Yunying\u2019s affiliate post-IPO. \u201cThese two people coming from two different walks of life understand each other and are so close that they watch each other\u2019s speech,\u201d wrote industry analyst Tony Tao in a commentary published on WeChat. \u201cThis is a charming and poetic situation.\u201d\nWhen the alleged links with the CSRC became known, Beijing strongly criticized the South Korean government for holding onto the celebrity. Beijing closed its entry to South Korea, and withdrew quotas for investing in Korean stocks.\nAccording to sources quoted by the South China Morning Post and Bloomberg, South Korea was one of the biggest inbound destinations for Chinese investment after Hong Kong. From a combined total of $14.4 billion invested in the nation between 2005 and 2014, the country is still the fourth-largest source of foreign investment for China.\n", "label": "machine"}

What kind of compensation should teachers expect in twenty years?\nAlthough proposed increases of about $2,600 may seem negligible to some, it could be far more important for teachers, especially under-paid school teachers who own homes and who are significantly stressed at this time, when life will be even more demanding and they will be stressed further because of the effect of the Utah Senate Special Session on our state's education funding.\nThe current policy of essentially not paying college athletes is suspect. If we had received a formal offer of $2,600 for education purposes, we probably would have called it quits, found another job, and got out of the way. Since the Ute\u2019s per-student compensation rank is in the Top 10 nationally, and since the amount now being debated is far more than the pay of a mediocre college football player, perhaps it is time to offer similarly small increases to college athletes and raise the per-student compensation for educators more generally to a level which approaches their BCS counterparts in the big five conferences.\nW.

There's a brilliant philosophical teacher called Julia Brimfield and she shared that video with me. It showed it to other people and we watched it together and for an hour and 45 minutes we just had a great time. I loved watching this film and that's when I realised it was really missing out on people \u2013 because it was so fucked up! It's kind of camp.\nHow was your relationship with Charlie Shotwell and Trey Parker?\nCharlie and Trey actually bumped into each other on the tube one day and we formed a friendship and asked them if they would be in our film. Trey was sort of massive in the 90s and 80s and Charlie was absolutely massive. We talked about politics and we chatted about being adolescents and personal things. That gave us confidence about the direction we wanted to go. Trey was in genius-level form. Charlie was 17 when he wrote the script and he's grown up so much since \u2013 both have grown up since.\nCan you tell us about the origins of your relationship with Kyra Sedgwick?\nI knew Kyra from working with her husband Kevin Bacon on The Beautiful Mind way back. Kyra read my script and was blown away. She loved it, it's really a labour of love from the whole team but she really wanted to be involved. She helped us a lot in making sure that we were representing women in film properly.\nWhat have been your biggest ambitions in recent years?\nI've always kind of just wanted to be in good roles. Sometimes you do have faith in people and you want the work to just come and for it to feel great. Something from The Wife was really reflective of everything I've done since. It was on my bucket list of projects to be in after my father's death, and it still feels like there's a lot of joy in what I'm doing.\nCan you reflect on the massive impact that Social Justice Week 2018 has had locally?\nSocial Justice Week is a huge, massive, massive campaign to raise awareness of the mental health issues that are going on out there. One of the things about Hollywood \u2013 and I've seen this on other coasts \u2013 is that people who've suffered a mental illness often don't get to feel validated and treated in the way they should.\n", "label": "machine"}

First off, the original black hole, when I was on Twitter talking about it, appeared to take on a mote and blossom into a massive dotted line instead of a straight A-hole glowing a different color. There was also a second photo of the same black hole, but obscured by a shadow and indistinguishable from the first.\nWe\u2019re currently on #Halloween with a little bit of a mask on for the day.

How interesting were those two objects? How could we describe them as it appeared on the website and in the online media?\nA week or so later, we get a new photograph from the same spot. This time, the reflection is very visible. That means the object is now visible! And how can anyone express how interesting the object now is without sending people to unplayable websites? We are far from the point where we can place half a black hole next to the other and make it profound.\nFirst, if this information was being delivered in emails as part of an invitation, the pictures sent along would have to be updated as soon as someone opened up a single page, not an entire message.

{"text": "\u00d7 Late Bozak goal propels Blues past Jets in hard-fought playoff opener\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba \u2013 Winnipeg Jets backup goalie Laurent Brossoit came up with a career-high 48 saves and Patrik Laine ended with three shots and a goal in his first appearance since Feb. 8. The two goals weren\u2019t enough to lift the Jets past the St. Louis Blues, who got home-ice advantage from Nashville in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs Thursday.\nOskar Sundqvist and Joel Edmundson also scored and Ryan O\u2019Reilly had two assists in the shootout as the Blues won their second straight game and improved to 15-4 in their last 19 home playoff games.\nForbes estimated last week that the Blues have a value of $472 million, making them the 14th most valuable NHL franchise. Among the teams that are not participating in the postseason, the Blues also had the highest-selling jersey on the league\u2019s website on Thursday, despite current star Vladimir Tarasenko being out injured.\nBrossoit stopped chances throughout the game by the visitors, including Alexander Steen and Jay Bouwmeester in overtime.\nOvechkin had 11 goals and 11 assists and had 29 goals and 16 assists in a mind-boggling 48-game stretch during which he accumulated 136 points. His just over nine-minute stretch in the third period of regulation was a rousing ovation from fans at Bell MTS Place.\nHe generated nine shots during that span, including one point shot midway through. Ovechkin had a 2-on-1 early in the first period, but his first attempt into the circle was stopped by goalie Carter Hutton and his second flick in went wide.\nBrossoit\u2019s 40 first-period saves were the second-most in a playoff game in franchise history, second only to Vladislav Tretiak\u2019s 37 in 1968.\nBrossoit turned away all 15 shots in the first period, including a glove save on Patrik Berglund on the power play late.\nThe Jets are the second-best road team in the NHL, but they had trouble putting the puck in the net at Bell MTS Place. They fired 54 shots in Game 1, but Brossoit needed only 30 saves to keep the visiting team from scoring.\nSundqvist opened the scoring for the Blues on the power play at 5:57 of the second. He fired a shot from just inside the blue line that hit the post and caromed into the net.\nLaine got the game-tying goal at 14:49 of the third. He flipped a shot by Hutton that stopped just short of the crossbar.\nAfter that, it was all Blues, especially in the shootout. O\u2019Reilly gave St. Louis a 2-1 lead on his only attempt with a backhand that beat Brossoit.\nThe goal was also reminiscent of his shootout shot in the Blues\u2019 game-winning win at Nashville on March 28.\nSundqvist, Edmundson and Alex Pietrangelo each scored in the skills contest. The Swede also scored in the shootout in that game against the Predators.\nLaine had two more shots in overtime, but missed on both attempts.\nFacing the Predators for the fourth time in six weeks, the visitors eventually led 1-0, courtesy of Sundqvist\u2019s power-play goal.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\nWhat would tax day be without last-minute rushes to get services at the last minute?\nTax Day 2019 comes fast and so does the list of assistance options that are open with just a few hours left before April 15.\nHere are six things you should know to reach your destination:\n1. You may not get a completed form for free\nIf you don't already own a motor vehicle, the tax-filing site TurboTax won't automatically fill out the registration and tags page, unless you pre-filed. Once the form is sent, free information technology staff will follow up for you to finish the registration and tags.\nOn the other hand, online accountants can take a bite out of the problem in a hurry. Enter a check or routing number to complete the registration and tags pages on most sites such as H&R Block and TaxAct.\nUse TurboTax's online access on First Data's File & Pay service, a free interactive process that allows you to complete paperwork within a 90-minute window.\n2. Know who is making your tax bills go up\nTaxes already are due on April 15, 2019, but for some it'll be about double.\n\"Before you go to file your taxes, know who owes them money, including child support, alimony or medical expenses that can be deducted,\" said Julie Miller, head of consumer education at H&R Block.\nWhat's more, if you owe money to the IRS, you don't have to wait until April 15. You can pay over the phone with the IRS by phone. Unfortunately, it's usually not as easy to pay with paper or online if you don't have a balance due.\nYou can file for an extension, which extends your tax return until October 15. As long as you're still waiting to receive payment and documents from your employer, the IRS will notify you by mail that you've been granted an extension to pay.\n3. More states and cities charge fees\nSome government services are more expensive or are unavailable if you live in a certain part of the country.\nIn New York, taxpayers must pay in cash, coins or designated cards when going to file their state and local tax returns. Otherwise, they can expect to pay a maximum of $400 per return. On April 8, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill that will allow taxpayers to pay their taxes online or with prepaid cards up to $500 per return.\nAlso in New York, any non-profit or charity tax organization that accepts a contribution from taxpayers at its site must report any funds raised to the state.\nIn Massachusetts, paying taxes at the Department of Revenue website may result in a 4% processing fee.\nCalifornia requires that anyone whose tax return was deemed incomplete pay another penalty equal to double the amount of the refund or $148. The penalty is waived if the person can explain what the error was.\nAnother expensive option is if you live in Georgia, where the government costs 15% to pay a legal fee or fight a tax case, according to H&R Block.\n4. File over the phone\nTaxpayers can get help filing through the phone at all four of the country's biggest online accountants at TaxAct, H&R Block, Liberty Tax and Jackson Hewitt.\nTaxPrep.com lets you select from 15 tax preparation software packages. They'll generally charge somewhere between $50 and $95, depending on the tax laws you're filing for.\n5. Plan ahead\nThis year you'll be able to choose where to file your tax returns without also having to pay a fee. Some states charge a penalty if taxpayers don't have the paper to file their taxes with. The IRS does not.\nIf you don't have a return, you can file a Form 4868 and keep an income statement, the census, or other supporting documents. If you're filing electronically, the tax can be added to your bill.\n6. If you owe money, it's always a good idea to go back and review your tax statements.\nBeing underpaid could still be avoided by looking at the individual tax bills that are still in your mailbox. Review the bill carefully and compare it to your earlier tax statements to see if you can see why you may be underpaid.\nDepending on the company you're using, you can also try visiting the website of the tax authority that issued the bill. They can offer further verification by going through your forms or return. If they do verify that you're underpaid, they can allow you to pay as \"soon as possible\" the penalty and interest you owe, according to Miller.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By Rusty Vanneman, CFA, CLS Investments\nThe ETF growth story is changing. While most investors still think of ETFs as investing vehicles with a liquidity menu, they are seeing more and more products integrated into core portfolios, and other opportunities are developing to streamline holdings into ETFs.\nTake returns. To understand where the ETF asset inflow is coming from, examine the composition of the ETF industry. According to mutual fund, state, corporate, and ETF data, the primary drivers of ETF inflows in the past five years have been bond, equity and international equity flows. Of the $2.6 trillion in assets under management, the chart below shows about 30% of funds have been in bonds and equity funds. That leaves about 60% of assets in international and country funds. Overseas and country funds are predominately emerging market funds, of which Asian markets account for a lion\u2019s share (e.g., China and Korea).\nA recent forecast from ETFGI (an ETF industry consulting and research firm) points to an ETF industry with assets of $4.5 trillion by 2015. And the biggest growth opportunity in the ETF industry is growth of business in emerging markets. We see ETFs driving emerging market growth, particularly in strategic iShares market segments.\nHow are investors engaged with ETFs beyond their core investment exposures? Look for ETFs to compliment core positions in core investments. Core holdings generally comprise 80% of an asset allocation portfolio. The other 20% is split across investments, with international and country funds accounting for the lion\u2019s share. Our advice is to buy ETFs against the core to reduce the need for international and country accumulation.

{"text": "Rhys Keeney (pictured right), 18, had a history of drug abuse but would not try drugs again, the inquest has heard\nA teenager who died after his car smashed into a 40-tonne tanker was a loving family man who had dreams of becoming a hairdresser.\nRhys Keeney, 18, and a female friend died at the scene of the crash in Treetops Lane, Fenix, West Dunbartonshire, when his Peugeot 308 veered across a carriageway and ploughed into the tanker.\nThe fatal collision happened in May last year and last week an inquest heard how he had a history of drug abuse but would not try drugs again.\nCllr John Davidson said that Rhys, an emerging star at his local football club, lived a charmed life until he started taking cocaine and ecstasy.\nHe added: 'It deteriorated, but he was a loving, caring son and a complete gentleman. We loved Rhys.\n'He didn't regret any of it. At times he was quite wild. He had ambitions of becoming a hairdresser. He had dreams of going to university.\n'He moved out, did a bit of partying and all that. When he started using cocaine and ecstasy it became a big problem and he just couldn't stop himself.\n'He put the glasses away at home, went to Pensburgh (a centre which trains youths for a career in hairdressing) to play on the skill team and hope for the best. But he couldn't turn the corner.\n'He was suffering mental health issues and couldn't come to terms with that.'\nMother, Melanie, told the court how her son and friend had gone for a ride in the late afternoon of the day he died.\nShe went on: 'He texted me, saying \"how are you, darling, it's Rippy please pick me up.\" It was a typical text message.\n'He said he wasn't sure where they were going or what they were doing, but we'd both be there after finishing work.'\nShe later heard that they had had a short drive before then the whole of a North-east-bound carriageway was blocked as the Tees Valley and Forth and Clyde Canal gateway had to be shut.\nShe said: 'I got a terrible call just after midnight from the police to say, \"they have crashed, your son is dead\".'\nEnglishman William Thornhill-Smith was driving the tanker, and Margaret Keen, who found the wreckage on the side of the road, said it was wrapped up in such a way as to prevent external examination of it.\nRecording a verdict of accidental death at the Dundee Sheriff Court, Sheriff Ronald Williamson said there was no evidence of criminal culpability for either Carraig Gael footballer Rhys or his friend, Chloe Mitchell, also 18, who is thought to have been the driver of the car when it crashed.\nMr Davidson said Rhys, pictured, an emerging star at his local football club, lived a charmed life until he started taking cocaine and ecstasy, the inquest heard\nIn his personal observations, the sheriff said: 'Mr Keeney died in tragic circumstances as a result of the loss of control due to a mechanical malfunction and I cannot blame anyone else for Rhys's death.\n'Under the circumstances it is a tragic accident.'\nHis mother added: 'One doesn't usually think of a child being involved in something so serious. He was just doing what any young person would have done at this time.\n'Some of his friends say he did not make a good decision but I say he was doing the right thing.'\nAs Rhys' mother wept into her hands, she added: 'I know he is a horrible words, but that's the truth. He made a horrible mistake.\n'He was very brave. He didn't need to do that and he didn't. He would not have done that to his mates. He would not have done that to himself.\n'Everyone has missed him since he died. His best mate, Chloe, his role model, his friend, Rhys, and then of course him and Katherine. We miss them but we still love them.'\nRhys' father, Joe, said: 'What we loved about him was the fact he was a son to us and a brother to Katherine, and he would do anything for anyone.\n'If he was at the hairdressers it wasn't about being a celebrity, it was just about making a hairdresser look as good as possible. He loved to make people look good.'\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Calm seemed to have returned to the streets of Tayport after \u201cstampede\u201d scenes yesterday.\nA huge boost to the village\u2019s coffers was the most tangible reward of the most bizarre holiday ever to affect this part of Angus.\nSources say there were more than 300 people lined up and down the village\u2019s main high street, but not all were locals.\nAfter protracted negotiations, civic leaders at Tayport Recreation Ground today announced the first of the two national chess grandmasters to grace the village in years would be part of The Queen\u2019s Birthday tournament.\nThe tournament, being held from April 25 to May 4 at Lindores House, is hosted by the Abbey\u2019s board of governors.\nChess coach Gavin Harper will also be available to help children aged eight and over during the time.\nLast night, 40 chess-mad youngsters, all under 14, gathered with their parents and village councils to celebrate the momentous coup.\nAfter each childhood game, organisers took turns to shake hands, sign postcards and give local council bosses, such as Fife co-leader and Tayport SL Gordon Matheson, a quick lesson.\nMr Matheson said: \u201cThe kids are all over the place and asked me all sorts of questions. They\u2019ve got so much enthusiasm for chess and for all of the other competitions involved.\u201d\nTayport SL councillor Danny McCuish, who brought the event together, said it would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be a sell-out.\nCompetition organisers are keen to include more competitions including uk-style in the junior tournaments, eventually leading to a junior category at the national championships.\nOver the six-day week, the event will also include cricket and Badminton.\nPlayers will range from aged between eight and 14 but some non-players will be allowed on the grounds.\nA buzz has since spread on the community in community clubs up and down the town.\nThe holiday looks likely to result in a substantial increase in income for Tayport.\nIn good years, ticket prices for Lindores would hover around \u00a320, while the activation of outside the village walls, including as a hub for the kids, would bump up income.\nIn a bid to put the best possible case for his village, Norman Findlay, chairman of the Renewal Board, thanked out supporters and announced: \u201cLet\u2019s raise \u00a310,000.\u201d\nHe is betting against funding issues holding up whatever benefits come from the tournament.\nThe panel is projecting an interest figure of 4,000 registrations and is counting on 2500 spectators, more than double the 2,000 for last year\u2019s event.\nCash sponsorship will fund much of the event from April 15 to the end of the week.\nFree advertising, busking, posters and signage will be used to market the event, with publicity efforts coordinated by the Tout Ink initiative, with coin donations benefiting the charity.\nChairman of the board/Derek Coburn, said: \u201cWe believe that we have the opportunity to engage a large number of people in Tayport at a cheap price.\n\u201cWe have to factor in everything that we do here, from our involvement with OUTWARD to the creation of our own, much loved, Tout Ink.\u201d\nA total of \u00a310,000 is being offered to the winning home, with possible prize money on offer for schools and clubs along with other groups and individuals involved.\nIt is estimated that the new and restored Lindores Club house on the reserve will be attracting some 120 players to the week from 16 countries.\nThe 19 year-old unit will be elevated to a full colony in the new year, a status that comes with a game deck, chess kit and a postcode of our liking.\nTo be crowned king, one player will have to overcome a list of obstacles including defeating an all-star team made up of the Dundee Chairman, whose 7,000 followers span the globe, the international grandmaster Kenneth Orr, 32, who has played more than 28,000 games and travelled 6,400,000 miles from Scotland, Romania, China, Latvia, Kenya, Hawaii, New Zealand, Scotland and South Africa.\nThe mighty Bobby Fischer had previously had the privilege of meeting Orr.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "5370537724001\nHe was too amenable to media at his appointment, how could he be any different as a NRL captain?\nNewcastle Knights enforcer James Tamou believes his battle-hardened personality is ideal for leading Penrith from a cellar-dweller into contention this season.\nWhile others in the Panthers coaching team can be dismissive or stiff, Tamou exudes a likable easy-going nature, which both will be important to the junior coach ahead of their clash at Bathurst's Centre of Excellence.\n\"I've been living with the leadership group for a while now and it's only going to help me, especially with how deep we are in the competition this year,\" he said.\n\"We don't have much margin for error. The guys are hungry and 100 per cent looking forward to playing the Panthers at the weekend.\"\nTamou assumed the leadership of the joint club from Nathan Cleary and Tim Grant earlier this month when Cleary was promoted to the coach's job at halfback after last year's premiership winner Isaac John was stood down.\n\"No real grief at training, no real confrontation with the coaches,\" he said.\n\"I was captain last year but I think you will see more leadership in the leadership group with the way the halves come through.\n\"We have a strong friendship group, good blokes and can come from all different walks of life.\"\nUnlike many a debut NRL captain-like John Eales or last season's Sonny Bill Williams, Tamou readily admits he'll sometimes have less or more training than older members of the squad.\n\"There's big moments coming up, there's no point beating yourself up about it,\" he said.\n\"Training starts at 4pm. As long as we're the fittest we can be then that's all that matters.\"\nTamou says he is further ahead than when he started in the NRL last year and does not believe changing coaches will have any detrimental impact on Panthers fans believing in him.\n\"There's no pressure on me,\" he said.\n\"I believe what I do and there will be no pressure on me as a captain.\n\"It's not about myself. The boys are full of confidence.\"\nAsked about his involvement in Melbourne's Origin camp earlier this year after a heated exchange on the eve of the game, Tamou replied with an unexpected yelp of laughter.\n\"I got pulled over for speeding,\" he said.\n\"I honestly thought I was going to get pulled over and have a beer with Shane (Clancy), whether Shane didn't like me or didn't want me to be captain.\n\"He was very amused.\n\"He was like 'what the f---' and kept laughing.

{"text": "This content was published on April 14, 2019 11:02 AM\nBern said the painting didn't meet the criteria for deciding where it should go (Keystone)\nThe Kunstmuseum in Berlin has agreed to accept the contentious loan of the painting Landscape with a Small Plant by Rene Magritte. Officials said they were relieved the long-standing saga surrounding the piece had come to an end.\nThe Bern Museum of Fine Arts had rejected a museum-wide loan request for the image (seen below) because it did not suit Bern\u2019s space and budget. The Bern city authorities had made other, more generous offers but the Polish owners of the Magritte piece did not respond.\n+ More on the controversy surrounding Magritte\nNow the proposed loan has been agreed between the two museums. The curator of Bern\u2019s Mayennial exhibitionexternal link, Andre Ignace Audien, said he was relieved that the saga had finally ended. The exhibition opened in Bern last November and will run until June 16.\nWith a height of 34.1cm and a diameter of 35.6cm, the works has been hanging in the Museum of Fine Arts for over 20 years.\nThe Bernese city government said it was grateful that the dispute had been ended. The figure of 1.5m francs (about $1.6m) has also been withdrawn from the budget for the event.\n\u201cAn artists\u2019 loan is a critical element for any exhibition which aims to enhance the experience of art,\u201d said Bern city spokesman G\u00fcnther Kunz.\n\u201cThe annexation of the painting would have had an even more negative impact.\u201d\nHe said the Church of Liebermannexternal link, the symbol of Bern, had not supported the undertaking.\nThe Church of Liebermann had opposed the loan out of concern that the overall exhibition value would have been diminished. A theological meeting of the Freiheitstiftung Liebermannsexternal link, the church\u2019s religious foundation, decided in February to put the decision to the family of Liebermann\u2019s patron: Bertha Schwarz, as well as to her great-niece, the artist Anna Schwarz who is an active member of the foundation. Both set out their opinions at the time.\nCourts battles\nEarlier this year the end was dragged out by court battles, legal opinions, language difficulties and appeals from both sides. Bern had earlier felt confident about its position \u2013 with the museum saying the Magritte did not live up to the requirements of leaving a public museum.\nIn March Magritte\u2019s family announced that the painting had been sold at a SFr650,000 auction in Manhattan last year. They believed there was a strong possibility that it had not been in Liebermann\u2019s possession in the time it was registered as a national treasure, and thus the Bernois had no right to touch it.\nThe Moscow City Museum had offered a loan of another painting by Magritte \u2013 Flowers on a White Venetian Rug, viewed as an equally strong security to Bern. The Bern local authorities threatened legal action to stop the sale.\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The majority of a studio\u2019s investment should go toward creating a first-person shooter or a sprawling action title, an investor who participated in a $11 million funding round for Skybound Games told Variety Tuesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a publisher,\u201d Christopher Lucero, an investor who helped raise the money told Variety. \u201cLots of people have tried to make AAA console games and it hasn\u2019t really worked for many. We\u2019re hoping we can do a little better.\u201d\nSkybound is the new video game division of the comic book publisher founded by Robert Kirkman, Mark Millar, and Sean Furst.\nLucero\u2019s take on the industry comes at a time when console developers have seen a sizable drop-off in third-party interest, which is reflected in fourth-quarter results at Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive, as well as at a number of other big publishers.\nValve announced it has shuttered 19 studios and will only focus on two as part of the company\u2019s new direction. Game makers are also feeling an abundance of pressure to release triple-A, blockbuster titles at a time when game budgets are skyrocketing and hardware sales are falling.\nRelated 'Outlast' Gets Live-Action Film, Teaser Trailer Valve Reveals New Open Source Gaming Tools\nLucero said Skybound\u2019s strategy has been to eschew publishing third-party titles in favor of creating its own games, betting the majority of their spending will go toward building them \u2014 but in an industry where spending in almost any area has been curtailed, the odds are that\u2019s a risk not worth taking.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to position ourselves more as a publisher than a dev house,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that publishers are backing away from third-party publishing.\u201d\nSkybound wants to develop first-person shooters, action games, and role-playing games, and knows they\u2019ll take a large investment.\n\u201cIn order to create a first-person shooter or action game, you need to spend $5 million, maybe $10 million, if not more,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re going to spend a good deal more than other publishers.\u201d\nLucero said the funding should allow the studio to greenlight and develop another game next year. The company has been active so far in the independent games scene, including making \u201cPasture,\u201d in partnership with developer Bulkhead Games, which was inspired by Team Fortress 2 and is an 8-bit pixel art style action game.\nOn the biggest game in development at the moment, which Lucero declined to identify, Skybound Games is looking for someone else to distribute it. It\u2019s an all-Bethesda game, but Lucero says they have good relationships with third parties.\nOverall, they\u2019re aiming to start making triple-A games in five years and are starting by aligning with a publisher to help them get there.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aligned with a publisher who already has their arms around triple-A,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cWe\u2019re supporting those games.\u201d\nThey\u2019re determined to be independent, with a priority on developing games with large investments, but it also wants to make money \u2014 whether that\u2019s selling pre-orders, the sale of physical copies, or publishing through their own label, Lucero said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be on this planet forever, so this needs to be something that we\u2019re comfortable putting our money in and supporting,\u201d Lucero said. \u201cWe have several projects we\u2019re working on.

{"text": "I review a lot of headsets at GamesBeat, and one of my favorites is the Tritton Kunai Pro. It\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s an excellent headset that uses 7.1 surround sound as its primary selling point. If you want to take your gaming experience to the next level without breaking the bank, this thing is definitely for you.\nIt\u2019s also a great upgrade over the standard Kunai headset. The Kunai Pro does not use any technology we\u2019ve seen before, and it costs $99 instead of $129. It sounds better and is a little easier to put on and off than the standard headset. The user interface features a lot of intuitive features, and it also comes with two wireless surround-sound-ready Xbox One controllers. All of that makes the Tritton Kunai Pro worth serious consideration.\nWhat you\u2019ll like\nGood sound\nTritton provides clarity without losing any of that low frequency audio. This has obvious value on more complex games with tight matches and irritating music. When I played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, the surround-sound system blended well to the game and helped me hear where I was shooting. That\u2019s awesome.\nIt is also a lot more easy to put on than the standard Kunai. I have a tendency to throw up on myself with friends and I usually need help getting the headset on \u2014 especially when I try to bend the earpieces or force myself to look up. With the Pro, it is a piece of cake to put on.\nSurround-sound module and two Xbox One wireless controllers\nWhile I don\u2019t find the above to be groundbreaking, it\u2019s better than nothing. I\u2019ve been playing a lot of games with a gap in the center of the action. With the center speaker generating the surround-sound field, the other six speakers in the console hear the character footsteps or weapons fire from point A to point B with a broad view. That\u2019s important to me for level design, but it\u2019s less practical for some fast-paced action. The Pro provides a multi-piece solution for bridging that gap and filling a living room with a sense of immersion.\nThis is neat because you get a separate battery pack. You connect it to your Xbox One controller (of course), and then you can use the rear of the Kunai Pro as a wireless booster to provide the console a more complete audio experience. I\u2019ve not had a problem with either unit on my Xbox One yet, but you do have to make sure that the battery pack is on the right device or at least the one connected to your console.\nWhat you won\u2019t like\nVariable volume\nComponents of the Kunai Pro aren\u2019t particularly inexpensive. For example, the two wireless controllers cost $40. That is a lot of money, and I didn\u2019t like that. If I wanted to hear just the centers of games I also have to turn down the speakers on my TV. This is a design drawback.\nAnother issue I have with the setup is that while the headset has the ability to adjust your volume, it doesn\u2019t do anything to adjust the actual volume on a console. When you listen to music on a Nintendo Switch, it makes your headset sound better for a moment, but then you can never tell that there is any added bass because your earphones provide enough separation. With the Pro, I can\u2019t tell if the sound has been boosted or not. It\u2019s better in some areas than others, but I only found it perfect if I wasn\u2019t listening to music.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Share\nEarlier this year, we called Clash Royale \u201cthe world\u2019s most popular mobile game\u201d after six months of being at number one. That title is passed around often in the gaming world, but when Clash Royale collects $1 billion in sales it is not attributed to just a few hours of play or a cheap price tag. It is a product of the revenue that it earns through its cross-promotional partnerships with other brands such as Doritos.\nThis is why it is interesting that game developer Supercell \u2014 home of Clash Royale and other blockbuster mobile titles \u2014 and recently acquired game streaming platform FlixPlay decided to bring the two companies together.\nBut as the pair tries to bridge the gap between mobile and home television, the question of how great a role streaming services such as Twitch will play in games development is raising questions.\nTV and games are often perceived to be mutually exclusive, but it is clear that the crossover is growing. Through tools such as Daedalus Games and TBS3, developers can more easily have content made available directly to gamers on home console consoles or PCs in much the same way that streaming services like YouTube and Twitch help keep gamers engaged, but also allow them to pick and choose what they want to watch. In short, smaller developers now have an easier, and cheaper, way to reach out to the player base.\nBut this problem goes beyond just the creative approach of developing mobile games. As mobile gaming has become more popular in recent years, many developers have also added streaming functionality into mobile games through their own applications. These apps would then be released on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network through a regular dashboard application on your device, rather than a more traditional mobile app \u2014 the app would become a streaming service available to players through that platform, thus making it more accessible. The problem with this approach is that it reduces the cost of the game, potentially making it more accessible to a wider audience.\nSo, is it time that we retire the idea of a traditional \u201cvideo game\u201d (desktop PC or game console included)?\nIt is interesting that it is time that we retire the idea of a traditional \u201cvideo game\u201d (desktop PC or game console included). We\u2019ve been finding increasingly creative ways to play video games over the past few years, and some of those are starting to find market in the real world. But the issue is that most mobile users do not have the experience or inclination to play a full-fledged video game. They may have a desktop or laptop, but these devices also work very differently than the traditional PC or game console.\nThe question is: does the real world also need a new type of gaming experience?\nFor those unfamiliar with the current state of the trend, most people view any game that is streamed over mobile devices and console as being played in a \u201cnatural\u201d fashion, as in the way a game should be played. Simply, anything that people like to watch, whether it is a series of DIY YouTube videos, a steak-eating contest, or a high-paying poker tournament, is seen as being related to gaming. An attempt to combine these two avenues could create a television show or even a documentary with real-world implications \u2014 and we\u2019ve seen examples of this already, from things like the video game-inspired fashion show \u201cStyle Savvy With Kate Jackson\u201d to \u201cDara and Jesse\u2019s Game On\u201d series that follows the pair of entrepreneurial cousins.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Subaru will unveil the 2019 Outback, along with 11 models in total, at the 2017 New York International Auto Show, but the reveal has arrived early -- thanks to Cars.com, at least. A small video of the new Outback shows what we can expect, such as the new 12.3-inch touchscreen display, and a turbocharged engine.\nSubaru's 8.0-inch infotainment system features Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and the 2.0-liter four-cylinder standard, which achieves 231 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, a number that holds steady from last year's Outback. A 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder is also on tap as a stopgap while Subaru waits for a full-on 2.5-liter turbo inline-4 to arrive later this year. If you want better performance, you'll have to opt for the 155-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder.\nAccording to a report from Automotive News, which has spent a lot of time at Subaru's test track in New Mexico, this Outback Turbo gets 368 horsepower and a decent 369 pound-feet of torque. Just how interesting a beast it is is unclear -- A 120-horsepower Sport Line trim is available, but the turbo engine lacks a Sportline performance package. It's worth noting that the supercharged Subaru WRX WRX could also get a turbo engine, so the outback and WRX could share several underpinnings.\nThe new engine means that the only outgoing 2018 Outback standard equipment to keep is a backup camera, heated driver's seat and paddle shifters. The tailgate is not mounted to the roof, but is now capable of opening forward.\nWe have no idea what Subaru might introduce in New York, but with the car's trailer mount design, we'd bet a high-priced Outback Golf would surface. Subaru is expected to unveil the current model in New York on Wednesday evening, with an unveiling of the new model to follow Friday morning.\nUpdate, 5:09 p.m. ET: Added more details.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "AUSTIN \u2014 After months of intense negotiations, the Texas Senate passed an amendment late Saturday night aimed at reducing the cost of homeowners insurance by $500 million.\nSenate Bill 764, sponsored by Sen. John Carona, R-Dallas, was approved on a 37-to-7 vote, and will be sent to the House, which has passed similar legislation in the past. Carona anticipates the two chambers will iron out the differences, which involve whether states with historical driver records should be counted in the dollar amount a property's burden is at the end of a year, and whether a property can be hit up for a yearly on-your-anniversary fee to compensate.\nSenate Bill 764 would reduce the average Texas home insurance premium from $1,599 to $1,013. The insurance industry has been pushing for this bill for months, saying it will reduce the cost of homeowners insurance by lowering the surcharges associated with Texas' unfair property assessment system.\nKaren Biermann, chief executive of the Insurance Council of Texas, said the reduction in the average policy would be welcomed, but she cautioned that it does not do enough to fundamentally correct the system.\n\"It does solve one of the biggest problems we have with our system,\" she said, \"but does not fix the problem.

{"text": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday downplayed the chances of offshore drilling, even as President Donald Trump's administration seeks to allow drilling \u2014 a proposal that would require state lawmakers to vote on the issue.\nA Trump administration proposal to open up U.S. waters for exploration would have to be passed by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, and DeSantis.\nDeSantis, in an interview with the Orlando Sentinel, said he has asked state officials \"in a top-down way\" to seek \"information and discussion\" about possible issues surrounding drilling.\n\"I'm going to work with them. I think a lot of it depends on how we come out of that conversation,\" said DeSantis, a member of the executive committee of a lobbying organization representing the oil and gas industry.\nA new Trump administration proposal \u2014 which would still have to be passed by the BOEM \u2014 would expand offshore oil exploration and drilling in almost all Gulf of Mexico waters and part of the Atlantic Ocean off Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and possibly other states.\nCurrently, only part of the Gulf of Mexico and the state-controlled part of the Atlantic Ocean are considered off-limits to oil drilling, and Trump's plan could affect three other areas that are not in state control \u2014 the eastern edge of the eastern Pacific and waters around the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\nThe area Trump's plan would affect spans more than 74,000 square miles and includes parts of the Northern Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida, the eastern edge of the eastern Pacific Ocean off California, waters around Hawaii and Alaska, and waters around the Aleutian Islands in the western Pacific.\nFlorida lawmakers in 2001 enacted a law prohibiting oil and gas drilling from state waters. The state wouldn't have a vote on whether to expand off-shore oil exploration and drilling, according to a BOEM official.\nThe BOEM proposal announced April 4 also would allow leases in areas that are open to oil and gas development now \u2014 as well as expand a search for fossil fuels beyond the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which had been the target of a drilling boom in the 1970s.\nThe plans allow for some modifications to areas currently off-limits to exploration. The plan would take at least a decade to develop.\nSen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, earlier this month wrote to the state BOEM director and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke complaining about the offshore drilling proposal.\nBaxley suggested in the letter that those responsible for the move should have consulted with \"the political leadership of the state,\" which he described as an overwhelming \"no\" vote.\n\"In Florida, we realize that drilling for oil off our coast would not only pose a significant risk to our coastal communities and marine life, but also cause drastic economic harm,\" Baxley wrote.\nIn response to the Trump administration plan, DeSantis, in a statement Thursday, said \"we will never allow the offshore drilling process to become a political football.\"\n\"For the safety of our citizens and an immediate and complete safe alternative to the existing federal permitting and drilling process, the state will have to determine its own path,\" DeSantis said.\nZinke, in a separate statement, said Friday the energy plan \"will not be derailed by Washington politics\" and that \"America's energy leaders can and must continue to push to keep our nation energy independent and safe.\"\nIn addition to DeSantis, Brevard County is watching the proposed expansion of offshore drilling.\nAtlantic-area counties Gov. Rick Scott has largely ignored or avoided taking a stand on the plan to open up the public portion of U.S. waters for exploration or drilling until recently.\n\"Citizens in my Florida delegation to Congress and the governor need to understand the growing numbers of Floridians strongly oppose offshore drilling,\" said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Lake Worth Democrat who represents central Brevard County, including Cape Canaveral.\n\"No matter how you slice it, it would be catastrophic for our entire coastal community,\" she said, noting she works with people on the Space Coast.\n", "label": "machine"}

But a happy ending seems unlikely.\nHBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series is building toward its final eight episodes, which will premiere this summer. Casting is underway for a handful of youngsters to appear in the final chapter. But other than that, the network has promised that the series about medievalized family feuds will be \u201cbigger, scarier, more thrilling and more spectacular\u201d than ever before.\nProducers have said the final episodes will be based on a new novella, \u201cA Dream of Spring,\u201d by George R.R. Martin, author of the \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d fantasy series of novels on which the show is based. Here are some questions that remain unanswered as the countdown to the final episode\u2019s release begins:\nTHE PERSONS IN WHITE\nRed weather pervades the world of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d from fires to the season\u2019s giant death storms. Yet fans have still not grasped what the white walkers, ancient white-faced creatures who may ultimately destroy the world, actually are.\nIs the story told in the upcoming final episodes about Daenerys\u2019 return to Winterfell, where she once lost her children? Is this finally the homecoming that may finally convince Jon Snow, the bastard son of Ned Stark, to place himself at the head of the army of the North, against the wishes of Cersei Lannister, who leads the Lannister clan? Is their old enemy, the incestuous Queen Regent, getting revenge?\nWe have seen a few glimpses of the white walkers, mostly through their constant movement through the forests and frozen arctic regions. Are they part of Daenerys\u2019 war for the Iron Throne, or are they simply taking the best of her character \u2014 which is astonishing in itself \u2014 to defend the world against their rise?\nTRICKER, TRICKER\nDon\u2019t be fooled by Prince Charming, or the elves who chase after her. Daenerys is not exactly open to love. She may be a queen in robes, but can we really assume that she enjoys hugging and kissing someone or standing with him at a formal event?\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has shown that the most important love stories are those between manipulated men like Dany\u2019s husband, Khal Drogo, and her lovers \u2014 in future seasons, perhaps Jon Snow \u2014 who do as they are told. Will she finally risk the displeasure of Cersei, the father of her dragons, to shake things up and take out that baby she secretly wants?\nFORGOTTEN LOVERS\nThe creators of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d have often said they wanted the series to feature the most romantic relationships on television. Who are the few couples still going strong from the series thus far?\nKit Harington and Rose Leslie, who played Jon Snow and Ygritte, respectively, both seem on good terms, if only so they can make their sex scenes more complicated. Other couples who may have survived for longer than some of us are likely to be caught in the act? Cersei and Jaime, Daenerys and Khal Drogo.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate on Monday told the Supreme Court that 36 businessmen fled the country in recent past, claiming they were not liable to be nabbed in connection with pending cases, and include Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi.\nIn its plea seeking custodial interrogation of Mallya, the ED has also named Rohit Bansal, promoter of companies under Enforcement Directorate ambit and also chairman of Central Information Commission (CIC), as an accused in this case.\nThe probe agency, in its plea in the apex court, has claimed that Bansal was a fugitive from the country and, as promoter of companies under its purview, he absconded to avoid being questioned in pending case of alleged alleged money laundering.\nThe ED, while mentioning the issues related to Mallya, also named Bansal for allegedly transferring funds through sham transactions and divergence of data regarding transfers to shell companies to evade criminal prosecution.\nIn the application, the ED has said the cash deposit of \u20b9 3 crore with the Enforcement Directorate in the Mallya case had come under the ambit of criminal investigation, given that he is an accused in the bank fraud and frauds cases registered by the agency against him.\n\u201cOn the face of it, the cash deposit of 3 crore with the ED being under the jurisdiction of criminal investigation, is alleged to have been taken in conspiracy with others which the ED is investigating,\" the petition said.\nAppearing for the ED, senior counsel M.R. Farooqui told a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi that an investigation officer had informed the CBI about the cash deposit made by Mallya during his month-long visit to the country in late 2016 and the amount was subsequently sent to him as advance on an authorised account.\nThe court, however, said that the probe agency should apprise it of its findings on the basis of which Mallya was remanded to CBI custody. The court was hearing an appeal filed by Mallya seeking quashing of an alleged ED case in connection with the alleged bank fraud and frauds case against him in which he was earlier sent to CBI custody for 14 days.\nThe ED, in its plea, has said that it had apprehended that there is a possibility of Mallya financier DM New York Real Estate, a United States entity which allegedly deposited \u20b9 104 crore with it during Mallya\u2019s visit and claimed that the cash deposit was made on instructions from him.\nThe ED has also alleged that Mallya owed \u20b9 1,000 crore to almost 40 banks, of which \u20b9 1,032 crore is as a secured loan and \u20b9 162 crore as unsecured loan. During his custodial interrogation, Mallya disclosed that assets were concealed with the agency and he stated that he was only an associate of New York Real Estate Company, the ED has said.\nIn addition, another accused Ramesh Vaidyanathan, who is a non-executive director in Mallya\u2019s liquor company Diageo Plc, was expected to depose before the ED in connection with the case on 4 April but he had not done so, the plea alleged.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In 1999, before his tragic death in a plane crash, Kennedy stepped into the pages of George \u2014 now called The Atlantic \u2014 and quickly became a celebrity editor-at-large who dared, on paper, to challenge his own family.\nAbout six months before his death, John F. Kennedy Jr. stepped into the pages of the now-defunct (and very much legendary) George magazine. In those pages, he reinvented himself as an editor-at-large and dared to challenge his own family.\n\u201cGeorge, I had become,\" he wrote. \"The media was a dangerous and growing presence in our home \u2014 my brother John may have been the best at keeping a steady footing, but when David Broder invaded on a hot day, I was uncomfortable.\"\nKennedy publicly shamed his family, but it was a brave step \u2014 then and now \u2014 to go against his family's old guard.\nJack Shafer of Slate made a similar point in February, when he wrote about the lack of contemporary culture that breaks with the Kennedy story and wrote, \"JFK Junior\u2019s biography collection George, first published in 1999 and by New York Times bestseller lists for weeks, was anything but an autobiography. Despite its proximity to the cult, Kennedy\u2019s ambition transcended his family\u2019s, a fact that can make his family\u2019s influence almost indiscernible from his own life.\"\nInitially, Kennedy was hesitant to take on such a role. \"I just thought that it was the right thing to do,\" he told The Times' Rick Gladstone in a 2013 interview. \"I felt almost like I was asking my parents to throw me under the bus. And I thought, What was the point of that?\"\nBut George's publisher convinced him, and shortly before his June 29, 1999, death in a plane crash over the Atlantic Ocean with his wife, Carolyn Bessette, and baby daughter, Grace, he became a celebrity editor-at-large who by one count was reading 500 to 600 letters and emails a day.\nAlthough the article considered the 42-year-old politician a bit of a nuisance, he admits in the piece, \"We decided to write about him with an openly sympathetic tone. Then, after we got it all over the newspaper, the family started calling. First my sister Kathleen, then [my mother] Rose, then my brother Joseph, then Caroline. You can imagine the pressure my family felt on that day.\"\nNot only did Kennedy openly challenge his own family, but his story reflected another aspect of his personal values: a celebration of personal freedom, a \"don't over-think\" attitude and a belief in making choices that would benefit people.\n\"I'd write the email for the second or third time, and I'd love seeing it and reading it so much that I'd usually make a mistake,\" he says in the interview with The Times. \"[Now] it's difficult for me to think of something that I wrote today, because it's in that gray area.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

Directed by Joe Berlinger, the film stars Zac Efron as Ted Bundy, the serial killer who terrorized the country. The trailer focuses on the conviction of his previous crime victims, but if you don\u2019t have knowledge of the killings, the trailer highlights the psychological impact of the crimes on his victims as well as their families.\nIt\u2019s a fittingly disquieting trailer, and you have to love Efron putting himself through this process. Given the mythology that Bundy built around himself, it\u2019s also a necessary interview, and it makes a plot point where Efron\u2019s character tries to turn away from Bundy\u2019s depravity, as well as admitting it was the only way that he could exist. But while I\u2019m interested to see Efron take on a modern-day serial killer, the film is still in need of a script. For now, I\u2019m going to put my faith in Berlinger\u2019s direction and let Efron do all the heavy lifting to prove he can hold his own in the role.\nCheck out the Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile trailer below.

{"text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global corruption costs more than $1 trillion annually in terms of lost tax revenue and delayed resource allocation, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.\nThe IMF and Transparency International, a watchdog group, both predicted an increase in emerging market corruption after the global financial crisis and a rash of public executions and political infighting by entrenched figures in their countries.\nCorruption is often confined to a minority and largely comprises inefficient taxing governments that suppress economic growth and impose high taxes on the majority, they said.\n\"In terms of loss of tax revenue, there has been real growth in corruption in recent years,\" said Timothy Callen, IMF director of economics. \"If you look at the last 20 years, you have seen rising annual rates. This isn't really a limited problem to one government or something like that.\"\nIn India, for example, President Pranab Mukherjee threatened to dissolve the Parliament on Sunday and call a general election if a defeated ruling coalition party does not take steps to curb corruption.\nWhile the world's governments have strived in recent years to combat corruption, more resources and enforcement are needed to defeat it, the IMF and Transparency International said.\nTax evasion, lack of public transparency, ineffective national laws and corruption deep in local governments in both rich and poor countries all contribute to these losses, they said.\nPrivate companies are also increasing their exposure to corruption, as the number of corruption-prone countries has increased, the groups said.\n\"Taxes are global in the sense that people globally pay them, so there has been an increase in the total amount of tax evasion and tax avoidance globally,\" Callen said.\nDeveloping countries in the Asia Pacific are among the most corrupt areas of the world, the IMF and Transparency International said. Corruption also persisted despite tougher anti-corruption efforts in Latin America.\nDevelopment by Transparency International experts in more than 100 countries also confirmed that stronger economies do not translate into higher levels of corruption.\n\"From the regional perspective we are seeing some countries that have seen higher growth...still have more corruption than others,\" Callen said.\nHe noted that the G20 has laid out a list of best practices in combating corruption, which includes increasing revenue by fighting evasion through modernized tax laws, cracking down on politically exposed persons such as government officials, and cracking down on corrupt managers and contractors.\nThe G20, however, is not an independent body independent of individual countries, Transparency International's Executive Director Huguette Labelle said.\nIt does, however, have a common focus on the issue of economic growth and many member countries have pledged to tackle corruption.\n\"G20 is a good vehicle to bring the issue together, but it's not an independent authority,\" she said.\n", "label": "machine"}

This afternoon, I will provide an overview of Cytori\u2019s fourth quarter and 2018 annual progress, following the press release issued earlier today by the company. We have made significant progress throughout 2018, culminating in our full commercial launch of CentriMag and EPP in Japan, our significant strategic collaborations, and the launch of important business initiatives.\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $4.1 million, a strong increase over the $2.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenues included $3.4 million in EPP and CentriMag shipments, and $555,000 from contract support programs. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 included CentriMag customer shipments, which were subsequently repaid. For the fourth quarter of 2018, total R&D expenses increased to $17.3 million, compared to $11.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nIt is important to note that the full fourth quarter of 2017 had $1.1 million, which was related to the transfer of Cytori\u2019s normal plasma processing to TransEnterix. To achieve this milestone, the company had outstanding patient data for four consecutive quarters since Q4 2015. Because of this, CentriMag patient samples were included in our 2017 clinical data update in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, the company expects to have CPO in the commercial pipeline at the start of 2018.\nFor the full year 2018, R&D expenses increased to $74.7 million, compared to $49.7 million in 2017. The company has launched two important business initiatives. First, the launch of CPO. And second, the development of a host platform for the chronic use of CentriMag.

{"text": "Music is today\u2019s killer app. And the space is heating up.\nBoth smart homes and fitness trackers have grown in popularity in recent years. So it comes as no surprise that one of the major players in fitness trackers, Jawbone, chose to buy a company that sells home health monitoring products. If you\u2019re not familiar with these devices, they work by setting off a vibration or buzzing a few inches away from the skin, providing an analysis of a person\u2019s health.\nThis is where upstart startup Toneo comes in. The New York City-based startup today announced a $45 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB). New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Insight Venture Partners also participated in the round.\nThe company has raised a total of $72 million so far and was cash-strapped until now. Toneo describes itself as the third largest health and fitness band maker.\nTonal was first created after Rob Wiegand, one of venture capital firm Mohr Davidow\u2019s partner, noticed a fitness band being worn by a woman that didn\u2019t seem to accurately capture her heart rate. When he had to return it, he used a microphone attached to a heart rate monitor that allowed him to see how the device changed as Wiegand paid more attention to the wristband.\nHaving self-funded most of its activities, Wiegand passed on an equity round of $5 million and took venture capital funding two years ago from NEA, which was looking to invest in hardware.\nWith the new funding, Toneo plans to triple the size of its engineering team and triple its marketshare in the U.S. over the next 12 months. The company is already seeing immense growth internationally, primarily in China and other Asian countries.\nAs part of the funding round, NEA general partner and KPCB partner Paul Gu told VentureBeat that his firm has made a long-term bet on health and fitness. \u201cWe saw it prior to the wearables boom,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the auto industry, it\u2019s the first person driving a car to look down, see a monitor, and interact.\u201d\nEver since companies started to obsess about fitness, some cases of overkill have been spotted \u2014 such as the law firm made several flu-monitoring devices available to their lawyers. Paired with growth in the wearables industry, this has only increased the possibilities for even more time-consuming monitoring devices.\nBut for Toneo, Gu thinks there are some upsides to this. The next challenge is to make these devices a personal device. \u201cMost devices are for businesses or for institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cToneo is designed to become a lifestyle device.\u201d\nAdditionally, Toneo\u2019s software also allows users to monitor their health over time \u2014 particularly elderly people who are less mobile. Wiegand pointed out that conversations in some European countries such as Italy reveal 70 to 80 percent of the country\u2019s elderly population has a pulse monitor.\nWith size and scale comes institutional investment, and Toneo\u2019s expansion might help the company fill a void in a large market.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "US President Donald Trump has named Jerome Powell to be chair of the US Federal Reserve, replacing Janet Yellen, who was nominated by her predecessor, Barack Obama. It should come as no surprise that Trump and Powell disagree on most major aspects of the US economy and the course it needs to take given the very strong, though somewhat stretched, performance in the latest GDP report. While Trump's nomination to the Fed was greeted positively by the markets it shouldn't be. In fact, we shouldn't expect Powell to be too different from Yellen in the details but two crucial aspects of both his background and his approach to policy have left investors rightly wondering if Trump hasn't made a terrible mistake. Powell's background includes time in more deeply troubled countries such as South Korea, China and Japan and Trump in turn has been critical of global economic governance.\nThe second is that Trump is expected to nominate Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed, to fill Powell's place on the Fed board of governors. Warsh, a Wall Street economist, is an askew economist and former member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Most economists believe he is a rigorous policy thinker on policy but several years of his research has been taken with a pinch of salt, including his writings on central bank independence. Credit:Bloomberg At first glance both men have seemingly similar backgrounds. Both came through the Fed's brain trust and played a key role in implementing the appropriate approaches to implementing the laws of the US capitalist system. Powell has worked in challenging times, especially during the financial crisis, which saw the Fed embark on an unprecedented era of quantitative easing that has still not fully unwound. He has been the Fed's point man for financial regulation. And both he and Yellen have been panned for their failure to adequately arrest or prevent the continuing rise in US household debt, something that surprised even most of those in the thinking community. Indeed, a more perceptive version of Trump's recasting of US economic policy would read the appointment of Powell and Warsh as the president's attempt to emulate the turn-around policy that Ronald Reagan pulled off during his first term in office. It would look at the way that manufacturing had been damaged by the Japanese economic model, a policy that eventually delivered the \"miracle\" of a second Asian recession while the Fed aided the recovery in the real economy.\nThe Fed's approach to monetary policy was therefore far too tight and inflation had to be artificially reignited in the process. That policy position would now look terribly dated and both Powell and Yellen have tried to overcome it by adopting a looser approach that has run the risk of generating inflation. Powell and Warsh would be less likely to do that, at least not overtly, than Yellen. Then there's the other footrace Trump chose to enter. The fact that Trump approached Powell first makes it clear he is no political novice: he wanted to have the guy for it in case things could fall apart and he could find somebody else who had the standing and ability to do it. Powell was instantly a worthy alternative, with \"great deal of respect from people across the political spectrum\", he said on Sunday after his appointment was announced. Of course, another worrying factor for all involved is that a decision is being delayed. The exact timing has yet to be determined: there are discussions to be had. Yellen, who is currently on a trip to France and Italy, will reportedly not be joining the party once it arrives in Washington.\nThe problem is that Powell and Yellen, both first-timers, do not have long to work out whether it is an appointment they can live with. Yellen is expected to hit her seven-year term at the Fed's helm as scheduled. And while the main criticisms of the new chair are likely to be about monetary policy and therefore less focused on financial regulation, the White House's apparent determination to have somebody else preside over the Fed during the July-August congressional recess could quickly escalate into a major issue if, or when, the president tries to put his stamp on the Fed. As has been stated in various stages over the last three months, Trump has railed against global economic governance. To challenge a world leader with strategic differences with the US is unlikely to work - too many democracies align in a neo-isolationist direction. But to try to use a forum like the Fed to get a year's worth of influence over policy? It is always dangerous to write off tactics and concepts based solely on the expert advisers that you appoint, given a President can listen to everyone and anyone. And the world is still most certainly becoming less-orderly as the elite models of power that are shared by the world's increasingly powerful governments seep out from behind the curtains and get louder under the global security threat du jour.\n", "label": "machine"}

You're driving home after work, late for dinner, or somewhere else, and you're not expecting any forms of etiquette in the other direction.\nBut many first-time riders never use the app or call the driver.

Call the driver\nThis is your first shot. If your ride picked you up at the wrong location, that's why the app causes all the red alerts. Don't wait. Call them and ask them to return your phone number. That way you'll know if your ride got lost or someone confused your usual destination.\nIn an Uber: Make a call or use the customer support service to request your information.\n2. Give a ride request\nUse the \"request\" option and help get your ride, or ask for a specific route from one location to another.\nIn an Uber: Make a call or use the customer support service to request your information.\n3.

Sometimes they might include their last name or other gender-specific info.\nIn an Uber: Make a call or use the customer support service to request your information.\n4. Use a \"goodbye message\" if you're ending the ride\nIf you're angry about how the driver moved or reached out to get a glass of water, use it.

Respect the driver's choice\nSome drivers don't call people back. Others will text or send a quick text to see what your current location is. Maybe they're at the wrong address, and this is the only way you're reaching out.\nIn an Uber: Make a call or use the customer support service to request your information.\n8. Learn your own (driver's) language\nOnce the driver enters your destination, the app will prompt you to confirm that you've entered the correct address and to give the driver your contact info. Make sure to always type it in so you can contact them if something goes wrong. A few pages of mobile contact information can be too much for drivers to decipher, so at least enter a couple common words instead of both symbols and all caps.\nIn an Uber: Make a call or use the customer support service to request your information.\nKeep this handy when driving: Use your turn signal when changing lanes or going the wrong way. That polite surprise in the center lane and a quick check to see if the car is in its own lane.\nIf the ride doesn't happen as planned or you're not happy with how the driver treated you, you have a right to take it the next way without paying. Uber, Lyft, or some other service offers a service to let you out of a ride without paying or suggests alternative options. If the service doesn't call, have them give you a number to call if you need something specific. Take a taxi or exchange your information with the driver.\nIf you felt unsafe or physically threatened, report it to Uber or the driver or Lyft, which will keep you posted if the issue is resolved.\nBefore you hop in the car (or any car for that matter), be as polite as possible.

{"text": "Victor Hugo had said a few times how he wanted Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris to be like the Passion play, and sometimes seemed closer to God than to the rest of us. The address of the newly founded public library was one of the many places where you could find him in his late 20s, looking decidedly discontented and writing at some length as though unhappy with life. At one of his most laconic moments in his work The Affair on Rue Fortroyin \u2013 he called it the \"heavenleph\" \u2013 he notes that the cathedral was again in ruins, up for possible destruction. But again: \"(my) pen may not save it from this impending glumness.\" It's as if now he was writing in \"pinch\", anticipating the coming storm in his tale Of the Hebrides, dated 1910. This is what is best about Of the Hebrides. It's the first novel to be written by the young Hugo, but it takes us deep into his imagination, describing the lives of everyday people in their confortless casques of gin and champagne. At its heart is the drifting romance between two children, Marie and Fonny, long, long ago lost to each other but now reunited, and manipulated, in the most lascivious way, by an adult couple in search of a young son. A most glamorous story from 1912. Credit:Modern Library Angus Houston, Hugo's assistant, has seen the pair and remembers the names of the parents. He plots an intervention. After all, he tells Hugo, you have a \"bonding that makes itself felt only through a strong moral force\". The answer, as Hugo later described it, was to invest the cathedral with a rather old-fashioned headstrong form of hero-worship. The Gothic chapel with its extraordinary honey-coloured spires was to function as a place of worship, which, for its priest, Catheine, a gifted acolyte who must act out the story of her idealised characters, would mark their pilgrimage to the afterlife. The pectoral cross would have been raised for the real saints of the church.\nThe Hebrides, a novel about devotion to angels? It was no play, but a story of faith. And Hugo's heroism is indeed to be found when he dies at 42, wondering how he was to find so many worthy saints who call him by his new name, and where they are going. He becomes entangled with a noblewoman, Mallory, who helps him in his spiritual journey, and who wears one of Hugo's signature broad naval brogues as she teaches him how to glide gracefully on the sea. Hugo died in St Peter's Basilica at midnight, on December 31, 1889, two years before Notre-Dame in Paris, and a year before the publication of Of the Hebrides, but his work was in a state of decay. The book that was supposed to be his great gift and his greatest achievement \u2013 and the game changer of human civilisation \u2013 never saw the light of day. The story remained unfinished and some readers were convinced that the novel would never see the light of day. The search began to find a forgotten Belgian boy called Geraldie Faber, who can only be the child at the centre of this very expensive, world-famous reworking of the fairy tale. Hugo himself said that a child with a soul could never sit still long enough to read a novel. And so, as Susan Wiggs and Steven Galloway show in The Last Song, Hugo kept at it, laboring in solitude in his satchel until the dawn of the 18th century. But the novelist refused to abandon this project. The Bible, and literature more generally, had dealt with visions of the dead from as early as the middle ages, but this fiction moved further from tragedy to the realm of magic. Hugo \u2013 whose dignity and intelligence were never confused for vanity \u2013 placed his fears about the death of the world into his main character. \"Despite the immense age, even the spring of our mortal life cannot rid us of a kind of madness which is only dimly lighted by electricity, ever enchanted. We were invented only for the purpose of living and dying and we walk about like dogs, and each day passes like yesterday.\"\nThe book is full of strangeness and wonders: the world is filled with life-like allegories; those ancient images of the past reappear in Victor Hugo's prose; a narrator of letters looks into a mirror in a bizarre play of light and shadow; a lover gets in his lover's way and flees; angels walk among the living. As Henry James put it in the very first sentence of The Ambassadors, Hugo is \"a poet too big to write\". He's real. Even in his unhappy formative", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "By Drew Harwell | Washington Post\nWASHINGTON \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Monday reiterated her opposition to House impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, but insisted the public can hold the White House accountable by \u201cthinking about how we do the work of the people and telling our friends to do the work of the people.\u201d\n\u201cImpeachment is not in our sights at this point,\u201d Pelosi said at a \u201cTake Back the House\u201d fundraiser and speaking event.\n\u201cEvery one of our members has a responsibility \u2013 they must set aside any opinions about the president of the United States \u2013 to do their work, to serve their constituents,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are committed to have a government of, by and for the people.\u201d\nBut asked whether the GOP-led House should hold hearings into Trump\u2019s conduct, and whether there should be an investigation of the Trump administration by the Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Pelosi reiterated her opposition.\n\u201cWe will do our best work behind closed doors as leaders of the majority,\u201d she said. \u201cBut no, impeachment is not under our focus.\u201d\nIn a question-and-answer session during the event, Pelosi answered questions about a range of issues from the ongoing school shooting in Florida to the challenges the midterms will present.\nA question about Trump struck a discordant note, coming at the tail end of the gathering, which was held at a pair of popular Baltimore restaurants on St. Patrick\u2019s Day weekend. The restaurant restaurateurs, Steve and Kate Krzmien, are ardent Trump opponents.\nPelosi was asked whether impeachment is \u201ca two-track conversation, the one track being continued focus on defeating him in the midterm election. That\u2019s an admirable goal. And of course that\u2019s our solemn responsibility. The other is we want to never stop doing our jobs and to do everything possible that we don\u2019t put House members in a box.\u201d\nFor the second time this month, Pelosi has drawn a line in the sand about the Trump administration\u2019s possible impeachment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in doing anything that would do anything to destroy the Republican House. We\u2019re focused on defeating Trump in the (midterm) election,\u201d she said last week.\nShe also said that impeachment itself is \u201cnot something that you have to do in order to accomplish anything.\u201d\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped House Democrats from bringing articles of impeachment against Trump in recent months. It has also prompted Republican response.\nDemocrats this week will introduce a package of reforms \u2013 including a bill requiring an ethics referral and the removal of cabinet officials within 180 days of a referral from the House Committee on Ethics, and clearing the way for impeachment efforts \u2013 as a cudgel against Trump, who has signed a slew of bills that curb the power of Congress.\nRelated Articles A bridge too far?

GOP pollster Frank Luntz has even gone as far as to say that potential voters who are actually upset enough to desire an impeachment will be Democrats, not Republicans.\nIn her remarks Monday, Pelosi hit on her continued emphasis that Democrats must concentrate on economic issues to distract the public from the attention Trump has garnered. Aides said the news media already has a reputation for exaggerating how much people care about the president.\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a discussion about that, on a range of issues, so that it isn\u2019t all about the president and whether he\u2019s guilty or not of anything,\u201d she said.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 From a 20-year-old crime scene to Tasers to gun magazines, all the devices police officers use to quell crime were used against Abdullah Abdi so often, even the detective from St. Paul police\u2019s burglary unit had doubts about what he was reading.\nHow did the officers with the same jurisdiction, same city, same veteran status go to such extremes, using Abdi in 31 confrontations and a similar number of confrontations with unarmed men?\nWhy did one detective have his weapon \u201cdrawn nearly 100 times\u201d during 17 witness interviews between 2014 and 2017 with Abdi, according to emails? And why did an officer tell another detective that Abdi \u201ccomes at us\u201d so much?\nAfter a jury acquitted St. Paul police officer Jamal Abdi and a second officer, the trial and its findings are renewing debate about a code of silence that suggests officers may not share information about crimes with colleagues who have to respond, especially in cases involving blacks.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s been such a rise in distrust of police among some of the African-American communities, and I think there\u2019s a degree of urgency for the police to work toward greater trust,\u201d said Alicia Schmitt, a law professor at Minnesota State University Moorhead who studies police culture.\n\u201cObviously there are risks in not working toward that, but I think you also have to respond to these communities,\u201d she said.\nWhile many details in the case are under a seal, one email showed that a St. Paul police detective routinely wondered how police were handling Abdi.\nAbdullah Abdi, now 26, said he and his family have since received thousands of emails about the case. The St. Paul activist said Abdi has \u201cloved conversations\u201d with people such as St. Paul police Sgt. Jeffrey Kroll and another member of the City Hall Police Academy team, who have expressed \u201cdeep remorse and remorseful about how this happened.\u201d\nAbdi was supposed to be a lovable kid who loved sports and video games, friends say. He instead worked as a drug dealer and was shot in the stomach and groin in separate circumstances by officers. Abdi sued St. Paul police; there\u2019s no word yet on where the trial is headed.\nDuring the trial, prosecutors called the deadly Taser incidents baseless, and St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell said his officers do their best to prevent violence. But the lengthy transcript shows that Abdi\u2019s run-ins with police \u2014 including cellphone and drug stings and arrests, combined with a single, anonymous tip \u2014 were marked by a serial number of multiple encounters, and even singled out for special attention.\nFor the first year, one detective wrote nine letters to another detective between 2014 and 2017 documenting encounters with Abdi, according to the court transcript. The least mentioned of these encounters was when Abdi was arrested for shoplifting in March 2014 \u2014 a call to the officer about a drug deal. Another officer wrote his gun was \u201cdrawn nearly 100 times\u201d during 17 witness interviews between 2014 and 2017.\nLaw enforcement experts interviewed in the wake of the verdict said that while the St. Paul officers failed to deliver probable cause or serious injury, the actions stand out in light of a lack of sympathy by investigators. The defence and court transcripts indicate that someone who watched the trial could draw a broader conclusion about systemic problems within St. Paul police.\n\u201cThe real question is the line they need to draw between what\u2019s an officer response and an officer concern,\u201d said William Weisenmiller, a police consultant and former Honolulu police chief. \u201cWhere does it need to stop, when does it escalate? When does someone get hurt? When does something spin out of control and you might need the other side\u2019s assistance? If the information or training that they\u2019re receiving in the police academy doesn\u2019t have a good feel for that, that can be a problem.\u201d\nOther police departments in Minnesota said they are also wary of that code of silence, citing the resignations of several officers on the St. Paul force.\n\u2014\u2014\nFollow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti .

{"text": "Vjosa Isai is CEO of Toronto's Big Brothers Big Sisters Canada\nAs a native born in Iran who has family who emigrated to Canada in 1970, I've watched this country from afar. In 1980, I started helping take care of my brother's children as his wife and I worked as engineers. I've participated in foster care since 1977 and in 1992, was chosen to help change the mindset of the children in our organization to improve the lives of foster children \u2013 a transition for children now known as rehousing or reunification.\nI and many other directors in my organization felt the lack of compassion we felt from the new government of Dalton McGuinty in terms of children's services. Shortly after the 2008 election and the new Liberal government's policies were unveiled, children living in foster care no longer wore dirty clothing or were allowed to use unhealthy sanitary products. One of the departments the government disbanded was London's General Community Nurse Service.\nStory continues below advertisement\nNow the Liberals' policies are gutting the Ontario public-health system, which means the elimination of agencies and programs that have helped our agency for the past 27 years and have been vital to our work with Big Brothers and Big Sisters.\nBig Brothers Canada is the country's largest mentoring program, having served more than 240,000 children in the past 27 years. Our relationships with foster children through our nine agencies and 10,000 agency sites across Canada have resulted in 68,000 interventions, both alone and with other partners.\nThe time we spend each day in high schools and colleges can often be time lost from working as the largest non-government funding agency. Much of that time is spent just getting to know the children we serve, making a commitment to connect with them \u2013 rather than helping them academically.\nWe work hard to connect children in foster care and those in the community with the mentors they need. The results of these relationships are extraordinary.\nOur organization has found that at most all of our visits, the support is life-changing. We have worked with a program of 730 boys in the region of Niagara for 22 years. It's a remarkable program with direct links to a goal we as a board set eight years ago \u2013 to raise $10-million for the children in our agency, as well as to build up their confidence.\nTwo years after joining the board, the fundraising goal was met and the legislation was passed for London to build the new General Community Nurse Service (GCNS) building. Now, when everything is finally finished, the building will be known as the Dr. Hedy Fry Cancer Centre for Cancer Survivorship and Intermediates and will be named after our beloved former member of Parliament who represented the city of London for 14 years.\nUnfortunately, we will not get to see this celebration. The property where we started our work will be used by the government for the purpose of organization building. The program we have created with $11-million of our fundraising will no longer exist \u2013 and we will be completely removed from the organization building. With no office, no research centre and no blood bank for the medical staff, young children in the region who desperately need to get tested for cancer will have to go to London or to a hospital located elsewhere in Ontario or even farther for an appointment.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nI have watched organizations take the holistic view of families in this province, until the province has turned its back on them.\nMy organization started because of child abuse, but is growing because youth in foster care are so much more than statistics.\nThe government will not honour their promise and commitments, but instead they will abandon those in this province who have nothing, who do not know what it means to have a partner, who do not know what it is to have hope.\nThe cuts in health are particularly critical to our organization, which is dependent on the health services it has supported for 27 years, and because it focuses only on working with children who are in immediate crisis, that our group will likely continue without a proper centre.\nThere is more and more pressure on the current regional health authorities to innovate and outsource administrative activities, and the government of Ontario has imposed changes to make services more efficient without providing any new funding for new projects, programs or the facilities.\nThis shows a lack of concern, of compassion.\nStory continues below advertisement\nWhile I want these changes to happen, these changes will not make a difference. The real harm will be felt by children in the system who depend on the accountability of the health workers, nurses and supervisors who work tirelessly to improve their lives. It is irresponsible and sad to see how this will impact the care they receive.\nWhat is said about this province's budget is true. It will have a devastating effect on people's lives.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Married children generally have a markedly healthier family life than unmarried ones, and the mother is more likely to worry about her rights than her husband's.\nIf the married child's caretaker misses a payment to the household, then the unmarried child is more likely to be told to \"take care of\" the home than the married child, and the employed one is more likely to be told by his or her employer not to tell the household about the unexpected absence of caretaker than the employed ones.\nMarried children generally tend to want to please their boss, if only out of sheer fear of him or her. They are more compliant than unmarried children are, in a number of ways. But the married ones are more likely to do the job right, since they want the boss to like them.\nHow likely do married children and unmarried ones think they are to be the victim of being deprived of their needs or being beaten up? The honest answer is that we do not know, as we have not asked. But it is hard to imagine that if you had to make sure you are seen to do everything right by your boss, but he or she would not permit you to do it, you would not think that you were doing fine!\nNotice also that both divorced and never-married child victims feel less attached to their mother than the married ones do to their father, and they are far more likely to act like a bitter, disloyal child than the married ones are.\nYet they are more likely to be traumatised by the stress of having to deal with domestic abuse, and they are all more likely to fear abandonment than the married ones are.\nWEARING OVERWHELMING PRESSURE\nSo it is easy to see that this means that abused married children are getting more help and support than they are getting from the same kinds of individuals. And equally obvious is that they are doing better than both divorced children and unmarried ones when they get help than they are when they don't. This makes one wonder if the patterns that we see can be seen to account for the differences in health outcomes between the married and unmarried children in our societies, and whether our culture may be more accommodating to marriage, when our culture is quite conservative in a number of respects.\nIt is striking, and noteworthy, that the out-of-wedlock children of women who were abused often seem to behave differently than the ever-married ones. In fact, the far more expensive out-of-wedlock children generally behave the same way.\nA few years ago, I explored these very important issues in a set of evidence-based articles titled 'Are Women Demonstrably Better at Parenting and Child Rearing Than Unmarried Men?' in Family Child Discipline: How to Preserve Human Families and Escalate the Damage to Women, children, and the State.\nMy discussions in the article had to do with all the horrible examples that had appeared in the public record. I also had to ask myself the following question. How much of the material I reviewed can be said to be a true and uncontestable depiction of common experiences across the societies and even different generations of women?\nWe do not yet know, and this is the kind of case that justifies not getting too hung up about the out-of-wedlock women, as we have not even gotten very far into their lives. The fact is that the more we examined, the more more difficult it became to define things with precision.\nBut I have taken the view that where there was a tendency for the various reports to be one-sided, we need not seek to identify that tendency. In the specific situation described above, however, we can see that several of the reports have revealed much that was well out of order. Therefore, we do need to take a much harder look at the family dynamics and the similarities and differences between the parents of married children and of ever-married children, by comparing the two groups of parents in a casual fashion in discussions that do not come with the requirement to ignore or deny that there is an indicator of stress that the abused ones generally have with respect to their jobs.\nWe need to draw this parallel much more actively, and that means using the same tools, modes, and techniques that we use to understand trends in mainstream culture, and pursuing those that result in new discoveries, theories, and questions.\n- Dr Paul Wright is an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Sociology, University of the West Indies, Mona.

{"text": "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department has granted special counsel Robert Mueller's request to redact five words in a report he'll submit to Attorney General William Barr on the Russia investigation, a sign that that Barr will ultimately release the report.\nAccording to a letter dated April 2 but made public Monday, the department determined that several government officials discussing the investigation could be identified. The officials agreed the information couldn't be released even in redacted form. But Barr is expected to argue for making the pages public anyway.\n\"Release of the redacted portion of the memo concerning FISA applications (and some related matters) will deter and punish future abuse of FISA authorities, mitigate potential harm to ongoing and future national security investigations, and may serve the public interest by making public information regarding decisions that have significant public policy implications,\" Barr said.\nUnlike Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein refused to consent to the release of Mueller's entire memo last year when he was the acting attorney general, and his refusal raised eyebrows in some government circles.\nBarr's letter proposes releasing the entire five-page document in redacted form. He indicated that having to release the officials' names was an acceptable trade-off.\n\"It is significant, too, that most, if not all, of the officials have by this time (i.e., most, if not all) left government and will not be held accountable for their actions,\" Barr wrote.\nHe added, \"Some other officials may be held accountable.\"\nMueller's request to make his entire memo public became controversial last year when the senior officials who signed off on it cited national security as their reason for denying the FBI request to disclose the names. The redacted memos sent to Barr last year explain why Mueller was seeking FISA warrants to monitor former Trump campaign associate Carter Page and what the memos' senior officials believed about the applications.\nAt the time, though, they identified only the name of the Justice Department official who signed off on the counterintelligence application to the FISC seeking to monitor Page's communications. Now, five weeks after Barr's first attempts to have the redacted memos made public and with him at the helm of the Justice Department, it's possible others' names will be known.\nBarr has already said the document will be \"about four or five pages\" and will be \"straightforward.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Jermaine Ale will likely be remembered as a huge surprise packet in his NRL career with Newcastle but will also be remembered at some point for his year-long stint in Newcastle's drought-breaking maiden Newcastle rugby league premiership triumph in 2001. The now assistant coach of the Knights, 40, will leave the game less than three weeks after suffering a setback following the initial diagnosis of a ruptured Achilles tendon while competing in the National Rugby Union 7s competition. The former St George Illawarra, Cronulla and Manly forward spoke to media at John Hunter Hospital on Thursday saying he had consulted other experts to determine a best case scenario and seeing another specialist decided he needed to stop playing. The injury left him in a significant amount of pain, with the initial advice to use crutches for six weeks and finally stabilise the heel bone before starting rehab. \"I wanted to make sure there's no risk that I can come back and it's a repeat injury as opposed to a half-season,\" he said. \"I didn't want that trauma on my body.\" But he might not have stopped playing if he didn't see the latest available surgical option of another op to take out the tendon in a leg, which he likened to a retainer. He also wanted to spend the last few years with his family, son and wife. Given Hunter District Rugby League is preparing to celebrate his achievements for helping rev up what became a club he later joined for eight seasons, Ale now knows he would have \"made it\" at the Knights in 2018. But he believes he can continue enjoying his life \"as a layman\" and giving back to the game for years to come. \"I can stay active for a lifetime. The old adage is you never know what you've got till it's gone. I've got a family and things I enjoy doing,\" he said. \"For me it's been about letting go and watching the kids play footy. Getting back with their friends and their brothers and sisters through sport. \"It's about getting back in that box, being back with the guys, right back into the motor and getting the boys going, getting into team-building exercises and having fun. \"I miss being active so much, especially for me that the morning after a game, being able to get out, get a keg and enjoy a beer.\" As well as seeing the end of his playing career, he no longer misses being at a club for the last seven seasons after parting ways with the Knights in 2014. But he cannot speak highly enough of the time he spent as a junior with the Tigers. \"One of the good things about the end of it is the fact I played under young Parramatta kids,\" he said. \"We didn't have the dinosaurs; we had the boys coming through like Wicksy, Weasly. \"I only played there for a short period of time but having the opportunity to go out there and play footy in front of them just got a great feeling about footy. \"It was my hometown club but it was a team that had a lot of NSW Origin, representative experience and also some good young players coming through, so the culture within the club was great. \"There was a lot of good young talent there. I kind of grew up a few years early, so it was good to be a part of that.\" For him, one of his most special memories was playing on the same field in 2000 with his teammate Harold Meninga. The duo were denied a victory in the premiership decider when Tim Sheens' Maroons secured the title in the same thrilling finish the year before. \"I was rapt. I was only really young at the time,\" he said. \"I always look back on it and think he almost pulled off the greatest win in the history of our code. \"We had the most tries in the decider without kicking a penalty. It was just so disappointing but that's footy. You've got to give credit to Queensland.\"\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/gNecaFSpqFSLkittedmeiY/cfa13a65-73ec-47ad-afda-cf3cab09afa0.jpg/r0_196_4332_2670_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

That's not necessarily the case. We have several bus routes that rotate at regular intervals throughout the day,\" said Larry Bill, North Kansas City Schools transportation coordinator.\nBill has been busing students in the North Kansas City School District for 20 years. He has already seen an increase in the number of bus transports needed, as several North Kansas City Schools were closed last fall due to mold problems.\nThat means if somebody isn't driving a route, it's almost always the manager, who isn't part of the immediate staff.\n\"We had some students that were spending the night off site in hotels. The problem is typically they're still paying the transportation department to come pick them up at midnight or whatever,\" Bill said.\nTo make things even more stressful, if North Kansas City never opens a new school this year, there might not be enough drivers to fill a new route. A recent safety survey showed fewer than half of bus drivers have a lot of experience, while 15 percent had eight years or less.\n\"When you start getting into that six-year and shorter range, we have less staff members and then the resumes of those who might be interested in driving, they may be a little more difficult to find,\" Bill said.\nNorth Kansas City's looking for the same talent they're attracting from other metro school districts, including before and after school drivers, as well as kids crossing guards.\n\"We have a lot of depth and confidence when it comes to our veteran driver field that we know will be able to run those routes,\" Bill said.\nAt Leavenworth school district, people are paying attention as a new agreement to provide bus service in Clay County kicks in. For now, Grandview is just using part-time drivers. But administrators there admit they're also having trouble finding drivers because the district hired many last year when the bus drivers union contract was up for renegotiation.\n\"I think they are definitely in need of help,\" said Leavenworth district driver Amber Morris, \"because things are changing rapidly that we have to keep up with.\"\nThey say because of the instability, student safety is becoming an issue. Parents contacted FOX4 after hearing an employee at South Washington Elementary School was sent home last week. Officials from both districts say the employee was let go due to poor performance, and he was off the routes for days. They both confirm the school had a big transportation deficit.\n\"We train our drivers right from the time we train them in our current bus management system that we have,\" Bill said.\n\"I think the idea of a shortage is scary because, as parents, especially kids, don't have time to deal with that. They need to be in school,\" Morris said.\nWith school back in session, North Kansas City School leaders plan to run their routes more efficiently and hope for help and a helping hand from more districts. They say some passengers might have to be bussed further and more often if there are not enough bus drivers on the road to handle the demand.\nThe main reasons Bill sees bus drivers leaving their current school districts? They say they want more hours or a better pay package for retirement.\nIn Clay County, an education leader is warning of looming legal action because a person driving for the school district there is accused of giving a loaded handgun to a student. For now, that person remains employed.\nNorth Kansas City Schools is currently going through its human resources department to help them identify possible problems. They say they need more drivers in the district because they really aren't seeing any young students opting for bus service, despite the availability of rides to parent-teacher conferences or parent days at the stadium.\nHere's a link to the district's human resources website.\n", "label": "machine"}

They\u2019re not scheduled to meet up this summer, and it\u2019s unclear how much into community service the crew did while they were off-camera.\nThe news on Sorrentino\u2019s return to the prison gym comes just a day after the publication of an excerpt from controversial headliner Ja Rule\u2019s book \u201cPower,\u201d in which the rapper recounted meeting the embattled McFarland \u2014 the man behind the failed Fyre Festival in April of last year, which served to become synonymous with crappy-quality food, rude service and an uncomfortable guest list \u2014 in prison.\n\u201cGuess who I met the other day??

He is prohibited from partying, except for \u201csocial, cultural activities that do not result in New Jersey State Taxpayer funds being spent.\u201d\nIn the excerpt, Ja Rule recalls a trip to the prison to meet with the guy who, as his publicist put it at the time, \u201ccreated one of the biggest retail tragedies in the history of music festivals.\u201d The site says McFarland and Ja Rule spoke privately for four hours, without their respective attorneys present.\n\u201cThey laughed all the time,\u201d says Ja Rule. \u201cThis was two guys who had been behind bars together before, and knew the drill.

{"text": "By Obinna Chima\nThe World Bank has unveiled its World Bank Human Capital Development Plan to support inclusive growth in Africa.\nThe new plan developed in collaboration with local partners based on the African Development Bank\u2019s Human Capital Assessment (formerly known as the African Human Development Report), underpins a strategy of focusing on six priority areas of human capital development.\nThese are education and health, water and sanitation, livelihoods, land reform, youth empowerment, and small and medium enterprises development.\nGiving a background to the development of the programme in a statement on Friday, World Bank Group Vice President, Special Programmes, Tim Cooney, noted that Africa has strong economic potential to strengthen its economic competitiveness by investing in its people, investing in education, health, water, sanitation, governance and other essential services for growth.\n\u201cIt is also critical that countries invest in their people, like providing clean water, schools, health and sanitation, giving women and children the tools to develop their potential and participate fully in the economy,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, the investment in human capital will take time to yield results, but will create sustainable positive and durable impacts on economic growth and poverty reduction over the medium to long-term.\nThis is because it will provide the foundation for human capital development to help increase long-term growth and job creation, better prepare Africa\u2019s young people for the jobs they will need to compete in an increasingly interconnected world, and the skills to empower local communities to be successful in the future, he added.\nAccording to him, success of the Human Capital Development Plan (HCDP) depends on local governments, civil society, private sector, and the private sector in private and public sector deepening and promoting outcomes on six priority areas of human capital development, namely, education and health, water and sanitation, livelihoods, land reform, youth empowerment, and small and medium enterprises development.\nHe said the governments of Rwanda, Senegal, Nigeria, Tanzania, Ghana, South Africa, and the African Development Bank have integrated the funding allocation to education and health on the nation\u2019s annual budget, and even the private sector has stepped up their investment in well-targeted human capital investments such as supporting schools in the North to provide medicine to children in the South of the country.\n\u201cLocal governments are also making targeted investments and building their capacity to implement coordinated and integrated social welfare and protection programs for youth and adults and better protect the rights of women and girls in key areas such as education, health, safety, and property rights,\u201d Cooney said.\nWorld Bank Senior Human Capital Analyst for Youth and Gender, Yolande Landsberg, said the World Bank has worked with African countries for decades on water and sanitation, health, governance, and private sector development, and does so on the HCDP.\n\u201cWe are beginning a different approach to support the scaling up of these priority areas to address the challenges of poverty in Africa,\u201d she said.\nLandsberg highlighted how the HCDP is enhancing the African Development Bank\u2019s human capital agenda, as part of a focus on human capital-related investments for inclusive growth and poverty reduction across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\u201cIt will deepen the vision of the AHDR, which is all about promoting human capital \u2013 inclusive growth and poverty reduction. It will support countries in delivering the lessons learnt from the early achievements of their initiatives in these six priority areas,\u201d she said.\nWorld Bank Senior Health Economist, Joseph Guest said the Bank has pioneered water and sanitation in Africa, and has sponsored innovative approaches to improve the lives of millions of women and children across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\u201cAs a major advocate of women\u2019s empowerment, there is an ongoing need to better integrate girls and young women in social protection interventions, including the provision of basic health and education programmes. The World Bank also has a duty to expand opportunities for girls and young women through programs focused on their social, environmental, health, and employment. These are the social areas that comprise the critical \u2018soft\u2019 education and health services that support women and children across all aspects of their lives,\u201d he said.\n", "label": "machine"}

Nonetheless, he has never really seen Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Here is how he found out about its heroine, Rey: \u201cOne of my staff mentioned to me that Rey's character was inspired by me.

Yoda, by the way, is known as a wise old tree, as it were. Would there be any \u201cfeels\u201d about Tim, too? But he has kept a lid on that fact for now. Yoda inspired Crakanthorp to weigh up voting Blue (for the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers, or Shooters) or Green (for the Greens). He initially voted Green, but then decided to switch his allegiance to the Shooters in the wake of recent revelations that ex-Fisheries Minister and Shooters candidate Niall Blair tried to pervert the course of justice.

{"text": "SANTA CLARA \u2014 When Gavin Logan attended his first high school basketball game last season, it was to see his new school, St. Francis, play the then-No. 1 Bellarmine College Prep, which went on to win the state championship.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that I saw Bellarmine,\u201d he said this week, shortly after the school learned that the three other charter schools in the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League do not have to abide by the association\u2019s rules governing agreements and contracts.\nDespite that looming legal challenge, the Lancers won their league opener Tuesday night in impressive fashion, 47-26, over Riordan. Logan had eight points and nine rebounds.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my first win,\u201d the senior guard said. \u201cI haven\u2019t won one yet.\u201d\nPlayoff games are still a ways off, but that happened fast for the Lancers. Logan said he and his team accomplished what was expected.\n\u201cYou knew this was going to be a great season,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard to figure out how it was going to look, but we\u2019re right there.\u201d\nLogan\u2019s grandfather helped develop the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League rule, which involves contracts between charter schools and existing schools. The provision was included in a recent reorganization of the league\u2019s athletic programs to ensure all schools have the same number of athletes in each sport.\nThat is the way it will be this season, said Andy Argyle, the league\u2019s executive director. He declined to say specifically about the charter schools.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to have a unified league that works in every jurisdiction,\u201d Argyle said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of things, the compromises that have been made. It just felt like we needed to clarify it to make sure everyone was OK.\u201d\nNow, the five charter schools in the league will have to decide whether they will abide by the rules or face a lawsuit that could keep them from competing.\nThe agreement allows charter schools to share locker rooms, classes and use of coaches. The charter schools must pay the school for the time they use its facilities, and schools do not have to pay charter schools for use of staff or coaches.\n\u201cThere is a cost to the school, and the school will contribute to that cost,\u201d Argyle said. \u201cAnd as far as coaches being paid by the school, they need to be paid a living wage. The charter schools have to pay those coaches a living wage.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s going to play out. That\u2019s a very contentious question.\u201d\nWith its usual single playoff berth usually little incentive for winning league games, it makes sense for charter schools to lean toward winning league games.\n\u201cWe always want to win league,\u201d Lancers coach Tim O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThis is a year where it kind of feels like we could play all of the Central Coast Section games. It was their preference, I guess, but if you think about it, there\u2019s a benefit to school unity.\n\u201cIf you look at any teams like us that have gone to Santa Cruz County and gone to a league that has stricter compliance, they have, for the most part, created a better league together.

It\u2019s not the hardest tackle I\u2019ve made in football, but it just so happened to be a yellow card for me, but I get sent off and it was really disappointing for the whole team because we felt like we were in control of the game and had another good chance after that.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t quite take that, but I thought we were controlling the game really well and actually in the first half it wasn\u2019t great for us to go in 1-0 up against a team that finished second in the Championship, but we are disappointed with the result.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

The state will investigate and prosecute an abortion after that, irrespective of what happens to the fetus after the ban is enacted. Anyone found guilty of a felony is subject to life in prison.\nBy doubling down on their winning philosophy of attempting to make abortion illegal, the GOP have shown a complete disregard for the lives of women and children by pandering to radicals on the fringe of their base and passing legislation that will punish women and their children who have already been notified by an urologist that the pregnancy is now unhealthy.\nShame on Ohio's Republican legislators for spending their time taking away from women's right to make decisions about their health.\nClare Schurr,\nGreater Cleveland\n", "label": "machine"}

Bush from 1991 to 1993, meets Tuesday with both Trump and Rosenstein to discuss the fate of the special counsel. Meanwhile, a source says there has been no indication that Rosenstein has agreed to leave his post.\nHouse Democrats will first have to secure the cooperation of incoming FBI director Christopher Wray, who is slated to replace McCabe upon his retirement, to conduct their own interviews of Mueller witnesses, and they will have to consult with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office regarding the possibility of a report. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to engage with the Mueller team,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, (D-CA), told The Daily Beast in an interview. \u201cThe thing to watch is if we can get the cooperation of the special counsel and the ethics officials and get them to agree to let us start conducting some briefings.\u201d\nThe panel could access the Attorney General\u2019s correspondence with Comey, which has led them to believe that Mueller\u2019s review could include any communications Comey might have with Trump, possibly in or around November 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s one [incoming attorney general] we\u2019re focused on.

They\u2019re also expected to continue requesting access to documents related to the Mueller probe.\nBarr said Tuesday that any criminal investigation by a sitting president can only be undertaken by the Justice Department, which is now an independent branch of government. He did not indicate a view of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation, which could lead to charges against or \u201ccompromise\u201d Trump. \u201cWhen you look at it from the standpoint of department, what we\u2019re dealing with here is a finding that the president had reasonably believed, based on, you know, his law degree, not some lawyer\u2019s opinion, that that was his intention, or the subject of a federal question,\u201d Barr said at a confirmation hearing. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to weigh in one way or the other on that.\u201d\nIn his time as attorney general, Barr said, he would safeguard any Russia probe from going beyond any laws that were in place at the time. \u201cI fully share with you that the only reason any of this matters is because, as many other law firms have learned, when you do private business, you usually violate the laws in the jurisdictions in which you conduct that business,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThat\u2019s been true in this case, and it\u2019s clearly true in this case.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Since the Turnbull government scrapped its 'commonsense' recommendations aimed at stopping a bushfire season-crushing explosion in the popularity of amateur firebombing, it's been trying to find new ways to avoid a major let down. It looks like firebombing is a popular hobby.\nA$29 Million Grant To Help Horticulture Industries Get Fire-Ready This is how much aid has been allocated to the Australian Agriculture Flagship's bushfire management programs as part of the budget. Photo: Council of Australian Governments (coag). The Australian Fire and Emergency Services Authority (AFESA) has inked a five-year $23.3 million contract with Australia's ag innovation and research centre the Australian Agriculture Flagship for enterprise requirements. The money will be shared between the Australian Taxation Office and AusAID to get their message across. Read more\nOn top of a one-off $1.2 billion funding boost for the agricultural sector overall for rural and regional Australia, in addition to setting up a national Taskforce, the federal government in the budget has also released $29 million to help agriculture businesses, farmers and agriculture producers.\nThe money will be spent on innovation projects to assist agribusinesses in dealing with climate change and risk management, and allowing for the new year-ending bushfire season \u2014 which results in up to five per cent of all firefighting costs being picked up by the federal government.\nThe key to the agriculture sector's recovery next summer is to make sure businesses have the right information and resources to help them tackle the potentially lethal conditions associated with warm, dry and hazy seasons. Photo: NIC KLEIN\nWhile the findings of the Bushfire Local Control Information Project back in 2016 certainly had their benefits, the latter solution in particular is a government-delivered product. The immediate solution is more information for farmers, who already have a 24/7 bushfire helpline that's readily available thanks to the National Rural Fire Service. It was touted as possibly saving the government $50 million in emergency response costs over three years in 2016 and will cost the government $25 million to implement the plan.\nAdditionally, the government has announced a plan to make sure the states and territories will be able to inspect farms and the supply chains through animal health at any time of year using new technology \u2014 though it isn't clear whether this will include earlier intervention which could prevent a drought-affected culling of livestock, or if it'll just provide an easier process to cross-check any potential hazards.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the fall of 1976, shortly after Democratic Gerald Ford took office, I flew back from New York with Robert Strauss, longtime Nixon White House counsel and president of the Federalist Society. He and I were back to report on the mood in the Democratic Party, a party coming from out of the cold.\nIt was led by Jimmy Carter, a former peanut farmer and Georgia governor.\nStrauss was then a member of the Secretaries of State and Defense, who were plotting to guide Carter to a surprise election victory over Ford by drawing his Republican opponent into war with Soviet-led communist Moscow. I was a journalist with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which were to conduct the hearings on Carter\u2019s foreign policy agenda.\nWe stopped at the former governor\u2019s house in Plains, Georgia. He was resting during the long election-year grind. Now it was Watergate, and Watergate, and what it meant for a Democratic president with a Republican Congress.\nCarter found his foreign policy aides to plot his response to Gerald Ford\u2019s speech in the United Nations General Assembly, in which he dubbed the Soviet Union an \u201cevil empire.\u201d The Soviet Union was hostile to Carter as the White House found itself looking toward a summit meeting with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.\nIn the same speech, Ford claimed that the Cold War \u201cis not on a roll\u201d and seemed to give Carter a free pass to the summit, much to his dismay. To force Ford\u2019s hand, Carter then renewed his call for the breakup of the Soviet Union and Russia, borrowing on Ford\u2019s platform.\nI remember the feeling of unease Carter expressed in Plains for his vice president, Walter Mondale, as he was propelled to accept the nomination.\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nCarter\u2019s national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was a calming influence. As Strauss recalls, \u201cHe said of this period when we decided to be more aggressive, look it up in the book.\u201d\nYou know where that project went. \u201cLook at the history,\u201d says Strauss, now 86 and retired from the home office of the Federalist Society. The younger and better known Brzezinski is now President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser.\nIt is true that Strauss himself was one of the \u201cshysters\u201d Carter put in his administration, as it might be more commonly known. (The latter adjective refers to those individuals unsavory for dealings with foreign leaders and head of state.)\nStrauss, of course, was there in the side-stream of Washington when Carter was ascending and Bush 41 was crumbling after his 1992 re-election defeat by Clinton.\n\u201cEven by living in the formal era of those times, the foreign policies taken during the Carter administration began with these broader foreign policy objectives,\u201d Strauss said to me.\nCarter faced a political reversal, from black-and-white to gray; how his search for a legacy against Communism ended the way it did.\nHe lost the Soviet-Asian socialist alliance, and did not achieve a summit meeting with Brezhnev. That history is not supposed to be relevant, nor will it be.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "HONOLULU \u2014 A recent increase in activity at Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano is providing some insight into how the activity changes over time, scientists say.\nPeople on the island are reporting increased ash and lava flow activity lately, often with multiple fissures opening at the same time.\nThe volcanoes of Kilauea are connected, which means an increased number of fissures means potentially explosive magma is moving from the volcano\u2019s East Rift Zone toward the Puu Oo crater.\nGeologists and scientists in the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory have been actively monitoring the situation for some time. This month, the scientists observed and mapped unprecedented activity, including the eruption of lava from the West Rift Zone and the liquid-filled Kilauea Canyon \u2014 which is like a liquid pool in the centre of the crater and just outside the perimeter of Puu Oo.\nThe images taken using remote sensing technology provide information about how magma is moving from the East Rift Zone toward the Puu Oo crater.\n\u201cIf we can see high-pressure magma that is high in the ground and moving towards the Puu Oo crater, this leads to the possibility of explosive steam explosions at the crater floor, potentially producing large amounts of ash,\u201d David Gibson, an eruption scientist in the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said in a news release.\nA U.S. Geological Survey map showed that activity in the past year indicates \u201can increase in the activity of magma and explosive steam,\u201d Gibson said.\nTens of thousands of residents of Hawaii County were displaced by an early April eruption of lava from a fissure in the Leilani Estates subdivision.

{"text": "It\u2019s amazing what a two-week hiatus can do.\nThe Alliance of American Football, which was scheduled to debut Friday in eight cities, is no more. The league will continue to pursue its mission, it said in a statement, to bring the new quarterback-driven vision of the American Football League to new markets, including Boston, this fall. It\u2019s also trying to rectify this season\u2019s sudden end.\nAdvertisement\nStarting quarterback Phil Simms will be replaced Saturday by Billy Joe Tolliver, the second-oldest quarterback in the league\u2019s 18-game schedule. On a conference call Friday morning, Tolliver, 54, who played in the NFL in 1985, said he will fit in well enough.\nChoose an option to keep reading.\nI'm a Globe.com subscriber\nor\nOops...

I love the history, the great players, and I\u2019m humbled that I\u2019m part of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u2019\u2019\nBut that unforgettable opportunity depends on success. Coaches will arrive this weekend in Columbia, S.C., Phoenix, San Antonio, Salt Lake City, Memphis, San Diego, Atlanta and Orlando; that crop of opponents, which will be cut to 10 in the coming weeks, will be forced to beat two of the four remaining AAF teams.\n\u201cWe are all extremely disappointed the NFL\u2019s bad business decision has forced the AAF to fold for our scheduled start date this Friday,\u2019\u2019 the league\u2019s statement read. \u201cThe grass-roots momentum created by the AAF is strong, as is our mission to restore American football to fans across the country.\u2019\u2019\nThe AAF has been a bizarre and somewhat sad chapter for the NFL and ESPN. The digital channel for the league was marred by internal feuding and problems securing talent. When the NFL said it wouldn\u2019t approve the league\u2019s players, the AAF struggled to secure talent for the spring season. When the league launched, a number of planned local kickoffs were forced to be rescheduled, or wiped out.\nAdvertisement\nUnderstood.\nBut there was also confusion over the seven games that were going to take place Thursday night. The initial schedule would have cut off the AAF\u2019s competition before the start of the regular season, and the backlash was intense. ESPN, which first announced the Thursday night games in November, felt it had been misled, and the network broadcasted its early AAF games anyway. Within a few hours, the Thursday night games were scrubbed, and all eight markets that had planned to host games this weekend were told they would have at least one game, if not two.\nThat chance comes Saturday, against an upstart team in the Los Angeles Express. ESPN will air the two prime-time games this weekend in an unprecedented format, with the first game on Thursday at 10 p.m. ET and the second one on Saturday, with the \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019\u2019 theme song, starting at 7:30 p.m.\nThe hosts of \u201cOutside the Lines\u2019\u2019 were so riled up that they called for an NFL-mandated investigation into league incompetence, and one writer for a New York station opined that he felt like \u201cthe middle man for the NFL, carrying a can of whoopass for them.\u2019\u2019\nThe 68-year-old head of the AAF, Charlie Ebersol, is an ex-L.A. Dodgers executive who sold a majority stake in his company to NBC. Ebersol quickly put distance between himself and his ownership, saying the money would not influence the league.\n\u201cThis league was never going to be the corporate family of NBC, or Ebersol Sports,\u2019\u2019 Ebersol said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a baseball executive for 36 years. From the moment we got the partner from NBC, we knew this was going to be built by a group of investors who had a specific perspective. They believed the opportunity was to develop football in a new way for fans across America.

{"text": "Mark Titus, Gleaner Writer\nWESTERN BUREAU:\nThe organiser of the Golden Age Caricom Skill Certificate Programme, who says the three-month programme is exclusively for Jamaicans to obtain Caribbean Community (CARICOM) certification to improve their employability, has accused some businessmen of waging a well-oiled plan to sabotage the programme.\n\"Businessmen who are pushing for the certificate scheme are spearheading an attack against the scheme, mostly due to this initiative of theirs that they want to push off the CARICOM gravy train,\" Howard Orr told The Sunday Gleaner.\nBut this alleged collusion by some businessmen was countered by some of the authorities who have expressed support for the rollout of the CARICOM certification scheme, which is designed to grow the local economy and improve trade within the regional grouping.\n\"The certification is not the sole responsibility of the government and the United States, it should be sought out by businesses to strengthen their managerial skills,\" said Labor Affairs Programme Officer at the CARICOM Secretariat in Jamaica, Xavia Pinnock, when contacted for comment.\nOrr, however, disputed Pinnock's assertion, pointing out that not only do businesses apply to receive certification, but special licences are required for specialised businesses.\n\"A lot of people, particularly Jamaicans, take advantage of this programme and masquerade as businessmen in order to get the certificate,\" declared Orr.\n\"In fact, a businessman like myself approached this role with the intent of doing it to assist the process to clarify things, but we quickly found that people don't tell the whole truth about themselves.\"\nIMPORTANT POSITION\nEarlier this year, Orr assumed the position of chief instructor of the Caribbean Commerce Training Institute, Jamaica, and set to work to recruit Jamaicans for the intensive education, set to start in mid-May.\n\"They came out with some threats from the very beginning to not promote this programme from Jamaica, but we've proved them wrong as we've passed over 200 applicants and have only four men left,\" said Orr.\nHe also highlighted that Jamaica is the only CARICOM member state which has been cooperating with the Secretariat in Jamaica in ensuring the training is done consistently with the requirements of the Guyana Regional Certification Board, while allowing for visas to be approved by the Guyana Government.\n\"Even the government of Guyana does not allow for the time and effort that has been invested by Jamaica to get the training and certification done in such a manner,\" noted Orr.\nPinnock, however, pointed out that work was also done to make the training on-site more engaging.\n\"In January, it was introduced as 'designed to enable CARICOM nationals within five parishes in Jamaica's industrial sector' to go out and sample plants and techniques necessary to set up a small greenhouse for commercial cultivation,\" said Pinnock.\n\"Even though our members were initially reluctant to see this undertaken, other members of the local business community have taken up this opportunity to partner with us,\" added Pinnock.\nOver the past 10 years, there has been a migration gap in Jamaica, with an increasing influx of Jamaicans going to the United States and Australia. This has led to the introduction of programmes which, like the CARICOM certification scheme, are targeted at assisting the brain drain to reverse and to prepare the workforce for the regional and global economic recovery.\nmark.titus@gleanerjm.com\n", "label": "machine"}

The information contained on the phone brought police on a trail that ultimately led to the accused.\nOn Tuesday, police announced both accused were \u201cextremely violent offenders.\u201d\nThere is a jolt when the words \u201cextremely violent\u201d are paired with the word \u201cpickpockets.\u201d\nUnbelievably, a criminal record of 11 charges is the new normal for the accused.\nThe conclusion is that the five-year-old cases were not \u2013 or could not be \u2013 solved and each accused was released on bail.\nDefence lawyers argue the sentences are too stiff for a relatively minor crimes. Police, however, asked for tougher sentences and did not receive it.\nWhat is known about the victims \u2013 other than that an associate, whose name was not revealed, has been charged and faces two-week mandatory release before trial \u2013 is that they are described as \u201csimple people.\u201d\nIt is as if things did not work out for the accused.\nOne weapon-carrying associate was charged and is awaiting trial. One allegedly dealt marijuana, found in the search of his home, was charged and awaiting trial. One faces guns, drugs and weapons charges while the others are facing charges.\nAccording to police, the alleged co-conspirators were numerous as well, going back to 2010.\nThere are 74 charges against the four accused \u2013 Gregory Patrick Perry, 23, Stefan Paul Motaskevich, 20, Aaron Matthew Walter, 19, and Steven Patrick Hellyer, 19.\nTwelve were done in connection with the car theft in Victoriaville, five were a result of a break-in in St-Jerome.\n\u201cThe number (of charges) does not bother me. It is their liberty,\u201d said Moncour.\nPolice are satisfied with the results of the prosecutions, he said.\nThe Ministry of Justice also welcomes arrests and prosecutions on the charges.\nLegal deficiencies are difficult to resolve when justice is hampered by poor communication between defence and prosecution and lack of sufficient resources.\nBut at the same time, legal counsel\u2019s ability to provide the public with information and information about his client is important.\nAnd in the case of the five accused, if the force was truly effective in finding evidence, investigators could have brought evidence to justice long ago.\nIn the meantime, offenders like these often continue to threaten the public with disregard for justice. Their disposition, like their disposition, should stay hidden.\nBill C-51, which when properly implemented would allow police to immediately seek out information about the accused and assist in the prosecution, is stalled in the Senate.\nmonicreg@att.net\nTwitter: @monicreg\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Millions of Nigerians woke up yesterday morning to series of fuel shortages in both commercial and personal motor vehicles as a result of perceived \u201cunwillingness\u201d of the government to ensure immediate removal of subsidy from the products.\nA Goodlatte government official said the government was ready to \u201cend fuel subsidy but with a hefty burden\u201d.\n\u201cThe government is ready to end subsidy but with a hefty burden.\n\u201cThe statement by the IMF and the World Bank now that subsidy should be removed from fuel increases our fears as Nigerians became wide-spread.\u201d\nHe explained that the government was also surprised to hear the clarification by the IMF and World Bank.\nOne of the attendant consequences of the government\u2019s position on subsidy removal is likely to spark litany of protests from right-thinking Nigerians.\nOn Monday, the Chairman of Organised Private Sector (OPS) Coordinating Council, Japaul Okafor, in Lagos, said the World Bank was against the removal of subsidy, an undertaking Nigeria made through the debt multilateral instrument, adding that the nation would lose its international investment name.\nAlso, an Alausa, Ikeja resident, Mrs Kemi Anifowose, said the World Bank had called for removal of subsidy by the government.\n\u201cEverybody is asking: What are the consequences of discontinuing subsidy, since I am sure there are implications?\n\u201cSo as a right-thinking citizen, I must know that the government is prepared to deal with everybody, including victims in the unending fuel subsidy saga.\n\u201cLike I said, since we are not physically in the country for a major election, my recommendation is that Nigerians should resist acts of this nature.\u201d\nA car driver, Mr Emmanuel Oluwole, said: \u201cThe solution to the problem lies in improving our economy, which we cannot achieve through removal of subsidy.\n\u201cMost of us are suffering from such hardship. I cannot be talking of protesting when I am unemployed, as I don\u2019t have money to engage in such activities.\u201d\nMr Olumide Popoola, a living wage worker, said: \u201cThe people are giving the government a free pass of sorts as long as they are asking for the removal of subsidy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for such people to be supporting the government if they know they would become a victim of the social vices.\n\u201cThis is not the time to be jubilating because nobody is sure what will happen after removal of subsidy.\u201d\nNIGERIA has been savaged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, for not making good the agreements reached with the fund and the bank to eliminate fuel subsidy.\nThey have urged the Federal Government to immediately and without delay completely deregulate the downstream petroleum sector.\nThe couple of bodies had in May 2014 mandated the government to end fuel subsidy.\nHowever, the successive administrations in the country that had the greatest outcry over fuel queues and high cost of fuel, left the existing arrangement.\nThe government had devised other strategies to assist Nigerians, including selling subsidised petroleum products through private refineries, subsidy on imported diesel and contracting some middlemen to sell foreign exchange.\nIn November, 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari restated his commitment to eliminate subsidy in order to bring prices of fuel close to international market prices.\nHe further hinted at this dispensation that his administration would address the issue through a comprehensive programme of structural reform.\n", "label": "machine"}

Gabby sounded pretty good on her original song, but it wasn't the most captivating take on the Creedence Clearwater Revival hit. Grace was able to deliver a powerful take on Katy Perry's \"Dark Horse,\" with a moment when her voice cleared to reveal backup vocalists. Troy sang \"Hit the Road Jack\" in the final round, but his version did not highlight his greatest asset: his voice. Maddie sang \"Dark Horse\" as well, although she did not do a close-up of her face to showcase her talents.\nThe first double elimination happened later that night, with the bottom two singers earning the opportunity to sing a duet in the final rounds before being eliminated. Caleb Lee Hutchinson and Maddie Poppe both sang with other members of their groups \u2014 Maddie sang with Avalon Young and Caleb sang with Gabby Barrett \u2014 which helped them move on. This meant that Gabby Barrett was eliminated, with Caleb Lee Hutchinson going on to face off against Gabby for the top spot. The other two singers in the bottom were Gerald \"Mingo\" Jacobs and Wayne White. Whirlpool had also brought in Josh Gracin to sing, along with Kaleb Lee. Joshua Davis didn't even make it into the top 12.\nFor the finale, the top six singers will sing a \"live version\" of their eliminated contestants' songs.

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nWhen Jim Corrigan (Asher Angel) swoops in to take on Captain Marvel in the DCEU, fans were excited, but turned out to be disappointed. It turns out that Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) was a casual bystander to Corrigan taking on Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) in Shazam, and instead sends his nephew Billy Batson (Asher Angel) in his place.\nIt had been previously confirmed that Billy Batson is only permitted to be exposed to magic on one occasion. Putting Billy and the Shazam family of Lachlan, Filipe, Freddy, and Hiro into a climactic fight against Captain Marvel, in order to have the chance to become the real Shazam, had been part of the plan from the get-go.\nHowever, what fans saw was already expected, with Billy taking on Billy Batson as the Shazam, fighting Captain Marvel, not Jim Corrigan. And what means DC made for these characters - that they would live on as superheroes - is surprising. If this is the case, then Warner Bros. could be set for quite the string of failures to come in its multiple ongoing DCEU films.\nThis Page: What The End of Shazam Means For The DCEU\nPage 2: How Changing The Shazam Movie's Ending Gives Hope For The DC Universe\nWhat The Shazam Movie Ending Means For The DCEU\nGossip and speculation has already begun to surround this surprising ending to the newest DCEU film. As seen from the trailer for the film, a majority of the damage was done by Shazam himself. And while that's perfectly appropriate, the ending did wind up stealing scenes from the rest of the film.\nBefore Jim can appear in the final act of Shazam, he retreats into his locker in the Captain Marvel HQ. Although he has no recollection of the battle, he whispers a quick explanation. It turns out the hero's power to change matter is actually a gift given to him by an old acquaintance from New York City.\nIt turns out that the man in question is the superintelligent, crime-fighting doctor Bert Monk (John Goodman), and that Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) knew it long before the Doctor himself. The Doctor would later find that this was just one of many such mystical gifts Dr. Monk gave to him. And as a result, the doctor not only brought the Shazam mythos to the future, but he laid the groundwork for something far greater.\nThe goal of Shazam, of course, is to be a tremendous success, and that's exactly what Shazam achieves. In terms of box office, the film blows past expectations, topping the previous record-holder X-Men: Apocalypse to set the standard for its Marvel counterparts on the big screen. The film also perfectly positions itself as an evolution of the classic superhero mythos. Shazam not only gives world-changing power to a six-year-old, but it also does so through a technology so far out of the box that it would have been so uncommon in science fiction when the character was created a century ago.\nBut with Shazam, the place from which he emerged. The story of the familiar hero now encapsulates a New York City we didn't know existed. It provides space for future additions and future advancements of the superhero and magical world.\nThis Page: The Audience Is Present In Shazam's Ending\nPage 2: How Changing The Shazam Movie's Ending Gives Hope For The DC Universe\n1 2\nWhat The Hell Is Viral Video Games?\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In this edition of Press and Journal, Paul Hutcheon investigates the crisis in Scottish healthcare and he features in our new Player Series, as the south backs away from traditional level seven hospitals.\nNHS Grampian is under fire for its poor record on treating patients after it emerged that almost one in five hospital operations in Scotland were cancelled last year because of NHS Grampian\u2019s finances.\nAcross Scotland between September 2016 and September 2017, 31% of all planned operations were delayed for less than a week. And just 20% were cancelled because of urgent reasons like bed shortages, use of emergency medicine or lack of staff, according to figures released yesterday.\nThe NHS Grampian figures are the most worrying of all of the 30 hospital systems and total more than 100,000 operations over the year.\nBut next year the NHS Grampian figures are likely to be even worse because the health board\u2019s worst start to the year is expected to continue at least for another four months.\nOnly 13% of operations in Grampian went ahead because of urgent or urgent pre-existing condition.\nSpeaking to the Press and Journal, an NHS Grampian spokeswoman said a range of reasons was put forward to cancel procedures including fear of patients being diverted by ambulance from urgent care. But she conceded that this tactic does have the unintended consequence of waiting time complaints.\nShe said: \u201cOur performance measures cover the amount of cancelled procedures compared to annual GP referral waiting times for patients with stable conditions. As agreed with the Scottish Government, ours are considered a 'low-risk metric' and were managed within recommended thresholds.\n\u201cIn April 2018 we met the government\u2019s target by managing around 84% of procedures within 16 days of referral and it is expected to meet the target through the current financial year.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe do however have the responsibility to manage complex cases, as well as a responsibility to meet targets to minimise planned cancelled surgeries. Our current performance and referrals indicate that around 40,000 patients have been managed within 16 days of referral from a GP.\n\u201cNo patient can be put at risk due to our application of the target to cover the coverage period with limited limited resources.\u201d\nMatthew Hutchinson, medical director at the charity British Heart Foundation, said there was no excuse for poor resourcing of standard level seven hospitals.\nMr Hutchinson said: \u201cWith many older people living longer and much more complex conditions developing, this situation is not acceptable for patients. There is no need for the NHS to cover even a few days in January with little-to-no staff in these hospitals. Waiting lists are rising and waiting times are increasing and this cannot continue. Waiting lists need to be stopped and surgery has to be improved.\n\u201cHigher investments are needed to address the obesity epidemic and prevent people developing diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. These problems can be addressed through simple exercise and healthier eating and in turn the risk of heart disease will be reduced. More research is needed into links between these risk factors and the current NHS crisis.\u201d\nThe trusts in the north-east have the most troubled financial performance of all hospitals. NHS Grampian made a \u00a39.9 million deficit last year while NHS Highland suffered a \u00a39 million shortfall.\nDespite working in the high dependency area, NHS Highland was not placed under any Ofsted supervision and had the lowest bed occupancy rate, in line with other trusts.\nNHS Grampian fared worse with patient mortality at a record high. There were 4,256 deaths in 2016-17 and the overall death rate is 7.8 per 100,000 people \u2013 compared to the Scottish average of 8.4 per 100,000 people.\nOn Tuesday, the Press and Journal highlighted how the NHS Lanarkshire discharged its own beds at Thornhill Park Community Hospital \u2013 a level seven hospital in its portfolio.\nNHS Grampian has 24 acute beds. The board said it has the highest number of level seven hospitals in Scotland.\nA spokesman said: \u201cNHS Grampian commissioned specialist equipment for surgical units to ensure medical support was available should conditions change.\n\u201cA retrospective review, which included the seating area, shows that they were occupied only 20 times over the entire reporting period for 11,537 nights.\n\u201cAt times as a result of the scale of demand across Grampian, these plans were changed.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen testifies before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on \u201cThe Threat from North Korea to the United States.\u201d Mark Wilson/Getty Images\nIt was too little, too late for several senators who had long wanted to hold Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in contempt of Congress for refusing to give them the names of immigrants in immigration detention and forcing a federal judge to force her hand. It was worth it, nonetheless.\nThe hearing was marred by a pair of frayed Democratic delegations. Judiciary Committee member Sen. Richard Blumenthal tried to interrogate Nielsen on the adequacy of the circumstances under which he wants her to attend an Orthodox Russian mikvah in accordance with Orthodox Jewish law; Nielsen said she was not talking about it, and Blumenthal retreated gracefully. Others argued that Senator David Perdue was unfair to Nielsen during his questioning, digging around at immigration levels and alienating her with unnecessary trouble.\nNielsen knew as soon as she got there that her answer for the Senate Judiciary Committee was forthcoming: She has been traveling with President Trump throughout the country, but won\u2019t recuse herself from all of the agency\u2019s work, so the Senate never had the chance to grill her on its policies, objectives, and evolutions. (The audit of her agency\u2019s data collection and ICE operations by GAO is in effect and will never see the light of day.) She acknowledged that she was being photographed at a sheriff\u2019s department where the handcuffs are uncomfortable. She offered no further comment on illegal migrant births and ways that an elected official can be commanded to keep critical information from an agency she runs.\nNielsen wanted the interview to come down to whether she was unfriendly to immigrants or respectful to the rule of law. That might have been a nice way to start a conversation, but standing behind her in the cramped hearing room\u2014where ICE has taken over the intelligence desks in some offices\u2014and betraying to senators an allegiance to ICE\u2019s brutality is too much to ask\u2014especially when they\u2019re facing a bullhorn-wielding Donald Trump.\nThe hearing opened with Nielsen\u2019s claim that Trump said she could do anything. She immediately apologized to senators who had earlier decried her refusal to keep the information of thousands of immigrants in detention secret. She said that Trump knew nothing about the death of a 10-year-old child. She remained resolute that she was applying the law faithfully and upholding national security. As if President Trump cared about national security. As if he liked to hear rational arguments about asylum or effective detention.\nSenator Patrick Leahy, who has spent many hours of conversation with law enforcement officials in the community, offered an insightful analysis of Nielsen\u2019s relationship with ICE, not just as secretary, but throughout her tenure in the Trump administration.\n\u201cAs a member of Donald Trump\u2019s staff, she has been important to the deportation and arbitrary entry of thousands of immigrants,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cShe also has worked closely with ICE officers and agents who have carried out this unlawful conduct\u2014a violation of many protections which Congress has enacted to guard against. Secretary Nielsen has worked in concert with ICE officers to break the law.\u201d\nLeahy noted that DHS is the purview of the attorney general. So why, he asked, was the attorney general giving her a pass? \u201cWhy is President Trump giving her carte blanche to dismantle the rules that Congress put in place to protect the public?\u201d Leahy asked. \u201cWhy is he letting her off the hook?\u201d\nLeahy also noted that Nielsen\u2019s security clearance was cancelled after his committee gave her a \u201cfailing grade.\u201d She explained that the president is familiar with her race and background. Leahy repeated that she is not versed in the language of institutional responsibility and hadn\u2019t been briefed on the culture of the department. It sounded like she\u2019d made up her mind early in the process not to give up. She said she\u2019d be happy to talk with lawmakers. Then he added that she\u2019d already had enough witnesses, and the time had come for her to go. Nielsen shook her head and said that she\u2019d given enough testimony.\nEventually, senators started asking her questions, and she clearly said she was in her position of authority because of Trump. But she conceded that she had been an executive secretary, an administration assistant, and deputy chief of staff in a Republican administration, but had never been part of a DHS which was named, along with the Trump administration, a national security agency. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big jump from the political office to the", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "On Thursday, Fatboy Slim, the DJ and electronic music producer, played Fatboy Slim, a show that also made for much better television. The setup: Fatboy Slim had set up a massive soundstage in Leicester Square with TV cameras and an extravagant Stomp of the Bulls-Eye overhead. The dedicated rock audience drank and danced until 2 a.m. In the center of the stage, a giant disco ball recreated the background of a vintage newsreel shot of a major news event: Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore on the Grammys red carpet with their eight-month-old daughter, nattily dressed, covered in shiny red carpet makeup. The theme and the theme song were \u201cIf You Can\u2019t Beat \u2019Em ... Let\u2019s Dance,\u201d and they spelled out for the audience what theater audiences in the 1980s thought themselves to be and Swayze was, and what they\u2019d been led to believe they were even if they weren\u2019t watching the Grammys.\nEarly in the exhibition, a strobe light flickers on the ceiling and off the ice palace at Buckingham Palace, a prop that captures the surreal, brilliant ostentation that Fosse was accustomed to putting forth in his extravagant choreography. He choreographed his premieres out of the imperial trappings of celebrity, enthroning stars on live TV (Heather Graham and Tony Randall, Faith Prince and Bernadette Peters on the top tiers of the Radio City Music Hall stage) with precision and the evident joy of performing for one\u2019s countrymen. He worked with the most peculiar sets, freezing them in time so that viewers would face the future when the final frame of the show flashed down. And when starlets took a tumble or a pint glass flew through the air, Fosse\u2019s tips were to leave that moment for the viewers to think about, not be called upon to interpret.\nThose qualities didn\u2019t go over well with his audience, who disapproved of the public commentary of the casting process that he supposedly conducted. They were nostalgic for the exuberant, campy energy of the golden age of movies (a genre that has evolved over the last three decades into an easy criticism of Fosse\u2019s work); the live camera work was for once, they pointed out, allowing them to see inside showbiz as Fosse observed it, instead of retreating with the rest of us behind the camera.\nThis had Fosse covered in irony, which made him resentful that he wasn\u2019t doing it justice. \u201cTo be a choreographer,\u201d he complains to his studio boss, Diane Sawyer (Jeanne Tripplehorn), in Shaffer\u2019s documentary, \u201cis a kind of crime.\u201d He often blames the media. When his first wife, the actress Teri Garr, suggests a play that would acknowledge Fosse\u2019s talents to a mainstream audience, Fosse worries about being compared to Jerome Robbins, whom Fosse even condescendingly labels \u201cthe greatest choreographer who ever lived.\u201d But Robbins too had the privilege of watching his work championed by an audience that made him ask himself, Fosse explains in the documentary, \u201cWhy did people not appreciate what I was doing?\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

How would it have happened with one of the league\u2019s ultra-competitive teams?\nGriffin, who tied a Clippers record with 23 rebounds and was named Western Conference player of the week, said he won\u2019t come out of the playoffs and be remembered just for a night.\n\u201cIf we get swept, we will say they were great competitors, great guys, and they really play hard,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\nBut for once, the Warriors had a problem child in the series.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Bay Area News Group, a member of the CNET News Network.

{"text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nAvengers: Endgame writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely want to write a new Secret Wars comic book series under the direction of the Russo Brothers. Due to the nature of comic book universes, it's become customary for many comic book works to be re-imagined in a big-screen fashion, with writers like Simon Kinberg writing/directing X-Men films or James Mangold adapting Wolverine comics. Although Mark Millar was able to establish an entirely new version of \"The New 52\" for his Ultimate Marvel version of the X-Men in Ultimate Comics Ultimates #1, Marvel Comics has all but put the Secret Wars story to bed for most fans.\nDuring the mid-2000s, Marvel took their epic story The Infinity Gauntlet and mounted a three-part comic called Secret Wars that ultimately brought together six major Marvel Earth-616 supporting characters - all of whom might have been left unaddressed had the other characters not united under a single banner. Although the story proved to be rather controversial when its long-awaited conclusion was released in 2016, the comic served its intended purpose - to round out the Civil War story arc in Marvel continuity by giving the Marvel Universe an additional character to compare it against; the Living Tribunal and other cosmic entities that signed the \"Ancient One's\" bill offering peace to the Earth in exchange for regular shipments of formula sent down to Earth and seeded throughout much of the multiverse. The result? A world united against those who took advantage of the universal-level changes to the human race.\nRelated: Disney Wants To Work With Marvel Again\nAvengers: Endgame continues that story, continuing the fight for everyone who ever lost an Avengers: Infinity War fight - including the Soul Stone-holding Doctor Strange. As Markus explained during a conference call with fans, the writers have been having fun re-imaging the Secret Wars story and deciding which heroes - if any - should return to help in the fight. Unfortunately, he confirmed, the Russo Brothers' interest in further exploring the Secret Wars universe hasn't made them too interested in having Marvel's actors do the same.\nIn the past, as much as Marvel seemed eager to develop other associated properties, some of them had difficulty finding co-directors and writers willing to deal with the restrictions of their own brand. So while Markus and McFeely are currently busy penning Endgame, there's a possibility they may collaborate on Secret Wars following the release of Endgame and take over as co-directors when Joe and Anthony Russo return to their regular film roles (at least on Avengers 4).\nWhether or not they do find themselves involved in the new Secret Wars, don't expect to see the Avengers use a version of the series in the upcoming Avengers 4 trailer. Although Infinity War serves as a prequel to Endgame, the trailer is likely to focus on the fallout of the end of Infinity War, so the Russo Brothers might have more time to develop a Secret Wars comic book story that isn't directly related to the events of their film.\nSource: Christopher Markus\nBen Affleck Reveals Why He's No Longer Involved with Batman\n", "label": "machine"}

What happened next may surprise you.\n\u201cI met a big time lawyer in Montreal,\u201d Vannelli recalls. \u201cWe married and now we have a two-year-old. I want to make music again, but I\u2019m also so busy now. I\u2019ve been rushing from here to there. I also worked as a locksmith.\u201d\nWhile this is news to fans of his early work, Vannelli knows why his past does not need to be spurned. After all, the album he is releasing this month on his own Suburbia Records label is full of mid-80s blues classics such as Kansas Joe and Robbie Fulks (\u201cthat was an easy song to write\u201d) as well as not-so-easy songs such as Mr. Bush and Mr. Stevenson.

I wrote a lot of personal stuff and I\u2019m releasing those songs because I wanted to put them out there, because it was therapeutic, I guess.\u201d\nWith a new album and new DVD footage showing him in a 1980s leather jacket and a bright white shirt, Vannelli is heading back into the spotlight. While he acknowledges his occasional lapse into nostalgia in his career, he is determined to make sure that old hit will live on. He is also working on a sequel to Before the Blizzard.\nBefore that, Vannelli is on stage and very much a rock star.\nHe just played in Richmond, Va., and will come to Montreal for three dates, beginning April 26 at Joe Louis Arena.\n\u201cI am so lucky,\u201d he says of his staying power. \u201cI have a couple of really good friends.

{"text": "Updated\nA Perth lollipop man and his son insist they are being harassed and retaliated against by other children in the area as they fight allegations they tried to get children in his area to have sex with each other.\nMichael Cyril Hyde, who walks children to and from school and has held the role for more than 30 years, was accused of conducting a campaign to get children at a primary school to have sex with each other by former police officer Gerry Dignan.\nMr Hyde has vigorously denied the claims and the ABC asked him to address why he continues to supervise children after his daughter and step-daughter spoke publicly to defend him.\nThe allegations date back to when Mr Hyde worked at Lake Hillier Public School, but police said later they were unable to pursue charges against him over a number of incidents due to lack of evidence.\nLate last year, Mr Hyde resigned from his employment at Lake Hillier, before quitting his position with Lathlain Public School in May.\nHe has publicly supported the other schools in the area.\nMr Hyde was alerted to the allegations by an ABC radio listener who claimed Mr Hyde had been contacted at his home by several children claiming to be former students of Lake Hillier Public School.\n\"I'm embarrassed, shocked and deeply troubled to learn that some of the students in my care at Lake Hillier have accused me of attempting to groom and sexually abuse them,\" Mr Hyde said in response to the allegations.\n\"This behaviour goes against everything I believe in and anything I've taught my children to do.\"\nWhat happened at Lake Hillier?\nMr Hyde said in a 2016 interview that at Lake Hillier, he was told a boy had been \"grooming\" another child who was present while he was at the school.\nHe said a staff member believed she witnessed the grooming and asked another student who had witnessed the incident to help her report it.\nMr Hyde said the child she approached asked if he wanted to have sex with her.\n\"She can't even look at me the rest of the day,\" he said.\nMr Hyde said he did not have contact with the student and did not attend the meeting with staff.\n\"I just shut down because I don't approve of that,\" he said.\n\"I would never condone sexual abuse, because that wouldn't be my way.\"\nMr Hyde said staff told him not to approach the child again and that his phone calls and emails were monitored by the school.\nWhere does that leave Lathlain Public School?\nThe ABC asked Mr Hyde why he chose to take a position at a school in a suburb where other school employees, who also happened to be men, had been accused of sexually abusing children.\nMr Hyde said he had the support of another retired lollipop man, in order to free up the children to pass the pupils to another person, when the parents were attending a fundraiser or event.\n\"My understanding was that there were allegations against the lollipop men as opposed to the teachers. So, all the boys from here to the south, they have more male shoulders to lean on,\" he said.\n\"And where I came from, you couldn't put a real soft target, because the lollipop men did so much for the kids,\" he said.\nHe also said he was not aware of any allegation made against a male lollipop man working in other parts of the Perth metropolitan area.\nIn 2017, nearly three years after the alleged incidents at Lake Hillier, Lathlain principal Mike Williamson said Mr Hyde's actions were \"very, very inappropriate\".\n\"And after that point we made the decision that any time that Michael was out with pupils, it was compulsory that he be supervised by another staff member \u2014 and that is what we're doing now,\" Mr Williamson said.\n\"He'll be supervised by a staff member.\"\nMr Hyde has not given any interviews since resigning in May.\nSettlement negotiations continue\nMr Hyde's attorney Eric Van De Water has advised he will not consent to a media interview until mediation negotiations are settled.\nHowever, Mr Hyde declined to answer specific questions from the ABC about whether allegations were made that he tried to groom, or assault, students.\nIn his earlier interview in 2016, Mr Hyde denied any acts of sexual abuse.\nTopics: sexual-offences, law-crime-and-justice, sexual-health, schools, lathlain-6055, broadbeach-6155, perth-6000\nFirst posted\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the end, Jon Snow has it: He\u2019s returned home.\nSunday night, HBO aired the Season 8 premiere of Game of Thrones on its streaming service and its cable channel. The hour-long episode, written by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, marked the fourth episode\u2019s title change, recasting the tense military battle that would see Dany up against the Night King as its central plotline.\nThe war is over and Jon (Kit Harington) is their savior.\nFor viewers, this too was an unanticipated twist: Dany\u2019s rise is all-consuming in the show, while Jon, a Bastard of Winterfell, was just on his way to Throne. Now, after the Army of the Dead wiped out House Lannister, Jon and Daenerys are united as allies, with it being almost assured that he\u2019ll turn her into queen.\nNow, Thrones is finally giving Jon Snow the proper backstory that fans have been clamoring for. Last episode, we learned that he\u2019s actually Aegon Targaryen, son of Aerys Targaryen and Rhaegar Targaryen. He was removed from the legal line of succession (even though there were rumors that he could one day reign as king) when his father had his second cousin Ellaria killed by Dorne\u2019s ruthless Queen, Doran Martell (played by Alexander Siddig).\nAegon\u2019s mother was the impossibly beautiful Melisandre, who immediately fell in love with the young prince, even though he was an enemy during the War of the Five Kings. Lady of the Night\u2019s Watch and granddaughter of Walder Frey, Brienne of Tarth, warmed to the mysterious Targaryen as well, boarding her direwolf Ghost with a magical red kilt that would smell of Olyvar\u2019s blood.\nBriar\u2019s legend grows, while his true story remains a mystery. The other Starks are also interested in learning more about their bastard son and their history. But the Alliser Thorne (Owen Teale) continues to reject such a notion, claiming that if anyone wanted to know the truth about Jon Snow, they needed to go to the Vale.\nFor a leader, Joffrey\u2019s role in the new arc is telling. After years of beating the rest of the Starks and their maverick counselor Lysa Arryn (Kate Dickie), he lays down his own terms for accepting them back into his family: that every ruler in the house should kiss Lysa\u2019s hand twice, and clear their names on the grounds that they were unwillingly used by the Lannisters. As if there were ever any doubt, Joffrey soon does kiss Lysa, and whispers his resurrection oath into her ear.\nAnd then it comes to pass: Jon and Daenerys put an end to Dany\u2019s war to remove the Night King by merging them and moving them into the shadow realm.\nWhat is under the table of the civil war that plagues Westeros? The death of Yara Greyjoy (Gemma Whelan), and whoever she brings with her, was the first sign that time was near. But Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) had the sight of a wight and convinced Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) to kill the new Night King in front of everyone\u2014who decides against an assault on the Wall because there are none left to kill. Jaime considers the wight to be a boon and decides to confront it in person\u2014but despite the wight raising its lance, Jaime is still killed by an arrow. This cliffhanger doesn\u2019t wrap up until the episode\u2019s end, leaving the second half of Season 8 to explore the implications of all that death.\nBut before that, last night\u2019s episode had Jon Snow and Dany stand together as they created the White Walker and dragon. For fans of Dany, Jon, and all things Stark, this was a moment that felt long, long overdue.\nThis season had been teasing the two since they met at the end of Season 7, but not as anyone other than two incredibly powerful alliances\u2014for all intents and purposes an unbreakable one, finally protecting the whole of Westeros\u2014could be such a thrilling image.\nAnd Jon\u2019s ring was key, reminding fans of the Time Heading of the dead. Jon\u2019s link to his own bloodline now gives the universe someone in the early chapters of his story. And a new hope for future generations that saw his return.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "0\nLance Bass and Aaron Kunkel, the stars of MTV\u2019s The Boy Band Con, had an idea for a documentary about the 90s boy band craze, and they got into it with the help of Abby Sunderland, MTV\u2019s Chief Creative Officer and creator of World of Wonder Productions, and Adam Refn (Drive, Cosmopolis, Drive Angry). Based on their Kickstarter campaign, The Boy Band Con is now a 33-episode true-crime docuseries documenting the trials and tribulations of aspiring female pop stars and music labels, searching for a star\u2026and falling in love.\nDuring this 1-on-1 phone interview with Collider, actor and producer Lance Bass talked about how he got into the project, what it was like collaborating with Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath and Adam Goldstein, how the documentary was written off as just a documentary because of the huge influence the \u201990s pop music scene had on them, what it was like watching some of the bands they profiled on-screen perform, their approach to comedy and how they had to tread a delicate line. As an actor and producer, he also talked about Scream Queens, working with Jamie Lee Curtis, Ryan Murphy, and the possibility of Season 2. Check out what he had to say after the jump.\nCollider: You definitely got to meet a lot of people in this documentary. How did you get involved with this doc? Did you know Adam at all?\nLANCE BASS: I met Adam at the beginning, when I did a few of the pre-screenings. What I found, I think, amazing about him, was his desire to contribute. He was so enthusiastic about the whole experience, and he wanted to help move the project along. I found that really, really inspiring. So, when they asked me to do it, I was so excited to work with him. And I mean, he\u2019s obviously someone I\u2019ve watched for years and years, and I love him as a singer and as a performer. As much as anyone, I look up to Adam McGrath and what he did in making Sugar Ray a great pop-rock band.\nIn this documentary, there are so many aspects. Do you think that\u2019s why you started this project?\nBASS: I think a lot of us, when we look back, were like, \u201cThis was so bad. Nobody wanted to talk to us. It was such a garbage shoot.\u201d And then, it\u2019s like, \u201cWait a minute! Wait a minute! This wasn\u2019t that bad!\u201d It was a good documentary. So, me being an actor, me being a musician, and me wanting to help out, I was willing to help out in any way that I could.\nDid you ever get to meet anyone that was in that scene that you just spoke about?\nBASS: I met Adam and Mark McGrath, and then Adam Goldstein got to know me through Adam and Mark. I\u2019ve known Adam since I was a teenager. He was my stepbrother, and we grew up together. It was really fun. Adam and I are close. I\u2019ve known him for years, so it was fun to get to see him as an adult. He really opened up to me. Everyone was really nice. Mark McGrath was cool, too. It was just a different era, so some things were different. But, they weren\u2019t the worst.\nWhat was the thinking behind the title? I imagine that, initially, it was just something you guys came up with.\nBASS: Yeah, because it really was just like, \u201cBoy bands, 90s music.\u201d It\u2019s what we wanted to talk about, from the very beginning. We wanted to try to have it from the bottom up. So, the title became something that we wanted to use because we tried to capture what the struggles were, from the passion of the band, to the obstacles they were faced with, to the fighting and the battling, to the pressure they were under, and to the romance. All of those things mixed together were the ultimate \u201cboy band con.\u201d We found ways to highlight all of the things, that were kind of a con, that made that band what it was. What I found really cool about working with that was that, there were pitfalls to it, as well. If you were good enough, all the attention would come to you. But at the same time, you weren\u2019t protected from what was around you. That was something I tried to emphasize, in the documentary. And that really just hits home for everyone who grew up watching the \u201990s band", "label": "machine"}

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\nAnother chance: The Eagles have second- and third-round draft picks, thanks to last year's Carson Wentz trade.\nAmong players the Eagles should be considering at No. 25 is S Nasir Adderley, who led Auburn in tackles last season and is coming off a productive year.\nWhere else could he go: Adderley (6-1, 202 pounds) is the best safety in this year's class and would be a logical pick for the Eagles. In fact, Adderley, a converted running back, started 10 of 12 games as a senior in 2017. The Eagles need a safety playmaker on special teams, and his ability to impact a game in many ways could help them transition him to cornerback as a rookie.\nStrengths: His former position makes him a well-rounded player. He's a strong tackler with decent awareness of the game. He's also a hard-nosed player with great ball skills and the ball skills to get interceptions.\nHe's physical in the run game and plenty quick to put a guy on his back to jam at the line. He's got good speed, closing speed and athleticism for a defensive back.\nIssues: Adderley has played mostly free safety at Auburn, making him somewhat questionable at strong safety, which the Eagles do have options at with Malcolm Jenkins and Rodney McLeod. Adderley has some quickness but needs to add some bulk to improve his play in run support.\nA&M defensive end Charles Tapper could be a nice fit at defensive end in the Eagles' subpackages.\nRollout: Regardless of what the Eagles are doing, Adderley is the player that gives them the best chance to become playoff contenders right away.\nRobert Kraft is now determined to start persuading Tom Brady to consider retirement. Gronk is the one remaining question.\nMalcolm Jenkins, meanwhile, was not present at the Eagles Organized Team Activities Monday.

{"text": "recommended,\nJanuary 2016. Hold-ups at Bendigo Hospital have caused Sophie Garth to miss her Menopause. But it wasn't her fertility that was disrupted. It was her normally healthy bowel. An endoscopy revealed the intestinal obstruction. \"I went in and immediately knew something was wrong,\" recalls Garth, from Culcairn. \"The next night, two weeks after I returned to Menopause, I had immediate surgery to have the wall and inner lining removed. \"This was in April 2016. I'm fairly positive about my short bowel history, but I do think it could have been saved.\" Miraculously, Garth managed to keep the infection within the peritoneum for five days after the endoscopy. A few weeks later, a smear test detected no clear sign of cancer. The three-year, $250 million construction of a 50-metre-long, three-floor, ropeless, private wing on the Murray Campus of Albury Wodonga Regional Cancer Centre was a key part of endoscopic and cancer specialties by the Albury Wodonga Health health service.

{"text": "PIEDMONT \u2014 Officials with the publicly owned Valero Energy refinery must move out by the end of the year because it can\u2019t afford to pay higher rent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring the family from Texas, but we\u2019re negotiating,\u201d said Piedmont City Manager Doug Hinrichs.\nThe Valero complex comprises the refinery, bio-fuels facility, tanks and pipes. It is being sold to Andeavor, part of Tesoro Energy. Andeavor didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nAndeavor has become the new owner of most of the closed Bay Area oil refineries but has only now finalized its acquisition of Valero. The the 49ers environmental compliance complex will also be closed and sold. On the other hand, another 2,000 jobs will be created as Andeavor adds bio-fuels production at its old Chevron refinery.\nThe Valero complex was originally built by oilman Robert Moody Jr. and his partner Walter Leigh in 1959 and expanded in 1963. Moody Sr. died suddenly in December 2009, and left his family to develop his 50-acre retirement community. Robert Moody Jr.\u2019s sons and daughters, Conrad and Ingrid, operated the site when it was for sale. In May 2013, Andeavor purchased the Valero complex at 1 Big Basin Way for $180 million.\nThe complex consists of the Valero Bay Area Gasoline Refinery, the Valero Biofuels Platform, which consists of storage tanks and piping, the Sanford Fuels Storage and Distribution Center, and the 2000-12 Northshore High-Speed Transmission Line system. Andeavor has not yet completed an environmental assessment to determine and publish the impact of its proposal. Until the EIA is in place, a lack of public comment has been the result. In effect, the city is being silent.\nLongtime resident Donna Whittemore lives just outside the general area of the complex where the bio-fuel tank farm is. She pointed out that a port of entry is within sight.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just placing their trucks and tankers right on our roads,\u201d Whittemore said. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen some of it.\u201d\nThe price of the property has gone from $470 million to $1.65 billion over 18 months. Hinrichs said if the city doesn\u2019t act now, the new owner may raise rents to unaffordable levels, which would force Valero to leave.\nSome oil defenders say the Valero family may fight the eviction order, but Hinrichs noted that the family did not give the city notice and has not made any public statements. In the fall of 2013, Valero made an unsuccessful attempt to have the City Council approve selling its Ingleside Gas station to BP. Valero wanted to sell that property and its former headquarters at 450 Old St. Helena Road, near the old Alameda Airport, also on St. Helena Road.\nUnder the tentative sale terms of Valero\u2019s refinery purchase, Andeavor would invest $200 million in capital improvements over three years, beginning late 2016. As part of the buyer agreement, Valero would invest $300 million in 2013, including $120 million for equipment, improvements and site upgrades. Also included in the deal was a commitment from Valero to sell 200 acres of Alameda County land to Andeavor for use as a comprehensive biofuels hub within the city\u2019s proposed East Bay Energy Corridor, which would feed Valero\u2019s operational needs.\nResidents said Valero lease prices have been among the highest in the Bay Area. A representative for the company recently told the Daily Piedmontian, \u201cRight now, because of our high demand for diesel fuel, it\u2019s relatively difficult to find an apartment that\u2019s all-inclusive in terms of utilities and whatnot, so we\u2019ve had to agree to pay a little more than market value.\u201d\nPiedmont land-use attorney Tim Janigo said he might fight the eviction order on behalf of Valero. But, he added, he may find it difficult to come up with funds to challenge the order.\nAnd he noted there are a couple of complications. Valero still owns 350 acres off of Orchard Drive, north of Bay Parkway and east of Orchard. Janigo said Valero continues to pay and develop orchard land, although it has not developed orchards there. So, the city can claim the remaining property as in its pre-eminent use. Also, Valero may try to keep the old refinery building.\n", "label": "machine"}

It felt like we were shooting for people sitting on their couches watching the show.\"\n\"It's all so mythological,\" Crompton said. \"The world\u2019s in peril \u2014 but it\u2019s not. The entire world is miraculously working. There are really no problems at all. Until something tells you otherwise.\"\nIn Crompton\u2019s case, \"something\" was Joe Naufahu\u2019s character. Jon Snow, the current King in the North, lost his father\u2019s love and looks up to him as the nearest thing to a kindred spirit on the show.\nThe two were good friends, on set and off. At the end of the day, Naufahu was the very embodiment of Ned.\nThough his pal ended up being responsible for the death of one of Eddard\u2019s closest friends, Crompton made sure he knew exactly what the character meant to the actor.\n\"I didn\u2019t know to expect the sad phone call,\" Crompton recalled. \"I just wanted to leave [Naufahu] with the bond that we had built.\"\nIt's back to the map in fifth 'Game of Thrones' book: 'It's not as powerful as the original'\n\"When I go and look at the scene, I'm going to be impressed that Joe killed you, big guy,\" Crompton told Eddard to calm him down in the scene, \"and that means more to me than you know.\"\nCrompton's fellow actors felt the same way. \"I think we've all had to find an emotional edge that's never been discussed before when the cameras weren't rolling,\" said Sam Palladio, who plays Samwell Tarly, to a reporter at a recent event.\nThe actors said they shared things about real-life relationships with their show-pitched counterparts \u2014 secrets the actors didn\u2019t even have to worry about revealing in real life.

Rather than contain extreme thoughts, metaphors and strange scenarios, these tales increasingly preserve the comfortable but false norm of consumerist societies.\nYet the individuals who were most empowered by these stories, he argues, typically became the most self-righteous.\nAlthough this message is clearly unpopular among some, O\u2019Malley believes the solution to this problem lies in reappropriating stories and alternative forms of entertainment.\n\u201cOrwell\u2019s dystopia was a dud. No one is disappointed in George Orwell,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happens is that these versions of reality are so familiar that they form the basis of reality in itself, and the only way out is out. But one of the hardest things to do is bring the things we love back.\u201d\n\u201cThe Book of Job\u201d might be a terrible story, but O\u2019Malley says it provides the framework for the channeling of imagination and emotion to real action.\nCredit: / UTAH STREAM\nFuture of Space Tourist\nAt 6 p.m. on Friday, Sloan Auditorium will host Kevin Murphy\u2019s theatrical performance, \u201cFuture of Space Tourist,\u201d a piece of improvised theater that Murphy describes as \u201ca journey through the stories of our current and future-hopeful ethos.\u201d\n\u201cFuture of Space Tourist\u201d involves combining comedy with political discussion in a unique program that \u201cfocuses on wry wit, clever tongue-in-cheek satire and profound entertainment,\u201d Murphy explains.

{"text": "So now it looks like the Republicans' farewell to government may become a collective mea culpa to all Americans about what they did.\nThe federal court settlement over the U.S. territory's debt remains the nation's No. 1 cause of concern, but on the immediate horizon looms efforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to obtain aid for Puerto Rico as high as $15 billion.\nPresident Donald Trump wiped his hands of the territory last October, dismissing its problems as a \"fake disaster.\" Congress, unwilling to show mercy on its least of its colonies, approved $3.4 billion in direct aid for Puerto Rico last summer. Since then, the island's dire financial state has worsened. The island is on pace to have $94 billion in debt by the end of this fiscal year and has mandated a third bailout of municipalities.\nStill, the Obama administration wrote in its latest report on the island's financial situation that a third bailout of Puerto Rico municipalities (the second passed this year) is required if they expect to meet a constitution requirement to pay at least 70 percent of their revenue to pay their debts. That's unrealistic. The state in crisis is often unprepared for hurricanes and other emergencies, yet is squandered with unsustainable day-to-day spending. More than one million Americans own homes worth $165,000 or less in Puerto Rico, so \"we all hold the responsibility for what has happened there,\" Rep. Nydia Velazquez said in Congress on Monday.\nNo, Congress and Trump did not cause Puerto Rico's financial crisis. But Republicans did substantially, leaving them no chance of understanding the thorny problems. Puerto Ricans deserve no less treatment than our fellow Americans in other ways. Republicans could do so much more good for Puerto Rico: Declare all money that the island has borrowed illegal. It has a long history of imposing tax burdens on Americans that run in the other direction, and Congress needs to crack down on that.\nGranted, those folks are Americans. But that's just not true.\n", "label": "machine"}

The road was wet because of the recent rain.\nAt 3:48 p.m. the vehicle she was driving spun, giving Paff a clue that something might go wrong. He jumped into his own car to race to the accident scene, situated one-half of a mile north of the Inver Grove Heights juncture with 87th Street.\nHe found the Cadillac CRX crashed into the lane of oncoming traffic. Its occupants had crawled from the wrecked vehicle into a nearby ditch. Two teens who\u2019d been standing in the ditch \u2014 one was nearby and friend of the driver\u2019s niece \u2014 had suffered only minor injuries.\nBut after pleading with the sun-soaked drivers to stay in their vehicles while emergency workers attended to the inattentive passengers, Paff found both sisters already gone. \u201cThey died within a half-hour of each other,\u201d he said.\nGov. Mark Dayton, in his 2014 State of the State address, called for the ban on texting and talking on cellphones while driving.

{"text": "Share this:\nTweet\nThe Boston Celtics are showing great resolve after facing a litany of obstacles.\nThe Celtics entered the regular season with expectations of winning the Eastern Conference. A lot has happened to derail that dream and cause Boston to set lofty goals entering the playoffs. The reality of life on the hardwood has humbled the Celtics, however, and they responded Thursday by wrapping up a playoff berth with a win over the Philadelphia 76ers at TD Garden.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty,\u201d Celtics point guard Terry Rozier said in his postgame news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d\nWell, it sure seems like Rozier\u2019s words summarize perfectly Boston\u2019s season. Whether the Celtics go into Saturday\u2019s first-round playoff series against the Washington Wizards as one of the better teams in the NBA, or they\u2019re merely content to just be part of the March Madness TV package this time around, it\u2019s safe to say the C\u2019s have a good thing going.\nThe Cavs and Raptors sat back and watched the Celtics make this season-long grind happen in relative seclusion. It\u2019s likely Boston will draw a tough second-round opponent, especially with another playoff run being expected from reigning MVP Kyrie Irving, but the fact that the Celtics still managed to emerge healthy and positioned to beat the defending NBA champions in a potential second-round matchup hardly seems like a surprise.\nFrankly, that might be exactly how Boston wants to view it \u2014 and it\u2019s probably what should always be how Boston views itself as a team with this many talented players and ascending coach. Win or lose, how much do we all really know about a team? We find out on the court, of course, and no one is questioning whether Boston is a team that\u2019s headed to the Finals, but how much truth is there behind all of the ins and outs of a team that had a seemingly promising season but has been stripped down yet again?\nThe Celtics sure sound like a team that\u2019s thinking that there is some truth to all of the ins and outs.\n\u201cA lot of us can have a very strong connection,\u201d Celtics forward Marcus Morris said Thursday. \u201cDefinitely felt like that this year. The way we have each other is very special.\u201d\nEven the team\u2019s postseason schedule doesn\u2019t provide too much clarity because teams have shown they can beat one another in about every conceivable scenario since Thursday\u2019s season finale ended. But the C\u2019s seem to have a strong point of view about where things stand when they come down to it.\n\u201cThe truth is that we have showed that we can go into any opponent and win,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said Thursday night. \u201cWe expect that again. Obviously there will be different circumstances and it\u2019s different faces, but we expect that.\u201d\nThe Celtics shouldn\u2019t expect to go into any potential playoff matchup slouches, though. It\u2019s doubtful that Washington will go into Boston and knock off the defending champs, and the same goes for whichever teams could potentially face the Celtics in the conference finals or beyond.\nThis is a strong Celtics team, and it\u2019s one they should expect to go all the way if they\u2019re able to stay healthy.\nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "life-style, basketball, Newcastle Hunters, WARATAH BASKETBALL LEAGUE, Newcastle Waratahs, Wolves, Great Lakes Hawks, Wollongong Wolves, Shark\nIf the Waratahs want to keep hold of their Waratah Basketball League top-four spot, they will have to play through adversity in their next two games. Returning from long-term injuries, Newcastle have lost Wollongong Wolves import Jamar Xellious against Young Fire in their penultimate round home clash on Sunday. Great Lakes Hawks will be without last weekend's Woolooware Bay Hawks player of the match for the second time in three weeks when they host the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at Waratah on Sunday in a final-round double header. Adam Bahr scored a game-high 27 points and had 11 rebounds in a 106-83 win over Waratah on Friday. Bahr kept up his formidable form by scoring 30 points in a 106-103 win over the Mallabula Panthers on Friday. He drained 17 points, including a 3-pointer, in the final three minutes of the Hawks' 102-84 triumph over Woolooware Bay last Sunday. \"That's an Achilles heel for us when we lose one of those guys at the end of a game,\" Waratahs coach Barry Preston said. \"We struggled without Xellious at the end last round against Waratah, and now we're missing him again. \"He's a big, big problem for us. Xellious can only work on limited things. He's been crucial to our team's success this year, and we need a few more guys who can knock down 3-pointers. We need to get some depth into the line-up. \"We need to find some points out of our bench. You just never know when we need somebody, so we've got to be ready to go when he's needed to get some rest.\" Xellious missed the last two weeks with a stress reaction and shouldn't miss again this weekend because he has missed only two games of the 10 this season. It leaves an opening for 19-year-old international and North Cronulla Eagles prodigy Clarke Vause, who scored 12 points with three 3-pointers and six assists in the fourth quarter against Mallabula and was named Most Valuable Player of the entire tournament. \"Clarke was brilliant last weekend and will be vital next weekend,\" Preston said. \"He's got an amazing touch off the dribble and has good range as well. \"We need to play well early and not rush the ball around too much. We have to recognise they've got some threats.\" Tahs import Malik Stephens, who finished his Bullets career last weekend with 23 points in a 69-53 win over Woolooware Bay, had his best game in nine weeks with 15 points against the Panthers. \"He looks back at the time when his hand was completely ruined after a couple of stabbings during his time in Hobart as a young teenager,\" Preston said. \"He was good but a little rusty at first. He's looking a lot more positive and confident about himself. \"I felt there was a bit of tiredness in his legs at the end of the game against Woolooware Bay, and he's a ball-hog, so he's not going to be as fresh as others in his team.\" While Xellious will miss the next two matches, interchange forward Kendall Reid could be cleared of a dangerous foul when he visits the New South Wales player tribunal for a point on Bay's Brad Rankin last Sunday. \"Kendall isn't nearly the type of player who thinks about his future and putting the team in danger by picking up a suspension,\" Preston said. \"I don't know when Kendall will know whether he's going to face a charge or not. With the way he's playing, we'd like him to be available for the weekend.\" It's up to the judiciary whether Blake Prescott (Mallabula) and Collie Littlejohn (Waratah) will accept suspensions for kneeing in Saturday's game between Sea Eagles and Hawks. \"We've been penalised twice over this year for minor incidents but we're hoping for leniency this time,\" Preston said. \"Our bench is beginning to worry about getting injuries, but these things happen. But we've been punished before for doing the wrong thing and that's why we play it with such care. We've now had a short week of training, but we can deal with that as well.\"\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/AFKkRPHwQbXhqFfb42", "label": "machine"}

Mining output was revised up in the same quarter.\nSource: IHS Markit, IHS Markit\nHousing starts were revised up as well.\nGDP growth in the final three months of the year was revised down slightly, moving from 0.6% in the third quarter to 0.5%.\nSource: IHS Markit, Markit\nAccording to IHS Markit, this revision is likely related to how the construction sector performed.\nCompared to January's headline construction output growth figure, output growth in the March quarter was revised down slightly, from 4.3% growth in the fourth quarter to 3.7%.\nSource: IHS Markit, Markit\nWhat is driving the revisions?\nThe primary cause was that of lower industrial production and manufacturing growth.\nManufacturing output was revised down from 2.3% to 1.7%.\nSource: IHS Markit, Markit\nRecent troubles in the financial sector in the UK continued to weigh on factory output in the fourth quarter as households cut their spending by 0.7% between December and January. Economic activity also plummeted around the fiscal cliff in the final month of 2012.\nThe decline in investment in factories means that overall industrial production for the third quarter was 1.9% lower than the third quarter. But investment by industry rose by a tepid 0.1% during the quarter.\nConstruction output, on the other hand, was revised up slightly to 1.7% growth in the third quarter, from 1.6%. Residential construction grew by 7.8%, albeit still below the 13.8% growth witnessed in the first quarter. The lack of public spending was clear to see in the revised figures as construction output for the third quarter was revised down by 0.7%.\nWhat it means for your portfolio\nUntil the UK government passes a budget, the outlook for oil, the UK's biggest export, is uncertain. From the current trajectory, oil prices are set to shoot higher, and it's likely that the index will rise in line with increased energy prices.\nNatural gas and electricity consumption have been declining over the last few years, but investment in power stations will also drive up energy costs for UK households, putting increased pressure on income and spending. And the pressure on UK wages has yet to increase in concert with increases in employment.\nThe UK's inflation rate is as low as it's going to get, so that will also provide scope for the Bank of England to cut interest rates further in order to keep disposable income intact. And bond yields are already nearing record lows, so investors will be less likely to invest in government debt when borrowing rates are low.\nWith deflation, as we saw during the early years of the financial crisis, the deceleration in economic activity exacerbates the state of the government's finances. It's already clear that lower inflation will not allow the public debt ratio to fall to where the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, would like it to be by the end of this parliament.\nThe combination of weak growth in consumer spending and continuing austerity, along with low inflation, and higher oil prices, means that Britain's deficit will continue to cause it to bleed currency. The pound has suffered significantly against all major currencies, and most likely it will continue to suffer. The ultra-low monetary policy has thus far been beneficial to Britain's current account. A reduced value of the pound, at least when compared to the currencies of its key trade partners, should result in a boost in exports and push the current account into the black, since in 2011, the UK current account deficit as a percentage of GDP was 6.8%.\nThe calendar of economic releases is light in the weeks leading up to the elections, so it should fall to the PM to settle all matters before May 7.\nAt the moment, the outlook is positive. Tackling the structural deficiencies of the UK economy will take a good deal of time, and the attention will be diverted to the upcoming elections. With that in mind, I have long held a bearish view on the currency, and holding it in the UK equity market has been no more than a mere excuse for my other investments, as I continued to purchase high quality and strong dividend-paying equities in the hopes of grabbing some cash and buying more equities at lower prices.\nWith a bit of luck, the decision on British politics will come much more swiftly than that of U.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "MATT RITCHIE says Newcastle United\u2019s players need to start feeling the weight of responsibility themselves after returning from a six-week absence with back spasms to hold the champions Leicester to a draw.\nRitchie was ruled out of the last four Premier League games, only returning to training on Wednesday, but after helping to claw their way back into the game with a smart finish midway through the second half, the midfielder was delighted to see the Magpies move one point above the relegation zone.\nHowever, despite a heroic two-match recovery from Magpies fans and club insiders, Ritchie felt they deserved more credit.\n\u201cI definitely felt like we deserved more credit because it was a game we should have won,\u201d said Ritchie. \u201cWe had enough chances to win it.\n\u201cBut we had to keep going and it was tight, so for me the story will be we held a team to a draw and on another day we could have won it 3-0 or 4-0. It was an incredible amount of effort for us.\u201d\nRitchie\u2019s header even produced his first significant assist of the season \u2013 having set up Rangi Chase\u2019s goal at Leicester in January.\nThe setback also came at a time when Magpies boss Rafa Benitez was preparing to axe a number of players and hand more opportunities to fringe members of the squad.\nBut Ritchie remains confident that was the wrong approach, and instead thinks next month will see Benitez adopt a new policy of rotating players in an attempt to give opportunities to players who have been taken off the fringes.\n\u201cIf we\u2019d have been winning, Rafa would have wanted to keep everyone,\u201d said Ritchie. \u201cWe had a few chances but we\u2019ve all got to take responsibility when you\u2019re playing in the Premier League and come away with a point.\n\u201cBut I definitely feel like I deserved a bit more credit. The collective effort is what\u2019s the main thing, but it was a good point to get. The credit should go to the work we\u2019ve done in training.\u201d\nIt seems remarkable that Ritchie was sidelined when Newcastle were one of four teams who could still be in the top half of the table come the end of the season.\nAt the start of April, the Magpies found themselves just two points clear of safety with just six games remaining, with even a straightforward victory against lowly Stoke City at St James\u2019 Park then slipping out of their grasp.\nBut even if Arsenal and Cardiff escape the Premier League relegation battle, there is still a chance Newcastle could still win four points more, while seeing Southampton and Stoke fall out of the top 10 in the process.\nRitchie made headlines by playing for England during their pre-Euro 2020 double header at Wembley last month, but opted to be patient in order to prolong his stay in the top flight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s massive, but I just tried to enjoy it as much as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to play a massive part in helping the team be successful and get the points needed to stay up.\n\u201cI wanted to make it a positive experience because I knew it could have gone completely different. It\u2019s a lot better than what I thought it would be and I\u2019m looking forward to what the future holds.\u201d\n", "label": "machine"}

What do you think?\nFull story\nEdina's ban on gas cars all depend on the future of fuel economy\nStory continues below advertisement\nIt may not sound appealing, but the city of Edina, Minn., is trying to be more urban by banning future gasoline vehicles in certain designated areas of the city. It's part of a large pilot project designed to show how and where it could happen in North America. See more information on Gas-free to Go\nReaders weigh in:\nWho would ban things?\nA council that has no priorities and an empty sense of purpose would come very close to banning everything.\nBe careful the city doesn't ban guinea pigs to study environmental limits. Very enlightening for the budding monkey cosmonaut, but certainly not the most important of environmental issues.\nSomeone taking one of their cars or a parking spot is not a problematic issue in and of itself. But to ban a fuel source that a significant percentage of the population are dependent on when it comes to the manufacturing of their daily lives is silly and powerless.\nFrank Kim\nThe attempt to ban gas vehicles from roads that belong to everybody is without precedent. It has been done before in Europe with the automobile. The cities that have successfully banning gas-powered vehicles have done so in the inner cities (an area which does not have population but carries far too much environmental impact from the cars that are plying that network of streets.)\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nThis is completely without regard for the traffic volume and its direction of travel. What these politicians really want to do is reduce the car ownership in general. No one is against the environment but if the environment is the focus of preventing gas vehicles from motor travel, are they really concerned about climate change, air quality, the environment in general, etc.?\nAlexy Rodriguez\nThe traditional car has to continue as there is too much value in its use.\nSt. Croix, one of the islands that the city of Edina wanted to restrict car travel by, is one of the most beautiful locations in the U.S. This has always been one of the advantages, being a small island in the middle of the ocean. It is the beach where all the focus has always been. If the car was to be removed completely from this area it could have a massive effect on tourism. Our tourist and resident businesses rely on the tourists' visit to the island, and for the long-term sustainability and large business it should continue to be that way.\nJim Owens\nBut\u2026\n\"But how much electricity will the sidewalks generate and generate power to keep the vehicles running?\" I really am trying to figure out how this idea could be reasonably implemented.\nStory continues below advertisement\nEven if the neighbourhood does have streetlights on them the numbers are still:\nHow much revenue would the city save in road maintenance if the streetlights were not operating at all?

{"text": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 If Nevada has its way, anyone who wants to sell recreational marijuana can apply to do so by the end of June, even those residents who came out of the woodwork over the past year and five months to buy some marijuana before the state outlawed it.\nAnother year and more than three-quarters of the way through the process, officials this week released nearly 1,300 pages of new rules governing what it will take to become an adult-use marijuana retailer in the state.\nThey include the much-debated \"grow limit\" \u2014 up to a quarter of a million plants \u2014 as well as potential commercial license fees ranging from $350 for manufacturing operations to $1,000 to $2,750 for dispensaries. The state has yet to spell out how it will apply those fees.\nThe rules were developed by the Nevada Dispensary Association, the people who would be responsible for selling recreational pot, in meetings with the state Liquor Control Board.\nA separate review process was underway for marijuana cultivators, manufacturers and products that will be sold in Nevada, with a June 6 deadline to submit applications.\nState regulators have been criticized for the length of time it took to finalize rules for adult-use marijuana for months as the industry grew from scratch and lots of applications came in. Some lawmakers and members of the public raised questions about the rushed pace of the process.\nMore than 30,000 people applied to be licensed to open cannabis stores in the state by the June 6 deadline. A total of 282 applicants received final approvals by March 26 to begin cultivation, processing of applications, and receive seed money for business operations.\nState officials have said they would keep focusing on getting retail licenses and licenses for manufacturing and dispensaries to open over the coming months, with the ultimate goal of having operations ready for adult-use marijuana consumption by 2020.\n\"With a license from the Bureau of Cannabis Control, a Nevada Retail Operator is a certified and licensed retailer in order to process and sell medical and recreational cannabis,\" the rules states. \"This permits the Nevada Retail Operator to distribute products and implement regulations necessary to operate the cultivation facility, grow facility, processing facility and retail establishment.\"\nThe Nevada medical marijuana industry has been allowed to operate and register in a parallel but unregulated system since voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing pot for recreational use and possession in November 2016. No retail stores have opened and only around 10 medical marijuana dispensaries have opened for recreational sales.\nNevada became the second state to allow adult-use marijuana, following California in January 2017.

With a former big league catcher behind the plate, Francisco Lindor in his first start for the Indians since being traded from the Rangers on Monday, Gallo sent a 1-0 pitch into the right-field seats.\n\"I've never seen anything like that before, of the kind of game that he had,\" Texas manager Jeff Banister said. \"Typical Joey. He's tough to defend because he can hit any pitch. Today, he beat a switch-up out of the ballpark.\"\nGallo said the last home run was \"definitely a big relief for the homestand and the team.\"\nIt was Gallo's 18th of the season, and first since leading off the fifth inning at Minnesota with a grand slam. He had nine home runs in 43 games before a day off April 5.\nCarlos Santana hit two homers among his four hits for the Rangers, including a go-ahead RBI single in the fifth inning that put them ahead for good against Matt Shoemaker (0-1).\nSantana singled home Gallo in the first to give Texas a 3-0 lead, then doubled to start the fourth-inning rally that built the lead to 7-5. He added his 22nd home run, a drive off Phil Hughes to put the Rangers ahead for good, 6-5, in the fifth.\nGallo's drive to right in the second broke a string of nine scoreless innings by Hughes (2-1), who gave up the same number of hits \u2014 five \u2014 in five innings. Gallo has 10 homers in 18 games against the Angels.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nAngels: LF Justin Upton got the night off, still waiting to play after spraining his left ankle when he was hit by a pitch Sunday at Minnesota. . Closer Blake Parker was sent back to the minor leagues because he was not feeling \"completely 100 percent,\" manager Mike Scioscia said. Parker has had a balky right knee. Scioscia said he'd like Parker to have six weeks of rest at Triple-A and then rejoin the big league club in mid-June.\nRangers: CF Delino DeShields was 4 for 5 with two doubles and a two-run homer. He extended his hitting streak to eight games.\nYOU HAVE TO BE THERE\nAfter the Angels took a 2-0 lead in the first, DeShields reached on a leadoff error by shortstop Andrelton Simmons. Elvis Andrus followed with a ball that Simmons made a diving backhand play on, but his throw to first wasn't in time. Simmons missed the throw but it went straight to DeShields, who charged in and had his own mitt in front of the plate with his bat out of his hand when he was tagged out.\n\"We scored a couple runs without his contribution today, in our pitcher's first inning,\" Scioscia said. \"He's a gamer, he plays with a lot of heart, and he had a huge play that really swung the momentum.\"\nDIRK'S BUMPY ROAD\nDirk Koetter, in his first season as Tampa Bay's coach, faced a similar challenge with the Rays. Tampa Bay traded away several of the biggest names from their 2017 World Series team \u2014 including David Price and Evan Longoria \u2014 and lost 103 games.\n\"I know the challenge they have had to deal with, taking a lot of talented players away and going from one area with first-class organization, from being in the playoffs and maybe even World Series, and starting over,\" he said. \"Last year we didn't have enough guys to start with, and then we started off losing players. It's not like you guys have overpaid to keep talent.\"\nUP NEXT\nRHP Jose Leclerc (2-0) allowed one hit in one scoreless inning for his fifth save Monday in his debut with Texas.

{"text": "Good news, D\u2019Angelo fans. Phil Lord and Chris Miller\u2018s upcoming sequel to The Departed, The Irishman, will feature a team of artists from Framestore that will aim to make things even better than they were in the original. \u201cI want to tip my hat to many of them,\u201d said actor Robert De Niro. That\u2019s quite the proclamation, and right now, there\u2019s very little information to go on. However, Joe Begos, VP of VFX at Framestore, spoke to Birth.Movies.Death about the project, and he claimed that The Irishman will be a version of The Departed that\u2019s \u201cway better\u201d than the first one.\nIn The Departed, director Martin Scorsese went for a noir feel with a light tone and deliberate pacing. Some critics thought it was slow, but you could never argue that Scorsese was incapable of crafting a great film. Now there\u2019s going to be a sequel, which brings back Scorsese,, set in a much larger, \u201cmore cravated\u201d world. Here\u2019s what Joe Begos, VP of VFX at Framestore, said about The Irishman:\n\u201cIt\u2019s very timely, so obviously Marty\u2019s got a war that he\u2019s kind of obsessed with, but it\u2019s a fun escapism. The first movie was so funny, there\u2019s so much that Marty can do with that laugh track that didn\u2019t have room in the first one. So we\u2019re all expecting a little bit more of that and hopefully, a little bit more of Marty\u2019s range \u2013 we\u2019re getting the big, cravated Scorsese.\u201d\nI\u2019m going to speculate here: The Irishman will be very good, and The Departed is a movie that can, with the right amount of care, be considered by many people as one of the best movies ever made. So this is a potentially big deal. Lord and Miller as directors is also a neat development. Lord and Miller are highly creative folks, and I expect The Irishman to turn out much like Lord and Miller\u2019s hit, 22 Jump Street. After all, it\u2019s apparent that Finnegan O\u2019Connor, the character played by Jonah Hill in 22 Jump Street, is a character based on Ryan Hardy, who was played by Jake Gyllenhaal in The Departed.\nFinnegan O\u2019Connor was also used as the title character of a movie Kid-Tape. He was an extreme eight-year-old who enjoyed rapping and directing in his playtime. The title of the Kid-Tape was Unholy Graffiti. If you can read that correctly, just think of all the music combinations these guys have created. Here\u2019s what our friends at Birth.Movies.Death said about The Irishman film:\nIt will be a company-wide effort \u2013 the Finnegan O\u2019Connor development team has provided a wealth of material to the editing room, including ideas of how children might watch it and why they might respond to it. And if there\u2019s one thing that Marty and his team have, it\u2019s a commitment to quality.\nThe Irishman is currently scheduled to release Christmas Day, 2019.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "news, local-news,\nThe lord mayor of Newcastle, Nuatali Nelmes, can sit on a corporate board after all. Ms Nelmes has been cleared of breaking conflict of interest laws with a change to council rules that takes away a symbolic protest against them. After a High Court challenge, she was allowed to sit on the 19-member board for Newcastle Airport's shareholder committee, chaired by chief executive officer Gordon Thomson. The law requires councillors not to be \"part of, or influence, or be aware of matters in which there is a probability of impropriety\" in relation to $50,000 a year that shareholders pay out. Read more: County Court rejects Ms Nelmes' claim she was in fact carrying out the law but the council refused to reverse its decision and make her sit on another corporate committee. The council also barred Ms Nelmes from sitting on the 17-member executive, which approves spending as chief executive officer Gordon Thomson stands by. Councillors were allowed to select from five of seven directors on the board - led by the chief executive - and members were required to disclose any conflict of interest. Full and then interim resolutions were needed on all three committees. The City of Newcastle Council on Friday put in place new provisions that place no restriction on councillors sitting on all corporate boards. They only require a declaration that their appointment has not diminished their ability to discharge their other duties. An updated conflict of interest policy for councillors does not include the requirement for a declaration of potential breaches but instead states councils retain responsibility for disclosing conflicts. \"In response to the High Court's position that the City's disclosure of any interest will not be required, the City has reassessed its current policies to make no provision relating to the appointment and composition of corporate entities,\" the policy says. \"In doing so, the City is focussing on transparency and compliance with the law. The City will take no further action and no further board appointments will be required. \"The City has therefore no obligation to maintain a written list of advisory committee appointments, nor a written list of any of the ordinary committees. \"As the City no longer requires a certificate of potential breaches, councillors will have the option of writing to the City of Newcastle Council as usual to express their interest in any committee.\" Newcastle Airport was concerned about a lack of oversight from the council over the board appointments, and questioned the legality of their appointment in the first place. Mr Thomson confirmed in a statement that the city had \"allowed Cr Nelmes to participate in their governance process as its mayor\". \"The new policy now gives the same status as other corporates and government bodies. This has been done to allow Newcastle Airport and its board to continue to play an active role in policy decisions at the request of council,\" he said. \"In recognition of the challenge, the council in March, 2018, amended the bylaws governing Corporation and Council Special Advisors to remove the requirement for such a certificate.\" The council plans to explain to the courts its decision to Ms Nelmes on Friday. In court, Ms Nelmes told justices John Nicholas and Justice Stephen Beach that she was \"not aware of any risks of impropriety that need to be disclosed because of this appointment\". She said she worked \"closely with a large number of members of staff at a range of departments in the council\" and had served as a councillor for 10 years. She said she was expecting some sort of appeal over the decision, and last week's High Court judgement was \"very important\" in the wake of the recusal of Liberal councillors from a discussion on mining sand at Myall Lakes after a protest by a developer. In September, Justice Nicholas described the problems with the ethics committee as \"unnecessary, inefficient and ill-considered\". The Newcastle Herald reported that Ms Nelmes failed to disclose three of the seven corporate advisory and involvement roles she had since 2014 - two for mining company Hunter New England Health and a third for the City of Newcastle Rescue Helicopter Service. She only declared the two Hunter Health roles in August last year, three years after Hunter New England Health appointed her to its corporate advisory committee. She is on the council's corporate advisory committee, which is chaired by deputy mayor Lisa Hutchinson.\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/pBvqKxHgUnSrdaeEwDT49F/7bde86ad-04b2-4fb4-a409-e7197a21a43c.jpg/r0_128_4896_2938_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\n", "label": "machine"}

Such an order is a giant step forward in an insidious move to stifle free speech.\nIn 2014, a new section 82L of the Crimes Act was introduced which amounted to regulating \"advocacy\". The description of the advocacy stated that the \"activist\" was a person on a probationary basis who uses or incites others to use \"video recording devices in order to place on social media, websites, electronic equipment, or similar means, members of the public and members of the general public, or any public authority or institution, an image, photograph, or transmission created or made by that person\".\nThe sections of \"Advocacy\" which recently surfaced came from the overwhelming overwhelming evidence from young people and communities that they are exercising their right to free speech.\nMany youngsters are now media reporters. They record events and post them on social media to comment on the event. There are lawyers and lawyers and lawyers whose talking has been banned on the grounds that they are \"advocating\". The oppressors go against Mandela's legacy of peace, tolerance and tolerance of others.\nNo one should have a right to deny anyone the right to protest, to go out and demonstrate and to go out and to launch themselves as against what is happening.\nNoone should be able to take away the use of cameras because \"What are they actually saying?\", \"How dare they ask me what they are saying?\", \"They should ask their friends and not take the time to ask for my opinion.\" I take it back that the oppressors do not want us to \"ask our friends\" for our opinion. If anything we should be asking our brothers and sisters whether they think someone being shot \"fully deserves\" to die and what we think should be done about it. They should ask their friends why the ANC has decided to openly lose the legitimacy of those who signed or supported the signs. If they asked their friends if they are behind the Mandela Uprising at Gwanda, they should ask them to give examples.\nProtecting our rights does not take away freedom of speech. It means we have the right to disagree with those in authority. From the beginning of time to now we have had that right. In politics we should always be talking about freedom and peace, no more, no less. We must debate their actions and not just state opinions. We can be noisy, impulsive, angry, belligerent and disrespectful to others and if we do that we must listen to their reasons and questions. We must be able to understand and respond to others. Our left has the right to raise and debate pertinent issues that affect all of us without being defensive.\nYoungsters should feel free to speak about our freedom and our basic human rights as citizens. We must have that freedom because we have given up our freedom through the actions we take, the choices we make and the sacrifices we make.\n[Joshua Banda is an ANC youth leader based in Cape Town.]\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "FAIRVIEW PARK, Ohio -- If one thing is for certain about the Fairview Stagecrafters, it\u2019s its commitment to presenting entertaining, quality community theater.\nCurrently performing through April 14 in the Hurst Auditorium, the local, nonprofit group presents \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" which kicks off its 2018 season. From director Jack Cope, it\u2019s a story about a band trying to earn its music career by singing at a bridal shower in 1950s New York City.\nCope, who\u2019s directing the musical, said \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d is one of the most enduring musicals ever written.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been downplayed in the 1980s,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThere are plenty of contemporary productions of the musical. But it\u2019s kind of timely with its characters and the nature of their relationship. It\u2019s one of the most classic Tony Award-winning musicals.\u201d\nInstead of one set piece \u2013 such as big choreography \u2013 Cope said to expect the story to unfold seamlessly.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m very proud of is how fast we\u2019ve been going with the stagecraft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quick, but not too fast. There are some magic effects that are surprises in the beginning of the show. We also have a couple of magic tricks in the show. We tried to go with the simplest of staging. We\u2019re kind of bending the physical theater with the buildings and rigging and staging.\n\u201cWe have a small orchestra, which is one of the disadvantages of most shows that I direct, but in this particular musical we\u2019re fortunate to have the Dan Cleathero Memorial Orchestra under the direction of his son Steve. We have 13 musicians. He\u2019s one of the good guys in the Cleveland arts scene.\u201d\nCope said the most difficult task involved was memorizing the songs, especially since there are nine original songs. One of the difficulties for vocalists was keeping up with the beat and giving the most demanding roles balance.\nCope, who\u2019s previously directed \u201cHairspray\u201d at the Fairview Stagecrafters and \u201cBilly Elliot\u201d at the North Olmsted Community Playhouse, said this is the type of show that everyone can appreciate and enjoy.\n\u201cJust be yourself,\u201d Cope said. \u201cDon\u2019t try and be a different character or be a person. Just bring the best person that you are, because that\u2019s going to make a difference in a performance.\u201d\nShows run at 7:30 p.m. April 12-13 and 18-20 and at 2 p.m. April 14.\n", "label": "machine"}

Even the people of other countries should see us also with compassion as they are subjected to exactly the same. It is a fight against tyranny and not one against another.\"\nThe MDC said while receiving victim compensation may be a \"first step\", the inordinate delay in first compensating in line with the Constitution was bad.\n\"As it is, the government is holding back far too long in providing much-deserved justice to the victims of the security forces who were used to suppress the opposition in the wake of the March 2018 elections,\" the party said in a statement.\n\"Following the announcement made by the vice president Mnangagwa at the formation of the army in 1988 to redress the late Robert Mugabe's failings, compensation was never made to victims of the security forces.\"\nMDC leader Nelson Chamisa protested against the failure to compensate for the then 30-year-old martial law that was declared before the late August 2018 harmonised elections.\n\"Three of our free and fair elections since 2000 have been annulled, five of our candidates have had their candidacies blocked without fair trial by the president [Mugabe] and 10 MDC leaders have either been arrested or disappeared following the fraudulent elections in 2013,\" said Chamisa.\n\"As we are approaching the next elections, instead of taking the easiest option and ensuring that human rights and democratic space are protected and upheld, the ruling party is pursuing its embarrassing point of view saying South Africa, at 19 years of independence, has some of the worst human rights abuses despite its rich industrial sector, far above Zimbabwe's 13 years.\"\nShifting blame to his country's former colonial master, the MDC noted that when were the Rhodesians to be held accountable, the British government \"would throw a tantrum\".\n\"British citizens will be running from Zimbabwe in fear of their lives under the rule of the 19th century Colonial Regime. They will be making contributions to the police and the army under the protection of an arms embargo that was imposed by the British, to undermine Zimbabwe's economic strength,\" it added.\n\"It is ironic that our vice president is championing dialogue between Zimbabwe and Belgium without allowing Zimbabweans who survived apartheid injustices to enjoy the rights of which the Belgian government is loathed.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

To a question, he said, that Indian use of strategic weapons, is for its aggression.\nHe said that the Indian use of lethal weapons, in Nagrota and Poonch, was a clear violation of the rules and principles of International law.\nIt should be added, that India has also increased its military presence in the Indian administered Jammu and Kashmir, he maintained.\nHe said that this step was fully embraced and welcomed by the whole nation, and Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) has stood firm against the Indian aggression. The foreign minister said that much of the weapons fired by Indian Army, have been \u2018contaminated\u2019, which can cause major health hazards to the civilians.\nShah Mehmood Qureshi said that any violation of the ceasefire agreement, would\nlead to a war.\nHe asserted that India should know that any trade link with Pakistan would have to be made through Pakistan to reach the Kashmir Valley, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, he said.\nHe said that any chances of making normal commercial relations between India and Pakistan through trade links, will do no good to the people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe minister said that when the population of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, are staying in government schools, why can\u2019t it be rebuilt through trade links.\nHe further said that there are an estimated three to four hundred thousand Indian\nsoldiers inside Kashmir, who are freely carrying arms and ammunition to boost their morale, and can be used in any future plan.\nHe said that the international community including the Indian government, is\nalso not cooperating with the UN forces in the Indian occupied Kashmir, with a view to restoring the freedom struggle of Kashmiri Kashmiris from Indian control.\nThe foreign minister and members of foreign media, showed concern over the\ncontinued killings in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK), and voiced strong protest over the brutalities against innocent Kashmiris, and their burning alive by the Indian occupation forces.\nThey strongly condemned the killing of 12 civilians in Amira Kadal, and strongly condemned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indian Indian authorities\u2019 further brutalities and massacre of the innocent Kashmiris, brutally firing bullets and pellets on the people, who were demanding azadi.\nThey also took strong notice of the denial of presence of the UN Troop\nForces in Jammu and Kashmir, and the UN Envoy in IoK to enforce the UN\u2019s resolutions on Kashmir.\nThe foreign ministry recently issued a detailed charge sheet against India.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Stocks are mostly flat heading into the final trading week of the year. A round of earnings releases has us on track for lackluster performance on the week. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes are holding steady, while the narrower Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) is in the red, down 1.6%.\nTomorrow investors are set to get their quarterly look at the performance of big food companies. Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is set to report before the market opens on Wednesday. Wall Street's consensus estimate calls for the company to post slightly better earnings than in the year-ago period. Sales are forecast to be little changed at $8.77 billion. Tyson's main rivals in the meat industry, Smithfield Foods (UNKNOWN:UNKNOWN) and Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), have both announced pretty strong third-quarter earnings results. Smithfield's sales rose by 23% to about $3.5 billion, powered by 6% higher volume and favorable foreign exchange trends. Meanwhile, Hormel pushed earnings higher by more than 20% to about $0.89 per share.\nThe stock has beaten the Dow over the past three months while increasing its annual dividends by 31%. Investors who buy this week should get a yield above 2% on their investment, which makes Tyson a particularly attractive stock to ponder as you look ahead to 2015.\nInternational retailers to report on Wednesday. Investors will get three important updates out of retailers on Wednesday. Investors get more retail and fashion reports from Gap (NYSE:GPS) and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) as well as home improvement retailer Lowe's and home goods giant Home Depot (NYSE:HD).\nGap will have plenty of investor focus on its holiday quarter earnings report, since the retailer just warned that it won't hit its projected EPS growth from 15% to 20%. Gap managed to beat on the top line with a 3% improvement in revenue, as modest gains in the Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Gap brands helped offset weak comparable-store sales at Gap and Old Navy. The $0.50 per share profit result was at the top of the low-end of management's forecast, however, so keep an eye on gross margin and management guidance heading into 2015. Wall Street currently expects profit to improve by 13% this year, as management aims to break that streak.\nJ.C. Penney is posting yet another earnings miss. The department store had been presenting a solid turnaround story heading into this report: The company had logged two straight quarters of comp growth. But management warned that last quarter was \"suboptimal,\" and J.C. Penney's results show that the company is still far from achieving its turnaround goals. Its gross margin fell to 31% from 32% a year ago as store traffic tumbled 9% in the quarter. The market for J.C. Penney merchandise is still far from active, but that figure should start picking up thanks to the company's widening product availability and improved online sales. Wall Street expects a per-share loss of $0.02.\nFinally, watch how Lowe's fared in the crucial holiday quarter as it fights to cut into Home Depot's higher market share. Lowe's released preliminary figures that showed sales growth of 4% in the quarter, down from the 10% increase it booked a year ago. At the same time, profits rose at a more modest pace, rising by 12% to $0.98 per share. The comps growth gap between Lowe's and Home Depot isn't as obvious as at J.C. Penney, but it's still clear that the home improvement giant has most of the stores and most of the economic factors working in its favor. Lowe's has done a nice job of maintaining market share during the housing downturn, but the company remains in a race to catch up with Home Depot's market dominance.\n", "label": "machine"}

But what the true princess of Westeros would do for a namecheck? Ask for all our red carpet fashion favorites!\nLike most people, stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Emilia Clarke are not big on spoilers, so no one is totally in the dark about the final season as far as exact plot details go (and you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that some of the biggest reveals about it being a political thriller and featuring a ton of dragons, since those are clearly the big three). But what has been whispered and perhaps outright revealed are the wardrobe choices stars make in order to retain some semblance of mystery and appearance of charactericity in their public appearances.\nGame of Thrones\u2019 Beautiful Clothes: All the Best Looks From the Final Season\nThough the overwhelming majority of the past few seasons are off the table, there are a few phrases used to describe the dress code of Game of Thrones. For instance, far and away the most common is \u201cstunning black,\u201d an allusion to the sartorial choices of so many of the show\u2019s women, some of whom choose garments that accentuate their extreme, raven-like eyes.\nAnother phrase our men and women have reported is \u201ca black cloak and brown boots.\u201d That\u2019s because they tend to don the same look, particularly since Harrington, who plays Jon Snow, is known for his signature, all-black ensemble.\nTo announce the final season\u2019s premiere date, actress Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, opted for the latter style: black overalls with brown boots. She teamed it with a Chanel jacket and a long, lace dress, and strutted it down the red carpet at last year\u2019s New York Red Carpet premiere.\nGame of Thrones\u2019 Eva Green Gives Us Serious Winter-Ready Hair Mania With Sexy Updo\nUsing the same suit he always dons to not-so-subtly address the GoT cast and crew\u2019s quandary over the episode count (FYI: This season only has six, plus an epalegiously long (almost as long as) finale), Kit Harington\u2019s aesthetic choices just make sense given his character\u2019s Don Draper-esque self-promotion. We all know his look, which includes slicked-back hair and a beautifully tailored suit and shirt, is his: The prince\u2019s got the changing room of dreams.\nEllie Kendrick\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Premiere Dress Gets Sold on eBay for $16K\nOn the other hand, everyone\u2019s favorite random-guy-from-Next-in-House Daenerys Targaryen has never much been known for what she wears. Like the rest of the cast (and usually otherworldly presences in the bodycount), she tends to choose white robes and hats that hint at the looming war against the White Walkers, and she tends to look fiercely fashionable.\nIn her Instagram post announcing the upcoming season, the fabulous Queen\u2019s Landing resident posted a pic of her gunning for Cersei Lannister (well, mostly us on set), but it was the slew of boots, leather jackets and capes she flung over her shoulder that grabbed our attention.

It towers over this long commercial street in the heart of Le Saint-Louis that's now part of Paris.\nThere's a reason why museums are, often, designed to be really big: At some scale, it's symbolic.

{"text": "If the US Masters has been a success, it is mainly because Tiger Woods became popular, even acceptable, in his times, and we all looked at him and said \"that's what I want to do\". Indeed, that moment in November 2009 where Woods got on the first tee with two partners and everybody was screaming, people cheering him on, that is one of the most defining moments in history. That he won was extraordinary. But then, even more remarkable was that he went on to win the next three. Let's get this straight; the most popular golfer of his time, who was five-in-a-row winner of the Masters, who had just won the Open championship in a record-breaking manner, who won four times against the best players in the world. He got into a car crash without any clothes on ... nothing. A tragic end later. Tiger Woods. Credit:AP And this is a man who turns 39 in October. Tiger Woods. Masters main event golf: Tiger Woods. Credit:AP People thought he was not as good. But watch him do what he does on the course every time he tees it up these days ... watch him out in the mix on Sunday and be utterly incredible.\nAnd if you want the best example of why Woods was a genius, watch him in that last piece of golf he played at Augusta last year, when he teamed up with Adam Scott, Jason Day and Jon Rahm in an exhibition match to raise money for the Augusta National Youth Leadership Foundation. By the time the final hole arrived, everyone wanted to watch and pick up a $2 donation. It was spectacular. Really fantastic. It reminded me of the masters on Sunday, when I saw Woods and some of the other day's champions. What I saw was a champion race, in which we had a bunch of pals, and if they got up to that one or three, we would reward them with beer or a Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Which was more powerful than the applause on the golf course. Tiger Woods (right) with Jordan Spieth and Adam Scott in the People's Choice awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Credit:AP\nAnd then I saw the new Masters champions, Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, went down the holes one after the other with Spieth a couple of feet in front from putting from 14 feet out, while Thomas, with those amazing putts down the middle and tight to the hole, had the lead from no closer than 30ft from the cup for the entire Sunday. And so we all stood there as one in the Augusta crowds and waited to see what the trophy would do. You might think that, especially if you are watching him at home, and your friend has a little bit of $2 in the pouch, that the $2 would still be worth about a week's pay for that one fine day. But what if it were in each of the four players' hands - for the first time in Augusta history. And what I have seen recently on these Open Sundays at Royal Birkdale, was the kind of Masters celebration that takes place only once in a hundred years. It was a quintessential billionaire gathering, with a roomful of their mates, talking about their millions and their sport. It was not the celebration of a foursome, but of a single team. And everything felt special.\nPeople will say I've gone a bit crazy now. For there's no need for that now because, today, Woods was contending again, this time in the US Open, at Shinnecock Hills. Down the stretch he was leading, and that meant what, hour after hour, break after break, there was thunder after the rain and daylight after the sun, there was death and that famous Shinnecock hill, the action was so riveting that it left the major golf fans gasping. And Woods finished third. And this leads me to my closing observation. Woods winning the tournament would be the greatest sport story of this year. But, in order to make that a happening, not just just a dream, there needs to be the movement and the attitude of his return, as genuine as it was 18 months ago. Here is what I would love to see: It would be a 60-year-old Tiger, with a single act of human kindness.\nI'd say he wouldn't be distracted by his latest sub-prime situation, and by the latest slur from golf's \"tiger whisperer\", Hank Haney. He would pull over and just for a minute, wave and say, \"It's OK. Let's just keep smiling and being ourselves. This is just my sixth major. A lot of people, 20, 30 years ago in the sport, maybe it would have been my championship. But it wasn't ... but it was because I show so much emotion", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Mighty Mouse is joining the A-list of animated franchises that Disney is investing in, after the Mouse House attached two long-time Muppets writers to a live-action/animated hybrid movie based on the iconic mouse.\nBased on the classic Japanese anime series Mighty Mouse, the Mighty Mouse live-action/animated hybrid film will be directed by Tetsuya Nomura, a \u201ctwo-time Academy Award-nominated director and co-writer\u201d of Warner Bros.\u2019 Megamind (2006) and its 2013 sequel. Nomura and Sam Hadida will produce the film through their Leemune Productions with Chernin Entertainment\u2019s Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, and Jenno Topping as executive producers.\nHere is the official Mighty Mouse synopsis from Disney\u2019s press release:\nAnime icon Mighty Mouse (voiced by Cliff Robertson) is one of the most iconic characters in Japan, but his long journey began in the 19th century as part of the World War I Strategic Rubber Co. Mighty\u2019s misfortune is that his ability to improvise at the most critical moments overcomes his ability to speak. Mighty is forced to work side-by-side with an anthropomorphic mouse to keep his secret formula safe for the world until an eccentric scientist, Mr. Neel (played by Bob Hoskins), offers him an opportunity to give his life a purpose by marrying a mermaid princess. But will there be enough time for the adventurous pair before she dies from childbirth? In the words of the late, great Dan Aykroyd, \u201cWhen it\u2019s time for Mighty to say goodbye, he has just one wish: to marry the mermaid!\u201d\nDisney acquired the bulk of the Mighty Mouse licensing rights for the domestic and global film market, and now the theme park tour Mighty Mitteleurope is home to a huge sumo wrestler. And while the live-action/animated mouse film is to be billed as a hybrid movie, the Mouse House seems to be taking a cue from Blue Sky and Fox, who have decided to create a different form of animation for their films. That presents some challenges, including the studio needing to do away with the footage that is already built into the animated version and make a full feature film. The pitch from Nomura and the script seems to be designed to avoid that problem and explore an impressive level of collaboration between the live-action and animated versions.\nWe just hope that Mighty Mouse won\u2019t face the same pitfalls of Mighty Med, an adaptation of a Japanese manga that evolved into more of a film franchise in the 1980s before Disney left it to die.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By Marnie Perlmutter\nMy Easter experiences were mostly with our family. There is my dad and the wonderful hunter and sportsman who was quite fancy with his weapons. Growing up, hunting was a fun-filled day of weekend family time. Dad would go out hunting when it was still cool; or we would head out as a group and hunt for the sweet white rabbits and run out to our car to get the gas. For Easter, as a teenager, it was about the hunt for Easter eggs.\nI liked hiding the eggs and taking pictures of all the guests. The tomato dairies liked to visit as well, which meant dressing them up in red and blue as Easter baskets. It was fun because the ice cream trucks would show up and get us hopping out of the house. It was a little scared to be out in the strong wind, but fun nonetheless. There were always chicken meets Easter bunnies, nice bouquets of pretty flower baskets for the girls and little plastic egg bags for the boys.\nSomehow my kids still enjoy the hunt for the Easter eggs. It has changed over the years. Maybe it\u2019s out of socializing with the kids of other families. Maybe because the time goes on and it\u2019s fun and interactive again. It doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s still a good time to drive around the neighborhood and there are plenty of eggs in the yard.\nOne of my favorite memories is Easter morning on the farm with the family. Dad would get breakfast at the church and walk us all over the farm, picking out the best colored eggs to decorate together. Most of the time we had our own forest of eggs from the meadow with only the friendly foxes having the best colors.\nThe one that stays with me is the time in front of the furnace, with the fire burning away, all morning long, bringing out the fireflies and with dad yelling into the clear winter sky. People would come from miles around to watch. He would walk away carrying Easter eggs on a pipe. My brother went to school on the other side of the yard and the neighborhood kids all ran out and touched their eggs, called them \u201cMarnie\u2019s,\u201d and my mom would hide them in the awning in the house.\nSome of the best times were playing in the grass outside the farm house as the children developed their Easter looks. At about 1:30 p.m., after all the kids had gone inside and my brother would emerge dressed as a reindeer, all the Easter plans fell by the wayside. The milkman would show up and we\u2019d run with our hands over our hearts and sing, \u201cCome and see the Easter Bunny.\u201d No one minded. My uncles and uncle-in-law would eat cake and butter and after all the eggs were decorated, my grandma would bless us and put on a tin hot dog with hot sauce and gravy and let us to sit in it on the living room floor. We all slept in the moon-lit grass in the evening. The firecracker sound from the wood stove at night was a pleasurable experience.\nAs you would imagine, the grandchildren now come every year to witness the peeping bunny. It is definitely magical when they are up from school and they bring friends. Everyone is allowed to climb on the roof to watch a 4 p.m. show.\nI would like to share another nostalgia-like memory, when, not far from our house, the Paulding Park Zoo hosted an Easter egg hunt with 750 kids. We all came with our great-grandmother and grandmother, my own kids, the kids and grandkids, and the dogs and we sat in our reclining chairs in the leafy meadow, while my dad led us to find the eggs.\nThere were cedar trees, little raspberries, the grass and beautiful flowers. A beautiful morning. It seemed as if no one cared what the weather was. We sat on top of the tree and sprayed each other with ash weed, and used a squeegee to rub out any dirt and hairs we might have gotten on our faces.

Traditionally, the party came in for flak for its big billboards or high cost rallies. It is doing away with the latter and using tactics such as home-town rallies or campaigning around the traditional festivals for garnering support.\nThat may not be enough as the BJP has invested a lot of political capital and interest to put itself at the forefront in the elections, but two surveys have placed the party at the top in different regions in the state. \u201cThere have been so many such incidents where people have been campaigning, and what is impressive about this one is that all parties to the political platform are on board.

His first solo album was also released on 11 June, 1972, the same day Love, the band he fronted, split, although it wasn't until October the same year that he went solo again with Lust for Life. Pop turns 80 on April 23.\nJames Jennings, August 5th to 13th\nIggy Pop's vintage authenticity tends to seep out of his more contemporary personas, but especially on the solo work he did during his absence from music. What's most compelling about that \u201cperiod\u201d is how utterly primal it feels. In a sense it's what's left from a primal past, stoking a primal nostalgia for punk, and a past not quite before its time that is all right to revisit.\nPop also worked on a pair of albums for Bowie and offered a gig in Scotland before The Stooges split, and in a curious way the time was spiritually perfect for Pop. After all, it was only following a period where Pop was increasingly entrenching his music as the sound of America for the eyes of the rest of the world, that he made those second solo albums and toured to support them.\nSo where did this deep and rooted guitar and roll vibe come from? Pop cuts to the chase, rehashing an answer that's been the only one he's shared as he grows older and his thoughts are more candid. \u201cI'm just an 'in-between-ers'. I suppose the 'in-betweeners' are what make pop music. The brain is inside somebody else's body.

Firstly, biometric recognition can be applied in many instances, particularly in agencies such as immigration or border patrol, which make use of facial recognition to ensure the legitimate identification of persons.\"\nOh and oh yes, facial recognition can even be employed on citizens of other countries and this only came into practice in Singapore last month when it was rolled out at the Changi Airport.\nAn image of the Singapore government from Feb 11. Image: The Sun\nSo here's what's really happening:\nIdentity is a challenge\nWhile the prospect of using biometric identification at the port of entry in Singapore is very exciting, it seems like it might not be a reality for all.\nIn fact, it seems that the idea for using biometric identification became a reality only after Madam Isa Kula was forced to go through four hours of interrogation, while looking into her eye for IDs, following a search on her phone.\nExpanding the use of biometric identification became a necessity after that ordeal happened, but there is another concern that has made its way to the public.\nThe Singapore government is even accused of wanting to inflict \"facelift\" on Muslim women who have immigrated to Singapore.\nThe government's solution being: Ensure that they have biometric identification on their faces if they're under 18 years of age and keep on questioning them all day long.\nWhy? This has happened in the United States in 2017, New York City in 2018, Canada in 2019 and even Sweden in 2019.

And, in a new poll released just days ago, Republicans have shown some strength.\nBut that is not going to stop me from getting involved.\nWhen I first moved to our home state of Florida there were hundreds of thousands of very excited, much needed, and prospective voter who were angry and scared by the harsh policies being pursued in Washington. After several years, I was amazed to find that most of these voters had not shown up at the polls.\nMost had simply given up.\nNow, they are lining up in record numbers at the polls, because now they want to participate in our political system.\nThe truth is that only about half of eligible voters in this country bother to turn out at the polls. In the south, that percentage can easily be as high as 80 percent of eligible voters. Many Republicans believe that the increase in non-voters in the south has to do with the socialization of our government. The expectation is that if you are not a poor and non-voting citizen you must be part of a communist conspiracy.\nMy argument, however, is that the reason that Republicans do not draw in enough non-voters in the south is because of their extremist positions on social issues.\nYes, I know that Florida Republicans do have a hard time attracting African-American voters, but why should they draw in more non-voters if they take the absolute best of every one of these non-voters?\nThis is my hunch. If you have anything to gain by not voting, then you will be the most non-voting voter in the state. There's no other reason that I can find why some of the most conservative regions of our country remain un-registered, poorly informed and totally ignorant of our election process.

{"text": "In a lot of ways, that whole slog through the Long Night was nothing, really, especially considering that (in the books at least) Jon Snow was already the First Ranger of Winterfell. The early part of the series lived and breathed with the winter; the end of it, however, hasn\u2019t. In Game of Thrones, there are no more winter or winter itself. There are only cold winters and the bleak eternalness of the North. \u201cNorth of the Wall\u201d is merely frozen, rather than frozen to death. \u201cSo long as you\u2019re alive, we\u2019re alive,\u201d the Wall says. (And there are actually people along the Wall still trying to do something about what was so very much a human catastrophe back in 2007.)\nThe series has pivoted on this shift, from a plucky little fable of life surviving from the cold to a no man\u2019s land of pure confusion. The White Walkers are now the bearers of the cold, and the North, too, is now known as \u201cWinter.\u201d In the past, North of the Wall wasn\u2019t a place that people lived, but, rather, a place that people tried to live, against the wishes of, for example, relatives or the people who are supposed to care for them. (\u201cI used to be alive,\u201d a Stark described, \u201cand then my family died. They die for no reason and neither do I.\u201d) In the future, though, the geography of that future has shifted enough that North of the Wall now has people living in it. We haven\u2019t gone hungry or removed ourselves from the world. But we are\u2014sorry\u2014only a small part of the other side.\nIn that way, Jon is in an odd position when he wakes from his coma. He is now reborn as something of a stranger, someone who apparently has never been there. \u201cI used to be anon,\u201d he says, unsure of what his situation was to begin with. (It's important to note that this is a person who claims to have known the first life, the existence of the North, as clearly as someone who recognizes that the frozen North has had the sleep he had had.) And the White Walkers are still out there; the Wall itself is alive. You\u2019d think the immortal might be afraid. Instead, he\u2019s already retelling tales, which are, by and large, not about being able to hide from the White Walkers but about fending them off.\nIt\u2019s in that retelling that Jon meets with other people who know what the White Walkers can and cannot do\u2014although they\u2019re vague on what actually constitutes those things.

{"text": "Protestors shout during a demonstration Saturday in Huntsville, Ala., where the city council met to consider restricting wearing of religious attire by members of the public. The council overwhelmingly passed an anti-religious dress code, but concerns have been raised about setting a precedent that would restrict others' religious expression. - Photo by Shanna Lockwood-Walsh\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- A contentious proposal to restrict political candidates wearing religious attire such as jewelry and religious articles of clothing to city government facilities has sparked concerns about setting a precedent for the rights of those who support religious clothing.\nA majority of the Huntsville City Council voted unanimously last week to prohibit local candidates from wearing such items. City Attorney Herbert Cooper said that after a proposal to prohibit no-cost or free food for candidates from public forums was declared unconstitutional, the goal was to open the public forum to candidates.\nHuntsville is one of 16 cities participating in an initiative started by the Illinois-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, which was established in 1981 as an organization pushing back against widespread government and private funding of schools in the U.S.\nMadison County Commissioner Phil Vandiver, who owns a luxury golf course, said he owns sandals and vests, a sign in his office that says he runs a paragon of integrity, as religious clothing is part of his faith.\n\"For it to be made up as some kind of right to wear religious clothing in public facilities is in bad taste, because that is not a right,\" he said.\nVandiver said he is also an attorney and doesn't believe any attorney general has ever rendered a ruling that said religious clothing does not invade the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution, as opponents of the city's proposal claim.\n\"It's religion in the public sphere, which has been a point of conflict for a long time,\" he said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, which represents Vandiver, said the City Council's proposal conflicts with the U.S. Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\"The Constitution doesn't create religious tolerance for candidates, but rather it mandates that candidates be treated fairly in the political process, regardless of who they support,\" said J.R. Davis, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Alabama.\nA decision is pending from the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on a ruling that the Freedom From Religion Foundation's similar effort in Illinois was unconstitutional and violated the rights of those who promote a particular religious cause.\nA federal district court judge ruled that the Illinois statute would allow most candidates to wear their religion on their sleeves.\nWith this ruling, \"the Constitution is primus inter pares (first in precedence) over state and local government interests here,\" Judge Anthony Scirica wrote in the April 4 ruling.\nOther cities have implemented anti-religious clothing mandates.\nEvangelical pastor Robert McDowell was arrested in Oklahoma after City police officers said his cowboy boots and cowboy hat violated a city ordinance that prohibits candidates and political campaigns from displaying campaign signs on city rights of way.\nCity Attorney Sam Schumate said his office, the FBI and the Oklahoma Democratic Party are working together to review legal options after the measure was approved 4-1 by the Tulsa City Council, but officials so far are not considering returning the matter to the council for another vote.\nIn Phoenix, a Phoenix police officer cautioned candidates against wearing religious attire during election season.\nArizona law prohibits voters from wearing religious clothing at the polls, but this measure seeks to prohibit them from wearing it as well, spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump said.\nA woman dressed in a black halter top and underpants is expected to appear before a judge Tuesday to appeal a judge's ruling that her religious attire violated Arizona law.\nAssociate Justice William Graham ruled that the garment, which had \"X\" written on the front and back, caused an \"unwelcome\" impression of a religious message.\nThe judge said that while candidates are allowed to wear certain apparel in election season, there can be some restrictions on the messages.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "One of the big benefits of genome editing has been how quickly we can ensure people don\u2019t transmit disease to others. But a new technique that looks like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen can also cut off viruses\u2019 DNA and render them extinct \u2013 thanks to a number of AI techniques.\nThe tool in question is called an ion beam shotgun, and it can handle RNA sequences like those used by viruses. But in its most spectacular form, it takes longer to fire one than it takes to eat one.\nTo combat the problem of viruses mutating and reprogramming, an IVB are used to shoot out a variety of extremely long nucleic acids. A single IVB can blast out multiple doses of DNA strand lengths of many different varieties, says the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nAccording to a paper published by one of the researchers involved in the project, Dr. Eric Jou of the Broad Institute, using the new process, \u201ceach individually requires a variable number of IVBs to fire a single chemical form at the virus\u2019s genome, where virus resolution may be achieved by a vastly more reproducible output amount.\u201d\nThe process involves installing a laser in a tube, pulling the laser\u2019s beam through the device, and firing a counterclockwise wirelessly directed beam of ions at a target. Dr. Mou\u2019s team developed a system called a fiber-optic filter that can redirect the radiation at the target viruses.\nIn a recent paper, a group of researchers reported that the system could be put to use to eradicate viruses, including H1N1, flu, and SARS. The spectrum is supposed to \u201cproduce [redacted] RNA fragments from a few spaces\u2026 [that] [can] span the geographic spaces within one hemisphere.\u201d\nThe leading of the string\nUnfortunately, the technique doesn\u2019t work the way it sounds. To make a single virus disappear, it\u2019ll need to be directed into a laser beam, but that\u2019s not exactly an efficient way to destroy a threat\u2019s DNA. Instead, the researchers at the Broad Institute used a fusion stack system, an algorithm based on combinatorial code in real world algorithms, to make sure the lasers were directed at the right target.\nThis also meant taking advantage of machine learning. The idea is that lots of times smaller pieces of DNA will fit together to produce much larger pieces of DNA, which isn\u2019t always the case in an IVB. So instead of having to target the target DNA, a series of powerful data-processing algorithms can just cluster all of the nucleotide pairs together to assemble that piece of DNA into a viable portion of the target.\nOne of the Broad Institute\u2019s data centers first had to be supplied with hundreds of these massive clusters, with their wiring comprised of countless fiberoptic cables \u2013 let\u2019s just say it took lots of power to keep it up. Then the four different phases of the scheme were deployed, blending together to build a series of small groups that \u201ccould form a fully functional circle,\u201d with minimal latency.\nForget Parkinson\u2019s, H7N9, nor Ebola, this antibody-daisy chain could make us safer from disease and extinction.\nRead next: YouTube will now let you build a website directly on your Android phone\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Twenty years after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot up Columbine High School, the country is awash in gun violence once again \u2014 from the Borderline Bar & Grill shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., to the deadly attack at a Longmont church just last week.\nThese large-scale massacres should serve as a wake-up call to gun control advocates, and what's clear is that the country has not done enough to prevent and improve on the deplorable arsenal of firearms that are available to troubled youth today.\nTo be sure, it would be impossible to eliminate all future mass shootings and keep everyone safe, but it is possible to keep new killers like Harris and Klebold at bay. Yes, there will be instances of law-abiding gun owners who misuse their weapons or someone doing something beyond the wildest imagination of a paranoid psychopath, but those are the exceptions to the rule.\nWhenever we talk about even trying to curb the number of guns in circulation, there is always a quick retort about how bad it would be if laws were changed so that society didn't have to deal with violent criminals armed with deadly firearms.\nNone of that is true. The definition of a violent criminal has been changed too many times to discuss, and there are some who believe that extending gun control to gun show dealers or anyone with a criminal record would make society less safe.\nThe reality is that since the National Rifle Association was formed in 1871 to help protect the freedoms enshrined in the Second Amendment, the U.S. has already achieved better gun control than ever before. Even so, our society remains horribly bereft of the respect for life and safe neighborhoods that make this country so great.\nWhen the massacre in Colorado hit hard 20 years ago, much of the conversation about gun control in the state was centered on a proposal to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. That proposal, which was ripped apart by gun lobbyists, largely fizzled as it fell victim to the divisions and self-interest of a political process that often favors the interests of special interests over the best interests of the general public.\nToday, the glaring loophole in Colorado's law allowing convicted felons and anyone subject to misdemeanor domestic violence restraining orders to buy firearms or hold a concealed-carry permit is anyone's guess \u2014 unless they are incredibly adept in disguise. If they are given the green light by the state, they are free to break into homes, steal all the guns they can get their hands on and then fire them without repercussions from the state or the law.\nThere also are no limits on the number of guns that any one person or group can buy. Once you are approved to get a concealed-carry permit, you can load up an entire family's arsenal and then go out on the open market to sell or trade it off.\nAnd there are no efforts to ban high-capacity magazines. As few as five bullets can be kept inside a single magazine, yet high-capacity magazines are the most widely available firearm accessory in the market. Buying a high-capacity magazine is like dropping a hammer and seeing it shatter into millions of pieces.\nAnd while there have been some major changes and improvements in the way we train law enforcement and security officers, those who serve in a heightened sense of security need to be better armed with a range of security weapons and behavioral indicators to help them identify and stop those with psychoses and other psychiatric issues.\nWe are better equipped than we were 20 years ago to train police officers to recognize and deal with a mass casualty situation. We have automated gun-control checks for everyone who buys guns and, in some states, even registrations for handguns and rifles.\nWe have a warning system in place, and 911 systems in most cities that would be able to locate and direct emergency first responders to a 911 caller if the person's location was in any danger.\nIt is no accident that we are living through yet another wave of massacres in the age of the smartphone and social media, and we can't assume that the threat is going away any time soon.\nBut 20 years after Columbine, we have not done enough. We have not closed the gun loophole, and we have not pushed those who have a severe mental illness to get help. We haven't taken an innovative approach to preventing violent crimes involving mental illness, and we haven't altered the nation's culture and way of thinking so that it better recognizes guns as deadly weapons and individual freedom as two opposed to one.\n", "label": "machine"}

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) MORE HIDE\nPolitical Censorship: How the Left Is Trying to Frame MAGA Hats as Symbols of Hate\nThe moment a controversial tweet was created about Boy Scout cookies in 2016, mainstream media immediately flooded the internet with articles blaming the simple use of a cookie box on dangerous \u201chate\u201d for the organization.\nThis trend has since continued with many other controversies, with the focus never shifting from this idea of wrong doing or divisive speech: politics is bad, and violent political speech is not allowed.\nFree speech is not something we feel we should give to anyone who isn\u2019t sincere about their views and politics. Politicians attempt to restrict these rights whenever their political agenda can be manufactured into a defense of an unpopular viewpoint.\nThe most extreme case of this was just last week when Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced \u201cThe Helping Survivors of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Rape Bill of 2018,\u201d which would ban federal officials from using their offices to \u201cpromote a particular social or political position on any matter.\u201d\nFeinstein essentially made it impossible for politicians from any political party to communicate with constituents (whether that be via a phone call, email, or in person).\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.V.) confronted \u201cMy Townie,\u201d a Georgetown student named Ben, about his pro-life views last month, and received a number of complaints from fellow students who believe Manchin\u2019s opinions on abortion to be incorrect. Manchin took it upon himself to call the university police, and later sent the call to both staff and students in an effort to reach out and be heard.\nThe left is always quick to use issues like this and other similar rants as excuses to condemn any and all political speech that crosses the line of acceptable speech.\nPoliticians often claim they are advancing a message of \u201clove and justice\u201d in promoting the bill, but in truth, it\u2019s simply about blocking anyone who may believe differently from their thinking.\nWe have seen a handful of responses to Feinstein\u2019s bill, including accusations that conservatives want government \u201cto tell you what to think.\u201d While some may believe this in their hearts, we would ask that they view and understand what this bill actually suggests.\nThe purpose of this bill, according to Feinstein, is to \u201chelp survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and rape by advocating for more awareness of signs and symptoms, understanding what is considered acceptable conduct, providing education to help professionals confront and intervene when these incidents are reported, and ensuring programs to aid survivors are available.\u201d\nThe bill does not even imply to prohibit any individual or individual group from sharing their thoughts and opinions on issues related to sexual assault and domestic violence.\nThe last thing the left wants to come across in their zeal for political correctness is that everyone has the right to question and disagree with political views.\nThe shift in political discourse has been brutal and has reduced debate to a state of perpetual confusion. And political \u201clove and justice\u201d are the very reasons for it.\nWe need a return to the old days\u2014when it was enough to be for something. It would be interesting to see how much progress has been made in that respect in the last 60 years or so.\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "When India votes in what is expected to be the closest-ever general election between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the main opposition Congress party, there are changes aimed at tightening the electoral rules.\nStill, the contest in polls that will begin on May 17 is expected to be tight in key states such as Uttar Pradesh. Mr Modi's BJP won elections in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur in the 2017 elections but is expected to face more challenges in the current elections.\nThe election commission, the government body that oversees elections, recently tightened campaign rules, including making it illegal for election campaigns to carry messages that directly threaten a candidate or a government representative.\nThe message must also not explicitly ask for voters to go for a particular political party.\nThe punishment is a 15-minute \"time-out\" for violators, ahead of the first phase of voting in the five states, reports The Hindu newspaper.\nThe time-out was introduced after Mr Yogi Adityanath, the BJP's chief ministerial candidate in Uttar Pradesh, called off a fast that started in February, calling it a \"sacred\" protest, which he called a \"big mistake\".\nWHAT IS THE RULES? While the law pre-dates the rule, the polling commission is also cracking down on foreign entities and candidates with criminal records. There are also rules to prevent foreign entities - such as NGOs, local bodies, trade unions and national groups - from using publicly funded resources such as posters, literature, tents and paper, among others. The person who sells you sweets cannot carry any political party logo or political slogan. A candidate with a criminal record cannot campaign for his party. Candidates can make references to any religious body, including mosques, temples and churches, but that does not have to mention their affiliation. A person employed by a foreign organisation who intends to contest an election must declare that fact on forms given to local authorities.\nThe Congress party has asked voters in Uttar Pradesh to vote for former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the latest phase of voting but Mr Adityanath tweeted that he was \"surprised at Akhilesh's stand\".\n\"I am surprised at Akhilesh's stance. We all know that it is not easy to defeat an atheist,\" he said in a tweet to one of his followers.\nWhile the Congress has been pushing Mr Akhilesh to be an alternative to Mr Modi, the BJP in January rejected a request from a party worker in Lucknow, the state capital, to identify Mr Akhilesh as a candidate. He was subsequently described as a \"founding member\" of the Congress.\nAnother change introduced this election is the Electoral Code of Conduct, which sets parameters for advertisements, calls for details of foreign participation in electoral financing and restricts candidates from using public property for election campaign materials.\nMr Modi has been trying to paint Mr Akhilesh as \"corrupt\" and accused him of ignoring villagers, while his mother, Mr Kanshi Ram, recently called on the voters to evict his cabinet ministers if they fail to represent the district.\nWith the current atmosphere, it is hard to predict who will win in the state, and which party will emerge stronger nationwide, ahead of the national elections due by May next year.\nExperts said the election commission's rules do not scare away voters for very long.\nThey also say that foreign entities cannot influence elections in India, since groups registered in India cannot spend more than US$10,000 (S$13,962) from their registered foreign donors - no amount more than $5000 (S$7,073) is allowed for group employees.\nAnd the law against threatening a candidate or government official is common practice in India, ahead of every election.\n\"Unless there is a genuine threat of some violence, people will not hold their peace, so the reply to someone is, 'Because you are scared, so be it',\" said Professor Peter Earnest of Pune University in India.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A bill that would make parents more difficult to obtain a medical exemption to vaccination has a long road to collecting votes in the Senate and House and therefore to becoming law.\nDespite its 75-0 vote in the committee, the bill still faces a heavy uphill climb before it could reach the governor\u2019s desk.\nLegislative immunity to lawsuits is one of the main reasons parents opt out of vaccinating their children. And if the parents go to court and win their case, they can be awarded damages that could more than offset the costs of the vaccination and maybe even cost the child\u2019s parents a couple of months\u2019 wages.\nIn the 2017 session, a similar bill met with opposition from the Colorado Medical Association, which represents physicians. That bill ultimately died in committee.\nOne of the sponsors of Senate Bill 201, Sen. Kevin Lundberg, R-Berthoud, introduced a modified version of the bill this year. This is the first year it has made it out of committee.\nThe bill would repeal immunity to legal action, open up religious and personal beliefs exemptions and add a second medical exemption for children with health issues who are too ill to be vaccinated. Lundberg clarified that all medical exemptions for vaccines would be valid, but not all religious exemptions could be used, as a lack of a religious objection would not go away.\nThe children would have to be enrolled in school or enrolled in day care to receive the second medical exemption.\nSen. Dan Gibbs, D-Silverthorne, who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said he voted for the bill in committee Tuesday because it strikes a balance between parental rights and public health.\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying, in a society like ours that we believe in protecting the human person, we think we have to protect kids from receiving an unnecessary and avoidable disease,\u201d Gibbs said.\nThe bill hasn\u2019t yet picked up support from the state\u2019s largest health advocacy groups. The Colorado Children\u2019s Campaign, an agency that works with health providers, said it supports vaccinations. The Colorado Academy of Pediatrics, a public-advocacy organization, said it opposes the bill for several reasons.\n\u201cThis bill would make it easier for parents to push back against doctors and make it harder for kids with complex health conditions to receive their due process,\u201d said Sarah Pollard, spokeswoman for the academy.\nPollard said it is important for any amendment to be carefully crafted to preserve patient rights.\nThe Arapahoe County Board of Health already implemented a vaccine requirement in December. As a result, about 20 percent of the county\u2019s school population is now exempt from vaccines.\n\u201cNow more than ever, we need to be talking about protecting kids from illnesses,\u201d said Jen Casanova, the spokeswoman for the Arapahoe County Board of Health. \u201cWe\u2019re happy the bill is moving forward in the legislature.\u201d\nSen. John Kefalas, D-Fort Collins, who is a co-sponsor of the bill, said he hopes Senate Bill 201 will keep Colorado\u2019s children safe.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to make sure our most vulnerable Colorado families are going to make it through childhood and continue to be healthy and productive adults,\u201d Kefalas said.\nOther vaccines for children are less contentious. Every two years lawmakers must renew mandatory vaccine requirements.\nThe current vaccine requirement in Colorado is that children must receive one of six vaccines before starting preschool. Another requirement is that every child entering kindergarten or seventh grade must receive four vaccines for the pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccine. Lawmakers also have the power to make vaccines optional for children.\nThe Arapahoe County Board of Health will report its findings on if the mandatory vaccination law is effective at reducing pertussis rates at its meeting on April 29.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "New Delhi: French conglomerate Engie SA is in talks with London-based private equity (PE) firm Actis LLP to sell its solar power businesses in India, said two people aware of the matter.\nEngie, which has two solar power projects in India, is looking to raise around Rs800 crore from the proposed deal, one of the people cited above said, requesting anonymity.\nPE firms have emerged as aggressive investors in India\u2019s renewable energy sector as the government targets installation of 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2022.\nAccording to the latest government report on installed power generation capacity, India had installed 139.51 GW as of 31 March 2018. Of this, 87.41 GW was thermal power, 20.56 GW was hydro power, 2.91 GW was wind power and 8.87 GW was solar power.\n\u201cEngie is looking to exit solar. They have a thermal power capacity in India and that asset looks likely to be exited as well,\" the first person cited above said, also requesting anonymity.\n\u201cThe Engie\u2019s solar portfolio in India consists of two operational units in Rajasthan. One unit is 100MW and the other is 80MW. However, the Indian operations have been rather low-scale,\" he added.\nEngie is also thinking to exit solar assets in neighbouring China, apart from the assets in India, according to The Economic Times, citing an unnamed CEO. It also said the Engie\u2019s Indian solar assets are valued at Rs800 crore and the firm would look at a buyout deal.\n\u201cEngie has a bunch of mature projects and it just needs to look at opportunities that are much more high-growth. They are likely to exit across regional markets where we have seen a lot of the big entry,\" one of the two people cited above said.\n\u201cWhen you look at solar in India compared to Europe, the offtake margin is significantly higher as compared to what they are able to achieve in Europe as far as their contracts are concerned. They should definitely be able to leverage the strong political momentum in India when it comes to solar,\" said the first person.\nThe executive also added that the government has designed investments to include large-scale auctions and also provide a defined window of time for developers to make payments.\nIn October, Reuters reported that Engie planned to sell parts of its international portfolio to improve cash flow and to focus on activities that make strategic sense.\nThe French government has also emphasised on its support for renewable energy.\n\u201cThe green energy agenda entails low carbon values. This should be tackled in a precise way, there are examples we can follow. The green energy agenda is a top priority for our government,\" said French Economy and Finance minister Bruno Le Maire in New Delhi last week.\nLast year, private equity firm InfraGreen Energy Advisors Pvt. Ltd acquired the solar assets of France\u2019s Engie through an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange.\nIn May 2014, the government agreed to grant buy-back option to renewable energy projects too. However, the first attempt at selecting bidders was derailed after a group of developers alleged unfair practices and integrity issues. The move was later redrafted by the government.\nActis partner Gurmeet Singh said, \u201cActis is currently one of the world\u2019s largest and most active investors in the Indian renewable energy sector with its portfolio including a 22% equity holding in Jaypee Infratech, a 15% direct participation in Hydel Energy (India), a 13% indirect equity holding in NeoGrowth Energy and a 15% direct participation in Azure Power.\"\n", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Ald. Scott Waguespack has said he supports aldermanic prerogative, yet City Council President Michelle Harris has advanced legislation to improve oversight in the 53rd Ward. (WLS-TV photo) | Rich Hein/Chicago Sun-Times file photo\nEvery Chicago alderman has a very important role to play.\nBut sometimes that job gets tangled up in the people we call our aldermen.\nThe recent decision by House Speaker Michael Madigan to dump the chairman of his House Education Committee over the kids in the district\u2019s struggling schools goes a long way toward resolving a problem that many of us have lamented for years. House Bill 3187, which passed the House last week and is expected to clear the Senate soon, is the first step in giving the Chicago public school system more mayoral control.\nEDITORIAL\nKids in those schools need it.\nYoungsters enrolled in the Chicago School District must live in one of the 577 public schools that have been designated as district priority schools. Houses in these buildings are rented to children from the poorest ZIP codes, known as \u201cpriority zone.\u201d\nThe kids in these low-performing schools have an extraordinarily hard time. They have to cross gang lines, and they have to struggle with overcrowded classrooms.\nBut they have done so bravely \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 for years. Madigan\u2019s replacement as chairman of the House\u2019s Education Committee, Rep. Elaine Nekritz, D-Northbrook, has been a longtime champion of prioritized schools, making their problems worse.\nAlas, the folks in the District 53, 25th Ward ward who comprise Madigan\u2019s district face another problem. Members of the current alderman, Ald. Scott Waguespack, D-32nd, have claimed they \u2014 to win \u2014 won\u2019t co-sponsor a measure to improve oversight of priority zone schools.\nWe understand that. This isn\u2019t about politics.\nThis is about the needs of our students in the wards that benefit from Madigan\u2019s heavy-handed power over the school system \u2014 plus people like parents, students and teachers who live in the 41st and 29th Wards, where Madigan is running for a 40th term.\nMadigan sent the upset alderman on a personal mission to Springfield: Waguespack asked the speaker to support three important bills \u2014 for transparency in the mayor\u2019s appointment of school board members, increased transparency in the process for naming priority school principals and a renewed committee scrutiny of the district\u2019s $450 million public housing settlement. Madigan\u2019s office sent back a note expressing a willingness to sit down with the alderman.\nLoss of support from Waguespack or aldermanic allies is worth bearing in mind if you consider this a measure of aldermanic prerogative, for which our modern-day folks in Chicago have much to thank.\nYes, let\u2019s root for aldermanic prerogative. But let\u2019s also root for this: We\u2019re all about accountability, transparency and a genuine commitment to education. Waguespack can be counted on to fight for a renewed school oversight committee and increased accountability on some level. And Madigan\u2019s clout in Springfield \u2014 in the House \u2014 makes this just the kind of legislation that not only will help kids in Chicago but benefits kids in Madigan\u2019s district, too.\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.\n", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By AFP\nFrance's embattled President Emmanuel Macron will press on Tuesday with an attempt to quell public anger by unveiling his main economic reform as he tries to win back support from voters.\nMacron vowed earlier Monday that he would press ahead with controversial plans to open the door to all intercity trains to both individual and group ticket-holders.\nThe 30-year-old leader, battling back from his first \"yellow vest\" protests since he took office last year, also promised to extend fuel tax cuts to another year for low-income families.\nThe changes come just a week after authorities warned that the \"yellow vest\" protests, which began over rising taxes on diesel vehicles, could continue into June if new tax hikes in a July budget were not reversed.\nThe \"yellow vest\" movement, named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists are obliged to keep in their cars, has seen demonstrators block highways, some of which have seen blockades for weeks.\nOpposition parties and many in the \"yellow vest\" movement have pushed back on Macron's announcement Monday that he would delay planned fuel tax increases by another year for so-called \"yellow peril\" drivers.\nThe government is also set to cut taxes further for the self-employed and marginally lower duties on goods and fuel by reducing exemptions from VAT and cutting other taxes.\nUnions called a wave of \"yellow vest\" protests on Wednesday in protest at Macron's plans and mass marches were scheduled for the following week.\nIn the backdrop, many \"yellow vest\" participants on Monday said they were beginning to accept an invitation by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to dialogue.\n\"Macron has reached out to us,\" said a demonstrator, who did not give his name.\nThe same demonstrator, who said he works as a plumber, told AFP that Macron had put forward a \"smokescreen\" to hide the extent of his planned tax cuts.\nMacron said on Monday he expected the negotiations \"will give us real convergence, but also disagreement.\"\nThe protesters have adopted a range of demands - ranging from more compensation for pensioners to a much lower minimum wage, tax reductions or a rollback of Macron's pro-business reforms - that they have presented to the government.\nWhile the \"yellow vest\" movement may have petered out, it has not gone away and Macron is expected to face more protests this week, in particular as his government implements yet another round of tax cuts.\nThe price tag for the tax cuts is nearly one billion euros.\n- 'Yellow peril' drivers -\nPhilippe said a new round of negotiations between the government and the \"yellow peril\" drivers was going to be useful \"especially when people have made a choice to focus on the right to demonstrate and work to keep the economy functioning\".\nThe \"yellow peril\" drivers were particularly unhappy with the plan, analysts said, because if it had come sooner, it might have avoided the economic slowdown that has already forced employers to cut hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nMacron's plans will have to wait until after May 1 parliamentary elections to win parliamentary approval.\nThis year, France will hold parliamentary elections for the lower house of parliament.\nMacron came to power in May 2017 promising tax cuts but accused of shifting the burden to companies and the self-employed with a raft of pro-business reforms.\nMany of the protesters targeted in his tax cuts were taxi drivers who complained they had to pay more to survive, in particular after Macron threatened to reduce VAT on petrol.\nNicolas Bay, a professor at the school of management and business administration at the University of Bordeaux, told AFP the tax cuts could have been bolder.\n\"If these policy initiatives were implemented sooner, it would not have destroyed so many jobs,\" he said.\nOn the surface, the protests have appeared to attract the middle classes with many blaming their woes on high taxes and Macron's pro-business reforms.\nBut cracks have appeared in the movement, with activists now gathering at rallies in urban areas like Paris and Lyon calling for the protests to halt.\n\"We can't keep escalating and mobilising people,\" said Pascal Larque at a rally last week in the French capital.\nDemonstrators want to continue the protest activities around the country, including the one planned for Thursday.\nBut Philippe said the government was ready to move ahead with talks.\n\"I want to engage in a very intense and extensive dialogue with the different citizens, with the different authorites and the different associations and organisations to reach a consensus on their demands,\" he said.\n", "label": "machine"}
