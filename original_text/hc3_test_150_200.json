{"text": "The gif you provided shows an artist's illustration of what it might look like if a star were to collide with a black hole. A black hole is a place in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It's called a black hole because it sucks everything in and we can't see it. A star is a huge ball of burning gas that gives off light and heat. They are very far away from us and are very, very hot. In the gif, you can see the star getting closer and closer to the black hole. As it gets closer, it starts to get stretched out and pulled apart because of the strong force of the black hole's gravity. Eventually, the star gets pulled into the black hole and disappears. This is a very rare event that we might see in our universe, but it's interesting to think about and imagine what it might look like.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The rate-fixing scandal at Barclays involved the manipulation of an important financial benchmark called the \"London Interbank Offered Rate\" or LIBOR. This is the rate at which banks lend money to each other in the London financial market. It is used as a benchmark to set the interest rates on many types of loans, such as mortgages, credit card loans, and business loans.  The scandal occurred when some employees at Barclays were found to have been dishonestly manipulating the LIBOR rate by submitting false information about the rate at which they were borrowing money. This allowed them to influence the overall rate and potentially make money for the bank or themselves. This is called rate-fixing and is illegal because it can harm other banks and companies that rely on the LIBOR rate to set the interest rates on their loans. It can also harm individual borrowers if the rate is manipulated in a way that affects the interest rates they pay on their loans.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Eating fruit is generally considered to be healthier than eating sugary snacks like biscuits and cakes because fruit also contains important nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals that can help keep your body healthy. These nutrients can help with things like keeping your heart healthy, giving you energy, and helping you to maintain a healthy weight. In contrast, sugary snacks like biscuits and cakes often do not contain these important nutrients and are primarily made up of empty calories, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. They may also contain unhealthy ingredients like saturated and trans fats, which can increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems. So, while both fruit and sugary snacks contain sugar, fruit also contains other important nutrients that can help keep your body healthy. That's why it's generally considered to be a healthier choice than sugary snacks like biscuits and cakes.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Sure! Here's a simple explanation:  A router is a device that connects your home or office to the internet. It takes data from your computer or device and sends it out to the internet, and it also brings data from the internet back to your device.  A switch is a device that connects multiple computers or devices together on a network. It allows these devices to communicate with each other and share information.  An access point is a device that allows you to connect to a wireless network. It works like a router, but it doesn't have the ability to connect to the internet on its own. Instead, it connects to a router or another access point and provides a wireless connection for your devices.  So, a router connects you to the internet, a switch connects devices together on a network, and an access point provides a wireless connection for your devices. Does that make sense?

{"text": "When a car is moving quickly, the wheels may appear to be spinning in the opposite direction because of a phenomenon called the stroboscopic effect. The stroboscopic effect occurs when an object is moving quickly and it is observed through a series of brief, intermittent glimpses.  Imagine you are standing on the side of the road and you see a car driving past you. If the car is moving slowly, you will see the wheels turning in the direction that the car is moving. But if the car is moving very quickly, you will only see brief glimpses of the wheels as it passes by. Because the wheels are turning so quickly, it may appear that they are spinning in the opposite direction.  This is similar to how a spinning fan appears to be standing still when you look at it through a camera with a fast shutter speed. The blades of the fan are moving so quickly that they appear to be in the same position in each frame of the photograph.  So, to summarize: the wheels of a car do not actually spin in the opposite direction, it just appears that way because of the stroboscopic effect.", "label": "machine"}

For example, the smell of cinnamon buns is often associated with warm, cozy feelings, and the smell of freshly baked bread or cookies can be comforting and pleasing. On the other hand, the smell of poop is often unpleasant because it is associated with waste and can indicate the presence of harmful bacteria.The way our brains process smells also plays a role in how we perceive them. Our brains have evolved to associate certain smells with certain things, and these associations can be based on our experiences and the meanings that we have learned to associate with them. For example, we might associate the smell of flowers with beauty and the smell of rotten food with decay and danger.Overall, the way we perceive and respond to smells is complex and can be influenced by many different factors, including our cultural and personal experiences, the memories and emotions that they evoke, and the physiological effects they have on our bodies.", "label": "machine"}

To directly answer your question, you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle. I would encourage you to use the $9k to finance directly without a lease, especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term. The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case, and worse, will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease (mileage, wear and tear, etc) Best option mathematically is to use the $9k to purchase a vehicle for cash.

{"text": "Water coming out of the tailpipe of a car or truck is usually a normal occurrence and is not usually a cause for concern. The water is created when the fuel in the vehicle's engine is burned. This process creates hot gases, which are then cooled by the vehicle's cooling system. When the hot gases cool, some of the water vapor in the gases condenses and turns back into a liquid, and this liquid water can be seen coming out of the tailpipe.  In some cases, excessive water coming out of the tailpipe can be a sign of a problem with the vehicle's cooling system or with the engine itself. If you notice a lot of water coming out of the tailpipe, or if the vehicle is running poorly or overheating, it might be a good idea to have it checked out by a mechanic.

When a person is sleepwalking, their body is in a state of partial arousal, and they are not fully conscious or aware of their surroundings. As a result, they may not be able to understand or respond appropriately to being awakened, and they may become agitated or combative.  It is also possible that the sleepwalker could accidentally hurt themselves or someone else while sleepwalking, either by tripping or falling, or by accidentally bumping into or touching something that could cause injury. For these reasons, it is generally best to let a sleepwalker continue their sleepwalking episode and to try to guide them back to bed if necessary, rather than trying to wake them up. If the sleepwalker is in a potentially dangerous situation, such as if they are trying to leave the house or if they are near a hazard, it may be necessary to gently guide them away from the danger and back to bed.", "label": "machine"}

One reason is that the thief might hope to sell the painting to someone who is willing to pay a lot of money for it, even though it might be difficult or impossible to sell the painting publicly. For example, the thief might try to sell the painting to a private collector who is willing to keep the painting hidden in order to avoid detection.\r \r Another reason someone might steal a valuable painting is for the thrill of the crime itself. Some people might find it exciting to steal something that is valuable or difficult to obtain. They might also enjoy the challenge of trying to sell the painting without getting caught.\r \r Finally, some people might steal a valuable painting as part of a larger criminal enterprise, such as a group that specializes in stealing and selling valuable artworks.

{"text": "Cellular respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in the cells of all living organisms. It involves the conversion of glucose, a simple sugar, into energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).\\n\\nCellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria, which are the cell's powerhouses. The mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells (cells with a defined nucleus) that are responsible for generating energy for the cell.\\n\\nDuring cellular respiration, glucose is broken down through a series of chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from glucose to oxygen, ultimately producing ATP and water. The process of cellular respiration can be summarized in the following equation:\\n\\nGlucose + Oxygen --> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy (ATP)\\n\\nThere are several different stages of cellular respiration, including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. Each of these stages occurs in the mitochondria and plays a vital role in the overall process of cellular respiration.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Pigeons, like all animals, can die from a variety of causes, including old age, illness, and injuries. In cities, pigeons may be more likely to die from injuries caused by cars, buildings, or other human-made structures. Pigeons may also die from diseases or parasites that they can pick up from other birds or from their environment. When a pigeon dies in a city, it is usually the responsibility of the city or town to clean up the dead bird. This is usually done by a team of workers who are trained to handle and dispose of dead animals in a safe and sanitary way. They will usually wear protective gear, such as gloves and masks, to prevent any diseases from spreading. The dead pigeon will then be collected and disposed of in a way that is safe for the environment and for people. It's important to remember that all living things, including pigeons, have a natural life cycle and will eventually die. It's a natural part of life, and it's important to respect and take care of all living things, even when they are no longer alive.", "label": "machine"}

While antidepressants are generally effective at reducing these symptoms and helping people feel better, in some cases, they can have side effects that may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.  It's important to note that the risk of suicide is generally higher for people with depression, and that the risk may be higher when treatment for depression is not received or is not effective. This is why it's so important to seek treatment if you're experiencing symptoms of depression.

{"text": "The thyroid is a gland in your neck that produces hormones that help regulate your body's metabolism. Metabolism is the process your body uses to turn the food you eat into energy. Your metabolism helps determine how many calories you burn and how quickly your body uses energy. Thyroid hormone supplements can help increase your metabolism if you have a thyroid hormone deficiency, which can cause weight gain. However, if you have a normal thyroid function and take thyroid hormone supplements, it is unlikely that it will cause significant weight loss. In fact, taking too much thyroid hormone can actually cause weight gain and other side effects. Hair loss can also be a side effect of taking too much thyroid hormone. This is because the hormones produced by the thyroid gland help regulate hair growth. When the levels of thyroid hormones in your body are too high, it can cause hair loss.

{"text": "Deductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking in which a conclusion is drawn based on the relationship between two or more premises. This type of reasoning starts with a general statement, or premise, and applies it to a specific situation to arrive at a logical conclusion.    For example, consider the following argument:    Premise 1: All birds can fly.  Premise 2: Eagles are birds.  Conclusion: Therefore, eagles can fly.    In this example, the conclusion that eagles can fly is drawn based on the relationship between the two premises: that all birds can fly and that eagles are birds. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.    Deductive reasoning is often contrasted with inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions based on observations or specific examples. While deductive reasoning is a reliable method for arriving at conclusions when the premises are true, it is not always possible to determine the truth of the premises with certainty. In such cases, the conclusion may not necessarily be reliable.", "label": "machine"}

In order to get a success rate of 96% you would have had to successful exploit this \"irregularity\" at 24 out of 25 times.   I recommend you proceed cautiously. Make the transition from a paper trader to a profit-seeking trader slowly. Use a low leverage ratio until you can make several more successful trades and then slowly increase your leverage as you gain confidence.

They keep enough on hand so that if you did want to make a withdrawal , they could cover it . But that is not even close to enough to cover the total amount in the bank . That was one of the problems in the Great Depression : people wanted to take their money out of banks so fast that the bank could n't cover it all . That 's called a bank run .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As far as the show ... It 's all bs , the grocery stores actually ignore the small print just for the show ... The one that says not combined with any offer etc . The way it actually scans is because the upc of the item , that is the Barcode number is not a serial number per se . It more identifies the brand of product and other vague stuff ... That said , in some occasions you can just take one of the coupons for let 's say 8 Oz redbull for a buck , but if you scan it when buying the 16 Oz then you just won the grocery store ... You would think that there cashier is paying attention but that 's not the way it works , you do all yours homework before you show up , then stack up on all the savings , go to the register , scan everything , bag it , put it in a cart and right before you pay you whip out the stack of coupons .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\\nHumming can help prevent choking by activating the muscles in the mouth, throat, and upper airway. When you hum, you vibrate the muscles in these areas, which can help to clear any obstructions that may be present.\\n\\nWhen you hum, the vibrations created by the humming sound can help to loosen and move mucus or other substances that may be stuck in the throat. This can help to clear the airway and prevent choking.\\n\\nIn addition to helping to clear the airway, humming can also stimulate the muscles in the throat and upper airway, which can help to keep them open and prevent blockages from occurring. This can help to reduce the risk of choking, especially in people who are prone to throat or airway problems.\\n\\nOverall, humming can help to prevent choking by activating the muscles in the mouth, throat, and upper airway, which can help to clear any obstructions and keep the airway open. It is a simple and effective way to reduce the risk of choking and other airway problems.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It is not a good idea to try to pop an abscessed tooth yourself. An abscessed tooth is a serious dental problem that needs to be treated by a dentist as soon as possible. The abscess, or pocket of pus, can be caused by a bacterial infection and can spread to other parts of your body if left untreated.  If you are experiencing pain and discomfort from an abscessed tooth, it is important to see a dentist as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can try to manage the pain by rinsing your mouth with warm salt water, taking over-the-counter pain medication, and applying a cold compress to your face to reduce swelling.  If you are feeling sick to your stomach and have other symptoms such as fever or difficulty swallowing, it is important to seek medical attention right away. Do not wait until your scheduled dental appointment to seek treatment.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The two terms are \" climate change \" and \" global warming . \" Global warming describes a warming effect on climate generally assumed to be the result of greenhouse gasses and anthropogenic impacts on the climate . The problem with the term global warming is that after the El Nino year in 1998 the earth went through ~10 years of no warming , perhaps slight cooling . All the science and predictions were that carbon emissions were driving the climate the warm , but this did n't happen and skeptics of the conventional wisdom pounced on it . So over time the term \" climate change \" became popularized to describe any change in climate caused by human interaction with the earth . If you are referring to human impacts that cause warming you can still be accurate and use the term global warming , but in most conversations the term climate change is more accurate because most conversations discuss more than just the warming of the earth .", "label": "human"}

{"text": "netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows (e.g. debits/credits, payments/receipts, income/expense) by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows, creating one transaction.   For example, if you make two trades in one day with your broker - one to buy a security for $100 and one to sell it for $110 - rather then you sending your broker $100 and them sending you $110, the transactions are \"netted\" - meaning they will send you the \"net\" amount of $10 ($110 inflow - $100 outflow). In a more general sense (\"netting of instructions\") it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the \"net\" effect - e.g. one step forward, two steps back would combine to a \"net\" one step back.  Most likely it will apply to the exchange of money, but it could be applied more broadly. Note that there doesn't have to be both inflows and outflows. You can also \"net\" multiple inflows (or outflows) into one transaction by just adding them all up, but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows.", "label": "human"}
